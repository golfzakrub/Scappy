""About the lasers, if it happened this is a first in Senegal. But we know that in Cairo there were a lot of these and [they are used] often in specific countries. Senegal isn't used to that.""He added: ""In my opinion, I didn't see during this game something that could be considered as chauvinism because the Senegalese are known to be very welcoming.""To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in LiverpoolEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.",positive,7 hours ago,liverpool,3,141,81,60

You can get the latest headlines and articles (or even audio files, photographs or video) in one place, as soon as they are published, without having to remember to visit each site every day.RSS takes the hassle out of staying up-to-date, by showing you the very latest information that you are interested in.RSS feeds are just a special kind of web page, designed to be read by computers rather than people. It might help to think of them as the free, internet version of the old-fashioned ticker-tape news wire machines.Not all websites currently provide RSS and not all sections of the BBC or BBC Sport website are available as feeds.In general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader.This is a piece of software that checks RSS feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added to them.

Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using Outlook, or keep it on a web-based service like Hotmail.Once you have chosen a news reader, all you have to do is to decide what content you want to receive in your news reader, by finding and subscribing to the relevant RSS feeds. For example, if you would like the latest BBC Sport Cricket stories, simply visit the Cricket section and you will notice an orange RSS button.Most modern browsers, including Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome, automatically check for RSS feeds for you when you visit a website, and display the orange RSS icon when they find one.

You have been taken too soon and our hearts are broken.""Warne's daughter Summer said: ""It has been exactly 26 days since you went to heaven and I miss you more than anything in the whole world.""I would do anything just to have one more of your cuddles and to hear your voice tell me how proud of me you were and how much you loved me.""I know you will be forever watching me and be by my side the whole time.""Warne is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all-time, having claimed 708 Test wickets in 145 matches across a stellar 15-year international career.Former England skipper Nasser Hussain joined Warne's former Australia captains Mark Taylor and Allan Border, plus former West Indies batter Brian Lara and ex-Australia bowler Merv Hughes on stage to pay tribute to the spin bowler.""Shane, it was an absolute privilege to be with you on a cricket pitch,"" Hussain said.At the start of the ceremony the Australian national anthem was sung by Greta Bradman, granddaughter of legendary Australia batter Sir Donald Bradman.A number of Warne's other Australia team-mates, bowler Glenn McGrath, wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and ex-captain Steve Waugh, were also in the audience, along with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in LiverpoolAnalysis and opinion from the BBC's cricket correspondent.Get latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.How to get into cricket - the thrill of the big hit, the rush of taking the catch, the skill of bowling.

34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60904260,Sophie Ecclestone: The making of England's world top-ranked bowler,"Last updated on 14 hours ago14 hours ago.From the section Cricket""To go from Cheshire cricket to six years later she's top of the tree, I just think wow, she's made us so proud so many times with what she's done and despite it all she's so grounded.""England's Sophie Ecclestone is the world's top-ranked one-day international and Twenty20 bowler, and is the leading wicket-taker in the Women's World Cup heading into England's semi-final against South Africa.It's been quite the journey from Helsby, Cheshire where her cricket story began with the influence of cricket-playing elder brother James and dad Paul.""Every day we were either outside playing football or cricket, we just messed about all day and night,"" said James.""There were a few tears and a bit of falling out as you can imagine. She was never out, there was always a way that she had to keep on batting. We had some good times growing up.""Paul was the junior coordinator at Alvanley Cricket Club where Sophie first got involved in youth cricket and where she discovered her finger-spin trade thanks to club coach Robin Fisher.Now the club has recognised Sophie as a life member.""We have a wall in the clubhouse with a signed shirt on - that's Sophie's wall, we try to show up as much as we can because we are so proud of her,"" adds James.""Everyone loves her to bits and she's so down to earth that's why everyone at the club takes time out to watch her.""Ecclestone was just nine years old when she progressed into the Cheshire U13s pathway. Her rising status through the age groups sparked interest from neighbouring Lancashire.Paul remembers the moment; he was driving to and from Old Trafford when the young off-spinner made her choice.""She said 'I've made the decision, normally I make a decision and doubt myself but, in this instance, I'm going to do it, I'm going to move to Lancashire.'""Ecclestone never looked back, she made her senior Lancashire debut aged 16 and was on the England development programme before being selected for the England Academy winter squad in 2016 where she toured Sri Lanka.She went on to make her senior England debut in 2016, playing a T20 against Pakistan and returning 1-21 from her four overs.Ecclestone's one-day international debut came later that year versus the West Indies and her Test cap was awarded in a drawn Ashes series in 2017.Eight months after her ODI debut, Ecclestone was made unavailable for the 2017 World Cup, which culminated in a thrilling victory for England in the final at Lord's.Fiance Craig remembers it well: ""It was a tough time, mixed emotions for her, she was finishing off her A-levels and she had to get them behind her so she could go on and enjoy cricket.""She was incredibly pleased for the girls, but I think she would've preferred to have been on the pitch.""So, while England won the World Cup in 2017, Ecclestone had to settle for the Lancashire Cricket Board's young player of the year accolade as Lancashire won the double.Notable performances included her 6-12 in a One-Day Cup match and 27 wickets at an impressive average of 6.96.With A-levels in the bag, Ecclestone was awarded an England central contract later that year.Her next landmark came in 2018 when she made her T20 World Cup debut, collecting a runner-up medal after Australia thrashed England in the West Indies.Craig recalls being sat in their hotel room prior to the final when ""Soph goes 'ooh I'm playing in a World Cup final today'. She just brushes everything off. I'm sure she does feel pressure, but she doesn't show it.""He adds: ""She's just wired differently. I don't want to say she's too laid back because she isn't, she just handles situations well. She is the sort of person who can finish second and be like 'now we need to put it right and finish first'.""Ecclestone faced further team disappointment as a washout semi-final saw England exit the 2020 T20 World Cup. Despite this, she became the number one T20 bowler in the world rankings, finding out informally via Craig as he scrolled through Twitter during a dinner in Sydney.She now reigns as both T20 and ODI top-ranked bowler at just 22 years of age and has almost 100 England caps across all formats.James beams: ""She's only 22 and that's the scary thing. When you see her stats come on the TV and how many wickets she's taken its mad thinking in another 10 years' time, how many wickets will she take by then?""Already, she is England women's sixth all-time wicket-taker with more than 150 scalps.Paul adds: ""She's just unbelievable, it's a fantastic achievement, especially for her age. It just shows how good she is, it's remarkable and we are over the moon for her. We are just so proud of her.""Personal accolades aside, there are still plenty of goals in sight.""I know for a fact she wants a 50 and she wants a five-fer. I said to her the other day 'what would be a bigger celebration - a 50 or a five-fer?' I think a 50 came out in favour so she's really got those next objectives in her sights now and to move up the batting order as well,"" Paul said.England have been away since early January so when she returns from her maiden ODI World Cup in New Zealand, the whole family - including cavapoo Rex - will be excited to celebrate her latest accomplishments.""It's been a long time away from friends and family and I think for Soph she's a real home bird. She just loves family life, she's so grounded and down to earth. She dotes on the dog, I think he must struggle when he sees the suitcase by the door and he doesn't know when she's back.""Ecclestone will no doubt be hoping she'll have a World Cup winners' medal to drape round his neck next time they meet.To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in Liverpool",positive,14 hours ago,liverpool,1,130,111,19
35,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60794962,Jo√£o Carvalhaes: Football's psychology pioneer and his role in 1958 World Cup win,"Last updated on 28 March 202228 March 2022.From the section FootballIn the summer of 1958 a 17-year-old Brazilian took international football by storm.Six goals in four games. A hat-trick in the semi-final. Two more in the final as Brazil claimed the trophy they so desperately craved.Arriving in Sweden for the World Cup as an unknown, Pel√© left as a star who would go on to achieve sporting immortality. But one man within the Brazil camp had argued against him playing.Professor Jo√£o Carvalhaes was the team's psychologist. In stark contrast to his modern-day counterparts, whose remit tends to be strictly focused on supporting players' performance and mental health, he had real influence over selection.Pel√©'s results in the psychometric tests Carvalhaes applied was the reason for his somewhat dubious advice, which was ignored in this instance. The legendary footballer himself later said of Carvalhaes' methods: ""They were either ahead of their time for football or just odd, or maybe both.""But beyond doubt is his place in history as a sporting pioneer. Carvalhaes introduced psychology laboratories to South American football almost 30 years before the concept was adopted in Europe.Back in 1950s Brazil, they wanted all the help they could get.Brazil's 1950 and 1954 World Cup campaigns had been torturous. In 1950 defeat in the final by Uruguay at the Maracan√£, the spiritual home of Brazilian football, prompted mourning across the country.The 1954 tournament, held in Switzerland, ended in ignominy as Brazil were reduced to nine men during an ugly 4-2 quarter-final loss to Hungary in a match nicknamed 'The Battle of Berne'.While the national team attempted to move on from the emotional trauma, a little-known psychologist was making his entrance into Brazilian domestic football.Carvalhaes joined S√£o Paulo in 1957, leaving a job training referees for the city's football federation. The club's interest was piqued by the psychology laboratory he had founded, the likes of which would not be seen in Europe until AC Milan's 'Mind Room' of the late 1980s.The lab was built at the federation's headquarters and housed 10 tests examining cognitive functions such as stereoscopic vision (depth perception). Carvalhaes used the tests to help highlight the skills trainee referees needed to hone before qualifying to officiate professional matches.Carvalhaes set thresholds for each variable he monitored, with candidates scoring below a particular benchmark considered unable to referee. For example, participants who recorded a result slower than 50 hundredths of a second during the 'reaction time test' fell into this category.He combined his day job with regular evening stints as a boxing commentator and journalist, during which he adopted the pseudonym Jo√£o do Ringue (Joao of the Ring). In contrast to his ringside persona, though, Carvalhaes' touchline demeanour was reflective, according to former colleague Dr Jos√© Glauco Bardella.""Arriving at the training ground, you could see everyone excited, but Jo√£o would be in the corner, quiet, hands in his pockets, just observing,"" he told a 2000 documentary on Carvalhaes' work, made by the S√£o Paulo Regional Council of Psychology.external-linkCarvalhaes may have been watchful, but he was far from a mere spectator.After S√£o Paulo won the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team's first state championship since 1953, Carvalhaes was heralded for his role in a selection decision that proved key to victory.Club director Manoel Raimundo Paes de Almeida said the replacement of regular midfielder Ademar with fellow playmaker Sarara, who then shone in a crunch match with Corinthians, was based on Carvalhaes' concerns about Ademar's state of mind.A year later the Brazilian Sports Confederation (CBD) came calling. Vice-president Paulo Machado de Carvalho, the man charged with planning for the forthcoming World Cup, asked Carvalhaes to join the team's technical committee. It was an offer too good to turn down.Brazil's preparations were already under way and Carvalhaes wasted little time in implementing the methods he had employed at S√£o Paulo. During the squad's pre-tournament camp he conducted an 'Army Alpha' test - an adaptation of an American programme designed to assess the intellectual capability of World War One recruits.The 50-minute exam examined players' arithmetic ability and vocabulary, with the intention of assigning an 'intelligence rating'. Those deemed less capable were asked to take an 'Army Beta' test involving exercises such as completing half-drawn pictures and tracing paths through two-dimensional mazes.While the concepts behind the tests might seem dated in comparison to contemporary psychology theory, they pushed the boundaries of thinking at the time, particularly in a sport that had seen very little, if anything, in the way of psychology-focused interventions.Carvalhaes was asked to present his findings to the CBD technical committee. The results, much to his consternation, were leaked to the Brazilian media. In a letter to de Carvalho, Carvalhaes alleged that documents were stolen from his briefcase.The leak led to suggestions that star player Garrincha, whose test results were poor, would fail to make the cut for the World Cup. Carvalhaes was exasperated. The public fallout ran counter to his behind-the-scenes way of working.But the storm was short-lived. After Garrincha was named in Brazil's squad, media speculation died down and Carvalhaes travelled to Sweden with the rest of the backroom staff. He continued working with the players, using Myokinetic Psychodiagnosis (MKP) tests to analyse individual characteristics and tailor his support accordingly.The MKP tests, in which players were given a blank sheet of paper and asked to draw whatever came to mind, were based on the theory that expressive muscle movements can help to indicate an individual's temperament.Once again, Carvalhaes was applying techniques that had never been used at this level of the game. Once again, he ran into trouble.""As part of our preparations the team psychologist, Professor Jo√£o Carvalhaes, had conducted tests on all the players,"" writes Pel√© in his autobiography, 'Pel√©'.""We had to draw sketches of people and answer questions to help Jo√£o make assessments about whether we should be picked or not.""About me he concluded that I should not be selected: 'Pel√© is obviously infantile. He lacks the necessary fighting spirit.' He also advised against Garrincha, who was not seen as responsible enough.""Fortunately for me and for Garrincha, Vicente Feola (Brazil's manager) was always guided by his instincts, and he just nodded gravely at the psychologist, saying: 'You may be right. The thing is you don't know anything about football. If Pel√©'s knee is ready, he plays.'""Others were more positive in their assessment.Goalkeeper Gilmar, also interviewed for the 2000 documentary on Carvalhaes' work, said he ""gave us the chance to take on ideas that could improve our performance"", adding: ""After the tournament, we realised that it worked.""Defender Nilson Santos said the team learned to ""enter the pitch smiling"" and Brazilian radio reports filed after the World Cup victory spoke of a ""consensus about the importance"" of Carvalhaes' role.Unfortunately, the CBD was less forthcoming in commending him, a stance that took an emotional toll on a reflective individual.""He was very upset because de Carvalho made inappropriate comments about his work and it saddened him a lot,"" said Barella.But he was beginning to attract wider attention. According to Barella, Carvalhaes received interview invitations from magazines in Spain, France and Germany, while Sports Illustrated also highlighted his contribution to the Brazil team.The international recognition helped to quell Carvalhaes' frustration. It perhaps also paved the way for future leading practitioners, such as Dr Bruno Demichelis, AC Milan's venerated former sport scientist, to advance the use of psychology in elite football.Carvalhaes died in 1976 at the age of 58, just two years after retiring. He had returned to S√£o Paulo after the 1958 World Cup, stepping down from his national team position to reprise his role at the club that helped make his name.Back in the relative sanctuary of domestic football, Carvalhaes was able to introduce new ideas such as individual counselling sessions for players, to supplement the cognitive testing for which he was renowned.He continued to work for S√£o Paulo until 1974, aside from a brief return to boxing in 1963, when he provided psychological support for Brazilian fighters competing in the Pan American Games.While Coleman Griffith (1893-1966) is widely recognised as the first sports psychologist, his work was largely confined to American football. Carvalhaes was implementing methods never before seen in top-level football, and doing so with some success.If he played a role in laying the groundwork for contemporary sports psychology, the CBD - perhaps by dint of a willingness to consider all options in its bid to win the World Cup - also lent a helping hand.Without the risk they took in appointing a psychologist, who had only been employed by S√£o Paulo for a single season before joining the national team, it is probable that Carvalhaes' work would not have been as widely acknowledged as it was.But even today, embedding psychologists within training ground environments - beyond academy level, where many English clubs are mandated to provide psychological support for players - remains far from commonplace.""Psychology is accepted to various degrees within football clubs,"" says Simon Clifford, who led Southampton's sports science department in the early 2000s.""Some will have psychologists working closely with first-team players, others will have managers who see themselves as the main psychologist and don't want players seeing professional psychologists on a day-to-day basis unless there's a problem.""It's like when clubs started to embrace strength and conditioning. It took a while for those practitioners to gain the trust of first team staff. We're still in the early days with psychology.""Clifford is confident that ""there will be a time"" when psychologists and coaching teams work together more seamlessly, in part because of the influence a player's state of mind has on performance.He believes that even if some of Carvalhaes' work could be viewed as ""crude by current standards"", there was also a ""far-sightedness to it that you can see in the roots of today's sports science"".He adds: ""The role psychology plays in elite football is massive.""As Bill Beswick (ex-England national team psychologist) once said: 'The mind is the athlete. The body is simply the means.'""To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in LiverpoolEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.",positive,28 March 2022,liverpool,1,158,136,22
36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60892215,Meg Lanning: Australia's captain desperate for World Cup success,"Last updated on 29 March 202229 March 2022.From the section CricketWe live in a world where little is left to the imagination.Revealing details about our lives is done with the touch of a button, anything from sending a picture of what you're having for dinner to a WhatsApp group, to a celebrity documenting their Caribbean holiday on Instagram.Social media has made professional sportsmen and women more accessible than ever, bringing them closer to the fans who idolise them and ultimately pay their wages.It feels valuable to have the opportunity to learn about the person behind the athlete. What makes them tick, what they do away from sport and the real-life experiences that have shaped them as human beings seem more interesting than how well they are hitting the ball in the nets or which end they prefer to bowl at.Which brings us to Meg Lanning, who has managed to piece together a career as perhaps the best batter to ever play women's cricket while barely revealing anything about herself.Lanning is captain of an Australia side that is probably the strongest international sports team, male or female, on the planet. By the time the 30-year-old finishes her career, she is likely to have numbers matched by no other woman. Her cut shot is so precise, it could take the head off a dandelion from 100 yards.And yet, even those who have played in the same team as Lanning admit to knowing little about her. The biggest revelation from a near-forensic trawl of the internet is that she doesn't like eating coriander.Watching Lanning in action paints a picture of an ice-cold winning machine. Automatic, unflappable and almost emotionless.A conversation with her reveals the opposite. Lanning is likeable and modest, open enough to admit she is a ""guarded"" person who finds captaincy much more stressful than she makes it look.She hates one nickname - 'The Megastar' - and laughs at another: 'Serious Sally'.""I don't tend to open too much,"" she says. ""I've got a small circle of friends who I really trust and I go along with them rather than worrying too much about what's happening on the outside.""The fourth of five children, Lanning's early cricket was with younger sister Anna, herself a good enough batter to play for Melbourne Stars. A narrow concrete path was their pitch, with a wall on one side and windows on the other encouraging them to play straight.Lanning's sporting ambition was actually to play hockey for Australia at the Olympics, with cricket only taking over around the age of 17. She made her first international hundred at 18 and was captain at 21, the youngest person to do either for an Australian cricket team.Even now, in her ninth year as skipper and undisputed leader of a team that dominates women's cricket, Lanning has to battle with her reserved nature.""The biggest challenge that I have found, even today, is building relationships with everyone in the team and trying to understand how to best get the most out of people,"" she says.""It doesn't come naturally to me.""With an eye on life away from cricket, Lanning has completed a degree in health and exercise science. Because of the commitments of her day job, a three-year course took eight to finish.In that time, Australia have not lost any of the three Ashes series in which Lanning has been in charge (she missed one through injury), and won three of the four T20 World Cups.The last such instance, on home soil in 2020, came with the added pressure of trying to 'Fill the 'G' - a push to sell out the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground for the final on International Women's Day.Australia eventually got there, memorably celebrating on stage with Katy Perry after getting their hands on the trophy in front of a crowd of 86,174, but not before almost being eliminated in the group stage.""It was very stressful,"" says Lanning. ""I don't think I've felt so nervous.""It felt like people were saying 'Australia is the best team, they'll get there', but that's not how it works. We could have been out of the World Cup in two games, which would have been a disaster.""We tried to talk it down as much as we could, but we felt it. There's no doubt about that.""Now, Australia are looking for the one trophy they do not currently possess. As overwhelming favourites to win the 50-over World Cup, they meet West Indies in Wellington in the semi-finals on Wednesday. Lanning is the tournament's second-highest run-scorer.Five years ago, Australia were dumped out in the last four by India, the eventual runners-up to England. For Lanning, the experience was physically painful. She played with visible strapping on her shoulder, an injury which would later require surgery.""That was clearly not a great time,"" says Lanning. ""Now that's what I really want to do. I want us to win and I want to personally contribute to that.""That desire leads to Lanning's World Cup experience being ""highly stressful"". She admits to a ""fair bit"" of her day being taken up thinking about cricket, to the extent that she is trying to teach herself to switch off from the game.She confesses to being unable to sit still, so will escape to play golf when she can. Even on training days, she has been spotted doing extra running around the Wellington waterfront.To be so consumed by cricket leads to the question of what Lanning will be left with when her playing career is over, even if her best years might still be to come.""As a player, everything is pretty much dictated to you in terms of where you need to be and what you need to do,"" she says. ""Then you might find yourself having to do all that stuff for yourself, and you're not really used to it.""I can't go on forever and I haven't come up with an answer yet.""It's a bit scary, to be honest.""For now, Lanning is the figurehead of the premier women's cricket team on the planet. Her talent with the bat and leadership of the Australia juggernaut has created a public profile. Even if she has not looked for the spotlight, there are parts of being a recognisable figure she can embrace.""If young girls and boys take up the game because they see us playing on TV, enjoying ourselves and having fun, that's a good thing,"" she says.""We're lucky to be in a position to have an influence and we want to make sure it's a positive one.""It's a really cool thing and something I actually really enjoy.""Lanning might hate the nickname, but she really is a 'Megastar'.To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in Liverpool",positive,29 March 2022,liverpool,1,138,119,19
37,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60866991,Euro 2022: 100 days to go until England host Women's European Championship,"Last updated on 28 March 202228 March 2022.From the section Women's FootballLess than nine months since England hosted a Euros final and we're already counting down the days until the next - this time in the women's event.There are just 100 days to go until the opening match of Euro 2022, a tournament which is set to draw the biggest crowds ever seen at the Women's European Championship.The competition, being held at 10 stadiums in England from 6-31 July, was originally scheduled to take place last year but was moved back 12 months because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Here we take a look at some of the main talking points, including which team will replace Russia and how Northern Ireland will fare on their debut.To mark the 100 days milestone, remaining tickets went on general sale at 08:00 BST (on 28 March) for the 31 matches, although ticket sales have already broken previous records.In August it was announced that 53,000 tickets had already been bought for the Wembley final, which would surpass the current record attendance of 41,302 when Germany defeated hosts Sweden at Euro 2013.England kick off this year's tournament against Austria at Old Trafford on 6 July, with the final being held at Wembley on 31 July.The other venues staging matches will be Brentford, Brighton, Leigh (Leigh Sports Village), Manchester City (Academy Stadium), Milton Keynes, Rotherham, Sheffield (Bramall Lane) and Southampton.Uefa says it has sold more than 350,000 of the 700,000 tickets available, compared with the previous record of 240,000 tickets sold for the last tournament in the Netherlands in 2017.There will be 16 nations taking part, although we only know 15 of them after Russia were kicked out of the competition following the country's invasion of Ukraine.Russia were meant to be in Group C alongside the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, with all three of their group matches set to be staged at Leigh Sports Village.European football's governing body Uefa is yet to announce who will replace them, although one option would be to bring in Portugal, the side that lost 1-0 on aggregate in the two-legged play-off to Russia.Another possibility is for the three nations that lost in the qualifying play-offs - Portugal, Ukraine and the Czech Republic - to be involved in a draw to select the replacement.Whoever does come in will have one of the toughest tasks to advance as only the top two in each group move on to the quarter-finals. Sweden and the Netherlands are ranked second and fifth respectively in the Fifa world rankings, while Switzerland are 19th.England have never won the Women's European Championship, but lost twice in the final - on penalties against Sweden after a two-legged final in 1984 and then 6-2 to Germany in 2009.In the last tournament, held in 2017, the Lionesses lost 3-0 in the semi-finals to hosts and eventual winners the Netherlands.This is only the second time England have hosted the tournament - they finished bottom of their group in 2005 - so could this be their time to triumph?Since Sarina Wiegman became manager in September 2021, England are unbeaten in nine matches and last month won the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup - a competition that also featured Olympic champions Canada, Euros favourites Spain and two-time world champions Germany.England scored two late goals to beat Germany 3-1 in the tournament's final match - their first win over Germany on home soil - to finish above Spain on goal difference and lift the trophy.Manchester City defender Steph Houghton, who captained England under the previous two managers, is a doubt for the tournament and is currently out of action following surgery on an Achilles injury.Northern Ireland qualified for the competition for the first time thanks to a 4-1 aggregate success over Ukraine in the play-offs, although Kenny Shiels' side are the lowest-ranked team at Euro 2022 - 46th in the world.The next month will be a good test for Northern Ireland as they play two of their Euro 2022 opponents, Austria and England, in World Cup qualifying.Northern Ireland are currently second in that group, level on points with Austria but five behind England after Wiegman's side beat them 4-0 in October.The Fifa world rankings, updated four times a year, see Spain ranked seventh in the world, behind Sweden (second), France (third), Germany (fourth) and the Netherlands (fifth). England sit a place lower than Spain in eighth.However, Spain are the betting favourites as their squad features a large number of players from European champions Barcelona, including 2021 Ballon d'Or-winning midfielder Alexia Putellas and striker Jennifer Hermoso, who came second in the voting for the award.The Netherlands are the reigning European champions and reached the World Cup final in 2019, losing to the United States. However, both of those achievements came under their previous manager - England's new boss Wiegman - and they now have Englishman Mark Parsons in charge. Goals shouldn't be hard to come by with Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema - who is the Dutch team's and Women's Super League's record scorer - among their stars.Sweden finished third in the World Cup three years ago - beating England in the third-fourth play-off - and have been drawn alongside the Netherlands in Group C. In the past two years, Sweden have only lost once, on penalties to Canada in the Olympic final.The Netherlands' success at the last Euros ended an incredible run by Germany, who had won the tournament six times in a row from 1995 to 2013. They boast some exciting youngsters and will be looking to progress deep into this year's competition after going out in the quarter-finals five years ago.France have won 10 consecutive matches and earlier this year defeated Finland, Brazil and the Netherlands to win the Tournoi de France. However, France do not have the best of records in European Championships, losing in the quarter-finals in 2009, 2013 and 2017.Former Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg has given Norway a boost after the 26-year-old Lyon forward last week reversed a decision to retire from the national team following a five-year absence. Her side play Northern Ireland and England in their opening two matches.Group A: England, Austria, Norway, Northern Ireland.Group B: Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland.Group C: Netherlands, Sweden, TBC, Switzerland.Group D: France, Italy, Belgium, Iceland.To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in Liverpool",negative,28 March 2022,liverpool,1,136,117,19
38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/60838662,Michael Bisping: Former UFC star looks back on remarkable career in new documentary,"Last updated on 26 March 202226 March 2022.From the section Mixed Martial ArtsAs Michael Bisping walks into the room for this interview, he spills a cup of coffee on the floor.For most, it would be an innocuous incident. For Bisping, there is a life-changing, career-defining reason behind the spillage - he is blind in one eye.The remarkable story of how the 43-year-old lost the vision in his right eye yet still went on to become the first British UFC champion in history is told in a new documentary.Here, Bisping talks to BBC Sport about the emotional turmoil he experienced as a fighter, the steep barriers he overcame to reach the top, and how it felt watching a film about his career.When Bisping agreed to fight Vitor Belfort in 2013, he knew beating the Brazilian could lead to his first UFC world title fight.What he didn't know was the bout would be the last time he stepped inside the octagon with vision in both eyes.In the second round, Belfort landed a fight-ending head kick which led to a detached retina on Bisping's right side.He initially dealt with the injury privately - fearing medical professionals would prevent him fighting - and three months later beat Alan Belcher by a technical unanimous decision.By then, though, his symptoms had worsened to the extent he couldn't put off seeing a doctor any longer.Six surgeries later, his vision remained irreparable and his fight career appeared to be over.""The mental side was by far the hardest part,"" says Bisping.""I'd just moved out to America. Things were going well living this new life in California, but we weren't financially secure and it all got taken away.""I went through depression and feeling sorry for myself and drinking too much because I couldn't do anything. My entire identity had been taken away.""Despite the loss of vision, decline in his mental health and insistence by doctors his career was over, Bisping never considered retiring.""Physically I felt great,"" he says. ""I could still do it, but I couldn't get cleared to fight. Someone else is saying: 'No we're not allowing you to fight because of your eye.'""I was forced for a year to not do anything which could get my heart rate up, and to allow the eye to heal, and that was in itself very challenging.""Contrary to the belief of the doctors, Bisping did end up fighting again. And again. And again.Indeed three years after going blind in his right eye, Bisping won the UFC middleweight title by knocking out Luke Rockhold.But how did Bisping get cleared to fight, and what was it like competing with one eye?In Bisping: The Michael Bisping Story, he tells how he ""fluked and conned"" his way through a number of tests by medical professionals, before getting the all-clear.Indeed only Bisping and his close team members knew the full extent of his problem.Inside the octagon, the main adjustments he had to make were to do with depth perception, which he still struggles with today - hence the spilt coffee.""I'd go to grab things, miss on a couple of occasions, then get it the third time,"" says Bisping.""It was the same with punching - I'd be hitting fresh air, but then you connect and your brain kind of measures the distance.""It was tough, challenging and definitely an adjustment period but I got there in the end.""Throughout the documentary, Bisping shows an emotional side in contrast to the brash, outspoken character he portrayed through his fight career.Whether it's speaking about his eye injury, the problems he suffered growing up in Clitheroe, or the difficulties in coming to terms with defeat, Bisping isn't afraid to pour out his feelings.One such poignant moment comes when he talks about meeting his wife, Rebecca.""She never helped me, she just loved me,"" he says. ""She loved me for who I was and because of her and what we had, I wanted to do better in life.""I never had any ambition, never wanted to be someone. I didn't care. Who cared if I didn't go to school? Who cared if I got arrested?""My mum and dad weren't around too much so when Rebecca came along I wanted more out of life and I wanted to be a success.""Bisping says discussing his emotions in the way he did during the documentary is something he struggled with during his career.""I had this defence mechanism, especially after a loss, of trying to play things down,"" he says. ""But inside you're crushed.""That's one thing that would have helped me - trying to get hold of my emotions. If I could do that, my life would be so much easier because I react out of emotion all the time, and controlling those emotions and discussing those emotions and being honest would certainly have helped.""Following defeat by Kelvin Gastelum, and a scare involving his left eye, Bisping retired in 2017.He's since built a career in the media - commentating and providing analysis for the UFC, and taking part in a number of podcasts.Looking back, he struggles to identify with the person he used to be.""The fighter side of me ... I wouldn't say it's dead, but it's definitely suppressed,"" he says.""But I sit cageside now, commentating on fights, and see what these guys do to each other, and I think: 'They're out of their mind - and I used to this. It's crazy.'""Among the other big names to appear in the documentary are MMA stars Georges St-Pierre and Rashad Evans - and both credit Bisping with being an inspiration.""They're legends themselves - they don't get any bigger than Georges - and for them to say what they said, it's incredibly humbling,"" he says.""Rashad Evans is actually crying because he was so proud of what I managed to do so, again, it's hard to find the right words.""Everyone on the film said the nicest things, and I'm just an idiot from Clitheroe, do you know what I mean?""It's amazing, it really is. Mind-blowing.""To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in Liverpool",positive,26 March 2022,liverpool,1,131,112,19

I want to prove them right and make them feel they made a good investment.""Dubois made her pro debut under a huge spotlight in February on the undercard of Chris Eubank's fight against Liam Williams in Cardiff. Multiple-weight world champion Claressa Shields was also on the card.""I wasn't overwhelmed,"" says Dubois, who fought at super-bantamweight on her debut.""I look at Claressa and it helps me decide what kind of fighter I want to be and what kind of person I want to be.""She's outspoken and she takes up a lot of the attention because she's not afraid to say how good she is. I felt that was really cool.""Seeing her train and seeing how she carried herself, it rubbed off on me. I was able to learn from her.""Watching Shields demolish Ema Kozin and then go toe-to-toe with WBO middleweight champion Savannah Marshall at ringside was inspiring for Dubois, who says she is still figuring out exactly what kind of fighter - and woman - she wants to be.""At the end of the day, people just copy each other and we're constantly looking at other people for inspiration and she's definitely somebody who inspires me,"" she says.""Pro boxing, it's all the time. Everyone wants to interview you all the time. It can be a bit much and overwhelming, so you really need the right people around you. You need to keep your focus. I'm doing that with the right people. But it's still something you have to learn to deal with.""One of the people around Dubois is her brother and fellow boxer Daniel, who turned pro as a heavyweight when he was just 19.The siblings are both trained by Shane McGuigan and travel to the gym together.""There's no competition there. There's no way I'm squatting what he is,"" Dubois jokes.But one piece of advice from her brother has stuck with Caroline.""He's told me to be myself,"" she says. ""And it's better to be open and speak your mind.""Dubois might have a bright future ahead of her, and although she says the leap from novice to world title contender is shorter than in the men's game, the Londoner is keen to take things slowly.""I want to learn and improve, I know I'm still very immature,"" she says. ""I don't need anyone to tell me that so I want to develop as a person as much as a boxer.""I want to have five, six bouts by the end of this year. I want them to be all learning fights, learning the game, learning the ropes, learning the lights.""We're in no rush. Female boxing, the level isn't the same. You have the beginner level and then, bam, you could be fighting for a world title.""You have to be ready when the time comes, but right now I'm still young and there's no rush.""To understand what Putin might do in the future, we need to understand his past...Police investigate an extremely violent gang in Devon's drug economyPeter Bleksley sets out to find Kevin Parle, a man connected to murders in Liverpool",positive,26 March 2022,liverpool,1,136,116,20
