Rangnick admitted ""it is extremely embarrassing for me as a coach to have press conferences like this one"" as he addressed the media after United's supine performance at Anfield. ""It's embarrassing, it's disappointing, maybe even humiliating,"" said Rangnick. ""We have to accept Liverpool are six years ahead of us now.

That is what needs to happen with us in the next transfer windows."" The German, who is to take a two-year advisory role come the end of the season, warned big changes are afoot at Old Trafford ahead of the expected arrival of new boss Erik ten Hag. ""There will be a rebuild for sure but that does not help us when we still have five games to play,"" said Rangnick, with United still three points off fourth-placed Tottenham, having played a game more. ""If you analyse the situation it is not difficult to analyse. For me, it is clear there will be six, seven, eight, maybe ten new players.

""They played without their centre midfielders and when you are in a difficult situation like United before the game, Paul (Pogba) has to go off and it is not easy to play against us. ""Nine-nil?

United were dominated by their rivals on a night that interim manager Ralf Rangnick called ""humiliating"" as their bid to finish in the top four of the Premier League received another blow. Neville admitted players and managers at the club deserved criticism, but that ""repeated failure over a 10-year period"", along with the dividends they continue to take out of the club, means it is time for the Glazers to leave Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, the former United defender set out his grievances against the American family that has owned the club since 2005 in the wake of a defeat to Liverpool that he described as a ""shambles"". It would be easy to launch into the players and I've done that enough, because they have to take responsibility. You can sometimes point towards the managers that Manchester United have had this season, but you have to start looking above when you see repeated failure over a 10-year period. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player They (the Glazers) are taking dividends out of the football club. No good business, when the core activity of that business is failing miserably, when the cash has been depleted over the last three years to the levels that it has, continue to take money out. Liverpool 4-0 Man Utd: Report and highlights 'Humiliated' Rangnick: Man Utd need up to 10 players in rebuild Get Sky Sports Premier League table Yes, maybe when the club's rich, it's winning, there's hundreds of millions in the bank, the sponsorship contracts are coming in, there isn't Covid and the stadium's absolutely amazing, you might say, 'OK, the owners can take a dividend'. Not today. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Out of respect, don't take money out of a business when the core activity of the business is failing, when the stadium needs hundreds of millions spending on it, when the training ground needs money spending on it, when the team needs money spending on it, when they need a manager who's paid a handsome wage to compete with [Jurgen] Klopp, [Pep] Guardiola and [Thomas] Tuchel - don't you take money out of that club. These do and that's why they must go. I'm a capitalist, I'm an entrepreneur, I've got businesses, I understand the theory of borrowing and lending money, and taking money out of a football club. But not when the business is on its knees. The culture is set from the very top. There's something rotten. This has been 10 years of poor decision-making, of repeated failure, of lack of investment into the stadium. They've invested into the football team, I'll give them that, but not with their own money. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This Manchester United team disappoint you on a consistent basis. Their performance levels are as bad as I've seen in my life, and that's from the very start of the season to the end. They've won games and they're on the points they're on, and I don't know how because there is absolutely nothing to hang onto, other than individual moments and players who sometimes turn up. There is nothing here. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did a pretty decent job for the previous two or three years, Ralf Rangnick knows how to set up a football team, but they've both been totally defeated by this group of players. You've watched those Manchester United players all season, blaming each other, blaming the manager, not clapping the fans. You've seen the owners not turn up. The culture of every club is set at the top. The players out there [against Liverpool] were an absolute shambles. That first half, I couldn't be any more damning. I'm never going to say they're not fit to wear the shirt, it's too emotional. They're good players, some of those lads. But the players have let themselves down, they've let the fans down. Tuesday night was a low. Even the worst Liverpool team we played against, we never got a game as easy as that. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Jamie Carragher admitted he was part of some Liverpool sides that took beatings from Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, but said he and his team-mates never ""stooped that low"". ""I did feel it would end up being about 4-0,"" said the former Liverpool defender. ""Where Manchester United are right now, that was me in a Liverpool shirt, trying to challenge Manchester United when they were top dogs. They had the manager, they had the squad, they had everything covered and we were just trying to hang onto their coattails. But I don't think we ever stooped that low. ""We lost one time 4-0 at Old Trafford, but we had a man sent off after one minute. We got some doings off Manchester United - they were better than us - but we still had something about us, a personality, a character. We still won trophies in unbelievable circumstances when we weren't one of the best teams. ""I couldn't imagine this Manchester United team doing something out of the ordinary, like an Istanbul, or winning an FA Cup when they shouldn't. We always still felt we had the ability to do something in a game and you knew there'd be a bit of fight."" Speaking to Neville, Carragher added: ""This Manchester United, yes they're awful, but this is one of the most expensively assembled squads in the history of the game. ""If you were playing now for that Manchester United team - I'm not even talking about [Ryan] Giggs or [Paul] Scholes - you wouldn't allow that to happen. I wouldn't allow that to happen.""

Sky Sports pundits give their Premier League title race verdicts,"Who will win the Premier League title? Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane give their verdicts after Liverpool's 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United saw them go above title rivals Man City at the top of the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp's side now have a two-point advantage, albeit having played a game more, and now the pressure is on Man City to respond when they host Brighton on Wednesday evening. Pep Guardiola's side can establish their one-point advantage with victory over Graham Potter's side at the Etihad Stadium as the twists and turns in this exciting title race continue to come. So, with games running out for both sides, who will get over the line and lift the trophy in May? The Sky Sports pundits have their say... CARRA SAYS: ""I look at the away games both teams have, and they are games you would expect them to win, but you know at this stage even a draw is almost like the end of the world. You feel like the title is gone if someone draws a game. ""They are the types of games, maybe after a Champions League semi-final, Liverpool have got Newcastle at 12.30pm and just maybe, if the game catches up with you, you draw an away game 1-1. You can have games like that even if you play well and you are just unlucky or the goalkeeper plays well. ""I just look at the away games both teams have got and that's where one side could drop something. That's all it could take, one team drawing a game off the back of a Champions League game. They just run out of steam, or you get a player sent off. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures ""I can see it happening that someone drops points in an away game, but I don't know who."" SOUNESS SAYS: ""It's impossible to call. Manchester City are a very special team. ""I think it is virtually impossible to look at any of the fixtures and say either team are vulnerable there or that is a guaranteed win. What we have is the most marvellous race on our hands. ""Liverpool have put the ball back into Man City's court. They have to respond against Brighton, and then it goes again. All you can do in this position is think about the next game and get through the games without injuries. ""As fabulous as Liverpool were against Man Utd, they got a large slice of luck with Naby Keita not getting sent off because that may have impacted in the games coming up if a midfield player or two were to get injured. But it is going to be a great end to what have been a fabulous season. ""It was 14 points Liverpool were adrift of Man City. City will have looked at that, and while they would never admit it in public, they would have thought they had it won at that time. However, they have blown that lead and 13 points have gone. ""So, I still feel the momentum is very much with Liverpool."" NEVILLE SAYS: ""I think Liverpool because of the momentum and the spirit, and also Man City not having that striker could hurt them at some point. I also think how City do in the Champions League will impact their Premier League challenge. I think the Champions League is a big one for Pep Guardiola and those players after what happened last year. ""But to be fair, Liverpool put City under unbelievable pressure a few seasons ago and City withstood it. So, they could withstand it again and prove us all wrong, but I just think, at this moment in time, the momentum seems to be with Liverpool."" KEANE SAYS: ""I still think Manchester City will edge it. I just think they are good enough to win all their games. It's as simple as that. ""Liverpool obviously have a lot of momentum and are a fantastic side, but I just think City will edge it.""

Pogba was jeered by United fans when he was substituted during their 3-2 win over Norwich, after which interim manager Ralf Rangnick said: ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players."" Several clubs, including Real Madrid and Juventus, are in talks with Pogba's representatives over signing him on a free transfer in the summer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The France international has also not ruled out remaining in the Premier League. Pogba was also substituted during United's 4-0 hammering at the hands of Liverpool on Tuesday after suffering a calf injury during the first 10 minutes of the game at Anfield. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 29-year-old will be assessed by United's medical staff to determine the extent of the injury. In commentary, Gary Neville said it could be the last time Pogba is seen in a United shirt, with the team having only five games remaining as they bid to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Get Sky Sports Premier League table Pogba first joined United from Le Havre as a teenager in 2009 but ran down his contract before he had broken into the first team in order to join Juventus. The midfielder rejoined United from the Italian club for a then-world record fee in 2016 and won the League Cup and the Europa League during his first season back at Old Trafford. But while he has lifted the World Cup and Nations League with France since then, further silverware at club level has failed to materialise. Pogba previously appeared close to a United exit towards the end of Jose Mourinho's spell as manager after their relationship deteriorated. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mourinho prevented Pogba from captaining the club, while the pair were also filmed having a confrontation during training. However, Mourinho was sacked just months later and Pogba was reintegrated into the squad by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Injury has limited Pogba to just 21 starts in all competitions this season, and he and the club will end the season empty-handed again. Senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Manchester United's overhaul will not be restricted to the squad and a new face in the dugout as the club's chief scout, Jim Lawlor, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, have exited Old Trafford. Fixing a recruitment structure that has played a part in a £1.4billion gross spend over the past decade with little to show for it has been overdue. Lawlor joined United in 2005 under Sir Alex Ferguson, working towards a chief scout promotion in 2014, while Louis van Gaal had roped in Bout as part of his coaching staff before the switch to scouting. A club statement read: ""Jim Lawlor has decided to step down from his role as chief scout in the summer after 16 years with the club. ""During that time, Jim played a key role in the development of multiple trophy-winning Manchester United teams and was an important source of guidance to Sir Alex Ferguson and each of the managers who have followed him. ""Jim leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future. ""Marcel Bout has departed from his role as head of global scouting after eight years with the club. ""A respected figure within and outside of Manchester United, Marcel has played an important part as an assistant coach and in the strengthening of our scouting capabilities in recent years.

The Spain left-back says he will instead point to the Premier League 'No Room for Racism' badge on his sleeve, while other players kneel ahead of kick-off. Since the Premier League resumed in the summer of 2020 after a coronavirus-enforced break, players, officials and staff at games have been taking a knee before kick-off to show support for the movement for racial equality. ""I am fully against racism and I'm against every type of discrimination, and I just prefer to put my finger to the badge where it says no to racism, like they do in some other sports and football in other countries,"" Alonso said. ""I prefer to do it this way and, of course, to say very clearly that I am against racism and I respect everybody."" Asked whether or not his decision to stop taking the knee had anything to do with politics, Alonso said: ""I don't know, I just prefer to do it this way. It's my way to do it, I think it's another way. ""And maybe I think it's losing a bit of strength the other way, so I just prefer to do it this way and to show I am fully supportive of fighting against racism."" Ruthless Chelsea brush aside Spurs Tuchel: Kante gives you 'everything you need' Tuchel: Mendy not comfortable enough to face Spurs Podcast: Brilliant Chelsea, Man Utd's slice of luck Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha became the first top-flight player to opt out of the gesture, earlier this year, after stating his belief that taking a knee is ""degrading"". Alonso, who was speaking to the media following Chelsea's victory over Tottenham on Sunday, said he had not discussed his decision with any of his Chelsea team-mates, several of whom have been victims of racial abuse. Reece James, Antonio Rudiger, N'Golo Kante and Romelu Lukaku have all faced abuse in recent years, with England defender James temporarily deleting his Instagram account earlier this year due to the scale of online abuse. ""No, we haven't talked about it,"" Alonso said. ""We are in the changing room and we are like a family. I have a very good relationship with everyone, I love everyone and up to now we haven't talked about it. I don't think there is a need to, but, of course, if I have to speak to anyone, I will say the same thing I just told you and I don't think there will be any problems."" Alonso confirmed he intends to maintain his stance for the rest of the season, adding: ""Yeah, for now I prefer to point to the sleeve and that's what I will do."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Chelsea boss Tuchel has said the club accepts Alonso's decision to stop taking a knee, and acknowledges it could prompt a discussion among the squad as to how they tackle racism in the future. Tuchel said: ""It's not a discussion in the group, but of course if a player takes a decision like this, we are not in a bubble - of course then discussions come up. The most important thing is I know Marcos personally and I trust him 1000 per cent that he is absolutely committed against racism and any form of racism. There is no question about it. We are all against it. ""We took the decision to take the knee together. Maybe it takes action against a routine to wake up again and have another good discussion. We want to do the most against racism and stand up against it. ""There are different forms of doing it. Marcos took his position. He's a grown up, a responsible person. This is his decision, we accept it, he gave his reasons for it and from here the discussion can end or go in a productive way maybe to do more."" Asked if he understands Alonso's point about the gesture lacking strength, Tuchel added: ""Isn't it always like this? Once you do a gesture, and everybody is doing it, and once you do it so often because there are so many games it becomes normal. ""Then maybe it lowers the effect of it. If this is his point, I can see his point. We can now discuss if it's necessary to have this discussion and be the only guy standing up. ""He's pretty aware of it, he's experienced enough, responsible enough. This development started with single persons taking a knee, and it became a bigger thing. ""Marcos' point is that it cannot end like this and it cannot become normal. What should be normal is that we're against racism. I understand Marcos thinks there's always more to do, of course we want to focus on sports, but use the platform and possibilities that we have. How we produce performances together is by living by example."" Alonso, who had fallen out of favour at Chelsea under Frank Lampard before Tuchel's arrival last season, has made a strong start to the 2021/22 campaign, starting all five Premier League games ahead of England defender Ben Chilwell. The high regard in which Tuchel holds Alonso was highlighted by the former Bolton and Sunderland defender being given the captain's armband as Chelsea beat Aston Villa earlier this month. Sunday's 3-0 win at Spurs maintained the European champions' unbeaten start to the season, during which they have claimed four wins and a draw from a tough opening schedule.

The visitors were outclassed at Anfield, with a Mohamed Salah double and goals from Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz racking up a 4-0 win which, coupled with Liverpool's destruction of United at Old Trafford in October, takes the aggregate score for the season between the sides to 9-0. Those two fixtures have illustrated the huge gulf in quality between the two rivals and former United captain Keane - who won seven Premier League titles and a Champions League during his time there - was left overwhelmingly disappointed with the demise of his former club. ""It's not anger, it was anger earlier in the season. It's sadness,"" he said. ""You look at the team today, there wasn't any heart, no soul, no leaders, they lack real quality. They are so far off and you look at the United fans tonight… there's no surprise with the scoreline, but Liverpool could score any time they went forward. ""There is disarray at the club from the top. The fans have no time for the owners. They need a new manager, they need players in, they need players out… ""It's so sad to see. It's not the club I played for. It doesn't reflect what Man Utd stood for when I played for it. It's chalk and cheese. I don't see a Manchester United team out there fighting and playing with pride. Get Sky Sports Dominant Liverpool drub Man Utd to move top Liverpool-Man Utd player ratings Man Utd's wasted season gets worse ""There's no hiding. At this level you get found out. It's so sad watching this team."" Keane was heavily critical of the attitude shown by the United players on Tuesday night, questioned their character and pointed to the fact several are out of contract in the summer. ""What Man Utd have always had in my experience of the club is brilliant characters, brilliant men, people you want to work with, people you want to be in the trenches with,"" he said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Robson, Bruce, Pallister, Beckham, Giggsy, Butty all these lads. Brilliant lads. We didn't win every week but you'd look around before a game and think, 'we're going to give everything we have for this club'. That's what we'd expect and hopefully our talent would get us over the line and we'd win the odd game. ""But this team isn't even likeable, there's no soul with this team. You don't even warm to them. I know it's difficult for players to do interviews but it's very robotic, there's no emotion. ""I'd love to know what's going on at the training ground. What's the culture with the players, the young players, who's helping these lads along? ""I've never heard so many players wanting to leave Man Utd. When I was playing for them you were dreading that you might be sold or leave. Now everybody wants to get out of the door. They can't get out quick enough. ""There's six or seven - look at the Everton game a couple of weeks ago - they've already left the building. They're gone. You can tell with their performances. They're on their holidays, they've switched off. They don't turn up, they lose 4-0, they're shaking hands going down the tunnel, they're doing the interviews with soundbites. You should be ashamed of your life. You should be hiding."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Keane's former team-mate Neville, United have hit a low he's not previously witnessed. ""Man Utd were a million miles away from that Liverpool team in every department. On and off the pitch. It was a sobering evening,"" he said. ""We expected it. Not one Man Utd fan came here with any hope whatsoever. That team has got nothing. ""There are some decent players out on that pitch and some talent. I cannot explain how it's gone from what would be slightly promising at the end of last season finishing second - I know they lost in the Europa League final which was a bad one - to the point where we are today which is an all-time low in my 42 years of watching United. I've never seen it as bad as that. ""I've never seen a Man Utd team wilt and be as flaky in a game of football in my 40 years."" Neville used the example of Hannibal Mejbri to illustrate his frustrations with this United team. The 19-year-old Tunisian was only sent on in the 84th minute and while he was caught in possession for the fourth goal, he also picked up a booking and made some strong tackles on Liverpool players - an approach, Neville said, which at least showed some fight. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, his overall assessment of the current team is that they're ""broken"". ""I erred on the unprofessional side on commentary when I said I was proud of him because he was going round trying to kick people,"" said Neville. ""But he demonstrated something, he showed us something: that he didn't like the idea at Anfield of Liverpool passing around him. The idea of Liverpool taking the mickey out of him and his team-mates. ""At least he demonstrated something. I'm not saying it was brilliant that he was kicking Liverpool players and could have hurt them, but as a Man Utd fan, they can respond to that at least. ""The rest of them… there's some of them out there who are probably good lads, good professionals, got good careers, good talent - but they're broken. They're finished and they're done this season."" Keane believes United need a major rebuild if they are to return to a competitive level. In the meantime he said the performances of some of the current players were simply not anywhere near the required standard and argued the group lack the togetherness to make up for their shortcomings. ""There are some good individuals when they fancy it and turn up, but when the going gets tough or they're under the cosh, they're out of it,"" he said. ""They haven't got that team spirit you need. This Man Utd team is well short on talent anyway. We've been saying for the last few months, they're not as talented as they think. So to then not to have the rest of it to try to back it up - fighting spirit, energy… ""We saw the midfield tonight, [Marcus] Rashford's performance tonight, [Jesse] Lingard comes on to try to save Man Utd. Lingard should have left Man Utd two years ago! He's not good enough for Man Utd. ""Rashford played like a child up front. OK he wasn't getting service but the one or two bits he got in the first half, when you think 'you're in on goal', a poor touch. ""Defensively, we were trying to help Harry Maguire out before the match, give him a little bit of PR. The last goal, Maguire's passing and his defending... It's not acceptable and not good enough for Man Utd. ""We're going to have to use that word, we're talking about a rebuilding job. Man Utd need to get players in who first of all are hopefully decent lads, good quality pros and talented to try to compete. ""Man Utd are now fifth or sixth in the league.

Lukaku finds himself as an understudy to Kai Havertz up front less than nine months after becoming Chelsea's most expensive signing ever in the summer after re-joining from Inter Milan for £97.5m. The former Manchester United and Everton striker has managed just five goals in 20 appearances on his return to the Premier League - he has never finished a campaign in England with less than 12. But Tuchel has faith that he and Lukaku, Belgium's record goalscorer, can find a formula to reignite the 28-year-old's career in west London. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""It is pride for me and it should hopefully also be pride for him - and it is I guess,"" Tuchel told Sky Sports News. ""This is how we feel, we feel things getting personal then if we don't get it right and I feel it with any player. If we cannot get the best out of a player for the team it feels, personally for me I feel it and I don't want to have that feeling so. ""You never give up on players, you never give in, and I think Romelu is such a competitor that he feels the same and he behaves in the same way."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports Tuchel refused to pull any punches when assessing Lukaku's performances over the past few weeks ahead of the visit of Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports. The German admits injuries have played a role in Lukaku's failure to meet expectations, but says he requires some fortune or momentum to galvanise his performances. ""All he needs is that spark,"" Tuchel said at his news conference on Tuesday. ""He maybe would've been a natural starter against Crystal Palace given the minutes Kai (Havertz) has played. ""But after a period of injury he lacked the fitness for matches. I don't point the finger at him, it's just a fact... Romelu should have had a goal against Real Madrid and Crystal Palace, but if he plays we need all that he has."" Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson: ""Even when Lukaku came on in the semi-final on Sunday, he's just not in sync with what Chelsea are trying to do. ""In the last five minutes at Wembley the ball went across the six-yard box three times. They are three tap-ins, and he could have had a hat-trick. However, he's pulling out to the penalty spot and another one was easier to score than miss. ""I just don't think he's singing off the same hymn sheet at the moment. It's just a situation where he's not in sync with his team-mates and it is showing on the pitch."" Lukaku was signed from Inter Milan for £97.5m last August and was seen as the final piece of the jigsaw that would allow Thomas Tuchel to solve the puzzle of how to end Manchester City and Liverpool's domestic dominance. But despite striking four times in his first four games - which included a goal in an impressive second Chelsea debut at Arsenal and two against Aston Villa - the goals quickly dried up for the Belgian. Lukaku has continued to underwhelm to such an extent that he now finds himself behind Kai Havertz in the pecking order to be the No 9 at Stamford Bridge. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Lukaku did make an appearance from the bench in the first leg against Real but, with his side two goals down and in desperate need of inspiration, he missed a glorious chance just minutes after coming on, a scene that perfectly summed up how his return to the club he supported as a teenager has gone sideways. For a few months now, Lukaku has been forced to watch from the sidelines, where he may contemplate where things have gone wrong for him this season, why Havertz has been able to succeed where he has failed, and whether his return to west London was in fact doomed from the start.

United were dominated by their rivals on a night that interim manager Ralf Rangnick called ""humiliating"" as their bid to finish in the top four of the Premier League received another blow. Neville admitted players and managers at the club deserved criticism, but that ""repeated failure over a 10-year period"", along with the dividends they continue to take out of the club, means it is time for the Glazers to leave Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, the former United defender set out his grievances against the American family that has owned the club since 2005 in the wake of a defeat to Liverpool that he described as a ""shambles"". It would be easy to launch into the players and I've done that enough, because they have to take responsibility. You can sometimes point towards the managers that Manchester United have had this season, but you have to start looking above when you see repeated failure over a 10-year period.

Not today. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Out of respect, don't take money out of a business when the core activity of the business is failing, when the stadium needs hundreds of millions spending on it, when the training ground needs money spending on it, when the team needs money spending on it, when they need a manager who's paid a handsome wage to compete with [Jurgen] Klopp, [Pep] Guardiola and [Thomas] Tuchel - don't you take money out of that club. These do and that's why they must go. I'm a capitalist, I'm an entrepreneur, I've got businesses, I understand the theory of borrowing and lending money, and taking money out of a football club. But not when the business is on its knees. The culture is set from the very top. There's something rotten. This has been 10 years of poor decision-making, of repeated failure, of lack of investment into the stadium.

Their performance levels are as bad as I've seen in my life, and that's from the very start of the season to the end. They've won games and they're on the points they're on, and I don't know how because there is absolutely nothing to hang onto, other than individual moments and players who sometimes turn up. There is nothing here. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did a pretty decent job for the previous two or three years, Ralf Rangnick knows how to set up a football team, but they've both been totally defeated by this group of players. You've watched those Manchester United players all season, blaming each other, blaming the manager, not clapping the fans. You've seen the owners not turn up. The culture of every club is set at the top. The players out there [against Liverpool] were an absolute shambles. That first half, I couldn't be any more damning. I'm never going to say they're not fit to wear the shirt, it's too emotional. They're good players, some of those lads. But the players have let themselves down, they've let the fans down. Tuesday night was a low. Even the worst Liverpool team we played against, we never got a game as easy as that. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Jamie Carragher admitted he was part of some Liverpool sides that took beatings from Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, but said he and his team-mates never ""stooped that low"". ""I did feel it would end up being about 4-0,"" said the former Liverpool defender. ""Where Manchester United are right now, that was me in a Liverpool shirt, trying to challenge Manchester United when they were top dogs. They had the manager, they had the squad, they had everything covered and we were just trying to hang onto their coattails. But I don't think we ever stooped that low. ""We lost one time 4-0 at Old Trafford, but we had a man sent off after one minute. We got some doings off Manchester United - they were better than us - but we still had something about us, a personality, a character. We still won trophies in unbelievable circumstances when we weren't one of the best teams. ""I couldn't imagine this Manchester United team doing something out of the ordinary, like an Istanbul, or winning an FA Cup when they shouldn't. We always still felt we had the ability to do something in a game and you knew there'd be a bit of fight."" Speaking to Neville, Carragher added: ""This Manchester United, yes they're awful, but this is one of the most expensively assembled squads in the history of the game.

Sky Sports pundits give their Premier League title race verdicts,"Who will win the Premier League title? Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane give their verdicts after Liverpool's 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United saw them go above title rivals Man City at the top of the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp's side now have a two-point advantage, albeit having played a game more, and now the pressure is on Man City to respond when they host Brighton on Wednesday evening. Pep Guardiola's side can establish their one-point advantage with victory over Graham Potter's side at the Etihad Stadium as the twists and turns in this exciting title race continue to come. So, with games running out for both sides, who will get over the line and lift the trophy in May? The Sky Sports pundits have their say... CARRA SAYS: ""I look at the away games both teams have, and they are games you would expect them to win, but you know at this stage even a draw is almost like the end of the world. You feel like the title is gone if someone draws a game. ""They are the types of games, maybe after a Champions League semi-final, Liverpool have got Newcastle at 12.30pm and just maybe, if the game catches up with you, you draw an away game 1-1. You can have games like that even if you play well and you are just unlucky or the goalkeeper plays well.

SOUNESS SAYS: ""It's impossible to call. Manchester City are a very special team. ""I think it is virtually impossible to look at any of the fixtures and say either team are vulnerable there or that is a guaranteed win. What we have is the most marvellous race on our hands. ""Liverpool have put the ball back into Man City's court. They have to respond against Brighton, and then it goes again. All you can do in this position is think about the next game and get through the games without injuries. ""As fabulous as Liverpool were against Man Utd, they got a large slice of luck with Naby Keita not getting sent off because that may have impacted in the games coming up if a midfield player or two were to get injured. But it is going to be a great end to what have been a fabulous season. ""It was 14 points Liverpool were adrift of Man City. City will have looked at that, and while they would never admit it in public, they would have thought they had it won at that time. However, they have blown that lead and 13 points have gone. ""So, I still feel the momentum is very much with Liverpool."" NEVILLE SAYS: ""I think Liverpool because of the momentum and the spirit, and also Man City not having that striker could hurt them at some point. I also think how City do in the Champions League will impact their Premier League challenge. I think the Champions League is a big one for Pep Guardiola and those players after what happened last year. ""But to be fair, Liverpool put City under unbelievable pressure a few seasons ago and City withstood it. So, they could withstand it again and prove us all wrong, but I just think, at this moment in time, the momentum seems to be with Liverpool.""

Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick at Old Trafford boosted United's hopes of a top-four finish following defeats for rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, but the result glossed over another underwhelming performance and the home fans were not afraid to show their discontent. Pogba, whose United contract runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up but struggled to make an impact against the Premier League's bottom side and was replaced by Juan Mata in the 74th minute with the score at 2-2. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The United midfielder was then jeered as he made his way off the pitch before cupping his ears to a particularly critical corner as he went down the tunnel at full-time. Although Rangnick admits he did not hear the boos from a section of disgruntled supporters, he insists he does not agree with their actions. ""I didn't hear it myself, to be honest,"" Rangnick said. ""But we were talking about it with my staff in my office in the locker room. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think the fans here are amazing, I really do. The support in the stadium today was again great, it couldn't have been any better. Man Utd 3-2 Norwich - Match report & highlights Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Live football on Sky Sports ""I can understand if that the fans are frustrated and disappointed - so are we. Things have stayed, as far as I know, peaceful all the time. ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players because it's a collective responsibility. ""Even if you look into the past, for me it doesn't make sense and this is why I will always defend and protect my players."" The individual brilliance of Pogba's team-mate Ronaldo has put United just three points behind fourth-placed Spurs as the season heads into its final few weeks, but Rangnick's side continue to look defensively vulnerable. Norwich had only scored eight away goals in the Premier League this campaign before their trip to Manchester. Having had 15 shots in the game, Dean Smith's side will undoubtedly feel hard done by not to have come away from Old Trafford with at least a point. Rangnick said: ""We didn't defend well. Both goals we should have defended much better and David de Gea kept us in the game with a brilliant save. ""Overall, it was highly important to win the game, but the way that we played defensively after being 2-0 up was not enough. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a question of intensity and physicality. Before the first goal, we had the ball at our feet at the sideline but if you are not physical enough in those moments to protect the ball then you can even lose the ball in those areas and within a few seconds they had a free header in our own box. ""It doesn't make sense to look and just be interested in the other results, we have to take care of our own results. Today we got the result but with the overall performance, we definitely have to raise that level against Liverpool on Tuesday and the same away at Arsenal and at home against Chelsea."" As for Ronaldo, he has now scored 60 hat-tricks in his professional career and has 21 goals for United this season in all competitions. ""Like against Tottenham, he was very crucial today,"" Rangnick added. ""The second and the third one were not easy goals, the way he took those two goals was just outstanding.""

Pogba was jeered by United fans when he was substituted during their 3-2 win over Norwich, after which interim manager Ralf Rangnick said: ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players."" Several clubs, including Real Madrid and Juventus, are in talks with Pogba's representatives over signing him on a free transfer in the summer.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 29-year-old will be assessed by United's medical staff to determine the extent of the injury. In commentary, Gary Neville said it could be the last time Pogba is seen in a United shirt, with the team having only five games remaining as they bid to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Get Sky Sports Premier League table Pogba first joined United from Le Havre as a teenager in 2009 but ran down his contract before he had broken into the first team in order to join Juventus. The midfielder rejoined United from the Italian club for a then-world record fee in 2016 and won the League Cup and the Europa League during his first season back at Old Trafford. But while he has lifted the World Cup and Nations League with France since then, further silverware at club level has failed to materialise. Pogba previously appeared close to a United exit towards the end of Jose Mourinho's spell as manager after their relationship deteriorated. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mourinho prevented Pogba from captaining the club, while the pair were also filmed having a confrontation during training. However, Mourinho was sacked just months later and Pogba was reintegrated into the squad by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Injury has limited Pogba to just 21 starts in all competitions this season, and he and the club will end the season empty-handed again. Senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Manchester United's overhaul will not be restricted to the squad and a new face in the dugout as the club's chief scout, Jim Lawlor, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, have exited Old Trafford. Fixing a recruitment structure that has played a part in a £1.4billion gross spend over the past decade with little to show for it has been overdue. Lawlor joined United in 2005 under Sir Alex Ferguson, working towards a chief scout promotion in 2014, while Louis van Gaal had roped in Bout as part of his coaching staff before the switch to scouting. A club statement read: ""Jim Lawlor has decided to step down from his role as chief scout in the summer after 16 years with the club. ""During that time, Jim played a key role in the development of multiple trophy-winning Manchester United teams and was an important source of guidance to Sir Alex Ferguson and each of the managers who have followed him. ""Jim leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future. ""Marcel Bout has departed from his role as head of global scouting after eight years with the club. ""A respected figure within and outside of Manchester United, Marcel has played an important part as an assistant coach and in the strengthening of our scouting capabilities in recent years.

Kante had missed Chelsea's previous two games after aggravating an ankle injury in last month's 1-1 draw with Liverpool but he replaced Mason Mount after a goalless first half at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and inspired Chelsea to a commanding victory. His headline contribution was his goal, a long-range effort which deflected in off Eric Dier eight minutes after Thiago Silva's headed opener, but Tuchel felt he elevated Chelsea in all aspects of their performance. ""I was absolutely not happy with the first 45 minutes,"" he told Sky Sports.

Here's how the players performed... Showed his confidence with a Cruyff turn in the third minute and was rarely troubled otherwise. Made an easy save from Jadon Sancho at the start of the second half before producing a double stop from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga which would have counted despite the assistant's offside flag. Came to blows with David De Gea in the aftermath of the first goal but didn't get carried away in the derby atmosphere. Defended well against Sancho including in a one-v-one against his England teammate early in the second period. Good range of passing and delivery on set pieces as ever. Brought back into the side in place of Ibrahima Konate and showed why. Never troubled defensively while also playing a sharp, first-time pass into Sadio Mane which allowed the forward to use the pace of the ball to chip it onto Salah for the second goal. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In cruise control for the entire 90 minutes. Gave away possession early in the second half which led to a Manchester United corner and a rollicking from his manager, but that was his only misstep. His most comfortable performance against United since the last time. A quiet night by his standards although still raided down the left side as usual while locking things up defensively. Showed his tenacity by winning possession with an interception which led to the crucial third goal.

Linked-up well with Alexander-Arnold on the right, at times switching into the full-back's position to get on the ball. A captain's performance in the derby. Get Sky Sports Premier League results Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports this week A tower of strength in the Liverpool midfield but also tidy in possession. Nearly assisted Diaz, who scored but was offside, in the first-half with a driving run into the United area. Faded in the second half as tiredness caught up with him. The Spaniard pulled the strings in midfield with his eye-catching range of passing. Always looked in control as he dictated the tempo of the match. Produced a particularly impressive first-half performance by completing 59 of his 60 attempted passes. In all, he made 105 successful passes from 110. ""It's like he's playing in his back yard with his kids,"" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher during the second half. Subbed in the 80th minute to a standing ovation. Who was ever doubting him? Salah looked back to his best after a difficult spell of form. Played a perfect pass to put Liverpool's first goal on a plate for Diaz and then grabbed the second with a cushioned first touch and finish. Endured a quieter second half along with Diaz and Mane although still put in a shift for the team and wrapped things up with a delightful chip for his second and Liverpool's fourth. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Set Salah in-behind for Liverpool's opening goal after dropping off the frontline to collect the ball before repeating the trick with a wonderful first-time pass for the second. Came to Liverpool's need in the second half at a time when United were on top with a well-placed shot into the bottom corner for their third. A high-quality display. Opened the scoring with a simple tap-in after five minutes and had another ruled out for offside. Full of energy and endeavour - a constant threat. His last act was setting up Mane's second before being subbed in the 70th minute. Diaz already plays like he's been part of this Liverpool side for several years rather than months. Came on in the 70th minute with the game won but still showed his class playing a perfectly weighted pass into Salah for the fourth. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Introduced with 10 minutes left and was shown a yellow card for a nasty tackle on Jesse Lingard. Helped to see the match out in the final few minutes - and held Bruno Fernandes to account after a poor tackle on Alexander-Arnold. Left horribly exposed for Liverpool's first and took his frustration out on Alexander-Arnold, who had lashed the ball narrowly past him in celebration. Stood no chance when Salah burst through for the second and Mane's finish didn't give him much hope, either. A deflection off Wan-Bissaka for number four completed a miserable night. Must be getting fed up with repeatedly scooping the ball out of his net in these games. Ineffective at right wing-back in the first half, he was moved to left back for the second to try to contain Liverpool's dominance down that side and did well to initially stymie that avenue of attack, even getting forward to support Sancho. But couldn't keep Salah from scoring the fourth in the end and needed a big tackle to stop the Egyptian completing his hat-trick. Had a terrible time against Liverpool earlier this season and while this was a slight improvement, it still wasn't great.

Jumped forward in an attempt to play offside on Diaz but that only served to give the Liverpool man a good three yards head start to run through for the first goal. Then his poor pass towards Elanga allowed Robertson to spring forward to set up the third. Had a nightmare against Liverpool in October and was at fault for the opener inside five minutes here, backing off Mane to give him space to feed Salah to cross for Diaz. Was stood off the Senegal star again in the second half when Mane swept in a third. Another wretched night for the backline - and team - he leads. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Had the unenviable task of trying to contain Liverpool's right flank in the first half and endured a tough night with Salah and Alexander-Arnold in those areas. He was badly caught out for the first goal and on his heels for the second. The fact he was moved to the other side of the pitch for the second half summed up his struggles. Another unconvincing outing. A shock selection with Ralf Rangnick desperately looking for ways to bolster his backline but it very much looked like this was just his second start of the season inside five minutes when he was out of sync with his fellow centre-backs as Liverpool carved through their visitors. When Liverpool scored the second he must have been wondering what he'd done to upset Rangnick to expose him to this. Threw himself in front of a Diaz cutback and gave his all but talk about being thrown in at the deep end… Subbed off at half time. Matic has been a fine midfielder in the Premier League but at this stage in his career he looks a good couple of yards off the pace when he comes up against a midfield as slick as Liverpool's. Passed around in the build-up to the first goal and couldn't win it back for the second. Got back to stop Liverpool scoring a third in the first half from a counter but over-run in the centre of the park. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sent off 15 minutes after coming on against Liverpool in October. Lasted even less time on the pitch here because he was forced off with an injury on 10 minutes. If it lasts a few weeks, it could be the last we see of him in a Man Utd shirt. The brightest of Man Utd's starters. Came up with a rare moment on the front foot in the first half when he got the better of Alexander-Arnold, set the tone by winning a corner at the start of the second half and saw a shot stopped by Alisson. Ultimately it didn't amount to much - but they were highlights of United's attacking display here. Almost caught Alisson out twice early on but the energy in his game had evaporated by the end of the first half. ""It's a joke that, honestly,"" sighed Gary Neville as Fernandes was beaten to a loose ball by Henderson. When he did have the ball at his feet, he was way below his inspiring best. Managed to nod the ball into the path of Sancho for one effort but not the display his team needed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Played as United's solitary striker but was starved of the ball until the 37th minute when his touch let him down from a long ball over the top - just his seventh touch of the game. Had a better look at goal just after the hour, when he shot straight at Alisson in the box but this wasn't a dangerous centre forward display. Roy Keane likened it to the performance of a child. Thrust into the action after just 10 minutes but barely had a kick as Liverpool dominated the first half, with only seven touches before the break. Saw just a little more of the ball in the second half but didn't make his mark. Tough to do that against this Liverpool side but a missed opportunity to impress. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A bright spark, at least. Sent on for the second half and immediately showed intent, scuffing United's first shot of the match at Alisson and relishing the chance to run at Alexander-Arnold. Looked the most likely to come up with a response before United's slight second half resurgence fizzled out. An eventful late cameo, which saw the Tunisian youngster almost immediately caught in possession for the fourth goal before charging around trying to lay something on Liverpool players and getting booked for a late tackle on Keita. Neville applauded his show of fight. Another Saturday, another chance to become a millionaire! Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive,liverpool,23,391,80

They always do. Manchester United's away support might be the best in the country even when they know that their team is not. On Tuesday at Anfield, that last point was hammered home by Liverpool. United could not even keep it level for five minutes. At least they restricted Jurgen Klopp's side to four goals this time, one better than the five-goal rout at Old Trafford in October. There was brief resistance early in the second half but that was too little too late. It is tempting to say that the supporters had travelled in hope rather than expectation but how much hope was there? Without Cristiano Ronaldo and his ability to conjure something from nothing, it required an awful lot of faith with very little reason. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Klopp had talked it up as a meeting between the two biggest teams in England and it had that big-game feel right up until kick-off when the reality became clear. Liverpool were playing at a pace that United could not comprehend let alone cope with. Their trajectory feels so different as they chase an unprecedented quadruple that would not only leave their rivals in the shade but eclipse the outstanding achievement in Manchester United's history. How can the gulf between the two be this great? Thiago Alcantara was a class above most on this pitch but nobody in a United shirt came close. Luis Diaz, the latest find, was full of urgency from the outset. In contrast, Marcus Rashford was eased off the ball by Virgil van Dijk early on and hardly saw it again. Alisson summed up the contrasting confidence levels with a Cruyff turn. Moments later, David de Gea hesitated when the Brazilian would surely have come out to clear. That led to the opening goal and Ralf Rangnick's plan to contain and frustrate was in tatters. 'Humiliated' Rangnick: Man Utd need up to 10 players in rebuild Liverpool thrash Man Utd - Report and highlights Liverpool 4-0 Man Utd player ratings Support for Ronaldo Has a supposedly top team ever played with this little belief? Gary Neville accused them of walking. Sir Alex Ferguson watched on stone-faced. Rangnick's thrown-together team had only a quarter of possession in the first half. The Kop reminded everyone repeatedly United had not touched the ball for some time. At Liverpool, Thiago was brought in to put his foot on it. Manchester City did the same with Jack Grealish. Providing the pause when everything else is flowing freely has its place. At United, there is no rhythm to disrupt. It is all pause, one long indecipherable stutter. While it might still seem astonishing that two squads on similar salaries can end up delivering such contrasting performances, there should be no mystery at all as to why. This is the product of perfect planning at Liverpool, while United are yet to implement one. Perhaps the arrival of Erik ten Hag will mark a sea change at Old Trafford. If the Dutchman is given time and trust, his body of work so far suggests his employers will be rewarded. But that is for the future. The verdict on the here and now came on the pitch at Anfield. This has been a wasted season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  By giving only the illusion of meaningful change, United have spurned this opportunity to rebuild. Five months have been consumed hardly bothering to process Rangnick's pressing style only to pursue Ten Hag and his possession game anyway. Rangnick's consultancy role was never clear but maybe that was not the point of it. Much like Joel Glazer and his talk of fan consultation in the wake of the failed European Super League initiative, short-term optics rather than long-term strategy have been the priority. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer left in November and the charitable interpretation for what has followed since is that lurching through to the summer was the best that Manchester United could muster. Writing off a season when the highest-paid player is an ageing icon. That never stood up to scrutiny. Did it need to be this way? Clearly, the time could have been better spent. Antonio Conte took the Tottenham job just 27 days after Rangnick arrived at United. Half a season later and he has assessed the squad, changed personnel, system and style. The plan might not work but at least it exists. Mid-season appointments need not be short-term fixes. Klopp, Brendan Rodgers and Thomas Tuchel all took their current Premier League jobs in such fashion and found that period to be useful. Tuchel even managed to win a Champions League in the process. How have United used that time? Players that might have been dispensed with earlier have continued to pick up a salary, their moves blocked with the club seemingly in stasis. Others such as Rashford, who it was hoped could be rejuvenated, now look lost. If Solskjaer seemed too close to the club to diagnose its problems, too invested in the message that progress was real, Rangnick has appeared too distant. His analysis has been accurate but delivered as if he is helpless to stop it, merely an observer to the malaise. Rangnick spoke of a lack of intensity, then a lack of physicality. Creativity has been a concern. He had improved the defence but against Norwich was still left bemoaning United's knack for conceding goals than no other team does. It is no way to go to Anfield. So, Liverpool exploited that nervousness. Neville had feared they would be eaten alive and so it proved, the indecision exploited. Low on confidence, lacking in belief, they must wish the season would end but it is Arsenal and Chelsea next. 'Imagine being us' read the banner in the Kop. Nobody at United really wants that but they can only dream of the crystal-clear vision at Liverpool. Further indignations await unless they can embrace what Ten Hag is offering. This needs to be a turning point. Nemanja Matic has now confirmed his intention to move on and others will surely follow. Perhaps history will yet judge Rangnick's time kindly, a necessary precursor to a new era, his struggles in the job only highlighting the scale and depth of the need for change. But on this April night at Anfield, as Liverpool scored and the Kop roared, it was difficult to think of new beginnings for Manchester United. Only a reminder of their fall - and a long wait to do something about a decline that shows no immediate signs of coming to an end. Another Saturday, another chance to become a millionaire! Super 6.
