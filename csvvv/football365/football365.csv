Ruiz was linked with a move to Newcastle during the January transfer window. The 26-year-old signed for Napoli in 2019 from La Liga side Real Betis. Arsenal, Arteta need to rediscover spark ahead of crunch run He has played over 150 times for Napoli across all competitions in just under four seasons. The centre-midfielder has grabbed six goals and three assists from his 28 Serie A outings this term. His form for Napoli led to him making his debut for Spain in 2019. He has been capped 15 times at senior level.

He has revealed that he has been offered a new deal: “There have been offers of a new contract but at the moment my aim is to play football and play regularly,” Nketiah told The Beautiful Game podcast. “That’s my ambition and that’s what I hope to do but at the same time I’m at Arsenal, I love Arsenal.” He continued: “What I can say is just that I love the club.

The midfielder has played 52 times for Tottenham since he made his senior debut for them in October 2018. “I never thought that young boy walking through (the club) at six, seven and then signing at under-nine would get to this stage,” Skipp stated in an interview posted on Spurs’ official Twitter account. Gossip: Haaland, Sterling updates; Kane and Eriksen reunion “I’m delighted to sign this new deal, it’s something I’m very grateful for. “It means a lot when you’ve grown up at this club. My whole family supports the club, and it means a lot when you step out in front of the crowd.” Skipp spent last season on loan at Norwich, playing 45 of their 46 league games as the Canaries won the Sky Bet Championship title. The England Under-21 international has gone on to make 28 appearances for Spurs this season, but has not featured since the end of January because of a pelvic injury. Skipp said: “In the first few months I had with the boss (Antonio Conte) when he came in I was really starting to improve and understand his philosophy. “You can see that in the team, everyone implementing his ideas. He is a coach who can push you and that really helps me wanting to go to the next level. “I want to get fit, that will happen, and when I’m back really push on from that first half of the season that I had. “I feel there’s a lot more in the next level I can get to and I’m really looking forward to showing that when I’m back. “Pre-season will be massive for me to show that I am 100 per cent right for next season and push on again.” ",positive,liverpool,0,28,22

The striker has scored 82 goals from his 85 appearances for Borussia Dortmund. He signed for them in 2020 from Red Bull Salzburg. Haaland to City could be sporting and sportswashing triumph It was always expected that Haaland would leave Dortmund this summer. His £63m release clause becomes active at the end of this campaign. It has been revealed this week that Man City have agreed terms with the forward. City will move back to the top of the Premier League if they beat Brighton on Wednesday night. It is also possible that they will face Liverpool in the final of this year’s Champions League. Lambert is of the belief that Haaland could “disrupt” Man City at the start of the 2022/23 season: “I think the way City play, I’m not too sure a big centre-forward will be good for them,” Lambert claimed (via Daily Star). “It might take them a while to get used to a new way of playing with them. I think it might disrupt them a little bit. “If one of these teams gets ahead early doors next season, it’s very hard these days for the other team to catch them. So, I think it could be a little advantage [for Liverpool]. “But I think in a year’s time Man City are going to be unstoppable. Because he [Haaland] will be settled in and it’s just going to be unfair. “It’s unfair that they’re bringing in these players every year, unbelievable players. But that Jurgen Klopp is not only able to keep up with them (City) but get the better of them many times is unbelievable.” Earlier this week, Pep Guardiola refused to speak on reports linking Man City with Haaland: “No answer to your question. I have another concern in my head to think what will happen in this club next season.” When asked whether they need a new striker in the summer, the City boss added: “We are playing without a striker. For many years I dont think about transfer windows especially when we have incredible things to play for.” ",positive,liverpool,3,33,23

The Telegraph are reporting that Conte will inform the club’s hierarchy that he needs six new players this summer. It is stated that they face a ‘homegrown player balancing act’. They could have a ‘depleted squadEurope next season if Levy and Paratici set their sights on the overseas transfer market’. The report adds that Spurs are ‘considering a move’ for Christian Eriksen. His contract at Brentford is due to expire in June. Leicester City star Youri Tielemans is noted as a target. Torino duo Gleison Bremer and Wilfried Singo, along with West Brom’s Sam Johnstone, are also mentioned as players Tottenham are looking at.

Spurs were beaten 1-0 by Brighton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday afternoon after Leandro Trossard found the back of the net late on. The Belgian winger skipped past Dier before finishing past Hugo Lloris to win it for the Seagulls. And former Aston Villa and Coventry City striker Dublin has hinted that Dier’s “midfielder’s brain” cost Spurs the match due to his role in the winning goal. “Dier doesn’t have a defensive brain,” said Dublin (via HITC). “He has a midfielder’s brain. That’s the way it is. He’s a midfield player, isn’t he?! “(Lewis) Dunk, for instance, he just stands up and takes it wherever it needs to be taken. You take it in the face. “As soon as you turn, that’s it. The goal is bigger. Then you can do whatever you want. “If you stay big, then you can push right or you can push left. As soon as he puts his feet together, which is what he did, then he couldn’t do anything at all. It’s silly things you know as a defender, which come natural to you.” ",positive,liverpool,0,34,23

It’s really disappointing. “We can only say sorry to the fans. I know they back us through thick and thin, which we appreciate as players. “We go into the Arsenal game now this week. We work hard throughout the week and however we train reflects how we play, so I think we can increase a little bit more intensity and energy in training as well.” Lingard is set to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer at the end of the season. He has only started four times in all competitions in 2021/22. “It’s difficult,” Lingard said of his season. “For me, I just want to play football. “It was great to play against Norwich the other week, I enjoyed it. I was getting into the rhythm of the game, obviously got brought off. “For this game, of course I was expecting to start again but Paul got injured and I came on early enough to play most of the game anyway. “I’m always ready, I’m always confident to play and as soon I stepped foot on the pitch I give 110 per cent for the shirt.” ",positive,liverpool,2,32,23

Lukasz Fabianski is out of contract at the same time, meaning David Moyes will be without a senior goalkeeper next season as things stand. The Hammers do have the opportunity to sign Areola permanently for around £10.5m. Pope is expected to leave Burnley if they are relegated to the Championship and the Clarets are reportedly looking for around £12m. The 30-year-old’s contract expires in 2023 with his club having the option to extend his deal a further year. According to The Times, West Ham have turned their attention to Pope after Moyes decided not to pursue a deal for West Brom’s Sam Johnstone. Arsenal and Tottenham both considered signing Pope but have opted against bringing him in due to his ability with the ball at his feet. Last summer, the Gunners bought Aaron Ramsdale who has since claimed the No. 1 shirt from Bernd Leno. They also signed American shot-stopper Matt Turner in the winter window.

The business end of the season is upon us and things are about to get trickier for Arsenal. Having lost four of their last five matches, the final chase for that last Champions League place is coming into view and the fixture list has cursed Mikel Arteta with a challenging run of fixtures to kick it off. Four of their next five opponents are in the top seven. It is not encouraging reading when their last three defeats came against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, three distinctly mid-table teams. Over the coming three weeks, Arsenal have to play Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham United and Spurs, with only a home match against Leeds United looking likely to provide much relief from an otherwise gruelling schedule. After the twin disappointments the previous weekend of losing at home to Brighton and then witnessing Spurs put five goals past Newcastle, Spurs’ desperate performance against the Seagulls in the Saturday lunchtime match should really have been all the encouragement Arsenal needed.They had to put some colour back into the cheeks of an increasingly exasperated fanbase against a Southampton team coming off the back of a confidence-sapping 6-0 home defeat by Chelsea. But sometimes it just feels as though Arsenal gotta Arsenal. A first-half goal from Jan Bednarek was enough to put Southampton in the lead but, a series of excellent saves from Fraser Forster notwithstanding, these were three more points thrown away by a team that is supposed to be showing its Champions League credentials. For the third match in a row, all against teams that should theoretically have little to play for in the league, Arsenal misfired. The costs of this are entirely tangible; maximum points from Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton would have put them a point ahead of Chelsea and into third place.  Arsenal will have to overturn a bad run of form against mediocre opposition to improve against stronger opposition if they’re going to get their season back on track. This isn’t impossible. It’s not difficult to imagine us all sitting here in three weeks with the (highly volatile) barometer of opinion concerning Arteta having swung back towards adoration again. But it’s not going to be easy either. And it’s the sort of test that Arteta needs to come through if he’s to be the coach he presumably wants to be. Arsenal have played eight matches against teams from the top seven this season and won just two of them: at home against West Ham and Spurs. When we consider that Spurs were plumbing the depths of their brief dalliance with Nuno Espirito Santo at the time in September, it’s not exactly a run against the stronger teams which suggest they’ll be picking up anything like full points from these forthcoming fixtures. And they matter to the manager, too. Arteta has been in charge of Arsenal since December 2019 and progress since then has come in fits and starts. He ended his first half-season with an FA Cup and then picked up a Community Shield the following August, but since then the silverware has dried up and the team seems no closer to a Champions League return than before. Both of his seasons have ended with Arsenal in eighth place.  His contract expires in the summer of 2023 but the overall lack of improvement makes it entirely plausible that he could be gone before his contract comes up for renewal. Eddie Howe remains the bookmakers’ favourite to replace him, yet considering that the odds given against this happening are 9/2 and that the second favourite is Thierry Henry, it seems reasonable to conclude that no-one really knows exactly what does happen next at Arsenal should Arteta be relieved of his duties. While Chelsea are getting ready for new owners, Manchester City are preparing for the next phase of their domination of the galaxy and Manchester United are selecting yet another stooge for the poisoned chalice-shaped managerial hot seat at Old Trafford, Arsenal remain trapped in a state of inertia. It says something when your team captain is giving interviews to the press about how he’d love to be playing in the Champions League again and telling the media that he is in “discussions with a lot of clubs”. It says something else when the club’s supporters read these reports and shrug their shoulders at the prospect of him leaving on a free transfer when he becomes a free agent on July 1. Since the departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Barcelona in January, Alexandre Lacazette has been the team’s main attacking focus. Small wonder Arsenal’s two highest goalscorers – with ten each in all competitions – are Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, both of whom are attacking midfielders. But should Lacazette leave during the summer, more questions are raised. Do Arsenal actually have somebody lined up to replace him as centre-forward or captain? Because they certainly didn’t have one for Aubameyang and he was also… the centre-forward and captain. Chelsea v Arsenal is always important, but this one matters for reasons beyond mere London rivalry. A win ties Arsenal with Spurs again – albeit below them on goal difference, unless they can rattle in 11 goals at Stamford Bridge – with the two teams still to meet at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in their penultimate match. For Arsenal as a club, a return to the Champions League is likely the first big step towards getting back to where they believe they should be. Defeat at Stamford Bridge would make that considerably more difficult. And for Arteta, it might even mean the difference between having a job in the summer and not. ",positive,liverpool,0,31,25
14,https://www.football365.com/news/mediawatch-liverpool-4-manchester-united-0-rangnick-lindelof-war,Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United: The Mediawatch,"Victor Lindelof was a solid 6/10, Roy Keane will be recovering from his emotional rollercoaster and Paul Pogba’s Manchester United end nears. To the Victor go the spoils Player ratings are a harmlessly fun part of the match reaction fabric that will endure long after the robots take over and that is fine. After all, they always offer some weird takes from people tasked with watching and marking at least 22 different players. Joshua Jones was assigned that duty byThe Sunand his Manchester United grades are suitably scathing at times – 2/10 for Bruno Fernandes – but also weirdly kind. Like this on Victor Lindelof’s performance in a defence that shipped four goals: ‘Was just about the only man in pale blue willing to put a foot in and go through with a heavy challenge. ‘Yes, he gave a few fouls away but at least he was showing signs of passion.’ Fouls: one. Tackles: zero. Rating: 6/10. Definitely sounds like he was their best starter.  16 Conclusions: Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United (9-0 agg)  War (What is it good for?) David Maddock writes about ‘the faraway stare of the shellshocked trenchman’ of Manchester United, who were stunned by ‘the noise from the big guns of the Kop’. He adds that ‘they had been tortured – and that is the correct word – by the sound of small explosions at every turn, all around them’. ‘To continue the war analogy which it surely must have felt like, they were outflanked by a superior general with modern methods.’ After a brief break in which the Daily Mirror writer decided not to write about a football game as if it was a deadly conflict at a time when events around the world make that ill-advised at the very least, Maddock picks up the baton in his penultimate paragraph: ‘Diaz was substituted on 70 minutes. It was to rest him for further battles ahead, but it felt as though Jurgen Klopp had taken pity on his old friend. They had taken enough torture, they could stand no more explosions.’ And we can’t stand any more of that nonsense – and that is the correct word. One line is vaguely forgivable but didn’t everyone quietly, subconsciously and understandably decide that war analogies really don’t belong in football match reports any more, if indeed they ever did?  Rang up ‘United have arguably grown worse under his management than they were under his predecessor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’ – Ian Ladyman, Daily Mail. They were awful and Ralf Rangnick’s appointment has been a failure but do we really have to pretend that Leicester 4-2 Manchester United didn’t happen? Or Watford 4-1 Manchester United? Or Manchester United 0-2 Manchester City? They have more points per game this season under Rangnick than they did under Solskjaer. This wasn’t even Manchester United’s heaviest defeat to Liverpool this season. Remind us again who was manager when they were hammered 5-0 at home by the same team in October?  Silence is golden What happens when no Manchester United player breaks their silence on social media just hours after the game? The MailOnline thankfully have the answer: ‘Nothing to say? Humiliated Man United players (and their PR teams) stay SILENT on social media after Liverpool shocker – resisting the usual ‘vanilla’ platitudes after another inexcusable performance’ The lesson here: there is always a story. And it generally involves scouring Twitter and Instagram. And when the word count of that story needs to be padded out, just copy and paste the messages some players posted after beating Norwich. Excuse the choice of words, but it does feel a little bit like they can’t win. Of course ‘there has not been a peep from any of the players’ and obviously they ‘did not hesitate to celebrate’ after other games. Perhaps they need a bit more time ‘to emerge from their cloud of shame’ and give a more considered response that will allow you have your cake of mocking their social media output and eat it by sticking it top of your website whether they do or not.  Keane learner The defeat sent Roy Keane on an emotional rollercoaster, if Giacomo Pisa of The Sun website is to be believed. His opening paragraph details how Keane unsurprisingly ‘fumed’ at the defeat. No surprises there. But as early as the third paragraph, we are told that the Sky Sports pundit ‘duly tore into’ his former side, only for it to immediately be revealed that ‘an exasperated Keane admitted he now just felt “sadness” at the continued shocking run of form, rather than anger.’ By the 14th paragraph, ‘his sadness turned to anger as he fumed’. Three paragraphs later, Keane was again ‘upset’. And three more paragraphs after that, he ‘seethed’ in his assessment. The poor bloke is confused. Or someone just needs to find more ways of introducing a quote.  The end is nigh ‘It is the beginning of the end for Paul Pogba at Manchester United after latest collision with Jose Mourinho’ – Neil Custis, The Sun, September 25, 2018. ‘Paul Pogba’s Man Utd career is OVER with player and club both desperate to move him on from Old Trafford’ – Neil Custis, The Sun, January 3, 2020. ‘Paul Pogba’s Manchester United career is over. Despite suggestions that a peace deal is being made, both sides want a splitting of the ways’ – Neil Custis,The Sun, March 19, 2020. ‘Man Utd chiefs want Paul Pogba OUT of the club in January transfer after Mino Raiola’s latest outburst’ – Neil Custis, The Sun, December 10, 2020. ‘That could be the end for Paul Pogba at Man Utd after Liverpool, he was a big name, on big money and big disappointment’ – Neil Custis, The Sun, April 20, 2022. From ‘the beginning of the end’ to ‘could be the end’ in 1,303 incredibly short days. What a journey. See you on November 13, 2025 for what presumably ‘might be the end for Paul Pogba at Manchester United’.  Ask a simple question… ‘Are they the worst side to ever challenge for theChampions League?’ – David Maddock, Daily Mirror. ‘No’ – Mediawatch. ",positive,liverpool,4,24,22
15,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-tuchel-tactics-fine-chelsea-standards-abramovich,Tactics Tom taking advantage of Chelsea’s sliding standards,"Thomas Tuchel could finish a distant third with the FA Cup and Chelsea, who once sacked a Double winner for coming second, will be grateful. On May 22, 2011, after a season-ending 1-0 reverse at Everton, Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay took Carlo Ancelotti aside in a Goodison Park corridor to deliver the news. Despite winning the club their first ever league and cup Double the previous campaign, scoring a record number of goals in the process, Ancelotti’s time had expired. He was sacked on the spot, less than an hour after the final whistle. Referring to the decision a couple of weeks later, Gourlay said that “last year was a difficult year for us – it’s fair to say our performances and results didn’t meet the expectations of the football club.” They finished second. In another era, ‘Tactics’ Tommy Tuchel may well be keeping one eye on the job market, his agent scouting flats in Madrid or Milan. With their title challenge over by Christmas, a quarter-final European exit at the hands of Ancelotti himself and only the quaint old triviality of the FA Cup still to play for, it is difficult to imagine this season’s achievements being well-received by the soon-to-be previous owner. They may well have won the World Series or whatever, and last season’s frankly ridiculous resurrection from feckless rabble to European champions may well have got him credit in the bank, but this is Roman Abramovich we are talking about. Somewhat ironically, credit in the bank is not really his thing. Just ask *insert name here*. Correction: this was Abramovich. We are, obviously, in another era now – or at the very least, between them. And while we can’t speculate on the recruitment practices of unknown prospective owners, we can offer our own appraisal of Tommy ‘Tactics’ Tuchel as he trundles towards the close of his first full season in charge.  The feeling, from most corners, is that we don’t need one. All round, his has been a decent job done well. In the trying circumstances – by some standards – of the forced sale of the club, Tommy Tuchel’s Tactics have seen the Blues stay comfortably clear of the quagmire of superclubs currently splashing about in the battle to be better than West Ham. They are the third-best side in the country by some distance, and ‘Tactics’ Tuchel Tommy’s record of reaching every final bar one is really quite staggering. A pat on that puffa-jacketed back of his. Arguably his most impressive feat to date, however, has been in making Chelsea (almost) likeable. Their squad is exciting, brimming with young English talent, and while much of it was blooded by mockney meme-generator Frank Lampard, the maturation of Mason Mount, Reece James and Trevoh Chalobah owes much to the German’s astute guidance. Most surprisingly of all given the reputation he arrived with, Tuchel Tommy ‘Tactics’ himself has even proven to be likeable. Yes, his moaning about fixture congestion is enough to make you spit out your Bovril, but you’d be hard-pushed to remember a European manager of a top Premier League club who hasn’t had a good old whinge about it. On the whole, he has shown humility and grace, especially in his markedly human responses to questions about Ukraine and the links between his club and their invaders. A far cry from the prickly, pugnacious diva we were led to believe he was. Thomas Tuchel on Arsenal, Spurs & Man Utd having advantage in Premier League by playing few games in Europe and cup competitions than #Chelsea: ""They were given an advantage I think. A huge advantage. But it always depends what you make of your situation."" [via @TeleFootball] — Absolute Chelsea (@AbsoluteChelsea) April 19, 2022  This stuff matters. This is the Premier League 4.0: the access-all-areas, multi-platform, Amazon Prime version, custom-designed to be digestible via TikTok. And while so much is made of what this has done to its players, turning proper lager-swilling blokes into preening prima donnas, it has altered the parameters for the manager too. He is now a personality. The cult of the manager is nothing new, but the sheer facetime he gives the media and the scrutiny that this part of the role attracts means the successful modern manager needs a brand. Not just a playing philosophy, but one that encompasses his way of speaking, acting, looking. What he does must be unequivocally his, as it is partly this that drives the media narrative, the social media narrative, the fan narrative. This is what got Everton fans so hot under the collar that they daubed Lampard’s name on the Goodison walls; these are the fingernails by which Ole Gunnar Solskjaer clung on so long at Manchester United. Eventually, results catch up, but in the meantime, “he speaks well” will paper over a lot. You only need look at our maniacal obsession with managerial unveilings to see as much. Events at which the new incumbent says precisely four-fifths of f*ck all, yet which are pored over like witness testimony. TTT is one who speaks well. And just as well really, because there are cracks that need covering. Chelsea’s fightback at the Bernabeu was ballsybut their defending at the Bridge was dismal and their attack in the biggest games this season has been blunt, scoring only three in five against the two runaway leaders. And while lagging so far behind such super-specimens as Liverpool and Manchester City can be deemed excusable, the oft-touted line about their ludicrous exploits meaning that what used to be perfectly viable points tallies are now consigned to mediocrity simply doesn’t hold here. With this number of points at this stage of the past 20 seasons, Chelsea would only be top of the table in one of them: 2014/15, when they won it anyway, with a higher tally at this juncture. In nine of those seasons, they would be third. Fourth, back in the anarchic, everyone-beating-everyone wastes of 2001/02. With the current uncertainty over the ownership situation, it is impossible to tell what success and failure look like for Chelsea. Every boardroom’s barometer reads different, and there is no guarantee that Boehly, Broughton or whoever might step into Abramovich’s moccasins will hold such ruthlessly high standards. Yet when this season’’ returns are allied to a wage bill that eclipses both Manchester City and Liverpool, with a far more expensive squad than the latter, and the failure to integrate the supposed ‘missing piece’ in Romelu Lukakau, things begin to look just a little middling for T-cubed. Fine, I guess, essentially. Perhaps this is simply where he, and they, are: a very good side with a very good manager, a force in the cups and occasionally unplayable, but consigned to the old Arsenal role of Champions League perennials for as long as Pep and Klopp are kicking around at the pinnacle. Unless things change next term, we will soon find out if this is enough. ",positive,liverpool,2,30,28
16,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-john-nicholson-feeling-sorry-manchester-united-ruthless-liverpool,"Sympathy for Utd, the 13-year-old to Liverpool’s ruthless Owen","Liverpool dispatched Manchester United with the calm of a Premier League team easing through the FA Cup third round. And it was kind of sad. Some say football is all about winning. On one shallow level, they’re right, but there is little joy in winning when the odds are so massively in your favour. Winning has little or no value when one side is so much better than the other. And anyway, football is not all about winning, even when teams are fairly matched. It is about so much more. If you’re going to the game, it is always a fully visceral experience. The journey, the weather, the anticipation, the colours and smells. Few of us forget our first night game because it is such a vivid experience pretty much unlike anything else you can do in life. Even if you’re watching at home, there is still the ongoing psychodrama to plug into. You get to see the details of the game which are impossible to spot from the terraces. However, again, if a match is too one-sided and there is no jeopardy, it can quickly become an exhibition rather than a competition. And that’s what the Liverpool v Manchester United game was like on Tuesday night: a 4-0 win that could’ve been nine or 10. While rivalry between fans doesn’t allow for sympathy for the other side’s plight, as a neutral, I felt sorry for United and that shouldn’t happen. It was a humiliating game. A game not fit to lace the boots of some of their epic clashes in the past. It felt like one of those cup games where a third-tier side takes to the field of a top-flight club, wondering if maybe luck will go their way, then a goal goes in after a few minutes and the remainder of the game is spent being beaten to a sorry pulp by a much superior team. There is no joy in that at all. 16 Conclusions: Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United (9-0 agg) Liverpool put on an exhibition of wonderful football, as they often do, and while accepting that football consistently makes fools of us all, it is hard not to think that this team is a legend in the making. However, so bereft of the basic skills and motivations were Manchester United, it was like watching a panther sprint past a tortoise in a 100 metre race. There was something wrong about it. Something ill at ease about the mismatch. It shouldn’t be like this. Manchester United have lost by four goals in previous seasons, but the very nature of the defeat was the disturbing thing. There was almost a cognitive dissonance seeing Harry Maguire – who has played really well for England, let’s make no mistake about that – lumbering around in the fashion of a drunk tourist having a kickabout on the beach. How can they be so bad? Yes, Liverpool are magnificent and absolutely thrilling to watch, but even after five minutes it almost felt like a boxing match that should be stopped before someone gets really hurt. There is nothing worse in football than people feeling sorry for you. And you couldn’t help but feel sorry for United. Their players’ lack of understanding, positioning, shape, energy, thought, skill and commitment was so overwhelming; it was sad to see. They were being cruelly exposed in front of many thousands of people and, like the small boy in the playground taking a kicking off the bigger boys, just had to let it happen to them. While it is easy to laugh at United the club for being run so badly that this sort of humiliation became inevitable, it is another to laugh at the hapless players. They’re only human. You know that video where Michael Owen keeps celebrating every time he scores against a 13-year-old boy? Well there was a touch of that about this game. Something cruel, almost unpleasant, so much so that the heartwarming, seemingly unanimous support for Cristiano Ronaldo after seven minutes was, as applause rippled around Anfield, rather moving and in contrast to the horror show that unfolded on the pitch.

17,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-16-conclusions-liverpool-manchester-united-klopp-maguire-mane-salah,16 Conclusions: Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United (9-0 agg),"This should be the line in the sand for Manchester United but that has been said countless times. Liverpool absolutely humiliated them. 1) To be honest, drawing 16 Conclusions on that has the same vibe as a throwaway piece of five things we learned during a club’s latest training session. For Liverpool, that really was a stroll around the cones. Their opponents were utterly embarrassing, from Alisson’s fourth minute Cruyff turn on Bruno Fernandes, to Martin Atkinson sticking a fork in Manchester United as a response to Diogo Dalot almost completing the mirror image of October’s decimation with an own goal. Never before has a team been so thoroughly, regularly and publicly deconstructed to the sporadic glee of the baying masses. Mo Salah casually saying “they make our life easier in the midfield and in the back” after the game was crushing analysis of the single most comfortably one-sided season in this rivalry’s history.  2) It was after a chastening 4-0 defeat on Merseyside that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer once declared of his players, “some of them won’t be here next year,” following a performance “not worthy of a Man United team”. That thrashing at Everton was on April 21 of 2019. Almost exactly three years later, David de Gea, Victor Lindelof, Phil Jones, Dalot, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Marcus Rashford all reprised their starting roles for a display that was even worse. That XI being warned over their immediate futures and seven not only still being at the club but playing in such a prominent game so long after is a nonsensical equivalent to children continuing to misbehave because they do not fear the consequences of the guardian punished for their misbehaviour, nor the step-parent they know won’t be there long. A line has to be drawn. The expiration of certain contracts dictates a level of churn but at least four of those that started against Liverpool must be moved on as soon as possible; history cannot be allowed to repeat itself.  3) This might also signal the end of Ralf Rangnick’s loosely defined contribution to Manchester United beyond his interim reign. The lack of clarity regarding his consultancy role has been bizarre and while there have been some bright sparks since his appointment, the general sense is that the club finally appointed a director of football but in entirely the wrong position. The German’s lack of coaching experience at any level since 2011, barring a pair of interim spells at an RB Leipzig side whose very structure he helped establish, has eventually told. The misconceptions surrounding a three-man central defence are entrenched. Some believe it naturally shores up the backline but it can actually further weaken it, adding just another combustible element to an incendiary unit. Harry Maguire and Lindelof as a partnership is a known quantity, so adding Jones to that equation was always a gamble. Rangnick admitted before the game it was essentially a toss-up between the 30-year-old and Eric Bailly, which hardly imbued a confidence that the system was being deployed to suit the players. It was undermined within five minutes when Dalot left his post, Maguire tried to simultaneously fill the 30 yards of space behind him and stifle Sadio Mane, and Jones and Lindelof both tried to catch Luis Diaz in an offside trap that was designed for the wrong forward. The subsequent 85 minutes hardly reflected much kinder on any of them Gareth Southgate was perhaps the biggest winner from the game. He deserves a little more respect for devising and using such an effective three-man defence with Maguire at its heart, because this made it look impossible.  4) The damning contrast came 10 minutes later. A rare Manchester United turnover, not forced but gifted by Trent Alexander-Arnold complacency, offered a glimpse of a counter-attack. The pass needed to be sharp, crisp and quick, which is precisely how Matic delivered it. Yet Jesse Lingard barely had a chance to contemplate his signature before Virgil van Dijk stepped up, made an interception on the halfway line and immediately resuscitated Liverpool’s move. The difference between an £80m defender exposed by the failings of a formation destined to highlight his limitations and a £75m centre-half elevated by a system designed to accentuate his strengths was stark. Maguire pressed high then backed off the emerging embers; Van Dijk acted instinctively to extinguish the flames before they could breathe. It bears repeating that these two players were ostensibly cut from the same cloth, excelling enough in mid-table to suggest they could rise to the challenge of an elite platform. Van Dijk is twice the player he was at Southampton and Maguire currently half of his previous Leicester self, being generous. But then Liverpool signed their catalyst because they had identified him as the leading candidate for a specific role; Manchester United bought theirs because they saw the two best clubs in the country do it and thought they had stumbled upon an expensive secret to transform a defence. They copied the answer of ‘Spend loads on a centre-half’ but without the substantial working-out that Liverpool and Manchester City put in before them, it is little wonder they still struggle to understand it.  5) The second goal was irresistible brilliance, a build-up featuring Joel Matip and Luis Diaz building to a crescendo of Mane’s sublime lofted pass around the corner into Salah’s path. The Egyptian finished well but he was shown a sizeable portion of the net by De Gea, whose presence was ultimately hollow throughout. He so often manages to make the target look bigger with his positioning and anticipation, which seemed non-existent for the first two strikes. De Gea remained stationed in his six-yard box for both, despite them coming from scintillating breaks that could perhaps have been swept up by an enterprising keeper. Alisson handily proved that point with some impressive bursts off his line to suffocate first-half attacks before they properly took shape. Even De Gea’s distribution was a problem and his inexplicably long attempt at a switch out to Dalot played a part in the first goal. He makes some spectacular saves but there is a gulf in quality and contribution between him and the best players in his position – although he is good enough to ensure Manchester United’s short-term priorities lie elsewhere.  6) One common thread pulled the two goals together: the false nine play of Mane. Even more specifically, the reaction to it. In both instances, the Senegalese dropped deep and into the space between a watchless defence and a hapless midfield, both fickle enough to consider it a no man’s land of responsibility, far enough away from goal to pose no threat. Yet Anfield might as well have started celebrating then. Mane had not even taken a touch when receiving those first-time passes from Jordan Henderson and Matip respectively when Salah – accompanied by Alexander-Arnold for the opener – had broken into a full sprint and left Diogo Dalot in a world of man-marking pain. The first half was a showcase for a Liverpool team which knew the next three passes and best alternatives ahead of time, and a damning indictment of a Manchester United side which was playing and thinking on a laggy connection. Those two goals were the epitome of phenomenal proaction against delayed reaction.  7) A nod to the game director, who followed the second goal by cutting to a shot of Sir Alex Ferguson looking miserable in the crowd and Sir Kenny Dalglish grinning indiscriminately. It has become a customary scene in recent games between these two sides but that does nothing to dilute its inherent charm. And this time it was sandwiching the lingering image of Manchester United fan in an almost parodic pose: head in hand before stroking his face in disbelief. It was a gripping and fitting remix of a modern classic. On the plus side, United remain absolutely top of the league for memes pic.twitter.com/CTw4UVu0JO — Tom Williams (@tomwfootball) April 19, 2022   8) Mane fulfilling the Roberto Firmino role to such an exceptional standard is not normal. It is testament to his malleable magnificence but also Jurgen Klopp’s coaching, with this the latest stage of his redevelopment of a generational forward line. With Mane’s mantle handed to Luis Diaz, the Senegalese was converted into the enduring link between midfield and attack, dumbfounding Manchester United with his movement and incisive link-up play. The pass for the first goal was made to look routine. For the second, it was service as good as any playmaker could provide. Mane’s next action was to shepherd an overhit cross and heavy Aaron Wan-Bissaka touch out for a throw-in as makeshift left-back. And the wherewithal to stop his run to offer a pull-back option before his first-time finish for the third, precisely when Liverpool most needed it, was laughable. Manchester United were indefensible but Mane was undefendable.  9) The biggest controversy of the game came in the 33rd minute. There was an audible shout from the crowd which either emanated from a Liverpool supporter or a Manchester United fan. A full-scale investigation can hopefully be launched into whether someone was revelling in the fun by yelling “Maguire, you’re a sh*thouse,” or pleading for the captain to “sort your sh*t out”. There was worse to come. Maguire can justifiably feel incredibly hard done by at times, judged to an unremittingly ludicrous degree beyond a price tag he did not set and an armband he never demanded. His every action is scrutinised and decontextualised and agendas are set for and against a player neither as good as his fans claim, nor nearly as bad as his detractors protest. A prime example of him being set up to fall came with his comments in the build-up, when he was thrown no bone by Sky Sports in being asked whether stopping the Quadruple was part of Manchester United’s motivation for the game. Maguire was hounded for replying in the negative but had he said that it was an influential factor then he would have been annihilated for having a small-time mentality. With that said, the interviewer’s question did not compare to the hospital ball Maguire gave substitute Hannibal Mejbri ahead of the fourth goal. Switching the ball high and about ten yards behind the teenager wide on the right, Maguire watched Robertson make the tackle, then stepped up to initiate a trap Elmer Fudd would have grimaced at as Salah ran through to score. He should be dropped. There is a solid defender in there and nothing to suggest he has no long-term future at Old Trafford, but neither the captaincy nor a fee paid three years ago should safeguard places in any vaguely functional meritocracy. If Phil Jones can make his second Premier League start since January 2020 against this opponent at this ground, then there are enough options to let Maguire sit out at least a couple of weeks, even if only as a performative show of egalitarianism.  10) The last two goals were a fun reminder of old Liverpool. It is not as though they have ever stopped counter-pressing and scoring through quick transitions but the sheer speed and precision with which they leapt into action was like the swashbuckling attacks of a few years ago. Luis Diaz assisted Mane to score within ten seconds of Robertson snaffling Lindelof’s pass into Anthony Elanga; six seconds passed between the Scot dispossessing Mejbri and playing in Diogo Jota to find Salah. Liverpool saw a wounded animal and took full advantage.  11) It brought to mind to Jose Mourinho’s last game as Manchester United manager, the 3-1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield after which he heavily praised Robertson. The left-back was “absolutely incredible” then and remains peerless now as the chief tormentor of a beaten, battered and bruised foe. Imagine already being physically knackered, emotionally drained and professionally inept, only to see a Scottish bloke still rampaging down the wing and not giving you a moment to think on the ball. It must be a right pain in the arse.  12) If there was one positive for Manchester United to glean then it was the performance of half-time substitute Jadon Sancho. He alone could not drag an acceptable collective display from the visitors – it should be said that Lingard was relatively bright from the bench, too – but there was flashes. The former Borussia Dortmund forward had the best of their two shots, was not afraid to actually carry the ball and showed some impetus. An assist should have been forthcoming but Rashford’s recent travails continued when put through just after the hour. Rangnick has, to his credit, rehabilitated Sancho from his early season struggles. The next manager must build an attack around the 22-year-old. Sancho has been immense — ً (@TheFergusonWay) April 19, 2022   13) Salah assisting Luis Diaz, who assisted Mane, who assisted Salah, is lovely. The fabled Liverpool front three that centred around Firmino never managed that particular feat of all scoring goals set up by one of the others in a single game. It is quite remarkable, considering their longevity and success, that this front line achieved it first instead. The way the back-up options of Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri have been quietly upgraded is astonishing.  14) Manchester United followed their 20 minutes of competence at the start of the second half up with a customary descent into harmful petulance in the closing stages. They committed six fouls all game, two of which came in the last minute plus stoppage-time. Both were awarded yellow cards, Fernandes for leaving one on Alexander-Arnold and Mejbri after going in late on Henderson. The latter would probably have been sent off in ordinary circumstances when he clattered Naby Keita moments later but Atkinson resisted pouring salt into the wound. Those tackles were welcomed in some quarters as an actual show of heart and passion, ofsomethinginstead of the nothingness that had preceded it. In actuality they were precisely the same examples of cowardice, cynicism and after-the-fact bitterness that best emphasise a beaten team’s inferiority. It didn’t prove that those players cared about anything other than their perception.  15) Thiago is something else. Keep him fit and that trophy polish might find good use.  16) Liverpool’s starting XI cost £340.3m. Their three substitutes cost an additional £93.75m. They had the most expensive goalkeeper and forwards. Two of their players cost nothing in terms of a fee – and while a talent the level of Alexander-Arnold cannot reliably be produced internally, Joel Matip will go down in the books as one of the great free transfers. Manchester United’s starting XI cost £398.45m. Their three substitutes cost an additional £73m. They had the most expensive centre-half, two costliest full-backs and the priciest central midfielder. Four of their players cost nothing in terms of a fee and the other 10 were varying degrees of worthless themselves. The cost in assembling these two sets of players was similar but that is where the resemblance ends. Klopp signed 11 of Liverpool’s, inherited Henderson from Dalglish, James Milner from Brendan Rodgers and Alexander-Arnold from the academy. Rangnick signed none of Manchester United’s, inherited four each from Solskjaer, Mourinho and the academy and two from Ferguson. One screams focus, planning and forethought. The other is dripping in chaos, randomness and disorder. It could take two or three transfer windows to fix. It could take four or five. It could take 10 or 20. This is not an exact science and Rangnick stating post-match that Liverpool “are six years ahead of us” seemed fanciful. It is futile to speculate on the time required to complete the work when the restructure needed does not seem forthcoming. Manchester United need to accept their endemic failings before even considering how to close the gap. And if this result proved anything to them, it’s that throwing money on top of budgets on top of war chests on top of investments is not the answer. A cheaper Liverpool just summarily dismantled the most expensively assembled squad in football history thanks to a decade of FSG groundwork built on by seven years of almost perfect management from Klopp and those around him. It will take more than a decent summer to compete with that. ",positive,liverpool,17,36,27

The 25-year-old came through the ranks at Spanish side Real Betis. He played 50 times for them in La Liga between 2015 and 2018. After an impressive season in 2017/18, Napoli paid his€30m release clause to bring him to Serie A. Top ten January transfer decisions that are already paying off The centre-midfielder has been a key player for Napoli over the past four seasons. He has played over 150 times across all competitions. His form for Napoli enabled him to make his debut for Spain in 2019. He has been capped 15 times since then. Ruiz has been linked with a move to the Premier League in recent months.He is out of contract in 2023. Italian outletTuttoMercatoWeb (via Sport Witness) are reporting that Arsenal are among ‘a lot of clubs’ interested in him. Barcelona and Real Madrid are also named as admirers of Ruiz. If he does not commit his future to Napoli, they may be forced to sell him this summer in a cut-price deal. It is stated that the player’s ‘future is up for auction’. Elsewhere, Ian Wright claims Premier League rivals will target Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhaes after his “mistake” in their 2-1 win against Wolves. The Gunners had looked on course to lose ground on the sides above them. But ultimately ran out victorious as Jose Sa palmed an Alexandre Lacazette effort into his own net. For Wolves’ goal, Gabriel – scorer of the only goal as Arsenal won at Molineux earlier this month – gifted possession to Hwang and he nipped in ahead of Aaron Ramsdale to finish. Wright said: “If you’re all of those teams (who play Arsenal next) you’ll still be feeling you can have a go. “They’ll look at Gabriel today with that mistake… you know you have to target him simply because he’s got that in him. You want to put him under that kind of pressure. To see if he’s going to make that kind of mistake. “There are that teams are going to press Arsenal high and try to take the chances and put them under pressure early. If they do that then we’ll have to see if Arsenal have the character to keep coming back from it.” ",positive,liverpool,0,29,23

The Mapies have already completed the signings of BrunoGuimaraes, Chris Wood andKieran Trippier in the January transfer window, and have other irons in the fire on deadline day, but failed in an ambitious move for Osimhen and Ruiz. READ MORE: F365’s January transfer deadline day – and it’s LIVE! That’s according to journalist Paulo Bargiggia, who told CalcioNapoli24 Newcastle were prepared to spend a huge amount of money on the duo, as perSport Witness. He said:“Napoli received offers from Newcastle for the two jewels Osimhen and Fabian Ruiz, around 40 million for the Spaniard; they could have reached even 100 for the former Lille. “Napoli turned them down and, the players themselves, were not convinced by the destination. “The club has to renew the contract of Fabian Ruiz, who, at the moment, is one of the best in the squad and earns 1.5 million. “My feeling is that if important clubs like Real Madrid show up, it will be hard to keep the player and match certain offers.” Newcastle have also consistently been linked with a loan move for Jesse Lingard, who is said to be holding deadline day talks with Ralf Rangnick to force through a move from Old Trafford. Negotiations between the two clubs were halted after Man Utd ‘wanted Lingard’s salary covered, a £2.5 million loan fee and £12 million if Newcastle avoid relegation’. The report adds that Newcastle are optimistic that a deal could still happen asthey believe ‘there may be some flexibility on those numbers’. Speaking last week, Dimitar Berbatov admitted he hopes Lingard and Donny van de Beek can get a fresh start: “I’m sad to see Anthony Martial leave United. But in a way I’m happy for him because he needed to go and he needs to play more minutes. “Hopefully he will get that with Sevilla and he can show his full arsenal of quality in the Spanish league. “Jesse Lingard also needs to go and find more game time. I was surprised that he didn’t stay at West Ham and they didn’t find a solution because he did so well there and I don’t know why he’s choosing to stay at United if he’s not going to play. “If United aren’t going to play him. Then I don’t understand why there are any problems with him leaving the club. “He’s still under 30, so he has enough time to play and enjoy football but just sitting on the bench at United, it’s obvious he isn’t going to play, I cannot accept that.” ",positive,liverpool,0,32,23

Mikel Arteta is now waiting for an update on his search for a midfielder… Arteta is said to be keen to bring Arthur Melo to the Emirates from Juventus on loan until the end of the season. The 25-year-old is on the fringes of Juve’s first XI but Max Allegri is only willing to sanction his exit if the club can source a replacement. Which is where Chelsea come in. Football Italia cites several sources in Italy that claim Juve are interested in signing Ruben Loftus-Cheek from Chelsea to bolster their ranks. Arsenal’s deal with Arthur is said to have already been agreed, the Gunners are now waiting for the green light from Juve. The Gunners are also reported by Goal to have held preliminary talks with Youri Tielemans’ representatives but Leicester are refusing to sell their record signing this month.  MAN UTD IN RACE FOR LIVERPOOL TARGET Manchester United are also in the market for a midfielder, although they don’t appear to be in quite the same hurry to strengthen their engine room this month. The Daily Mail says United have targets in mind for the summer and if they become available this month, they will make a move. Otherwise, they may sit tight until the end of the season. One of those targets may be Fabian Ruiz. The Napoli midfielder has been heavily linked with Liverpool in the past but La Repubblica reckons the Red Devils are now well placed to swoop. Apparently, Napoli will allow the Spain international to leave if they can secure a deal for Sassuolo’s Davide Frattesi.  UNITED TARGET SEAGULLS STAR United are also being linked with a move for Tariq Lamptey. The Brighton wing-back has recently returned from an extended spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury and Lamptey is said to have caught Ralf Rangnick’s eye. According to the Daily Mail, the United boss is looking for an upgrade on his current right-back options, with neither Aaraon Wan-Bissaka or Diogo Dalot impressing the German. Or anyone else. The story goes that United value Lamptey in the region of £30million, while Brighton are looking for £40million, which certainly doesn’t seem an unreasonable price. Tottenham have also been keen on Lamptey but Sky Sports says Spurs have shelved their interest for now while they pursue Adama Traore. If Dalot leaves United, AS says Atletico Madrid are interested as they look for a replacement for Kieran Trippier. ",negative,liverpool,2,32,22

Klopp was keen on the Napoli star last summer but Covid prevented the Reds boss from splurging on a midfielder. Next summer, though, Liverpool will move for Spain international. That’s the word according to Fichajes at least. Barcelona and Real Madrid have also been linked with Ruiz but the Spanish clubs have other concerns right now.  MAN UTD INTERESTED IN DE JONG One of Barca’s more immediate priorities is to raise some funds through sales, which they hoped to do by shifting Philippe Coutinho to Man Utd. Or anywhere. But El Nacional says United aren’t interested in Coutinho – why would they be? However, they might be willing to talk about Frenkie De Jong. Manchester City were heavily linked with De Jong recently, with reports of a done deal, which were subsequently denied by the Premier League champions.  Vintage Barclays as Villa prevail in wild Midlands derby  SPURS JOIN DEMBELE RACE Barca could be waving off Ousmane Dembele, but as things stand, they won’t get any money back for the France attacker if he leaves at the end of his contract next summer. So Barca have two choices: convince Dembele to re-sign; or sell him next month. Sport says the club have given Dembele’s representatives until the end of the year to let them know if he will renew his terms. Otherwise they will take him to the winter market. Where they might find Tottenham waiting to do a deal. Mundo Deportivo reckons Spurs have joined Newcastle and Man Utd in monitoring Dembele’s situation.  DEPAY COULD BE ON HIS WAY Memphis Depay may only have recently arrived at Barca but he will be in the same boat as Dembele this time next year having only agreed to a two-year contract at the Nou Camp. He could, though, look to make a quicker getaway. El Nacional says Depay is worried about his prospects with Ronald Koeman having been replaced by Xavi while they continue to be linked with a number of attacking stars.  JUVE EYE CAVANI AND ICARDI One of the stories that seems to have put Depay’s nose out of joint is Barca’s interest in Edinson Cavani. It was reported last week that Cavani is keen to move to the Nou Camp next summer, but there is interest from elsewhere in the Man Utd striker. Tuttosport says Juventus are looking at Cavani and PSG forward Mauro Icardi as alternatives to Fiorentina star Dusan Vlahovic. ",positive,liverpool,4,33,22
22,https://www.football365.com/news/transfer-gossip-haaland-sterling-manchester-city-kane-eriksen-reunion-spurs,"Gossip: Haaland, Sterling updates; Kane and Eriksen reunion","Man City have a free run at Erling Haaland and should keep Raheem Sterling. Harry Kane may get a reunion, albeit not with Mauricio Pochettino. HAALAND CATTLE There has been some clear and obvious development behind the scenes in terms of Erling Haaland’s future. A group of suitors that once contained Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and Barcelona was whittled down to Manchester City and Real Madrid not long ago. The former has now pulled well ahead in a move with significant ramifications. The widespread belief is that Haaland has chosen Manchester City over Real Madrid, whose consolation prize of Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer should appease those weirdos at El Chiringuito. Manchester City’s wage offer is thought to be in excess of £400,000 and slightly higher than what Real Madrid have put on the table. The Daily Telegraph echo the suggestion that Haaland’s £63m release clause will be activated when the transfer window opens. They ‘will listen to offers for players currently out on loan or on the fringes of the squad to balance their books,’ which are equivalent to a library when you consider the signing-on bonus and agent fees involved when dealing with Mino Raiola.  FLIRTY HARRY One of the move’s knock-on effects will centre around Harry Kane, who Tottenham are now optimistic of keeping. Considering how tightly they clutched last summer, their renewed hope of retaining a happier and more settled player is hardly surprising. The situation could still depend on Champions League qualification but Manchester City’s decision to focus on Haaland and Manchester United’s call to overlook Mauricio Pochettino as manager has strengthened Tottenham’s position and Kane’s contentedness in north London. More signings that can match the quality of Dejan Kulusevski, Cristian Romero and Rodrigo Bentancur would further help persuade Kane to stay. Christian Eriksen and Youri Tielemans are the two targets named by The Times, Tottenham having ‘been monitoring’ both. Eriksen has no commitments to Brentford or any club beyond this summer, with the short-term contract he signed in January containing no clauses for renewal. The Bees can only hope he shows loyalty to the side that offered him the chance to return. And Tielemans will enter the final year of his Leicester deal at the end of this season so is satisfied to farm interest for now.  TOO SEXY FOR MILAN The biannual speculation surrounding Raheem Sterling’s future took a twist recently when it was claimed that AC Milan, in the grips of a potential billion-pound takeover, would pursue the forward as one of their high-profile acquisitions. Such stories usually emerge when Sterling is out of the Manchester City rotation and the clubs involved generally emanate from Spain, where the 27-year-old has at least previously professed to wanting to play at some point. So the AC Milan links, coming with Sterling very much in Pep Guardiola’s current time, were curious. His Etihad contract does expire in summer 2023 and so the rumours are not completely without basis but the Daily Mirror say player and club ‘are in a very good place’ in terms of their relationship and Sterling ‘will not be distracted’. In fact, his focus is fixed so firmly on the remainder of the season that provided he is playing regularly enough, helping deliver the Premier League and Champions League titles are his absolute priority. With no contact having actually been made between Sterling and Milan, it looks like a no-go. ",positive,liverpool,0,33,26

Skipp has been unavailable since January as he is dealing with a groin injury. Conte is unsure when the midfielder will return. Sessegnon meanwhile picked up another hamstring injury earlier this week during Tottenham’s 5-0 win against Everton. Why Poch f***ing it at PSG is great news for Spurs fans Spurs are light in midfield and Skipp’s continued absence is a concern for Conte ahead of Saturday’s crunch visit to Manchester United. “For sure I am a bit worried,” Conte said. “He started with a groin pain. And then now, we are talking about two months, two months and a half, that he is out. “I don’t have so many midfielders. There is (Rodrigo) Bentancur and (Pierre-Emile) Hojbjerg and (Harry) Winks. “To miss Skipp for a lot of time is not simple and I have to hope also not to have injuries for our midfielders. Bentancur has had a problem. And to have only two midfielders, you have to hope also to finish the game without injuries. “For sure this is a problem. I am a bit worried, in my mind, the mind of the player [Skipp] is there was the desire to come back very soon, as soon as possible. “But in this moment, if you ask me for a forecast about his return with the team, I don’t have an answer. “For this reason I am really worried, we are talking about a player who was playing very well. We need to have another midfielder with his type of characteristic.” Sessegnon’s time at Spurs has been blighted by hamstring injuries and the latest comes at a time when he was enjoying his first consistent run in the team. Conte says they need to find a way to manage his problems. “We are not talking about a new problem, we are talking about a situation that unfortunately is repeating,” he said. “Not only in this season but also in the past. For sure we have to try with the medical department to find a solution to help this player. “But sometimes also there is a predisposition to have this type of problem. And especially muscular problems. He’s very strong physically. “Sometimes maybe to be so strong physically, instead of being good for your body, sometimes it can be a problem. “For sure we are very disappointed, we hope to find the best solution to help him not have many injuries. We are hoping, as for one month and a half he was playing with continuity – his performances were good, excellent, he was improving. “I understand, I have seen the disappointment of the player, he is very frustrated. This is the aspect I worry about. He’s very young. “To see a player like him frustrated about these injuries, is a pity, and also we have to work with him in the human aspect, to stay very close to him and support him.” ",positive,liverpool,0,31,24
24,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-spurs-dier-skipp-most-important-crazy?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Spurs’ most vital players are Skipp and Dier and that’s crazy,"Spurs being pretty terrible is no great surprise, but the identity of their two most important players certainly is. Some breaking news for you here, and you might want to sit down before I shock you with the sheer heat of this take: Spurs are not very good at the moment. I know, I know. A lot to take in. Give yourselves a moment to process, and then carry on reading. Or don’t; it’s up to you really. Done that? Good. Right, so Spurs are not very good. After a nine-game unbeaten Premier League run culminating in that injury-time absurdity at Leicester, they have lost three league games in a row and that – and I’m very sorry to have to shock you again so soon – is soon going to be four in a row after this weekend’s trip to Manchester City. Maybe the Bergwijn Incident was just too mad and the universe is now punishing Spurs with defeats to make up for the one they dodged that silly night. Like Final Destination, but for football. Final Score Destination, if you will. What these last couple of games have also confirmed, and this is probably madder than anything Steven Bergwijn did at Leicester, is that Spurs’ two most important players are Oliver Skipp and Eric Dier, and by quite a long way.  The Dier renaissance this season has been quite something, starting under Nuno and continuing (less surprisingly) under Conte. Since the Italian took charge, Spurs have conceded six goals in nine games with Dier in the side and seven in three games without him. But Skipp’s paramount importance to this Spurs team is even more stark and more staggering. A player who had started only three Premier League games for Spurs before this season and spent last season on loan – albeit enormously successfully – in the Championship has now become the single most important footballer at a club that is, despite itself, still technically in contention for a top-four finish. The raw stats are startling. In the 14 league games Skipp has started this season, Spurs have won 10, drawn one and lost three. In the other eight games, they have won only once and lost five times. Leeds, if you were wondering, are the team who should be instantly relegated for the shame of such defeat. The last two games – both home games against opponents Spurs would reasonably expect to beat – have produced a pair of truly terrible performances and entirely deserved defeats. They are also the only two league games of the season where Spurs have been without both Dier and Skipp. Both players deserve huge credit for the improvements they have made and the development of their game. It seems a long, long, long time ago now that we genuinely thought Harry Winks might be more of a Conte midfielder than Skipp. But it’s also ludicrous that these two players have become so thoroughly integral to Tottenham. The ease with which both Southampton and a Wolves side not famed for its attacking thrust were able to play through a Skipp-less midfield before tormenting a Dier-less defence was staggering. Both teams played well and deserved their success, but surely couldn’t quite believe how easy Spurs made it for them. With Skipp in particular, things have now reached the stage where Conte has to rethink his whole strategy if he is unavailable. That’s a staggering situation. But the evidence of the eyes and the results tell you that Spurs simply cannot play Conte’s 3-4-3 without Skipp. They’re still arguably better off with a 3-5-2 even when he is there, but without him, Spurs and Conte now have no choice but to stiffen the middle of the park at the expense of Lucas Moura’s occasionally deadly but frequently meandering forward runs. Simply looking at results with or without certain players is clearly simplistic and reductive; Spurs have been pretty dreadful at times with both Skipp and Dier, and one of their best all-round performances of a perplexing season – the 2-2 draw against Liverpool – saw the midfield battle at least reasonably well contested without Skipp. But the overall numbers and certainly the last couple of games have made an inescapable argument. Never has that old chestnut about being a better player when you’re out of the side appeared more true. Spurs’ midfield was missing in action against both Southampton and Wolves despite various permutations of Winks, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur being deployed. The one constant was the absence of Skipp. The defending was an error-strewn calamity that matched the very worst of Jose Mourinho’s time, despite the welcome return of the demonstrably excellent Cristian Romero. Again, the significant element in whether Spurs look competent or chaotic defensively has been the presence or absence of Dier. Spurs are a deeply confusing team right now, and there is really no clearer marker of that than the fact the rest of their season depends primarily not on their world-class manager or striker getting back to their best but how quickly they can get Dier and Skipp back in the side. For the purity of those baffling yet strangely pleasing stats, let’s hope it’s not until after this weekend. ",positive,liverpool,1,32,22
