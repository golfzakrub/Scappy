Losing 3-0 to Liverpool, their hopes of winning the FA Cup and a historic treble were up in smoke as the Reds' dreams of an unprecedented quadruple remained on course. And yet by full-time, the feeling that City could still yet end the season with bragging rights over their greatest on-field rivals remained, with hope regained after second-half fightback that almost saw them come all the way back and force extra-time. Saturday's 3-2 defeat was still painful, but given the week City have had, this was the game they will feel most comfortable in having lost. They remain a point clear at the top of the Premier League table after last weekend's 2-2 draw with Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium, while they are into the semi-finals of the Champions League after coming through Wednesday's bruising encounter with Atletico Madrid. City certainly felt the effects of that goalless draw at the Wanda Metropolitano against Liverpool, with Guardiola making seven changes to his line up at Wembley, with injured duo Kyle Walker and Kevin De Bruyne among those who missed out, even if the latter did manage to make the bench. Liverpool, on the other hand, were at pretty much full strength after resting a host of star names in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Benfica. The difference in preparation, even if the teams had the same amount of time between games, showed, particularly in the first half. City were sluggish and second best, outrun and outmanoeuvred by a rival that looked hungrier to win. The third goal of that first half can be forgiven. That was Liverpool at their best, with Thiago Alcantara and Trent Alexander-Arnold combining brilliantly for Sadio Mane to smash in a near-post volley. What cannot be forgotten so easily, though, is that City had already given up two of the weakest goals they will concede all season against their deadliest rivals. Ibrahima Konate won a simple header to put Liverpool into a ninth-minute lead, while goalkeeper Zack Steffen was caught horribly and embarrassingly, delaying a clearance that allowed Mane to slide the ball in from a tackle. Steffen's error summed up the doziness of City's performance, which is not a word usually associated with the Premier League champions. ""It was a difficult fixture because we came from somewhere like only we know where we came from, with games we had and the last five or six days days away and people with the problems,"" Guardiola said post-match. ""The guys put in a lot of pride in the second half. ""Our momentum was there in the second half. We had the chances to equalise."" There can be no resting now for City, with two games a week guaranteed until the end of the season. These two teams may have finished their scheduled matches against each other for now, but their rivalry will continue right until the end of the season, while there remains the distinct possibility of another meeting in the Champions League final in Paris. City could potentially need to win every game between now and then if they are to end the season with two trophies, but they would be the two trophies they crave more than any others. Almost all with connections to the club would have taken winning the Premier League and Champions League while Liverpool swept the domestic cups before the season began, and that very much remains in City's grasp. They may not have beaten Liverpool in any of their meetings so far this season, but that would mean little if Guardiola's team can get the job done in the two competitions they remain in entering the final month of the season. Ensuring that happens starts on Wednesday with a home clash against in-form Brighton, with City knowing they could kick off with Liverpool ahead of them in top spot if Jurgen Klopp's team beat Manchester United 24 hours earlier. After three games without a win, it is imperative City shrug off the first half at Wembley and get back on the horse against Graham Potter's side. Anything less could leave them up against it, but right now they may have lost the battle against Liverpool, but they remain on course to claim victory in the season's fight for ultimate supremacy.

Selling Crystal Palace captain could be Chelsea's latest transfer regret","Marc Guehi was asked ahead of Crystal Palace’s FA Cup semi-final date with Chelsea whether or not he was one of the best defenders in the Premier League. ""I’d say I am extremely far away,” he replied in the pre-match press conference. “I am nowhere near.” That humble approach to his development is just one reason Chelsea might end up with regrets about selling the centre-back last summer. ""It was the right answer,"" Palace coach Patrick Vieira said, causing the press room to laugh. ""He has the potential. That answer really tells you what kind of person he is. ""Yes, some people say these things but he really means it. You just have to look at him working every day in training by focusing on the details. He wants to be a better player. ""He has a massive chance to succeed because he is really prepared to work hard to improve himself. This is the type of player with huge potential and performing well [that we want to sign]. ""The interactions we have from him as staff are positive because he is prepared to do extra after training to try and improve. That makes our job easier."" Even nowadays, many Blues fans struggle to fathom how their club could have sold Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Romelu Lukaku only for them to go onto become stars of the European game. All three took a step back to smaller clubs from the Blues, before going on to huge achievements at other elite clubs. In the case of De Bruyne and Salah, they never returned to Chelsea, while Lukaku would come back for a club-record £100 million ($136m) fee after winning a Scudetto with Inter. Like Guehi, those three players all had a humble, hard-working approach. His answer about being miles away from the top was something his manager liked to hear, but he does believe he will get there some day. The 21-year-old defender is showing signs of superstar trajectory after his move to Selhurst Park for just £18 million ($24m). He has made more starts than any other player under Vieira (35), helping them to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, where he will face his former club on Sunday. ""It wasn't an easy decision for me to leave Chelsea,"" Guehi told GOAL on international duty earlier this season having been called up by England for the first time. ""For any young player that is really important, getting game time, that was all that mattered to me,” he said ahead of this weekend's match. “The decision to leave Chelsea and come to Palace was the right one, to get that game time and show what I can do."" He has since taken the armband to become the youngest captain in the Premier League and the youngest at his club in a decade. And with 30 league games under his belt already, Guehi is the third-youngest defender in the top five European leagues to reach that number this season. Those statistics are unmatched by any other young English central defender. Guehi has shot up Gareth Southgate's pecking order, having graduated from the England's Under-21s, and is now above AC Milan's Fikayo Tomori, another Cobham academy graduate. It might be easy to overlook the Ivorian-born defender when you are singling out players for praise. He is not aggressive; instead he goes about his duties with a steely determination and class. You get the sense that he is always in control, using his well-renowned intelligence and speed rather than relying only on his strength to win duels. He is also an excellent ball-playing defender, capable of starting attacks, and he can chip in with goals from set-pieces too. Of course, this is not news to those who have been watching him closely at youth level. His pedigree has always been that of a thoroughbred defender. Southgate on Marc Guehi: ""Marc has had a really consistent season. We've been really impressed with him on and off the ball, in the biggest games, he has been very calm. We know him well from our jnr teams as a World Cup winner."" #ThreeLions #Eng Honed at both Cobham and St George's Park, he has been with England since the U15s and scored in the final while winning the U17 World Cup with Steve Cooper's England side. Shortly after, he would win the treble with the U18s at Chelsea in an exceptional season before making his first-team debut under Frank Lampard in 2019. Having now left the Blues, it looks like a mistake for the club to have lost him so cheaply. Guehi is already worth far more than the sum he was sold for. Chelsea have a sell-on clause, to earn more from any potential future sale, and have matching rights attached to his contract from 2023. It means should a club bid for Guehi from next season, Chelsea will have the right to match that offer. Like Lukaku, there is a pathway back for the homegrown star to return, but the Blues might feel a tinge of instant regret, with central defence as their primary problem position for the upcoming transfer market. Andreas Christesen is set to leave for Barcelona and there is continued uncertainty over the futures of both Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta. When asked by GOAL, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel gave his view about the sale of Guehi. “It is a decision we took together and are happy about these decisions,"" Tuchel said at Cobham. ""You cannot go back and reflect at this point. ""When we took the decisions it was the right thing to do given the circumstances. For Marc Guehi, it is a fantastic development. It is impossible now to say if we kept him he would have been better, been worse or been the same. ""Maybe he needed that (to leave). Maybe he needed the change of environment, a different club, a different role, more minutes to develop your full potential. ""It just tells you over and over again that if you trust younger players and have a role for them, they can on a very regular level match expectations and even over perform. “It’s nice to see so many Chelsea players out there in every league. We are well aware of it. It is nice to play against them and see them develop.” Whether Tuchel feels the same on Sunday evening remains to be seen.

2,https://www.goal.com/en/news/maxwell-zlatan-slept-on-my-floor-messi-surpass-trophy-record/blt9295e218dc345dd5,'Messi will break Dani Alves' record' - Ex-Barcelona ace Maxwell talks trophies and 'Uncle Zlatan' sleeping on his floor,"When fans think of the most decorated players in football history, the usual names tend to come to mind: Dani Alves, Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta. Maxwell, though, is often overlooked. The Brazilian was a multi-talented left-back in his playing days, but he also had a nice habit of being in the right place at the right time, as underlined by the fact that he played for Inter, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain during the most successful period of each club's history. All in all, he won 37 trophies across a glittering career, making him the most decorated footballer all of time – until, of course, his title was taken by his former Blaugrana and Brazil team-mate Alves. Of course, both Iniesta and Messi subsequently drew level with Maxwell's tally themselves before the Argentine pulled one clear by racking up his 38th title at club and international level by leading his country to victory at last summer's Copa America. With the attacker having since joined PSG, who are currently running away with Ligue 1, Maxwell now believes that Messi, 34, is likely to end up with even more silverware than the 38-year-old Alves. ""He has every chance of breaking the record,"" Maxwell tells GOAL. ""Playing at PSG, he has a great team around him and the possibility to win many more trophies. ""Even now, with Dani in Barcelona, Messi has longer to go in his career. We never know how long Dani can go because he keeps pushing himself, but Messi is younger."" Maxwell, who is now UEFA's Head of Football Development, also explained that he was not in the least bit upset when Alves took his place in the record books. ""I was working at PSG [as sporting director] when Dani did it,"" he reveals. ""We hugged each other and he said ‘I am sorry.’ I replied 'No, you deserve it and now you need to go further and further!' ""So, I was really happy that he did it."" Maxwell's humility helps explain why he was considered such an excellent team-mate, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic once describing him as both ""a teddy bear"" and ""the best guy in the world"". Such sweet compliments may come as a surprise, given the Swede is more renowned for praising himself, albeit often with tongue planted firmly in cheek. However, Ibrahimovic considers himself forever in debt to Maxwell, who gave him somewhere to sleep when he was just starting out at Ajax. ""He never stops talking to me about this situation even today,"" he says, laughing. ""He mentioned that he was without money for some time and he needed some support. ""My house was there but I had only one room, so he had to stay on the floor. But Zlatan was a very humble person and didn’t mind. “We were young, just 18 or 19 and completely alone in Amsterdam. He came from Sweden, I came from Brazil. ""I learned my English with and through him, so much so, in fact, that my daughter says I speak exactly like uncle Zlatan!"" These memories make Maxwell smile today, but he also uses them in his new role at UEFA to remind players that the life of an aspiring football is a long way removed from the glitz and glamour that comes with being a global superstar. ""I have been in the football world from five or six years of age,"" he says. ""I lived insecure times in Brazil and the beginning in Holland. ""Not all players end up having elite careers. It is an uncertain period. Everyone has the dream, drive and ambition, but there is still no guarantee that you will succeed. ""I think it is a big responsibility for me and UEFA to show the players that they must get educated and prepare themselves in different ways for the future."" Maxwell, of course, was fortunate he made it to the top, and shared many of his best moments alongside his good friend Ibrahimovic. Indeed, the pair played together at four different clubs, including PSG, whom they helped on their way to becoming one of the biggest clubs in the world. Given the amount of titles he ended up winning, he could have easily just walked away from football, content with his lot. However, Maxwell says he felt compelled to give something back to a game that treated him so well. ""I don't think it is enough to just retire as a 'former player' anymore; there's a life after football,"" he argues. ""Like me, elite former players can do the UEFA Executive Master for International Players (UEFA MIP). It opened my eyes to football giving a 360-degree view of the industry. ""We work for both boys and girls, promoting UEFA's values on inclusion. We work on elite youth development, grassroots football and the UEFA Youth League, which is now the most prestigious youth tournament. ""We've seen 800 players or so go into the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. ""Mason Mount and Andreas Christensen at Chelsea have managed to win both the Youth League and Champions League. Munir El Haddidi has got the Youth League and Europa League titles. ""We analyse all UEFA competition matches so we know the trends in football and can continue to adapt our programmes as the game develops."" For Maxwell, then, his final trophy tally isn't that important to him. It doesn't matter how many players end up surpassing him. ""I really don’t care about these things,"" he adds. ""I had my past and lived a great life in football. I knew players and had these great relationships with team-mates and what happened on the pitch was a blessing. ""I am not a guy who looks to be known or famous. The new generation can be famous now."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Liverpool boss had almost reached the tunnel. He was heading for the dressing room, smiling and waving. Happy as Larry. But then, with a swivel of the hips and a turn of pace Sadio Mane or Mohamed Salah would have been proud of, he was off. The cameras struggled to keep up with him as he charged towards the fans behind the goal. They loved it. Out came the fist pumps. One, two, three. A beat of the Liver Bird upon his chest, one, two, three. That is what this win meant. The FA Cup may not be what it once was, but it can still get the blood pumping and the heart racing. It is still a competition to cherish and enjoy, whatever anyone says. Klopp waited until he got to the tunnel and then...#LFC 🔴 pic.twitter.com/WNOKaL9QZN Liverpool’s quadruple dream is still alive while Manchester City’s treble quest is over. It is the Reds who will return for next month’s final against either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, after a 3-2 win that was as deserved and well-received as it was nervy come the final minutes. You could not have gotten a cigarette paper between the sides at the Etihad Stadium last week, or at Anfield in October for that matter, but the third instalment went Liverpool’s way, thanks to a first-half blitz from Klopp’s side. Ibrahima Konate headed them in front early, the centre-back’s third goal in as many games, before Mane took them into dreamland before half time. The Senegal star struck twice, and though City inevitably, and impressively, rallied after the break, jangling Liverpudlian nerves through Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva goals, it was they who were left on the floor at the final whistle. How significant a result this will prove to be in the context of the rest of the season, only time will tell, but it feels like a big blow landed from the Red corner. City may have restored some pride in the second half, but all of a sudden it is their squad which looks the weaker of the two, heading into the final weeks of the campaign. Liverpool had the game’s star men. Konate justified his selection alongside Virgil van Dijk at the back, Thiago Alcantara ran things in midfield and Luis Diaz was a constant menace against Joao Cancelo. It was Mane, though, who proved decisive, and it was no surprise when, shortly before Bernardo had made it 3-2 in the first minute of stoppage time, it was the Senegal star who was named by the stadium announcer as the Player of the Match. Starting in the middle of Liverpool’s front three, the 30-year-old, who scored the all-important leveller in last weekend’s Premier League draw, was a threat from the word go. Backed up ably by Diaz and Salah, and a midfield which functioned far better and with far more purpose than it did six days ago, Mane pressed City early and pressed them hard. And for once, Guardiola’s side could not cope. Liverpool already led courtesy of Konate’s ninth-minute header when a ball was played back to Zack Steffen, City’s stand-in goalkeeper. The United States international had time, but he wanted too much of it. Mane, smelling blood, closed in. As Steffen went to clear, Mane slid in and got his tackle just right, the ball ricocheting into the net and leaving City’s fans, and their players, shellshocked. Mané 𝙥𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙨 ⚡️#EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/IKGpGAApkn Two up inside 19 minutes, Liverpool were purring, and before half-time they were partying, Mane adding another with a beautifully-controlled, and perfectly-placed, volley from Thiago’s astute pass. Some finish, some player. His threat continued after the break, even though City had an instant lifeline when Grealish lashed in from Gabriel Jesus’ pass. Guardiola’s side had chances, but twice Alisson denied Jesus. At the other end, Liverpool were wasteful with good positions, and seemed to enter conservation mode after the hour mark. Not Mane, mind. He was everywhere, a ball of energy. He tangled with Cancelo, took a blow from Fernandinho and gave one back. A booking each, said referee Michael Oliver. No backward step from the Liverpool man. Time and again, his control and strength got his side up the field. Time and again, City struggled to deal with it. When he made way for Roberto Firmino, five minutes from time, he got a standing ovation. He deserved it. City still had time to make a routine finish a tense one, Bernardo smashing in from substitute Riyad Mahrez’s cross. Fernandinho, Mahrez and Raheem Sterling all had sights of an equaliser in stoppage time, as did Salah and Firmino, but in the end it finished 3-2. The noise when the final whistle came would have been heard all the way in Anfield, for sure. Klopp and Guardiola embraced again, their mutual respect undamaged. They may well meet again in May’s Champions League final in Paris, of course. That is for another day, though. That can wait. Today belonged to Liverpool, and to Mane.

Despite his reputation, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner rarely scores from free-kicks, so when his 25-yard drive flew into the Norwich City goal to seal his second hat-trick in successive home league appearances, the roof came off Old Trafford. His treble sealed a crucial 3-2 win for the Red Devils, which in turn stopped their season from entering total meltdown - at least for now. United’s supporters had made themselves clear ahead of kick off who they believe the problem is at the club. Thousands protested against the club’s ownership outside Old Trafford, but those behind the march - who took the decision to boycott the first 17 minutes of the game in a representation of the 17 years of Glazers ownership - made it clear that this is not just about the owners anymore. There have been so many abject performances this term that the fans’ have turned their anger towards the club's underperforming players. A statement from an anonymous fan group associated with the protest said, ""it's long past time for these obscene-wage thieves to deliver so, as with the Glazers, they need to get out of the club.” #MUFC fans out to protest against the Glazer ownership. pic.twitter.com/AbEP9G5BAK Historically, many United fans would argue they never turn on the players, but with bottom-of-the-table Norwich holding them at 2-2 midway through the second half, things changed. Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford, with a chorus of ‘F*ck off Pogba’ following from some of those sat in the Stretford End. That came only three minutes after ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ was aired from those sitting in the same seats. There are many in this United team who the fans could have been aiming that chant at, but Ronaldo is not one of them. Another three goals takes him to 21 goals in all competitions this season, as he reached the 20-goal mark for the 16th consecutive season. For all the criticism that has come Ronaldo's way this season, he showed yet again that he can be this team's saviour, rather than their problem. He is a seasoned goalscorer who has been able to bail out his team-mates time and time again, even after another performance that was strewn with defensive mistakes. The FIFTIETH hat-trick of Cristiano Ronaldo's club career 🤯 pic.twitter.com/RSVhWPOsrX There will be more questions asked of Ralf Rangnick's side after they managed to squander a two-goal lead against the team who sit rooted to the bottom of the table, as Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki netted for the Canaries either side of half time after Ronaldo's opening double. The players were pointing the finger of blame at each other, but none will be directed towards Ronaldo this time around. With Tottenham having lost at home to Brighton earlier in the afternoon and Arsenal losing their third Premier League game on the bounce away at Southampton while United were winning, the Red Devils look like the cat with nine lives when it comes to a top-four finish. With six games left to play and now just three points behind Spurs in fourth, they could not save their Champions League skin again, could they? Anfield awaits on Tuesday, in a game that will provide plenty of answers. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

5,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-season-breaking-point-southampton-champions-league-dream-/blt3386195bf47a70e5,No way back? Arsenal's season at breaking point after Southampton leave Champions League dream in tatters,"Match statistics: Southampton 1-0 Arsenal Just when you thought it could not get any worse… After two successive defeats in the Premier League, Arsenal arrived at Southampton on Saturday in what appeared to be the last chance saloon in terms of the race for the top four. But Tottenham’s surprise defeat at home to Brighton in the lunchtime kick-off suddenly saw the door for possible Champions League qualification swing back open again for Mikel Arteta’s side. With games now running out, it was a chance they simply had to take. But instead they fluffed their lines - again. There was perhaps a slight improvement on the performances against Crystal Palace and Brighton, but this is an Arsenal side that now looks devoid of quality and ideas. They dominated possession at St Mary’s, but could not find a way back after Jan Bednarek had given the hosts the lead on the stroke of half-time. They had their chances, with Southampton keeper Fraser Forster making a string of saves, including two incredible stops to deny Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe. But with so much on the line and with Spurs having slipped up, this just was not good enough from Arsenal. This was their chance to get back in the mix, but instead they slipped further into disarray. Arteta’s side have now lost four of their last five Premier League games and have scored just two goals in the process. They have capitulated at the business end of the season and could end up missing out on qualification for the Europa League if they do not turn things around quickly. They have now slipped to sixth in the table, with Manchester United moving above them following their win against Norwich. They could even end the weekend in seventh, if West Ham beat Burnley on Sunday. It has been a nightmare few weeks for Arteta’s side and they now face games against Chelsea and United in the next seven days. They must win at least one of those to keep any hopes they may still have alive - but on current evidence that looks extremely unlikely. After the debacle against Brighton last weekend, Arteta brought Nuno Tavares back into the side at left-back and restored Granit Xhaka to the midfield. It was a change that brought about a much more assured performance from Arsenal, but they still lacked any sort of cutting edge in the final third. Arsenal lose three points to Southampton 😬 pic.twitter.com/FAdY4OOcuh With Alexandre Lacazette missing due to Covid, Eddie Nketiah got a rare start as the central striker and some good play from him helped set up a golden chance for Saka midway through the first half. Arsenal’s top scorer looked certain to score after being found by Gabriel Martinelli, but somehow Forster threw out an arm and pushed the England international’s shot over from point blank range. That became a familiar theme, with Forster providing an impenetrable barrier for Arsenal. After Bednarek had given the hosts a lead to protect just before half-time, Forster did superbly to keep out Smith Rowe and Xhaka, while Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli sent efforts wide when well placed. The sight of an Arsenal player standing with his head in his hands in front of goal is now becoming an all too familiar theme. By the time the full-time whistle had blown at St Mary’s, the visitors had fired in 23 efforts in goal, 19 of which came in the second half. But as has been the way for much of the season, they were unable to convert those chances into goals. A lack of firepower always looked like it might undo Arsenal’s hopes this season, especially when they let Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave in January without bringing in a replacement. And that is how things are now turning out. At the point of the season when you have to take your chances, Arsenal have been found wanting. They have scored just once in their last three games, and even that came from a deflection. From their last 73 attempts on goal, Arsenal have scored just twice. That is simply not good enough and it has left them with a mountain to climb during the final weeks of the campaign. A season that promised so much is now in danger of total collapse, and on this evidence Arteta appears unable to avert to slide. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Belgian returned to Stamford Bridge at the start of the campaign fresh from Serie A success with Inter, but has mostly failed to live up to his reputation despite a bright start. Lukaku is not the first Chelsea attacker to misfire after purchase however, and Tuchel has pointed to Germany international Werner - another who has struggled to make his mark at points - as a reference he can use to improve his game. ""What Timo has done is exactly what [Lukaku] needs to do,"" Tuchel stated. ""Wait, be patient, work hard and put the team first, be ready to help the team, because as a striker you can help within seconds. “Now [Werner] has made it difficult to leave him out. I’m impressed, he was very, very good in the last two games. These were two games when he was much better than in any other game and he showed what he is capable of. Everybody thinks we as managers do the line-up, and of course we do. “But in the end the players take care that you don’t leave them out, they do it in training or in games, and of course in games it’s the opportunity for everybody."" On the occasions where the Belgian has been offered pathways back into the starting XI with regularity this term, he has struggled to seize the chance, despite his success in the FIFA Club World Cup. But Tuchel observes that form can change like the wind, adding: ""Especially for strikers, things can be turned around in minutes, in moments. Whole careers can be upside down and in any direction but always as a striker you can have a chance to put things into your favour. ""He did in the last two games and that’s what we want from him. It’s what he needs to show and then he takes care that he plays."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The midfielder has struggled to leave his mark this term, first under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Ralf Rangnick, with the World Cup winner previously tipped to leave the Red Devils on a free transfer in the summer. Reports that United have tabled an offer of an extension that would make him their highest-paid player in recent weeks, however, have stoked ire among parts of the club's fanbase, who were quick to voice their displeasure after he exited the pitch following his performance against the Canaries. Having started in midfield for United as they welcomed rock-bottom Norwich to Old Trafford, Pogba had been relatively anonymous between Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard. The Frenchman had failed to supply any key touches throughout a first half that saw the hosts blaze into a two-goal lead through Cristiano Ronaldo, before Kieran Dowell had hooked home a response on the stroke of half-time, followed by a Teemu Pukki equaliser after the break. A failure to impose much on the game subsequently led to the choice by Rangnick to hook him for Marcus Rashford - and as Pogba departed the pitch, clutches of Red Devils fans could be heard to chant obscenities at the playmaker as he left the action, before Ronaldo rode to the rescue with a matchwinner for his latest hat-trick in United colours. Boos for Pogba as he is replaced by Rashford. Some in the Stretford End chanting 'f*** off Pogba.' Speaking after the full-time whistle, Rangnick admitted that he did not hear the criticism aimed at his star as he left the field - but while he acknowledged supporters have a right to be irritated, they should not singe out targets. ""I didn't hear it myself but I was informed after the game,"" the German stated. ""I can fully understand the fans are frustrated, so are we, but I don't think they should take on individual players. I don't think that is right or correct."" Speculation over the future of the former Juventus player - a superstar in the making when he returned to Manchester United and with a reputation only enhanced by his part in Les Bleus' World Cup victory at Russia 2018 - has been a major topic at Old Trafford this term. With a deal that expires at the end of the season, questions had been asked whether the midfielder would leave on a free transfer following a second spell at Old Trafford that, after an initial burst of silverware under Jose Mourinho, has failed to live up to expectation, and seen him become something of a regular scapegoat alongside skipper Harry Maguire. But the reports suggesting an increased deal to keep him at the Theatre of Dreams seem to have been met with wide disdain, and may well have contributed to the vitriolic response directed his way during Saturday's game.

A double for Sadio Mane, coupled with Ibrahima Konate's header, ensured a three-goal lead at the break for Jurgen Klopp's side under the north London sunshine, setting up what looked to be a comfortable cruise to the final whistle at first glance. But a quickfire response after the interval from Jack Grealish, coupled with Bernardo Silva's injury-time strike, set up a frantic finale as Pep Guardiola's side came up just shy against their Premier League title rivals in a thrilling encounter. With Premier League, Champions League, League Cup and FIFA Club World Cup successes all assembled since Klopp took the reins at Anfield in 2015, the Reds have not been lacking for silverware under the German. But the FA Cup is the one major honour that has eluded them during that period, with Liverpool unable to even reach the final at Wembley during their manager's first six seasons in charge, extending a barren run back to a 2012 loss to Chelsea under Sir Kenny Dalglish. Now, however, the Merseyside outfit can dream of a first triumph in football's oldest knockout competition since 2006, when Rafa Benítez's Reds beat West Ham on penalties after a thrilling 3-3 draw at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Wembley in FA Cup games is starting to become an unhappy hunting ground for Guardiola, despite his side's prior hold on the League Cup. 2 - Manchester City are only the second side to be eliminated from the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in three consecutive seasons, after Manchester United from 1963-64 to 1965-66. Unlucky. pic.twitter.com/oghnEP0zX6 While City racked up four successive triumphs in the latter competition before Liverpool deposed them as holders earlier this year, they have not been to the FA Cup final for three years now, since their only triumph in the tournament under the Spaniard against Watford. They have now suffered three consecutive exits at the semi-final stage, having lost to Chelsea last year and Arsenal the year before. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Palace, however, must make do without one of their best players this season, Conor Gallagher, much to the chagrin of head coach Patrick Vieira. ""He has played all the games so far,"" reflected the former Arsenal midfielder. ""And if there’s somebody who deserves to be in the semi-final, it’s him because of his performances, so I’m disappointed he won’t be able to play."" So what is the rule that prohibits Gallagher from playing on this occasion? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Gallagher is not permitted to play for Palace against Chelsea due to a clause in his loan agreement which does not allow him to take part in fixtures against his parent club. He had featured in the Eagles' previous FA Cup fixtures against Millwall, Hartlepool United, Stoke City and Everton. However, he will have to watch on from the stands as Vieira's side make a push for the final. Such clauses are common in football loan transfers and Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who has steered the Blues to Champions League glory, was adamant that he is not in the business of helping his opponents. Nevertheless, the German coach expressed understanding, noting that he said sorry to Gallagher. Conor Gallagher has caught Thomas Tuchel's attention 👀With plenty of competition at Chelsea, what's the next step? 🧐✍️ @NizaarKinsella ""I had the chance to speak to Conor, I could also see his frustration. We met some weeks ago, after the national break by coincidence. We ran into each other in a restaurant and we had a chat,"" Tuchel told reporters ahead of the semi-final. ""The subject came up, I apologised because I know how competitive he is and I like him a lot, I know his character very well and was a pleasure to have him here in pre-season. ""This is the way it is. We play to win the game and the rules were clear when we made the loan. ""I can totally understand Patrick Vieira and the disappointment of Conor but these are the rules when we did the loan and we don’t want to suffer from our rules.""  Competition Apps Goals Assists Premier League 27 8 2 FA Cup 4 0 2 Carabao Cup 1 0 0 Total 32 8 4  *Stats correct at time of writing on April 15, 2022 Gallagher has been practically ever-present for Crystal Palace in 2021-22, featuring in the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Prior to the semi-final against Chelsea, he had scored eight goals and provided two assists in the Premier League across 27 appearances in the competition. His work rate has been a particular asset for the Eagles and he notably broke a club record for distance covered in a single game when Palace drew 0-0 against Manchester City in March 2022. Chelsea and Crystal Palace play in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday April 17. The game will kick off at 4:30pm BST (11:30am ET).

The Bafana Bafana international set up Sherif, whose headed effort was fantastically parried away by Zniti from close range.The hosts did double their lead in the 23rd minute when Tau played a low cross for El Shahat and the Egypt international beat Zniti with a low shot from inside the visitors' box to make it 2-0 to Al Ahly.However, Mosimane's charges lost concentration in first-half stoppage time and they conceded as Mohamed Azrida fired past keeper Mohamed El Shenawy to make it 2-1 heading into the break.Mosimane introduced Hamdi Fathi prior to the start of the second half and the experienced central midfielder stamped his authority in midfield as Al Ahly looked to restore theirtwo-goal lead.Pressure mounted on Raja, who conceded another penalty afterMarouane Hadhoudi had committed a foul in the box and the defender was also sent off as the visitors were reduced to 10 players on the hour-mark.El Solia stepped up and he was denied by Zniti from the spot-kick, much to the dismay of Mosimane and his technical team. The hosts continues to attack as they looked to take advantage of their numerical superiority.However, Red Eagles were wasteful as Tau ballooned his effort over the crossbar with only Zniti to beat, before Taher Mohamed was brilliantly denied by the Raja goalkeeper in stoppage time and ultimately, Al Ahly won 2-1.The two teams will meet in the second-leg encounter in Morocco on April 23 with a spot in the semi-finals at stake.

""When you run out here yourself, it's awesome,"" Rothe told Sky Sport Germany following his impressive debut. ""[You get] goosebumps. [It is] indescribable.""

Leandro Trossard struck in the 90th minute to seal a major victory for Graham Potter's Seagulls over Antonio Conte's Champions League spot-chasing hosts. On the back of victory over the Gunners last time out, Brighton have now conquered both north London heavyweights in the space of a week - and they were fast to poke some fun at their achievement in the aftermath. Shortly after the full-time whistle had blown at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to confirm the Seagulls' deserved victory in an otherwise low-wattage encounter, the club's Twitter admin took to social media to celebrate the result. In a short tweet posted mere minutes after full-time, Brighton simply penned an effective four-word reference to their back-to-back successes over a pair of rivals from the capital.

The Gunners were vastly superior on a statistical level when compared to their hosts at St Mary's Stadium, particularly in the second half when they were chasing the game after Jan Bednarek's opener before the break, notching a 83 per cent possession figure and 19 shots. But they were unable to crack Saints open thanks to a stern performance from Ralph Hasenhuttl's side, and Arteta admitted that he found their defeat almost unthinkable after the full-time whistle. ""I'm very frustrated and disappointed because when you see what happened on the pitch, to concede and lose the football match I think it's very difficult scenario to imagine,"" Arteta told his post-match press conference. ""We tried to do everything that we could have done in the best possible way, I can not fault the attitude of the players. ""I think it's the opposite, the way they played as well but at the end of the day you have to put the ball in the net in the opponent's half and we didn't for various reasons."" One reason the Spaniard cited for his side's failure to come up on the right side of the result was Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster, who turned in one of his most impressive performances between the posts this season. ""Their keeper was exceptional,"" he added of the England international. ""The amount of situations that we created, we needed more quality to finish them off. ""[The players] are really down today and they are down because they cannot find the right answer - apart from what we can do better around the box - not to win that match."" Arsenal's top-four hopes have nosedived of late, with the Gunners sustaining three straight defeats to drop behind Tottenham and Manchester United. They do carry a game in hand, but Spurs boast a superior goal differential. So, the Southampton loss can be viewed as a potential death blow to their ambitions, particularly as Tottenham's loss earlier in the day had given them the perfect chance to improve their position.

The 30-year-old put up a man-of-the-match display with his brace sending the Reds into the final of the competition. Reflecting on the Senegal international’s showing, the German tactician showered praise on the former Southampton star, while admitting City’s Ederson would get some knocks for Mane’s first goal. “He played an incredible game, an absolutely incredible game,” Klopp told the club website. “He was the first player to start the press, so it was intense for him as well. The first goal he scored, I love it. “But I don't like too much that the goalie will get some criticism for it, but it's not about that because Zack can do what he wants in that situation, like Ederson did a week ago. “These kind of things happen, with Ali and all these things. If you want to play football, that can happen. “But the acceleration of Sadio, the desire to get there, it was really great. So this goal was great and the other one was obviously proper football until the final pass with the little chip and then the volley – it was a great goal.” The former Borussia Dortmund handler was also impressed with Mali prospect Ibrahima  Konate who was among the goalscorers after he was set up by Andrew Robertson. “Ibou scored now the third goal in his third start in a row, if I'm 100 percent right, which is very helpful as well,” he continued. “Set-pieces are very important, especially [when] teams are a little bit more focused on Virgil, so it's really important that the second target player can use that maybe. He did it now three times, it's really cool.” Asked whether Liverpool can end the 2021-22 campaign with four titles, he added: “You can mention whatever you want, but it doesn't make it more likely. “You won't get the answers you want from me. I think a game like today shows it even more how unlikely it is to do something like that.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The veteran manager left Elland Road earlier this year with the Whites embroiled in the thick of a relegation battle, and was subsequently replaced by former RB Leipzig boss Jesse Marsch. Bielsa's departure however prompted an outpouring of emotion in the West Yorkshire city he had called home since his arrival in 2018, when he took the reins and guided the club back to the Premier League - and now, supporters have sent a message to him via his hometown's biggest publication. A cohort of Whites fans were revealed to have paid for a full-page piece in La Capital, expressing their gratitude for Bielsa, who gained cult status during a three-and-a-half year tenure in charge of the club. Headlined THANK YOU MARCELO, it penned a glowing tribute of gratitude to the Argentine. ""You restored our pride, gave us joy and created precious memories that will last a lifetime,"" it read. ""And it was beautiful, Marcelo. And it will always be so beautiful. Thank you.""

18,https://www.goal.com/en/news/taye-taiwo-where-did-it-all-go-wrong/blte6c88e9d6982ff59,"Messi, Mikel, Taiwo: Why did Taye not realise his potential?","When the individual awards were being handed out after Argentina’s 2-1 win over Nigeria at the 2005 U-20 World Cup final, three players stood out: the diminutive Lionel Messi, gangly Mikel John Obi and Taye Taiwo. The South Americans owed their triumph to the mesmeric magician whose six-goal haul brought home the nation’s fourth success in six tournaments, while the disappointedpair on the losing side couldn’t record the West African country’s first win at the showpiece. Mikel, for his part, was probably the most talented of that iteration of the Flying Eaglets, with his artistry putting him above many in the squad. He came second behind Messi, and there was a peculiar choice for third-place. It’s often trite to place stereotypes on players of colour, but Taiwo was the emodiment of those 'classic African' qualities ofpace, strength and power. The left-back wasn’t just a bystander in Samson Siasia’s side; he indefatigably forayed forward, often contributing in making the side tick in the final third and balanced it with defensive astuteness. The stocky defender’s influence grew as the African side progressed in the competition, leading to his two strikes in the knockout stages. His first was a fortuitous cross-cum-shot with his weaker foot that won the game against Ukraine in the Round of 16, while the second, a typical powered effort, was the opener in the Eaglets’ comfortable 3-0 semi-final success over Morocco.  Furthermore, the confidence and composure to step up and dispatch both his penalties in the dramatic 10-9 shootout success over tournament hosts the Netherlands underlined his admirable self-belief and calmness. He was also involved in the move that ended with Chinedu Obasi’s finediving header to peg back Argentina in the decider. Taiwo was that side’s second highest scorer (Obasi netted three times) and seemed ready to take on the world, as Mikel and Messi would go on to do. Unsurprisingly, the defender’s showings at the biennial competition translated into increased game time at Olympique de Marseille in 2005/06. Having featured in only four Ligue 1 matches the year before, new boss Jean Fernandez made the Nigerian defender his primary left-back for the new season, resulting in 30 league matches. Appearances in the following campaigns were 37, 28, 35, 27 and 30 before his departure after the 2010/11 season. What made Taiwo’s time in France extra special was playing a major part in Les Olympiens’ return to the summit of Ligue 1 in 2010, ending an 18-year wait for the title. The left-back was largely backed as first-choice pick despite the managerial changes at the time – Fernandez, Albert Emon and Eric Gerets were at the helm between 2005 and 2009 before Didier Deschamps’ appointment under the late Senegalese president Pape Diouf.   Despite the 1998 World Cup-winning captain signing 10 players in the summer of 2009, Gabriel Heinze inclusive (who intermittently featured at left-back), the powerful Super Eagles star remained a vital cog of the side. He also featured for 90 minutes in Marseille’s 3-1 Coupe de la Ligue Final win over Bordeaux – ending ‎Les Phoceens’ 17-year trophy drought – which came about two months before their ninth top flight success. While players like Mamadou Niang (the club’s top scorer), Brandao, Mathieu Valbuena and Lucho Gonzalez (a then-record buy) got most of the plaudits, the input of blue-collar workers like Taiwo was also critical to their success. The left-back’s final year saw Marseille retain their cup title but surrender their Ligue 1 crown to LOSC Lille. In truth, departing Stade Velodrome having helped the club to league success and successive cup titles seemed like the smart move, especially as AC Milan, Bayern Munich and Liverpool were supposedly interested in his services.   After seven years in Marseille, 26 seemed like a good age to seek a new challenge and he opted for Milan who had won the Serie A in 2010/11. However, this proved to be the turning point of Taiwo's career. Massimiliano Allegri preferred Luca Antonini or Gianluca Zambrotta at left-back for the first-half of 11/12,and oddly even opted for Daniele Bonera, naturally a centre-back, in a game at Napoli with the Nigerian defender on the bench. After months without regular action, the former Marseille man blew his top in an interview with L'Equipe in December 2011. ""I am suffering every day because I don't get to play football. I joined this club in order to play, but I have made only six appearances so far,"" Taiwo bemoaned. ""I don't understand how things work in Italy. Sometimes I even have to watch from the stands, but I really need to play in order to show what I can do. ""It looks like Allegri doesn't have faith in me. It's not like me to just sit back and do nothing in a situation like this."" He also admitted laterto having issues with the language, not helped by the coach’s rapid speech. Allegri started the stout defender in the Rossoneri’s next two fixtures – 2-0 wins over Siena and Cagliari – but they proved to be the West African’s last games for Milan (he appeared only four times in Serie A and made four Champions League appearances).   Taiwo was loaned to relegation-threatened Premier League Queens Park Rangers in January 2012, a major step down for a player used to competing for things at the top of the table. That short spell in England proved to be the left-back’s last sighting in one of Europe’s major leagues; he had a year-long spell at Dynamo Kyiv, played in Turkey with Bursaspor and turned out for Finnish outfit HJK Helsinki, to name a few. The ex-Marseille man also played in Switzerland and Sweden prior to a two-year stay at RoPS where he stayed till his release at the end of 2019. For a career that promised so much, the notion is that the 34-year-old peaked early and couldn’t continue his upward trajectory after his initial burst of success. Somewhere, this evening, Taye Taiwo was listening to the radio...""..and Elderson's replacement will be...""...big smile...""Uzoenyi""..sad face Yet, one wonders how things might have panned out if he either moved elsewhere in 2011 or that ill-fated spell at Milan had gone differently. At international level, it is poignant that Mikel was the only one from that 2005 Eaglets squad to indeed stay relevant for an extended period. The ex-Chelsea man was also the only one who featured in Nigeria’s 2013 Africa Cup of Nations success, ending nearly two decades of hurt, withTaiwo having beendiscarded from the national team a year earlier. While Mikel became a cornerstone of the Super Eagles side, the left-back unfortunately faded following his promising time in France which turned out to be the highpoint of his career.

His 15-goal Premier League return and late Champions League group stage heroics paint him as the iconic figure he has been throughout his career. Yet the team's overall lack of success and often-disjointed attack may be attributable in part to his style of play, and his defensive workrate has come into question. Plus, recent off-field incidents have not done any favours to his public perception. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Prior to the game, the Brazilians had not tasted a loss in the ongoing continental campaign. In the game staged at the Estadio 11 de Novembro in Luanda, Lyle Lakay opened the scoring with a well-taken free-kick to hand Masandawana the lead, but goals from Tiago Azulao and Yano propelled the 15-time Angolan champions to a narrow victory.  For the hosts' second, Onyango failed to handle Tiago Azulao's cheeky backheel attempt at the near post - allowing Yano to pounce and fired home from close range.  Some Masandawana supporters feel the 36-year-old former Cranes custodian should be held accountable for the loss and consider hanging up his gloves.  We really should move away from Onyango. The time is now Grand sharp our new director should scout for a goal keeper cause Onyango and Kennedy are old. Pieterse is 30 but has alot of mistakes, likes dribbling and as you know we always play from the back. as for 28yr old Goss im not 100% happy Dennis Onyango.  Poor gameBrian Onyango. Poor gameLebusa. Poor game. T Mokoena poor game.Pls nxt game I DNT Wana see any of the above on the pitch.. https://t.co/PJ0NeaU1xc D. Onyango, M. Lebusa, T. Morena and Mokoena out for Mweene or Peiterse, De Reuck, Domingo/Maboe/Maema and Maluleka, then our chances of winning are higher. Also get Kapinga ready to replace Zwane Fans: ""We forgive Onyango""Onyango: ""You'll have to do it again""😭😭😭 Madam chair the coaches were wrong to start the away game with a 3-4-3, underestimated that team. Secondly Dennis Onyango and Lebusa needs to be dropped! https://t.co/tdUVI9IQVQ @Masandawana D. Onyango plus Lebusa = Disaster 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽 Wendell must do what is necessary now, Onyango has been exhausted. I think Dennis Onyango time is up at MAMELODI SUNDOWNS, he is our legend and we appreciate his contributions. Despite falling away in the first meeting, a section of the Masandawana faithful is optimistic the defending Premier Soccer League champions will get the needed result in the second leg to advance.

25,https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-united-worst-performance-premier-league/blt32dca1828a5c6fba,What is Manchester United's worst finish in the Premier League?,"Manchester United is the most successful club in the Premier League era. With 13 trophies to their name, they are the team with the most number of league titles since 1992. However, in the last decade, there has been a shift in power structure from the red side of Manchester to the blue side. After the departure of Alex Ferguson, Manchester City have had the upper hand over their arch-rivals and the Cityzens have won the league four times, the most by any club in the last decade. It is not easy to fill in the shoes of a legend like Ferguson and although United have tried a string of new coaches, they are yet to figure out the right man for the job. On July 1, 2013, the United board roped in David Moyes as the new manager. Moyes was handpicked by Ferguson and even decreed that the new manager should get a six-year contract. But United's performance went downhill with Moyes in charge. His managerial stint just lasted 10 months and was sacked on April 22, 2014. In fact, it was the third-shortest managerial stint in the history of the club. After the first six games, United found themselves 12th on the league table with just one win to their name. In December, they strung together a run of four wins which propelled them to the sixth position. But it was abundantly clear that the ship needed a new direction. Finally, on April 22, he was shown the door following a 2-0 loss to Everton. Ryan Giggs was brought in as the interim manager for the final stretch of the season. In four matches he won twice, drew and lost one each. With 64 points, United finished on the seven spot in the league table, their worst in the Premier League era. There was an air of optimism at Old Trafford at the beginning of the current season. Cristiano Ronaldo returned to his teenage club, Jadon Sanch and Raphael Varane were signed to improve the quality of the squad and with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm, the Red Devils thought they would once again challenge for the Premier League crown. But things hardly changed and in November after a humiliating 4-1 defeat to Watford, Solskjaer parted ways with the club. United were at the seventh position back then. Ralf Rangnick was brought onboard to shake things up but after an initial flourish that saw United climb to the fourth spot in January, the performances have remained below expectation. In their last five matches, they have won just twice and once again find themselves in the fifth spot. With six matches to go, they need 11 points to beat the record set under David Moyes. They have a complicated run of games that includes facing teams like Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea. However, the win against Norwich City will boost the morale of the team.

The Egypt international went into the showdown aiming to end his five-match goal drought against Pep Guardiola’s Citizens at Wembley. Jurgen Klopp’s side booked a place in the final - where they will be aiming to win the competition for the eighth time in their history. Heading for decline? 😢Below is Mohamed Salah’s uninspiring stats vs Manchester City 😡- Three shots- One shot on goal- Zero goal - Zero key passes- Two dribbles- 38- touches- 1 foul committed - Two offsides - 21 passes- Passing accuracy 71.4% #LIVMCI pic.twitter.com/jQqhrK2D2u Apart from the fact that he could not find the net, he could only muster a shot on target from the three shots played. Offensively, he could only complete two dribbles, had zero key passes while he was caught in an offside position twice by referee Simon Hooper. Also, he accounted for two crosses, 38 touches, 21 passes, and a passing accuracy of 71.4 percent. Salah did not add any value to Liverpool defensively with statistics showing he scored zero judging by top tackles, interceptions, clearances, and blocked shots while committing one foul. Before the game against Manchester City, manager Klopp blamed the ‘intense’ 2021 Africa Cup of Nations - where he helped the Pharaohs reach the final - as a key factor behind his not too impressive recent showings. “He had, definitely, the most intense period in January in his whole career,” the German tactician told the club website. “The tournament [Africa Cup of Nations] went to the wire, that meant they played the final, 120 minutes; the role in the team, he has massive responsibility on his shoulders, had to do dressing room meetings and stuff like this, so there was no recovery at all. “Being a superstar for a whole country, everybody wants something, that's always super-intense. And, again, that's OK for the boys, but it's not that now there is a period there is down – there is no down or whatever, it is completely normal.” Regardless, the former Chelsea and AS Roma forward has been backed to finish the 2021-22 season on a strong note. “A player like Mo who likes to dribble and is really good [at it], scored outstanding goals with dribbling, would I go to him now, 'Don't dribble?' No, but dribble in the right moment, keep the ball, keep it simple and all these kinds of things, but that's a process,” he continued. “The problem is it's not a long process, maybe a week or two or something like this, but the boys are in focus every day. “I know he will finish strongly, it's just the moment we have reset and each game for us is a final, since the beginning of January. It's crazy.” Liverpool take on Manchester United on April 20 with Salah hoping to regain his scoring form. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Juve were beaten 3-1 by Barcelona in Berlin, Morata's strike for the Italians cancelled out by goals from Ivan Rakitic after four minutes, Luis Suarez, then Neymar with the last kick of the game. Technology was not so heavily used in refereeing seven years ago - something Morata regrets and thinks could have won Juve that game. In an interview with DAZN, Morata said: ""With VAR, Juve would have won the final against Barca. ""I always think that, with VAR, they would have given us a penalty and we would have one more Champions League at Juventus. Life is like that."" Morata's annoyance stems from an incident in the 67th minute of the final at Olympiastadion, when Paul Pogba went down under a challenge from Dani Alves in the Barca penalty box. The referee waved away Juve appeals, and two minutes later Barca took the lead through Suarez. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Twofold. pic.twitter.com/G0ssxQkggv The Senegal international scored in each half to deny Pep Guardiola’s Citizens a place in the competition’s final. In the process, he achieved feats accomplished by two Reds greats at Wembley. First, he became the first Liverpool player to find the net twice in the competition’s semi-final since Robbie Fowler against Aston Villa in 1996. In the game in question, the former England international found the net on two occasions as the Reds hit the Claret and Blue Army for three. Roy Evans’ side failed to emerge as champions following a 1-0 defeat to Manchester United - with Eric Cantona’s last-gasp effort settling the classic. Furthermore, the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations winner is the first to score a brace for the Anfield club at Wembley since Steve McManaman in the League Cup final against Bolton in 1995. Although Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva were on target for City, that could not propel them to restore parity. After impressing for 85 minutes, the African star was replaced by Diogo Jota - whereas - Mohamed Salah played the full game alongside Mali prospect Ibrahima Konate. 30-year-old Mane boasts 18 goals in all the competitions he has featured in so far in the 2021-22 season. Prior to this encounter, manager Jurgen Klopp had raved about his team’s form that will also see them compete for the Premier League title, and feature in the Champions League semi-final, having already lifted the League Cup earlier this year. “Imagine we could have exactly the same for five years? That would be great, always in three semi-finals and winning nothing,” he told the club website. “The world is not ready for this kind of success! It's true, it's great and actually, I'm really happy for the boys because in this club it's so difficult to do something that our fathers and grandfathers didn't do already.“This specific thing, nobody did in this club, which is really special. But, yes, I know if that's the success this year then it will not be seen as such in the future.” Unbeaten in their last eight matches, the Reds host Manchester United on Tuesday evening in a potential Premier League cracker. For Guardiola’s Citizens who currently lead the English elite division, they would be aspiring to shake off the defeat when they face Brighton & Hove Albion on April 20.

29,https://www.goal.com/en/news/frustration-emma-hayes-chelsea-jess-carter-not-playing-star/blt7483e48a3112f6a1,‘I had a lot of frustration’ - How Chelsea’s Jess Carter went from ‘not really playing’ to being a star again,"Ask a player to highlight their favourite trophy win, and most will pick their first. Ask Chelsea’s Jess Carter that question, and she has good reason to pick differently. The 24-year-old has won six titles since moving to west London from Birmingham four years ago, but it is the latest of that haul that stands out for a player who, on Sunday, will try to help Chelsea reach Wembley again as they take on Arsenal in the Women’s FA Cup semi-finals. “I'd probably say last year's FA Cup,” Carter tells GOAL, after only a slight pause to think. “That was big for me because it was one of the first trophies where I feel like I've played more and contributed more on the pitch. “As much as everybody can say it's a team sport and we all win the trophies, having not played much and won trophies, and played more and won trophies, I can definitely say it feels better feeling like you've contributed more on the pitch.” When a young player joins a big club, there are always people who question whether the timing is right, but when Carter moved to Chelsea, she knew it was. “I loved my time at Birmingham, but I got to a place where I started to get a bit complacent,” she admits. “Because we didn't have the luxury of having as much depth at Birmingham, I felt like I started to - I wouldn't say I ever stopped trying, but I stopped maybe taking it as seriously, being as professional as I should. “I just seemed to kind of coast through quite a bit towards the end of my time at Birmingham. For me to be a better player, I couldn't do that. At that time, I felt like I needed to be in a more professional environment that would help push me to that level. “Everyone talks about yes, you have to set your own standards, but I don't know many 19-year-olds that are able to be super professional and lead the way. Sometimes you just need a bit of help from the environment and that's what I felt I could get coming to Chelsea.” In her first season, she was a regular starter, but the following two campaigns would see her fill more of a squad role for the first time in her career. “You want to win, that's why you play, but you also play for the game time,” she says. “For people that don't get much game time, it is difficult and it is about trying to find a good balance. “Ultimately, it's the manager that selects you and all you can really do from a player perspective is give your everything, every day, so that you don't leave anything [behind] and hopefully that'll be enough to give you minutes. “If not, you have to figure out the role that you are to play at your club and just do that role the best you can to help the team be successful. “It's a really difficult process when you're not in a team. Obviously, you believe that everybody has your best interests at heart, but sometimes you think you should play when you're not playing, and other people think you should be playing when you're not playing. “You can go to Emma [Hayes, Chelsea manager] and ask her what you need to be doing and she'll tell you directly about why you're not playing, most of the time, and what you need to do. But we are also very well aware that we have a team with great depth and if you're not on your top game, then you can be replaced. “There were plenty of times when I’d have a lot of frustration with Emma because I wasn’t getting the game time that I felt like I deserved but, equally, there are the reasons that she didn't play me and I respect those reasons. “But I had a great group of girls around me to make me feel valued in the team and appreciated. I think we could all turn around and say that we have a great dressing room and the girls are often what drives you to keep going each day.” Carter’s rejuvenation came around 12 months ago, when Chelsea were hit by absences going into the second-leg of their Women’s Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg. Hayes would often tell the 24-year-old to make sure to be ready if called upon – and she was. “For me, it was almost a situation of, 'it can't really get much worse',” Carter says, with a laugh. “I had a bit of [a feeling of] relief and no pressure because it was: 'You haven't had any minutes anyway, so you can't do any worse than what's happened so far. Just go and play and do your best'. “I'd probably say I felt quite free going into the game, whereas maybe some people might be slightly stressed having not many minutes. It was just a 'what will be will be' kind of moment.” Fast forward a year and Carter is a regular again – be it at right-back, wing-back or centre-back. She was crucial in Chelsea’s run to last year’s Champions League final and their Women’s Super League title triumph, as well as that FA Cup win. She has also been recalled by England, which “totally shocked” her. When she made her comeback appearance against Austria in November, her second cap, it was one day short of being exactly four years since her first. Now, she wants more trophies. Chelsea are in pole position to win the WSL for the third year running and could reach the FA Cup final on Sunday. There have been lows in this season - in December, the Blues were knocked out of Europe in the group stages and last month they were beaten by Manchester City in the League Cup final - but they have not dampened Carter’s mood. They are only driving her more. “I think that gives me an extra bit of motivation,” she says. “I want to be leaving this season with the FA Cup and with the league title. I think that is the same way for a lot of the players. “You're ready to go the extra mile again to make sure that we come away with the trophy.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Boos rang around the stadium when Pogba was withdrawn in the second half, with the atmosphere toxic until Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner with a free kick. Why was Pogba booed by the Manchester United fans? GOAL has a look... Supporters protesting before the game against Man Utd's ownership also vented their frustrations at the players, with chants and banners saying they're ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in evidence. Pogba has become a lightning rod for these frustrations with Man Utd's performances this season, with the club set to continue a trophy drought that has persisted since 2017. He is also a target for ire due to his refusal to sign a new contract, meaning a man signed for a then-world record fee of £89m in 2017 is set to leave Man Utd as a free agent - for the second time - this summer. With Man Utd drawing 2-2 against rock bottom Norwich at the time Pogba was subbed off, the anger of the fans once again came to the surface. Pogba then reacted by cupping his ears to the supporters - which will only further alienate the two opposing parties. Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick told Match of the Day of the criticism aimed at Pogba: ""I didn't hear it myself but I was informed after the game. 𝚅𝚎𝚛𝚢 𝚒𝚖𝚙𝚘𝚛𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚠𝚒𝚗 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚘𝚏 𝚞𝚜 𝚝𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚢! pic.twitter.com/KLZyu7dDeL ""I can fully understand the fans are frustrated, so are we, but I don't think they should take on individual players. I don't think that is right or correct."" On Pogba reacting to supporters, Rangnick told his post-match press conference: ""I didn't see it, I heard that. It was probably his reaction to the chanting of the fans. ""As I said, I can understand in a way the fans and supporters but it doesn't make sense to take on individual players."" Pogba's deal expires in the summer, and with no new agreement on the horizon, it seems increasingly likely the World Cup winner will be moving on once again. While there is still time for a deal to be reached, Pogba is being linked heavily with a move, with PSG or a return to Juventus the most commonly mooted options.

The USMNT international dallied too long with the ball in the first half, to allow Sadio Mane to pounce and muzzle home a close-range finish, as Jurgen Klopp's Reds saw off a late City fightback to win 3-2 at Wembley Stadium. It made for a humiliating moment for Steffen, but Guardiola has offered his support to the 27-year-old, who is the back-up to Ederson at City. ""It was an accident,"" Guardiola told BBC Sport at full-time. ""One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. ""It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there it can always happen. It was an accident and he will learn for the future. ""I have spoken with the team, not him personally but he is strong."" It is not the first time that the USMNT keeper has undone his own side with a flaw in his game, though this one likely ranks above all others in terms of sheer preventability. In last season's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea, the American dropped out far in his box before belatedly backpedalling amid a Blues break, leaving an effectively empty net for Hakim Ziyech to turn Timo Werner's square ball home into. He is not the only City goalkeeper with a major fumble in recent weeks either, after Ederson miscued a routine clearance and nearly put the ball in his own net last weekend against Liverpool in a thrilling 2-2 Premier League draw.

34,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-survive-brutal-champions-league-battle-with/bltc5a0f267d5815dd8,Man City survive brutal Champions League battle with Atletico Madrid - but at what cost?,"Atletico Madrid 0-0 Manchester City (0-1 agg): Match Statistics Manchester City made it through to the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday night – but they paid a heavy price. Kevin De Bruyne looked in discomfort as he was replaced midway through the second half of this brutal Champions League battle with Atletico Madrid and Kyle Walker also looked to be carrying an injury when he followed him off late on. In truth, there won’t be many players that leave the Wanda Metropolitano without a couple of cuts and bruises. The punishing schedule in City’s hunt for a treble isn’t going to get any easier after this war of attrition, and Pep Guardiola needs every player he can muster right now. However, while Jurgen Klopp was able to rest some star men in Liverpool’s own quarter-final second leg, against Benfica on the same evening, Guardiola went with a full-strength side against Atletico, even though the Premier League leaders face the Reds in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. The Catalan will feel he had no choice, with City having arrived in the Spanish capital with such a slender first-leg advantage, but another punishing 90 minutes will have taken a lot out of his players. Indeed, this was a night in which Atletico not only employed more dark arts, but arguably went well beyond what is acceptable on several occasions. This was an ugly game long before a huge brawl broke out in the dying seconds after Felipe had fouled Phil Foden close to the touchline. Stefan Savic first dragged Foden off the field before then grabbing the hair of City substitute Jack Grealish during the melee which followed. THE DRAMA. pic.twitter.com/wr5PUyRor3 It didn't end there, either, with Savic and Grealish having reportedly squared up in the tunnel afterwards after an alleged headbutt, before the police had to separate both sets of players outside the City dressing room. For most of the game, Savic and his colleagues appeared to have more of a problem with Phil Foden, who must have felt like he had a large target painted on his back. With barely 10 minutes gone, Felipe clattered into the England international from behind, leaving him sprawling on the floor and he played the rest of the match with a bandaged head. Having escaped a yellow card, Felipe later had another crack at Foden's ankles, while Savic shouldered the England international needlessly when the ball had long rolled out of play. But the 21-year-old kept coming back for more and, as Atletico desperately tried to rescue an equaliser and City ran down the clock, Foden drew them in again with just over a minute of normal time to play. After initially winning the ball with a sliding tackle, Felipe followed through on Foden, who rolled off the field, but then back onto it. Savic then got involved, and chaos ensued. As ever with Atletico, the 'sh*thousery' was a bigger talking point than much of the football. Champions League battles are 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙤𝙩𝙞𝙘 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/qOlMz9bjAb Still, it's worth noting that City strongly and were unlucky not to have taken the lead when Ilkay Gundogan struck the post. Atletico finally mustered their first shot of the match – and tie – 35 minutes in, with Jeffrey Kondogbia’s deflected effort running through to Ederson. They finally opened up in the second half and threatened repeatedly, with Antoine Griezmann and Joao Felix narrowly off-target. However, as the tension mounted in the final 20 minutes, City kept their headers, while Atletico lost theirs. Joao Cancelo did pick up a late booking which rules him out of the first leg of the semi-final with Real Madrid but it was probably a foul that needed to be made, given Yannick Carrasco was just about to enter the penalty area. Still, while City are still in the Spanish capital, a trip to the Santiago Bernabeu bizarrely feels a long way away right now, with a Wembley date with Liverpool now in full view. Also, Guardiola will be hoping that when his players do return to Madrid, most of those cuts and bruises will have healed. City may have survived this literal Atletico onslaught but how long will it take them all to fully recover? Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

And while the infamous 'loan army' is used against the Stamford Bridge outfit on a regular basis, a look beneath the surface suggests that is working in west London. In terms of young players, loan movestend to form a key part of their development, and it is telling just how many of the Blues' academy prospects of recent times have gone onto play international football while either establishing themselves in the Chelsea first team or being sold for a huge profit. More established players can benefit too, with loan spells working largely as shop windows for the individuals to prove they are worthy of being brought in a on a permanent basis by a different team. Chelsea's use of the loan system meant they were able to record a net profit in terms of transfer fees in the summer of 2021, despite spending £97.5 million ($136m) on Romelu Lukaku, and now other clubs, including Manchester City, are following a similar model. Of course, not everything worked out in Chelsea's favour. Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Lukaku himself were all sold by the club following spells out on loan, only to go onto become some of the best players in the world. So how did it all come about, and could anything have been done differently?Goalspoke exclusively to Eddie Newton, Chelsea's former loan technical coach and mastemind of the system, to find out: Newton: ""It was up and running but it wasn’t a developed system. It was (ex-Chelsea technical director) Michael Emenalo’s brainchild basically. He brought me into his office and said, ‘Look, Rafa [Benitez] is a bit worried about having you because you were with the last manager (Roberto Di Matteo)’. ""So I wasn’t going to be with him in the first-team, but he had another job for me to develop and run the loan programme. He said we had too many young players who were too good for the Under-23s, but not good enough for the first team. ""We needed to send them away on loan, but we needed to do it better than before. We didn’t know enough about these guys away on loan. He gave me a blueprint and then I builtit. We kept meeting every so often, and he said he would get me what I needed to make it work. ""Thedepartment began with just me and an analyst. We were working and going to watch games. Then, the list ofplayers on my rota was getting too big and I couldn’t do it anymore.  ""I told Emenalo that I needed to build a proper department, so I hired Paulo Ferriera next. He lived around the corner, had just retired and was good with languages, so we agreed he was perfect. We also got another analyst. ""Then we brought in Tore Andre Flo. We had goalkeepers on loan, so we needed Christophe Lollichon on board. We had an unbelievable team of coaches who travelled all over Europe to get feedback from managers and technical directors. ""It showed the players that Chelsea cared about them and were not just doing it for getting them off the wage bill. Many loans went well, others didn’t, but the ones that didn’t we visited more. We looked for ways to help the club manager. ""We developed the feedback we gave players andimproved our organisation with other clubs. When Michael went, I would get involved in loan negotiations before it went onto Marina [Granovskaia]. It was something we built and that I was really proud of by the end. ""We built a world-class programme that I know a lot of other people are copying today. A lot of clubs came to us and asked us for a little bit of help, we helped them up their game and that’s fine. You can only have the secret for a little bit!"" EN: ""It was normal. Michael wanted to go out and defend it, but the club wanted to keep it quiet. I don’t know why, but Michael wanted to defend Chelsea’s approach. He wanted to tell people it is working, but maybe not in the way people wanted it to work. ""I think a lot of people wanted us to loan these guys out and bring them into the first team one or two seasons later, but that was impossible. Utterly impossible. ""The clubs of the magnitude and pressure of Chelsea, Manchester United and all the big clubs in the world see that most young players can't make that jump right away. ""People like Mason Mount have done it now, but that’s because the loan programme became so developed alongside that work in the academy to allow it. The processes were easier for him moving from U23s to loan in senior football and then learning how to come back to the club to take his opportunity. ""It’s also down to the manager atthe time. If the manager is not accepting of the younger player, then it doesn’t matter how good the loan programme is. A new manager could just sign a player for £50m,meaning it wouldn’t matter what we do. ""We still had to use this loan programme to better these players in the meantime though, and that’s exactly what we did. People in the football world quickly realised it was a fantastic financial tool for the club. ""Taking players of the wage bill, then selling them and often for more than we brought them in for. We were making a profit and developing players. It became the business tool for the football club."" EN: ""For me, I think Salah and De Bruyne wasn’t about talent. It was a personality clash [with Jose Mourinho]. I just didn’t think it was working at the time. ""I think they were more than good enough, but it was the manager who didn’t see eye-to-eye with them, so it wasn’t going to work. ""For Lukaku, he wasn’t ready at the time, and I don’t care what anyone says. ""He just wasn’t ready to be the main No.9up front and carry that platform like Didier [Drogba]. He was always going to be compared to Didier and it wasn’t fair to him at that time. ""It was different situations for different players.""   EN: ""He was a great kid with bundles of enthusiasm who wanted to impress. He was sometimes too desperate to impress that it went against him. ""I think he needed to come out of Chelsea and learn his craft elsewhere, which he did on loan at West Brom. My former team-mate Steve Clarke was looking after him. ""It was well documented and he will say it himself:he had the power and pace, and when he was younger he got away with blowing people away with his physicality, outrunning people in behind and scoring that goal. ""When he got to the top level, he couldn’t do it as much anymore. He hadn’t developed how to play with his back to goal. Every time the ball came to him, a defender would get tight and it would bounce off him. He gave it away a lot and it was frustrating. ""That’s why at Chelsea it would have been hard for him, because there was an expectation on him to hold up the ball, find the players then get back in the box to finish. That’s what Didier did and it left massive pressure. It was better to go away and develop it at West Brom. ""Steve was working on that with him and we agreed on having that as an aim. It was the same at Everton, speaking with [Roberto] Martinez. He got better, but he still needed to improve with back to goal and his movement. I would visit him and show him footage of his performances. ""I was showing him where to improve and what to do. In combination with working with the club coaching staff and the external support of the loan group, it helped him a lot. ""He got to Manchester United, didn’t take off as he would have hoped, but Antonio Conte had him at Inter. He was a pain for Lukaku and forced him to complete the journey with his back to goal. He worked tirelessly with him until he got his just rewards. It was a major factor on why he didn’t establish himself at the highest level earlier. ""He is now back at Chelsea, more mature and a senior player who can play with his back to goal and score. He is now ready to complete that journey and fair play to him. A lot of hard work went into where he is now."" EN: ""De Bruyne, Lukaku and Salah all had amazing games. I remember watching Salah versus Juventus away,and they (Fiorentina) were up against it, but he scored a beautiful goal on the counterattack, going past players and hitting it into the top corner. ""It was an incredible, incredible goal. I was in the Juventus section and I almost got up and celebrated it!   ""We spoke about people not understanding the loan programme at the start, but the players didn’t either. After a season or two, they were coming to me and saying they get it now and appreciate it. The agents and parents'feedback started coming and it was positive. These were their careers that we were helping. I know they all wanted to play for Chelsea, but not everyone can. ""I was just being honest with them and they appreciated that honesty. The club did a lot for these players."" EN: ""From what I hear at Chelsea at the moment, Tuchel is open to different things. He is a good guy, a good manager and is open to listening to different things. He will work with the youngsters coming in. It’s not justabout working with the senior players. ""He’s from the German system, which is all about working with the young coach and young player. So he understands it. As well as that winning mentality, he understands development. ""No disrespect to any manager before, but Chelsea now have a manager who understands both sides of the coin. He knows he has to win titles, win matches and make tough decisions, but he also knows that there has to be a development space for these players. ""He will be getting the reports from the loan department, academy and have young boys training with the first team. He will understand it. ""He has a massive support system at Chelsea. If you utilise it properly as a managerthen it is a wealth of information, so you have so many things to deal with. All the players coming through, doing well and he will see some doing well in training. ""It is up to him to make his mind up to develop his squad from there. I am really pleased for Trevoh [Chalobah], for example. I know his brother well and watched him a bit too. I worked with Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham, Reece James and Fikayo Tomori too, so I am pleased for all the boys.   ""You could get frustrated at times because they were in a rush to get to where they wanted to. I was like that when I was a young player so I understood it. Their belief in their ability was very high, which helped them achieve what they achieved. ""I think Billy Gilmour will do well later in the season at Norwich. I really rate the boy, he did well at Chelsea when he came in. It will be interesting to watch him develop over time at Norwich."" EN: ""It was a bit difficult. I was being put on Frank [Lampard's]staff to be that senior guy,because it was quite a young staffing group. Chelsea wanted me to be that senior one for them, but it didn’t pan out and Frank wanted to go in a different direction. ""It became difficult and they decided to put me between loans and scouting, but it wasn’t for me anymore because I had been there and done it. Then came the opportunity to work atTrabzonspor, which I was a bit iffy about at first, to be honest. ""They had a Turkish coach they liked a lot but wanted me to look after their non-Turkish players. In the end, I asked Chelsea for permission to go and speakto their manager, and he wanted me there. It was great when I went there. ""We were competing for the league and went close. We got a few draws towards the end and it is very emotionally driven in Turkey. It’semotive anywhere in football, but my god Turkey is emotive. With two games to go, the president sacked the manager! ""I was dumbfounded to be honest. There was no need in my opinion. It happened and the president rang me up and said the manager is sacked and you’re taking over tomorrow. But you must win both of the last two games. ""Fortunately, we won the first to finish second and the next one to win the cup final. I enjoyed it immensely. The president then took me on as the full-time manager over the summer. Unfortunately,the side I was then working with was dismantled. ""We lost five or six senior players. The president didn’t have real control over the transfers coming in and the players weren’t good enough coming in I thought. ""I did my best with those players and tried to develop some young players, but it was very difficult and at week seven, he sacked me as well. Unfortunately, we couldn’t build on what we started. ""We were expected to build something again from nothing. It was a difficult baptism of fire in management but you learn. It was a learning curve to understand that market and how they go about things. I will know better for next time."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

37,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-youth-exodus-why-wonderkids-leaving-summer/yy8mg5464c7z10kw4t1wlzs4e,Chelsea's youth exodus: Why are so many wonderkids leaving the Blues this summer?,"When Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as Chelsea manager around six months ago, there were concerns raised by some supporters whether that would mark the end of the Blues' willingness to blood youngsters from their academy in the first team. Lampard, of course, had overseen the a change in tact at Stamford Bridge, with the club's FIFA-imposed transfer ban in the summer of 2019 forcing them to look inwards for additions. In came Mason Mount, Reece James, Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and -latterly -Billy Gilmour, while Callum Hudson-Odoi was also offered slightly more opportunities than had been available to him under Maurizio Sarri. But after a summer window in 2020 that saw Chelsea spend£220 million ($300m) on new signings, followed by the appointment of Tuchel in a bid to integrate those big-money arrivalsinto the team more than Lampard had managed, the writing - at least for some - was on the wall for the club's new homegrown heroes. Those initial fears were, in the most part, proven to be unfounded, with both Mount and James playing key roles in the Blues finishing in the Premier League's top four, reaching the FA Cup final and winning the Champions League. But with Tuchel's first transfer window in charge now well under way, one theme has dominated the summer for Chelsea supporters, with a deluge of the club's top homegrown talents having alreadyleft or who are on the verge of departing. In truth, most Blues supporters had already resigned themselves to losing Tomori this summer, with the centre-back completing a £25m ($34m) move to AC Milan following his successful loan spell at San Siro, that in itself came in the wake of him being frozen out under Lampard. But what has followed has raised real concerns that one of England's best academy structures is in danger of becoming a finishing school for players who never actually play for Chelsea, and instead furnish other clubs with their talent due to the lack of a pathway to the senior ranks in west London.  The biggest shock came when it was announced that Marc Guehi, the 21-year-old centre-back who for a long time had been earmarked as potential first-team fixture at Stamford Bridge, was leaving for Crystal Palace. Guehi had shone during 18 months on loan at Swansea City, with many pegging him as a future England defender, but it is the Eagles who will hope to see him flourish wearing their colours following his £18m ($25m) arrival. He has been followed out the door by 18-year-old midfielder Lewis Bate, who has joined Leeds United for £1.5m ($2m), and more will join them in leaving in the coming days. Tino Livramento (18) is closing in on a move to Brighton;midfielder Myles Peart-Harris (18) is expected to join newly-promoted Brentford; and defender Dynel Simeu (19) has rejected a new deal so as to join Southampton on a free transfer. But why, so soon after the likes of Mount and James showed there could be a pathway from the Chelsea academy to the first team, are so many of the club's talented youngsters now looking to leave? The answer lies in the sheer size of the Chelsea squad, and the difficulties that come with breaking into what is already an oversized group of senior professionals. Last season, Chelsea's core group that won the Champions League numbered just over 20, while around 30 more spent the campaign out on loan at other clubs. As such, for some of the current crop of youngsters at Chelsea, the competition is already too much. They, rightly or wrongly, believe they are ready for senior action this season, and the chances of getting that at Chelsea right now are slim at best. Bate, for example, is an elegant midfielder who has been singled out for his passing ability and willingness to take the ball in tight spaces while maintainingpossession. He has watched on as Gilmour, who is only a year older than him, hasstruggled to force his way into the first-team picture before opting to join Norwich City on loan for the upcoming season. A post shared by Lewis Bate (@lewbate) Bate knows that he will need to usurp at least one of Jorginho, N'Golo Kante or Mateo Kovacic to become a regular in the senior ranks, and that is before taking into consideration returning loanees such as Conor Gallagher, Ethan Ampadu and Trevoh Chalobah. Livramento, meanwhile, is coming off the back of a year that saw win named Chelsea's Academy Player of the Season, with the right-back a regular for England at youth level. In front of him in the Chelsea pecking order, however, are James andCesar Azpilicueta, while former academy star Dujon Sterling is closing in on a new contract and Hudson-Odoi has even earned opportunities at right wing-back under Tuchel. Livramento has seen the way in which Tariq Lamptey has impressed since leaving Chelsea for Brighton in January 2020, and though he will ironically now be in competition with the 20-year-old when he moves to the Amex Stadium, it is only one player he needs to usurp in the pecking order onthe south coast rather thanthree or four in the capital. A post shared by Valentino (@tinolivramento) Tall, attacking midfielder Peart-Harris has a little less competition in his favoured position, though he only need to look towards Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tino Anjorin, who both share a lot of his key attributes, to see that his chances of breaking through are limited at best. Chelsea are, of course, a club who needs to win now. The money that has been spent on the squad demands it, and there can only be so much room for sentiment where Tuchel is concerned. Fans need only look at the way Abraham was largely cast aside following the German coach's arrival to see that in action, while the £50m ($69m) that has been raised this summer from the sales of players from outside the first-team squad will be seen as strong business, particularly when some of it is used to fund new signings in the future. ""Nobody wants to rest, I want the next success, the next title, the next process, the same level of quality,"" Tuchelsaid following the triumphant Champions League final win over Manchester City. ""I want to be a part of it and I demand to be a part of it. This is what comes next, make no mistake about it."" Despite this summer's losses, Chelsea still do have plenty of homegrown talent on their books to choose from, and that does not even take into account those already established in Tuchel's team. Gallagher and Ampadu both have Premier League experience already, Sterling is showing encouraging signs after missing a year of football through illness and injury, and striker Armando Broja has signed a new contract after an excellent season on loan at Vitesse in 2020-21. Factor in 18-year-old Levi Colwill, who is spending the season on loan at Huddersfield Town after emerging as one of the best young centre-backs in the country, and the future still looks bright for both Chelsea and their homegrown wonderkids. The drawbridge to the first team has not been pulled up quite yet, even if some of this summer's losses will sting a little. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The highly-rated 21-year-old's move raised eyebrows, with many having tipped him for a role at Stamford Bridge this season under Thomas Tuchel. However, he opted to move to Selhurst Park and has quickly been given a starting role under Patrick Vieira. Ahead of an England Under-21s game against Kosovo, where he has been named the captain under new manager Lee Carsley, he explained his summer move. ""It wasn't an easy decision for me to leave Chelsea,"" Guehi said. ""I was at the club for so long - since I was seven years old. I am extremely grateful for everyone who has helped me get so far and it's because of them that I'm here. ""I felt like it was the right decision for me to move to Palace. I wanted to play regular football at a high level in the Premier League and test myself to see how far I can go. I think I will really improve myself. ""So looking at it that way, I think it was the right decision. My mentality is to get the most out of myself."" Guehi went on to talk about his new position as U21 captain, but not before reserving praise for Chelsea legend John Terry, stating: ""I learned an immense lot with the way he conducted himself, the way he played and the professionalism. ""He is seen as such a high standard through his professionalism and commitment to the game. ""It's a privilege to be captain and it is a proud moment for me and my family. I was a bit shocked at first. There's a lot of leaders and fantastic players in the group. ""It honestly could have been so many people. [Carsley] sees maybe something from a different perspective or from the sidelines. But I am confident and I try to help people on or off the pitch. Those are some of the qualities I feel I have."" The Young Lions' friendly match with Romania was cancelled after two players in the group tested positive for coronavirus. Instead of travelling to Budapest, the Football Association opted to play an in-house friendly instead. Unfortunately, Carsley has since seen both Liverpool's Harvey Elliott and Tottenham's Ryan Sessegnon drop out of the squad due to injury. Aston Villa midfielder Aaron Ramsey has been called up to the squad ahead of the match at Stadium MK against Kosovo on Tuesday night. It will be the first 2021 European Championship qualifying match in Group G for the side. Along with Kosovo, England have been drawn alongside Albania, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Andorra.

The four footballing superpowers are ready to offer the 29-year-old a lucrative contract after extension negotiations ground to a halt due to sanctions on Roman Abramovich and ongoing talks to sell the club. The Blues defender was close to signing a renewal that would have made him the club’s highest-paid defender, but negotiations may have to be picked up from scratch by one of the four American-led consortiums currently in the process of trying to buy the Stamford Bridge side. With Abramovich having been sanctioned due to his ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the invasion of Ukraine has led to the businessman having to sell the club. Chelsea are working closely with the UK government to facilitate a sale, but the uncertainty caused by the situation has plunged Rudiger's future into doubt. Had the club bowed to the German's renewal demands earlier there would be no cause for concern, but director Marina Granovskaia's tough negotiating approach has seen talks drag on for some time. In addition, the deadline for final bids from those interested in buying the club has been pushed back to April 14, which has caused further delays. Those bids will then be assessed in painstaking detail in line with the Premier League’s due diligence process. As frustrating as it is for fans, the process has actually moved at an unprecedented pace due to the potential sporting issues and devaluing of the club that would happen should the takeover - worth over £2.5 billion ($3.3bn) - rumble on. Most of the other issues have been resolved by adjustments to the club’s licence, including allowing supporters into matches. Indeed, The Blues are losing around £30 million ($40m) a month, but Abramovich can now put in money through his parent company, Fordstam Ltd, to cover the shortfall. The Blues continue to scout for players that they could try to sign in the summer, with a marquee signing likely to be sanctioned by any new owner. Sevilla’s Jules Kounde was a leading central defender target, with midfielders Declan Rice and Aurelien Tchouameni also on the agenda. They’re also looking at youth players to bolster their academy teams, which have struggled this season. In terms of outgoings, Andreas Christensen looks set to depart Barcelona on a free transfer for issues unrelated to the ownership. The Catalan giants are also keen to sign Cesar Azpilicueta, although an appearance clause that was first revealed by GOAL has extended his contract for another season. Elsewhere, Dortmund are interested in signing Timo Werner, who could push for a move away in the summer. Tuchel has also called on the club to not allow a repeat of the situation around expiring contracts for defenders to happen next season, with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho having just over a year left on their respective deals.

The Portuguese proved the initial bright spark for the Red Devils at Old Trafford against the relegation-threatened Canaries, with a brace of finishes seeing him write some impressive personal history once more. He has now hit the 20-goal mark for the 16th consecutive season, a feat stretching back all the way to his first spell with United, long before he became a Real Madrid legend. Heading into Saturday's fixture, both the 37-year-old and his club needed a morale-boosting result after their loss to relegation-battling Everton last time out in the Premier League. 16 - Cristiano Ronaldo has now scored 20+ club goals in 16 consecutive seasons in all competitions. Longevity. pic.twitter.com/tvcRecBamA For the former at least, it was exactly what he set out to deliver, finding the back of the net within seven minutes to push his league tally deeper into double figures. Then, a smart header just after the half-hour mark saw the veteran forward double his tally for the game and push him past the magic 20-goal mark for the season across all competitions for yet another campaign. He then completed his hat-trick in the second half by scoring a free kick to make it 3-2 to United. Speaking after the full-time whistle, United goalkeeper David De Gea and Canaries boss Dean Smith were both quick to single out the Portuguese as the difference in the clash between the two. ""Ronaldo has scored three very important goals for us,"" the former stated. ""We know we aren't playing very well but we got three points. We should control the game more against Norwich at home."" Smith was frustrated by his side's sloppiness against the star, adding: ""Ronaldo is the difference but we have handed him the first two on a plate and [goalkeeper] Tim [Krul] should have saved the third.""

41,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-arsenal-champions-league-challenge-collapse-brighton/bltc6e2c2bca8d31edd,Xhaka at left-back?! Arteta facing flak after Arsenal's Champions League bid rocked by Brighton blow,"Arsenal 1-2 Brighton: Match Statistics Advantage Tottenham! This was supposed to be the day that Arsenal posted a positive response to a damaging defeat at Crystal Palace, but instead it felt like the moment that the race for the Champions League swung firmly in the direction of their north London rivals. Mikel Arteta’s side were beaten 2-1 by Brighton on Saturday afternoon and, with just eight Premier League games remaining, they now have it all to do if they want to secure themselves a top four spot. Leandro Trossard scored the opening goal of the game for the visitors on 28 minutes and a fabulous strike by Enock Mwepu doubled their advantage midway through the second half. Arsenal did pull a goal back late on through a deflected Martin Odegaard strike but, by then, it was too little, too late. Up until the final few minutes, the hosts looked void of any sort of ideas, with the changes made by Arteta to fill the gaps left by the injured Keran Tierney and Thomas Partey leaving his team looking totally unbalanced. Arsenal offered next to nothing all afternoon against a Brighton side who had gone into the game with just one win and one goal in their last seven league games. It was a disastrous day for the Gunners and for Arteta, who will now come in for some severe criticism for how he lined his team up. After Nuno Tavares’ poor performance at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the Arsenal boss opted to use Granit Xhaka at left-back in the absence of Tierney. But with Partey also missing because of injury, that left the home side woefully short in midfield. Arsenal couldn’t get any sort of control as a result and Brighton went through the 90 minutes almost completely untroubled. They did get one stroke of luck when Gabriel Martinelli had a goal ruled out for offside by VAR just before half-time, but other than that, the visitors’ defence barely had to break sweat until the final few minutes when Odegaard’s strike set up a grandstand finish. There is, of course, still time to arrest this slump, but it’s difficult to see Arsenal coming back from the events of the past week. Back-to-back to defeats have sucked the life out of their top-four bid and the injuries to Tierney and Partey has left an already small squad looking woefully short of what is required to finish the season with a flourish. If they are to have any chance of keeping their Champions League dream alive, Arteta must find a way of coming up with a system that makes up for the loss of two of his most influential players because the one he used against Brighton was not fit for purpose. Using Xhaka at left-back and having Odegaard so deep in midfield left Arsenal unable to get any sort of foothold in the game. It was no surprise that the Gunners looked at their most threatening late on when Odegaard was able to operate in the final third after some late attacking changes gave him more licence to go forward. Arteta’s side go to Southampton next weekend and then they face Chelsea and Manchester United in the space of just three days. They now have no room for error in any of those games if they want to ensure the keep pace with a Tottenham side who have found their form just at the moment that Arsenal’s has fallen off a cliff. When they won at Aston Villa on March 19, it looked like Arteta’s side had one foot in the Champions League, but the way things are looking now, they could even find themselves in a battle to secure a Europa League spot.

42,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lacazette-exposes-arsenal-transfer-gamble-arteta-firing-line/bltc4a3e2b8fa6283a7,Lacazette exposes Arsenal’s transfer gamble and leaves Arteta in the firing line,"It was a decision that always looked risky at the time. As soon as Arsenal decided not to bring in a replacement when they let Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang join Barcelona in January, they left themselves open for criticism. Everyone knew it, including Mikel Arteta – but he remained defiant. “When you have a clear direction and process of how you make your decisions, you have to be ruthless,"" said the Arsenal boss. “You have to have a certain courage and consistency in those decisions. “So, if you are tempted to do something, but you think it's going to bring you trouble in the coming months or years, you should not do it. I think we were brave. “Whether it was good or not, we will only know at the end of the season – and it will depend on whether we have won enough matches.” The initial signs were good, with Arsenal winning five successive games immediately after the January window came to a close. But now Arteta’s side have hit a massive bump in the road. They have lost three of their last four matches in the Premier League, scoring just once in the process. Arsenal have seen Tottenham move above them in the race for the Champions League and that has seen the spotlight fall once again on the lack of firepower within the squad. It’s now been four months since Lacazette scored from open play, with his only goal of 2022 coming from the penalty spot against Leicester City last month. At a time when Tottenham are scoring freely and Aubameyang is flying again, with 10 goals from his first 14 appearances for Barcelona, that question is now being asked as to why Arsenal chose to weaken their squad in January, rather than strengthen it. “We need to score more goals, that’s for sure and that’s a collective issue,” Arteta said after last weekend’s home defeat by Brighton. Arsenal go to Southampton on Saturday looking to avoid a third straight defeat in the Premier League. It looks like they will be without Lacazette on this occasion, with the frontman having missed training this week due to an illness. And that, combined with his struggles in front of goal this season, has left Arteta in a difficult position. The Spaniard may not have been alone in opting not to bring in a replacement for Aubameyang, with technical director Edu equally as culpable, but he was the man who decided his relationship with the Gabon international was beyond repair. In allowing Aubameyang to leave without bringing anyone else in, Arteta put all his eggs in Lacazette’s basket. Two months on, that now looks like a decision that could cost Arsenal a place in next season’s Champions League. The France international, who is out of contract in the summer, has scored just four Premier League goals this season from an XG of 9.03 – the biggest negative differential of any player in the English top flight. He is averaging a goal every 429.5 minutes and has a shot conversion rate of just 9.1 per cent. When you consider Lacazette had a conversion rate of 28.9% in 2020-21 and 19.2% in 2019-20, you can see how much he is currently underperforming in the final third. That has left Arsenal reliant on goals from their wide forwards such as Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe this season, and now that those goals have dried up, wins are proving difficult to come by. “Laca's contribution to the team in many other ways has been phenomenal,” Arteta said when quizzed on his captain’s lack of goals. “Of course, we want the strikers to score goals and we know we require them to do that. But Laca has a really important quality, which is that he makes the people around him better.” Lacazette’s impressive link-up play was certainly a big part of Arsenal’s impressive run around the turn of the year. While he may not have been scoring, he was creating goals for others, contributing seven assists in 10 games between the defeat at Everton on December 7 and the 3-2 win at Watford on March 6. But the 30-year-old has not set up a goal since that success at Vicarage Road, with opposition teams seemingly having worked out that stopping him coming deep can nullify the Arsenal attack. In the 90 minutes he was on the pitch against Brighton last weekend, Lacazette made just eight passes and had just 22 touches – fewer than any other player who started the game. He also failed to have a single shot. The issue for Arteta is the decision he made in January to reduce his attacking options have left him with very little alternative to the out-of-form Lacazette. Arsenal’s manager appears unwilling to give Martinelli a go as his central striker, leaving him with just Eddie Nketiah – another player who is out of contract in the summer. With a spot in next season’s Champions League on the line, it was a major gamble to let Aubameyang leave without bringing in a replacement. Arteta described it as a ""brave"" decision. If things don’t turn around quickly, however, it will ultimately be viewed as a foolish one. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

43,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-versatility-wright-phillips-chelsea-usmnt/blt3a1e91a441c2d564,Chelsea and USMNT star Pulisic doing ‘well rather than excellent’ because of versatility says Wright-Phillips,"Christian Pulisic is paying the price for his versatility at Chelsea says Shaun Wright-Phillips, with the United States international doing “well rather than excellent” because he has been unable to nail down a set position in Thomas Tuchel’s plans. The USMNT star moved to Stamford Bridge from Borussia Dortmund in 2019 and has made more than 100 appearances for the Blues, becoming a history-making Champions League winner in the process. He has however suffered his fair share of injuries while also being shifted around in the current campaign to provide cover in a false nine striking role and as a right wing-back. At 23 and with a leading role as captain of his country, Wright-Phillips remains a big fan of Pulisic with the former Blues winger telling GOAL in association with Lord Ping: “That tends to be the way of football when you can play a lot of positions, you just do well rather than excellent. ""I can imagine that if he just played in his normal position, you would see why they bought him in the first place.” He added on the fight an American forward faces for recognition in west London: “I wouldn’t say there is too much competition because I’m a big fan of Pulisic. I love the way he plays, I love how dangerous he looks. “The thing he has found tough is staying fit. When he has gone into great form, he will get an injury and then it puts him back a bit, players come in and they are in form and the manager can’t drop them. ""He has got everything that people believed was there, it’s just that every time he has got on that roll and started becoming that Christian Pulisic that everyone wants to see, he breaks down again.” While Pulisic remains part of the long-term thinking at Chelsea, questions continue to be asked of whether Romelu Lukaku will see the second spell with the club cut as short as his first. The Belgian striker was signed from Inter for £98 million ($128m) in summer 2021, but has registered only 12 goals in 36 appearances and is no longer guaranteed a starting berth. Wright-Philips said: “I’m not sure how he’s going to handle or react to it. We can see that it hasn’t gone as well as he wanted it to go. “When he first started in his first game against Arsenal, he was like a man possessed and he was phenomenal in that game – Chelsea in general were. ""Since that game, Chelsea have played completely different. I don’t think that has benefited Rom. Either they go back to playing that way or Rom changes his game. It’s more of a sit down between him and the manager and come to an understanding of how they are going to play and what he needs to do better, and then move on from there. “For me, he always wanted to play for Chelsea. I don’t think he would not want to play for them. “It’s just, in the games that he has come on, he has had chances and the Rom we all know would put those chances away. You can see sometimes that he is a bit low on confidence. Some players are like that and maybe just need an arm round them and a little bit of belief. ""[Timo] Werner went through it and played every game regardless of how many times he missed chances or didn’t play well. With Rom, for some reason, that has not really been happening.” Another linked with a move away from Chelsea is Callum Hudson-Odoi, with the 21-year-old winger struggling to find form and fitness. Wright-Phillips says the highly-rated home-grown product has some big career calls to make in the near future. “It’s always been an interesting one,” Wright-Phillips said. “I would put him and Ruben Loftus-Cheek in that same bracket, where they have just been on the periphery all this time – in, out – they have never gone in and stayed in for a run of games, especially not in the positions they want to play. “They need to both decide what they want to do. They should both have two or three full seasons under their belt and that would have helped them to mature, and we would possibly have seen the players that we always thought were there, but to have one out on loan and then go back to Chelsea, they just stay there and do what they are doing now.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The consortium, headed by the family who already own the Chicago Cubs baseball team in the United States, had partnered with U.S. billionaires Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert in efforts to seize control in west London from the departing Roman Abramovich. Those plans have now been shelved, with suggestions those involved in the bid have been unable to decide on the final make up of any deal. The consortium said in a statement released on Friday: “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert Group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea FC. “In the process of finalising their proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. “We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans, and we wish the new owners well.” Final offers for Chelsea had to be on the table and passed to the Raine Group, the bank handling the sale of the Premier League heavyweights, on Thursday. With the Ricketts family – who had faced protests against their bid - out of the running, three parties remain in the race. Steve Pagliuca, Sir Martin Broughton and Todd Boehly are now battling for ownership of the Blues. “The Ricketts pulling out might seem like they've succumbed to pressure from sections of the fan base over their bid but sources suggest that wasn't the reason. “In fact, they had successfully managed to get some of the match-going support onside through several meetings. “Them pulling out at the final hour is a big surprise but owes more to them not being able to agree on a deal amongst the various billionaires Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert about how much they own and what they put in.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The England international midfielder has been starring away from Stamford Bridge at Crystal Palace but will be denied the opportunity to line up for the Eagles at Wembley on Sunday due to the terms of the season-long agreement put in place last summer. Palace had hoped Chelsea would break from tradition and give a green light for Gallagher to figure in a historic event for the south London side – with Derby previously allowed to field Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount when facing the Blues – but player and club have been left disappointed. Eagles boss Patrick Vieira has questioned why Chelsea are deciding to block the 22-year-old playmaker, saying: “It’s not the best rule because the only one who will lose is Conor. “There’s a semi-final, it’s a really exciting game about how you will manage yourself and prepare yourself to play that game, then there’s playing that kind of game and the importance of it. “It’s an experience the player is missing and I’m disappointed for him. He has played all the games so far and if there’s somebody who deserves to be in the semi-final, it’s him because of his performances, so I’m disappointed he won’t be able to play.” This is a Conor Gallagher workrate appreciation tweet 🙌 pic.twitter.com/dbhv7ipI0o Tuchel said: “I had the chance to speak to Conor, I could also see his frustration. We met some weeks ago, after the national break by coincidence. We ran into each other in a restaurant and we had a chat. ""The subject came up, I apologised because I know how competitive he is and I like him a lot, I know his character very well and was a pleasure to have him here in pre-season. “This is the way it is. We play to win the game and the rules were clear when we made the loan. “I can totally understand Patrick Vieira and the disappointment of Conor but these are the rules when we did the loan and we don’t want to suffer from our rules.” Chelsea are due to lock horns with local rivals Palace at Wembley on Sunday, with the winners going on to face either Liverpool or Manchester City in the final.

Pogba returned to United from Juventus in a club record £89 million ($116m) deal in 2016, having earned a repuation as one of the top midfielders in Europe at the Allianz Stadium. The Frenchman has since recorded 39 goals and 51 assists in 231 games for the Red Devils, but has only managed to pick up League Cup and Europa League honours, with injury problems preventing him from reaching his full potential. A hamstring issue forced Pogba to miss this season's festive period, and he has only managed one goal in 25 appearances to date, with his latest underhelming showing coming from the bench in a 1-0 loss to Everton. Meulensteen worked with the 28-year-old during his first spell in Manchester, and has suggested that his talents are not best suited to the Premier League. The Dutch coach, who worked as Sir Alex Ferguson's No.2 between 2007 and 2013, thinks the time has come for Pogba to move on, as he told Stadium Astro: ""Failure is a big word, but has Pogba lived up to the expectations? I don’t think so. ""He knew what the expectations were when he came back, to compete for the Premier League and the Champions League. ""Not everything has clicked with the players around him or the system, does he actually suit the Premier League? ""What frustrated me a little bit is Paul has never really outspoken his commitment to United. He’s never come out there and said he’s going to stay and bring United back to where they belong. ""There’s always been issues over his future and that doesn’t sit well with the fans. It’s not just one player though, there’s many more issues that need to be addressed before United are going to get back on the right track. ""Since he’s come back it hasn’t really happened for him or Manchester United. I think he will leave now."" Pogba's current contract is due to expire on June 30 and there has not yet been any sign of him agreeing on an extension at Old Trafford. The World Cup winner has said he is waiting before making a final decision on his future, but has also hinted at a possible switch to Paris Saint-Germain, who have been strongly linked with the midfielder in recent months. Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Pogba and a potential return to Juve has been mooted, but he would welcome a move to Parc des Princes to link up with more of his international colleagues. ""Why not? It's always nice to play with your team-mates in the national team and club,"" he has said when asked if he can see himself playing for PSG one day.

The Red Devils' record signing returned to Old Trafford to much fanfare in 2016, but has thus far failed to live up to his lofty price tag with inconsistent displays. And with the France international's contract set to run out in the summer, Rooney feels it's time for the 29-year-old to move on. “I think it’s got to the point now where it’s probably better if he moves on,” Rooney told Sky Sports. “If Paul is honest with himself, he's probably not had the impact he would have liked since he returned. “I watch him play for France and it’s a completely different player. His ability, his vision, control of the game is there in every game for France. “It hasn’t quite worked for him at Manchester United and I think there’s a few players they need to let go.” Pressed on why it hasn't worked out for Pogba at Old Trafford, Rooney added: “There hasn’t been a settled manager since Alex Ferguson. So whoever comes in, they (the board) need to give him time to build up relationships with players.” Man Utd are in the market for a new head coach at the end of the season, with Ralf Rangnick currently filling an interim position at the club. Rooney has given former Spurs and current PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino his backing over Ajax's Erik ten Hag, although stressed again that whoever comes in will need time to stamp their authority and vision on the club. “For managers now, they need time to put their blueprint on the club. If you give him time he’d do well. He knows how to work with top class players and young players, and I think you need to get that blend right because they can’t afford to fail again.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Jose Mourinho would subsequently re-sign Pogba and bring him back to Old Trafford for a then world-record fee, but the France star's brother said he may not have left if not for his advice. Speaking to So Foot, when asked if he pushed Pogba to sign for Juventus, Mathias said: ""Not just a little pushed: it was thanks to me that he signed there! ""I convinced him, 100%.And look at the player he has become.In Manchester, he was given false promises."" When asked what role he plays in Pogba's career, Mathias added: ""The role of big brother, quite simply: no more, no less.I will advise him until my death."" The talented Frenchman has 229 appearances across all competitions to date, scoring 39 goals and notching up 51 assists in around six years. In Pogba's time with the Red Devils, he's won the Europa League and Carabao Cup, and recently admitted he regrets not winning more trophies.

Liverpool and Manchester City play each other for the second time in a week on Saturday in the FA Cup semi-final and results in midweek have, most likely, set us up for a third meeting in the Champions League final. The two cup competitions will be decided in straight head-to-heads between the clubs, but a 2-2 draw in the Premier League meeting last Sunday means there is no such simplicity here. Instead, we must look to where they might drop points over their seven remaining games. And they will almost certainly drop points. A theory has prevailed that Man City and Liverpool will repeat their 2018-19 run-in form by winning all their remaining games, but a remarkable situation happening once before is not enough evidence to assume it will happen again. For starters, the Premier League as a whole is much stronger than it was three years ago. Liverpool’s final seven matches that year were against: woeful Cardiff City, Newcastle United, and Huddersfield teams; a Southampton side only just taken over by Ralph Hasenhuttl; a Chelsea team in disarray at the end of Maurizio Sarri’s tenure; a Wolves team with nothing left to play for; and a strong Tottenham Hotspur, who were beaten by an injury-time own goal. Man City played: very defensive teams Brighton, Cardiff, and Crystal Palace; safely mid-table Burnley and Leicester City; a free-falling Manchester United; and Spurs, whom they beat 1-0 in an edgy match. Things look harder this time, so here’s where and how Liverpool and Man City may drop points in the weeks ahead… The biggest obstacle in Liverpool’s path is a home game against Tottenham on May 7. It might also be the final hurdle. With so little on the line for their opponents, it seems unlikely that Aston Villa (a), Southampton (a), and Wolves (h) will put up much resistance in Liverpool’s final three matches – should Jurgen Klopp’s team have momentum by then. Before the Spurs game, they ought to fairly easily beat a Man Utd team playing without any direction or motivation. Everton at home looks particularly difficult, however. Frank Lampard’s side have struggled consistently when asked to play adventurously by their new manager, but suddenly find focus when allowed to scrap from a deeper defensive position – as in the 1-0 win over Man Utd (37 per cent possession) or last-minute 1-0 defeat to Man City (31% possession) The added motivation of the Merseyside derby means Everton can play a frustration game, packing the final third with players and throwing bodies on the line. What’s more, in Richarlison and Anthony Gordon they have attackers who are better on the counter, capable of breaking Liverpool’s high line via the distribution of Abdoulaye Doucoure and Alex Iwobi. But more likely, it will all come down to the Spurs match. Antonio Conte’s side have put together a run of four consecutive wins and now look favourites to get fourth thanks to the manager’s meticulously choreographed counters, built through Harry Kane dropping short as Dejan Kulusevski and Heung-Min Son make diagonal runs on the shoulder. Along with the quick switches of play, and the longer passes from centre-backs to advanced wing-backs, Spurs have exactly the direct and transitional strategy to evade Liverpool’s counter-press before bursting in behind Klopp’s dangerously high line. Those are the two matches Liverpool fans need to be most wary of. For them to emerge victorious, more than anything else they need Mohamed Salah to rediscover his goalscoring touch; he is without a goal from open play since mid-February. If Salah can hit another purple patch Liverpool should be okay, because they are less vulnerable to the sort of breaks Spurs or Everton could enact if able to surge into the lead. When Klopp’s team look like they can score with every attack – when Salah looks like he will score with every touch – the opponent becomes too frightened to hurt them on the counter. On paper, Man City’s task is easier, but they have three matches that should concern their supporters – and they just happen to be their final three games of the campaign. Should Liverpool still be a point behind at this stage, they can be quietly confident. Man City aren’t threatened by counters like Liverpool, but instead by tight defences able to grind out 0-0 draws like Southampton and Crystal Palace have managed this season. The first that could end like this is a trip to Wolves (although this postponed fixture does not currently have a date, May 10 is pretty much the only one available). Bruno Lage’s side, still chasing a European place, have a decent ‘Big Six’ record this season and, crucially, have not lost any of these games by more than a single goal. In a nervy contest at Molineux, it is certainly possible Pep Guardiola’s side will be held by a well-organised defence that has been a thorn in City’s side in the past; Wolves were very unlucky to lose 1-0 in the reverse fixture, a Raheem Sterling penalty the difference. Next up is West Ham at the London Stadium, one of the most difficult places for a ‘Big Six’ team to visit. David Moyes’ side have beaten Liverpool, Spurs, and Chelsea at home this season. They also drew 0-0 with Man City in the EFL Cup and were unlucky in a 2-1 defeat at the Etihad. In that game in particular, Moyes showed his powerful midfield partnership of Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek can, from a low block, seriously frustrate Man City, slowing them right down to produce some stale sideways possession. The added pressure of the title race only increases the likelihood that the Hammers will grind out a point, even if they might now have a Europa League final to look forward to three days later, having qualified for the semi-finals on Thursday night. Finally, though least likely, Aston Villa at home is a potential banana skin for the simple reason that Steven Gerrard would be desperate to help Liverpool win the title. Villa will no doubt be highly motivated, and their aggression through central midfield made them very competitive in a 2-1 defeat to Man City at the Etihad. Liverpool can get caught on the break, Man City can get suffocated by a deep defence. Points will be dropped over the coming weeks. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

50,https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-will-finish-strong-liverpool-boss-klopp-unconcerned-by/blt6256fb28b0dfd613,'Salah will finish strong' - Liverpool boss Klopp unconcerned by star man's goalscoring slump,"Jurgen Klopp has backed Mohamed Salah to rediscover his best form as Liverpool target a glorious end to the campaign. The Egyptian is the Reds’ leading goalscorer this season with 28 goals in all competitions, and is on course for a third Premier League Golden Boot award too. But he hasn’t found the net in open play since February 19, netting three penalties in 10 games since. Asked about Salah’s recent form, and if he was backing the 29-year-old to come good during the run-in, Klopp told reporters: “Yeah, yeah. It’s just in our business the problem we have is that in January he had the most intense period in his whole career. “The [Afcon] tournament went until the wire. They [Egypt] played in the final, they had all these 120 minutes, the role he has is super, super massive. There is a huge responsibility on his shoulders with dressing room meetings and stuff like this with no recovery at all. “Then you have the issue of being a superstar in your own country and everyone wanting something from you. It is all super intense. Again – that is ok for the boys. But now we are in a period where there is no down (time?) and that is completely normal. “A player like Mo who likes to dribble – and he is really good, he scored outstanding goals with dribbling. Do I say to him ‘don’t dribble?’ No! It is dribble in the right moments and keep the ball, keep it simple – all these kind of things. “But the boys here are focused every day.  I know that Mo will finish strong. It’s just at the moment we have to reset because each game for us is a final.” Klopp was speaking ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup semi final against Manchester City at Wembley, the latest in a long line of ‘must-win’ games as the Reds pursue a historic ‘quadruple’ of trophies. The Reds boss, though, was again quick to downplay that idea, stressing the scale of the task facing his side. He said: “[At] this club it is so difficult to do something that our fathers and grandfathers didn’t do already. This specific thing, nobody did it in this club. So it is really special. “But yeah, I know. If that is the success this year, it will not be seen as success in the future. “It is always intense. This year is especially intense but it is enjoyable and exciting. “Is it likely that we win the four competitions? No. Three competitions? No. One more? Hopefully. That would be nice!” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, leaving thousands dead and millions more forced to flee their homes, while Zinchenko and other Ukrainians abroad have been forced to watch on in horror. Zinchenko has been vocal in his condemnation of Russia's military aggression, and spared no detail as he raged against those who attempt to deny the reality of the situation in his homeland. Speaking to the Guardian, Zinchenko said: “It’s a nightmare. A shock to the whole world, the things they have done there. Terrible, scary things. They killed our civilians. They killed our children. They raped our women and girls. They killed our dogs and even ate them. I cannot even begin to describe how I feel about them. “I hate them so much, for everything they have done to the Ukrainian people and Ukraine. I hate the people in Russia who are trying to convince others that this is propaganda. It’s embarrassing. How can they say this? ""People send me the real pictures, the real facts. The bodies of our dead civilians were lying on the ground for two weeks. They have to take responsibility for this.” Zinchenko and other Ukrainian footballers in England have been supported by their clubs and fans - he was made Man City captain for their FA Cup clash against Peterborough, with fans in the stands carrying Ukraine flags and other banners in support. However, Zinchenko thinks footballers could do more to condemn the violence, particularly those in Russia - where he played for two years with FC Ufa - and said silence equates acceptance and support for the invasion. Zinchenko said: “I have friends over there, a small circle, but now it has reduced almost to nothing. I’m so disappointed. ""The guys I know called me as soon as the invasion happened, texted me: ‘I’m so sorry Alex, but we can’t do anything.’ Of course you can. If you stay silent it means you support what is happening in Ukraine right now, and I can’t see why they would. ""Maybe they are scared, because we see pictures on social media of Russians being taken to prison if they protest. But look at footballers in particular, or anyone with a massive audience. ""Can you believe that, if all of them posted something on Instagram at the same time saying: ‘Guys, we are against the war, we need to stop it,’ they would all be arrested? Of course they would not. It’s such a shame that they say nothing.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Palace and Chelsea are due to face off for a place in the FA Cup final in a London derby clash at Wembley on April 17. The Eagles sent a request to Chelsea for Gallagher to be allowed special dispensation to play, despite current FA rules preventing loan players from featuring against their parent clubs, which was denied last week. The terms of Gallagher's loan deal also stipulate that he cannot line up against Chelsea, but they could have given the green light for changes to be made. Vieira cannot understand why they didn't, because the midfielder will now miss out on the chance to play in one of the biggest games on the domestic calendar, which he feels would have been a deserved reward for his performances throughout the 2021-22 campaign. “It’s not the best rule because the only one who will lose is Conor,"" the Palace boss said in his latest press conference. ""There’s a semi-final, it’s a really exciting game about how you will manage yourself and prepare yourself to play that game, then there’s playing that kind of game and the importance of it. “It’s an experience the player is missing and I’m disappointed for him. He has played all the games so far and if there’s somebody who deserves to be in the semi-final, it’s him because of his performances, so I’m disappointed he won’t be able to play. “The decision forChelsea to send him on loan is to play these kind of games. We have as a group an opportunity to play an important game and that game would have given him more confidence and belief. We could lose but for him to have been on the field is what he needs to keep developing himself. ""Since he has been with us, he has been fantastic and for him not to have a chance to get involved in that game, it is something frustrating for his development. I feel for him because he wanted to play in that game — every player would want to play in that game.” Gallagher has recorded eight goals and five assists in 31 appearances across all competitions for Palace since joining the club on loan from Chelsea last July. The 22-year-old has also broken into the England national team, but Vieira says he hasn't been his usual self since the draw for the FA Cup semi-final was made. ""The next day in training he was affected by that,"" the Frenchman added. ""He knew straightaway that it was a game that he would not have the chance to get involved in. We feel for him. ""He put his head back into training straight away. It will be more difficult when we enter the week of the game.

55,https://www.goal.com/en/news/crystal-palace-gallagher-distance-covered-record-0-0-draw/blt4c71770f2e3b33c8,'I can't feel my legs!' - Crystal Palace's Gallagher hits distance covered record in 0-0 draw with Man City,"Conor Gallagher said that he could not feel his legs after setting the club's season record for distance covered in a match as Crystal Palace held Manchester City to a 0-0 draw. Patrick Vieira's Eagles frustrated Pep Guardiola's Citizens to deliver a new twist in the Premier League title race, helped in no small part by the energetic presence of the Chelsea loanee and England international. Speaking after the final whistle at Selhurst Park, Gallagher paid tribute to his side's effort in keeping the champions goalless throughout a tough encounter, while adding that he will need to rest his body after his exertions. ""We will take a point against them and it was really deserved,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I can't feel my legs, every one of the boys worked so hard, we gave everything and I'm proud of the team. I'm struggling to talk and my legs have gone. ""You could see our game plan, to be organised and try to catch them on the counter attack. It was a very good performance from us. Before the game we had the belief we would win. We have played well and got good results, but we're happy with the point. ""They are one of the best teams in the world and to do that against them twice is amazing and shows what we can do as a team."" At 12.5km covered in Monday's match, Gallagher comfortably not only made up the most ground on the night for his side but set the mark by any Palace player in a single top-flight performance this season. It further burnishes his reputation as a hard worker too, with the midfielder having led the way in 15 of his 25 Premier League starts for the club when measured by distance covered.

There is still plenty of potential to be unlocked in the 19-year-old's game as he is tipped to reach the very top in the years to come. For now though, the USMNT and BVB star is focused on trying to stay fit and in form, with untimely injury setbacks stunting his progress. So how many games has he been forced to sit out at club level? GOAL takes a look... Reyna has struggled with a number of muscle problems since arriving on the senior stage. Giovani Reyna is forced off in tears just 30 minutes into his first start since August 💔 pic.twitter.com/8OGfEAo4kw With his body still growing and adjusting to the demands being placed on it, the odd setback is to be expected. He has however been spending more time in various treatment rooms than he would have liked, with important fixtures for club and country being sat out. You can see Giovanni Reyna’s full Dortmund injury history in the table below. Injury Date Games missed Muscular problems May 18-May 21, 2020 0 Infection June 15-June 18, 2020 1 Infection Jan 14-Jan 18, 2021 1 Muscular problems Mar 4-Mar 11, 2021 2 Muscle injury Sep 6-Nov 29, 2021 16 Fitness Nov 29, 2021-Jan 24, 2022 9 Ill Feb 10-Feb 17, 2022 2 Hamstring injury Feb 21-Mar 7, 2022 2 Muscle injury Apr 9-June 30, 2022 5 TOTAL 38 Reyna was born in England during his father Claudio’s time at Sunderland. He moved to the United States at the age of five, as his family settled in New York, and joined the academy ranks at New York City FC in 2015. After four years spent catching the eye in the Big Apple, the highly-rated midfielder spread his wings and headed for Germany as fellow countryman Christian Pulisic had done before him. Impressive progress was made in Dortmund, to the point that a senior debut was made for Bundesliga heavyweights against Augsburg at the age of 17 on January 18, 2020, breaking Pulisic’s record as the youngest American to appear in the German top-flight. A first professional goal was recorded in the DFB-Pokal meeting with Werder Bremen on February 4, before going on to make his Champions League bow later that month. Reyna found the target in a Bundesliga fixture for the first time in September 2020, against Borussia Monchengladbach, and delivered a hat-trick of assists in a league clash with Freiburg a few weeks later. He was voted U.S. Soccer’s Young Male Player of the Year for 2020 and went on to inherit the No 7 shirt at Dortmund from Jadon Sancho in the summer of 2021. In August of that year, during an outing against Hoffenheim, Reyna became the youngest player to reach 50 appearances in the Bundesliga. On an international stage, his debut for the United States came during a meeting with Wales on November 12, 2020 – the day before his 18th birthday. He recorded as first goal for his country in his next match, converting a free-kick against Panama, and he recently helped the USMNT to book their place at the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar.

Reyna has missed over 100 days of the 2021-22 campaign due to injury, featuring in just 13 games across all competitions as a result. The 19-year-old started in BVB's latest Bundesliga outing against Stuttgart on Friday, having only just returned from a serious hamstring issue, but only lasted six minutes before limping off. Reyna was moved to tears and had to be consoled by his team-mates as he made his way towards the tunnel, with Dortmund going on to win the match 2-0 in his absence. The German giants have now revealed the full extent of his injury in an official statement on their website, which reads: ""Midfielder Gio Reyna, who had to be substituted early in the game, suffered a muscle and tendon injury. ""The season is over for the American."" Dortmund went on to provide updates on Mats Hummels and Mahmoud Dahoud, who also picked up injuries against Stuttgart. ""Central defender Mats Hummels, who was unable to continue the game after half-time, will be out for several weeks due to a muscle injury in his thigh,"" the statement adds. ""Midfielder Mo Dahoud's shoulder injury will require further investigation in the coming days."" Dortmund boss Marco Rose offered Reyna some reassuring words of praise after seeing him suffer another major fitness setback. ""Gio will be a world-class player,"" the head coach said after the Stuttgart game. ""He's a top lad with unbelievable qualities. We'll help him to get properly back on his feet."" BVB will play their next fixture without Reyna against Wolfsburg on April 16, seven days before a crunch Der Klassiker showdown against Bayern, who are sitting nine points ahead of them at the top of the table.

Reyna was forced off just six minutes into their 2-0 win over Stuttgart on Friday to further compound a season fractured by frequent fitness woes. Despite the time spent on the medical table, his manager believes he can be one of the best on the planet and says Dortmund will ensure he comes back fighting.

Since his senior debut at the start of 2020, the 19-year-old has marked himself out as an exciting talent. In his first full season with Dortmund, he helped the club to DFB-Pokal success against RB Leipzig, while he has already amassed a dozen caps for the USMNT. This season has seen him rocked by a succession of injuries, with Friday's setback the latest in a long line that could threaten his hopes of making the 2022 World Cup.

The Gunners were bested by Graham Potter's team at the Emirates Stadium, dealing a blow to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season. Arsenal have now lost two matches in a row, having also lost 3-0 to Crystal Palace in the league on Monday. Arteta says his side must take a critical look at their performance again following the latest set back. ""What happens is we criticise ourselves a lot again. Get slapped again because we deserve it a lot and we were really poor in the first half and then lift ourselves up,"" he told reporters. ""We know this road is taking ourselves nowhere, especially with where we want to be. ""We have everything to play for in the last eight games and we have to have that energy and visualise the beautiful challenge that we have ahead and not sit back and see what happens."" ""We were sloppy on the ball again,"" he said. ""We were second best in several situations, we didn’t gain any momentum, we didn’t show any purpose in the game, we didn’t play with the right speed and transform the game that Brighton proposed today. ""The first chance they had, the only chance they had I think, they scored. We created a cold atmosphere that we weren’t comfortable with, but when we tried to change it, it was too late. ""It was great not to give up but it was too late."" Arteta added: ""We created [the cold atmosphere]. ""The fans were here and they were exceptional, and you can see the moment we gave them something, what we tried. ""We played a game where you could not see the purpose or the intention of what the team was trying to do and like what can they do? Nothing.

However, VAR intervened to upset the Gunners, but it took a long delay for the call to be made. Four minutes had gone before for the footage had been reviewed and the officials finally came to the decision that the goal would not stand. Brighton took the lead against Arsenal in the first half through a goal from Leandro Trossard. Martinelli appeared to have pulled the home side level just before half-time, but the striker was level with the goalkeeper and his celebration was cut short as the goal had to be reviewed by VAR. It took almost four minutes for the officials to decide that the goal should not stand, causing a stir among Arsenal fans. Football fans were outraged by the delay in the decision and took to social media to express their frustration. Am NOT an Arsenal Fan but this was a clear Goal! Var messed up! #ARSBHA pic.twitter.com/1hGYCOBO0B Gabriel Martinelli has the ball in the net for Arsenal, but after consulting the VAR, referee David Coote has overturned the goal because Martinelli was offside in the build-upStill Arsenal 0-1 Brighton (45+4 mins)#ARSBHA Did anyone see the people using VAR draw any lines for that disallowed Martinelli goal? It has to be corruption? That is f*cking ridiculous. Martinelli was clearly ONSIDE. Outrageous decision - and another reason to hate VAR. #ARSBHA VAR was introduced to stop Arsenal from getting Top 4😏 No other explanation😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/2BH8x4aw9G If it’s taking 5 mins to rule out the goal, then it should be given. No concrete evidence Martinelli was offside as well. This is a really poor use of VAR. pic.twitter.com/Vcx4OgZA9e After 36 years of checking, it is confirmed that Martinelli is a millimetre offside, and the goal is disallowed. This sport will be the death of me. Martinelli might have been offside. But not sure there was an angle that conclusively proved it.Feels like the benefit of the doubt went to the defensive team there. The on-field decision should have stood. They’ve disallowed that goal cause they can’t see Cucurella’s foot and therefore it’s not conclusive if Martinelli was onside?The entire point of VAR is stamping out ‘clear and obvious errors’. If they can’t see if he’s onside, it’s not clear or obvious. What a complete joke. The clash at the Emirates Stadium is a crucial one for Mikel Arteta's team. They were fifth in the table as they approached the game, trailing Tottenham in the race for fourth place on goal difference. Enock Mwepu went on to double the home team's misery in the second half by making it 2-0 to Brighton. Martin Odegaard did pull one back for Arsenal in the final minutes, but it was not enough for Arteta's men to rescue a positive result from the clash. What do you think? Should Martinelli's goal have stood? Let us know in the comments! 👇 Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

61,https://www.goal.com/en/news/mathieu-flamini-arsenal-millionaire-entrepreneur-climate/blt7d933bc7c1853983,Mathieu Flamini: From Arsenal utility man to millionaire entrepreneur and climate change crusader,"When footballers retire from playing, they can take a multitude of routes. Some go into coaching or punditry, while others decide to leave the game behind. Few take a leading role in the fight against climate change and the production of renewable energy resources. Mathieu Flamini may have had a steady career as a utility footballer who played for Marseille, Arsenal and AC Milan, among others, but what he has done after hanging up his boots has proven pretty spectacular. Flamini came through the Marseille academy, breaking into the first team in 2003-04 and playing in the UEFA Cup final that season. This caught the attention of Arsene Wenger, with Arsenal swooping to sign Flamini on his first professional contract, a move which infuriated then-OM manager Jose Anigo. ""It's a great betrayal. He used me well. It's good for the money that he didn't sign pro with us. His sporting argument that he was afraid of playing less no longer holds,"" said Anigo. ""My outlook will never be the same again."" Anigo's warnings that Flamini would struggle to break into the Gunners first team proved initially inaccurate, as, after a season of settling in, he was crucial in Arsenal's 2005-06 campaign, playing in 49 matches across all competitions as they reached the Champions League final. However, Flamini never really mastered the midfield anchor role that his energy, intelligence and ability should have made him ideal for. Instead, his positional flexibility, along with his strong work rate and team ethic, turned him into a utility man, deployed at full-back and wide midfield as well as in his best central midfield role, often coming on as a sub while Cesc Fabregas and Gilberto Silva filled the starting roles. There were some moments of brilliance, such as his long-range strike against Newcastle in January 2008 that was voted among the 50 greatest Arsenal goals of all time, but they were frustratingly fleeting, for fans and player. Flamini chose to move on at the end of his four-year deal, signing for Milan, where he continued to be the jack of all trades, initially playing at right-back before being moved to midfield. He helped Milan to the 2010-11 Scudetto – their last Serie A title at the time of writing – before a knee injury that summer ruled him out for almost the entirety of the subsequent campaign. Released by Milan in 2013, he returned to Arsenal initially to train and maintain fitness before signing permanently. He was part of the squads which won back to back FA Cups in 2014 and 2015, however was an unused sub in both games, having also been left out for the Gunners' previous triumph in 2005. Flamini departed Arsenal for the final time in 2016 – remarkably having never lost a Premier League match at home for the club – and after stints with Crystal Palace and Getafe, he retired from professional football, and moved full time into a second career which looks to be far more meaningful than his first. During his football career, in 2008, Flamini co-founded GF Biochemicals, the first company in the world to mass-produce levulinic acid, which is regarded as potentially being key in the production of more environmentally friendly biofuels. It can also be used in biodegradable herbicides, plus in several other household items, like air fresheners and perfumes, as well as in plastics and pharmaceuticals. A genuine entrepreneur, Flamini's worth is estimated at around €20 million (£16.7m/$21.7m), enough to dwarf even any Premier League footballer. Different field, but same passion to drive change by doing things better. 🌿👷🏽#positive #impact #sustainable #chemistry #greenchemistry #biobased #chimieverte #tech #technology #innovation #plantbased pic.twitter.com/rLxyee25hE ""Growing up by the sea, I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water, on the beach,"" Flamini told the Guardian in August 2020. ""It’s horrendous and makes you realise that, if we don’t change something, the place where we live won’t be liveable any more. ""I was very aware of everything, very curious. I always told myself: ‘If I do something else later on outside football, I want it to be around sustainability.'"" His success in the world of business brought Flamini back around into the Arsenal discussion in November 2020, when unhappiness with the ownership of Stan Kroenke led to rumours the former player could lead a takeover of his old club. While he rejected talk of a takeover at the time, Flamini indicated a return to football at some point is on the cards. He told The Athletic: “Don’t ask me how I’ll be involved in football, because it’s not something I’ve thought about. ""But, definitely, it’s something which I’ve been part of forever in my life. I will always want to be part of this community.” It seems likely that Flamini will return to football at some point in the future – as he plays his part in making sure we all have a future to look forward to.

The former RB Leipzig boss succeeded Bielsa at Elland Road following the latter's dismissal, with the club missing key faces through a slew of fitness problems and facing a fearsome relegation battle. Marsch has since steadied the ship, and helped to breathe new energy into the Whites, but now he admits that his task has been a difficult one given the atmopshere he inherited. ""I could see from just watching games from afar, and talking to people within the club, that the stress levels were incredibly high,"" Marsch told talkSPORT. ""You could see it in their faces. You could see in the 15th minute that some of them were already at the max – and that shouldn’t be the case. ""The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodology. These players were over-trained and it led to them being physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically in a difficult place to recover from week to week, game to game. ""I have a very specific methodology with the way I work and I’ve had a reputation for high running data, but also having healthy, fit, strong players who can meet the standards of the game we want."" While fortunes look to have turned a corner, the American has admitted that it has been a tough task reshaping a Leeds team defined by Bielsa's characteristic style, which he paid tribute to while acknowledging the struggles faced to replace it. ""Marcelo had such a strong man-v-man playing style,"" he added. ""Trying to rip the players away from three-and-a-half years of being instructed to do exactly that, transitioning into what we’re trying to do, has been massively challenging for the players to adapt to. “They’ve worked really hard at it, but they still fall into bad habits, especially when they’re fatigued on the pitch.

Bielsa left the Whites earlier this season with the team in the thick of a relegation battle, but his exit has not dulled the respect that the club, the city and the manager's peers have for his talents. Guardiola has made no secret of his admiration for his fellow tactician, and has now revealed that he thinks if their positions had been reversed, it would only highlight the gulf in quality between the two, despite the Spaniard holding far more honours across his shorter career. Speaking toTelemundo Sports, Guardiola burnished his already famous admiration of the Argentine with the claim that the latter would have conquered more titles than he if gifted control of the Blaugrana - and that he would not have been able to transform his Whites side. ""Give him my Barcelona and you will see how he will win titles,"" he said. ""Give me Leeds, with all due respect to the Leeds players, but I would still be in the Championship."" Much was made of the bond shared between Bielsa and coaches who have been inspired by his methods during the latter's stay with Leeds, but the relationship between him and Guardiola stretches back beyond their Premier League days. The Argentine famously helped persuade the Spaniard to take up coaching near the end of his playing days, and the pair then faced off in the 2012 Copa del Rey final, when Guardiola's Blaugrana beat the former's Athletic Club to the title. Guardiola led the tributes to Bielsa following his dismissal by Leeds in February, describing his stay at Elland Road as ""spectacular"" after he guided a previously struggling Whites team back to the Premier League following their demotion 18 years earlier.

Jesse Marsch's side were held to a draw against the Saints on Saturday, with another wonderful free-kick from James Ward-Prowse doing the damage. It left Leeds shy of winning three on the bounce under the American and prompted some angry responses on social media - and Klich certainly rose to his own defence in particularly blunt terms. Klich was not the only Leeds player to be involved in a social media flashpoint surrounding Leeds' match with Southampton, after midfielder Kalvin Phillips marked his return to action with a pair of distinctive shoes pre-game. The England international was the subject of intense online chatter after sporting what looked to be a set of Cornish Pasty-inspired footwear ahead of kick-off. Leeds currently sit eight points ahead of the bottom three, albeit having played more games than all of their rivals below them, leaving them facing a race to secure their safety.

The incident in question occurred at the end of a 1-0 defeat for the Red Devils at Goodison Park in which a five-time Ballon d’Or drew a blank for the 11th time through 13 club outings in 2022. So what exactly happened and will the Portuguese star be punished for his actions? GOAL takes a look… Ronaldo appeared to knock the phone of a 14-year-old fan to the floor when making his way off the field after a Premier League outing on Merseyside. You can see a video of the incident below. Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of smashing a supporter’s phone after Manchester United’s defeat to Everton 🤬🎥 @evertonhub pic.twitter.com/OkS0mweTTC The Football Association and Merseyside Police have announced that they are looking into the incident, which suggests that Ronaldo may yet face punishment for his actions. The FA has told The Athletic: ""We are aware of the incident and will be seeking observations on the matter from both clubs and the player involved."" Meanwhile, a statement from Merseyside Police read: ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. “Inquiries are underway and officers are currently working with Everton to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place."" Club sources would not confirm whether they would take disciplinary action and any decision on the matter will be taken internally and dealt with as 'a private matter'. The mother of the child in question has alleged that Ronaldo’s actions left her son, who suffers from autism and dyspraxia, with a bruised hand. Sarah Kelly has told the Liverpool Echo: ""(My son) filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was — he didn’t even speak. ""Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son’s hand and carried on walking. “I’d understand if Jake was waving it in his face but he wasn’t near his face, it was down by the floor checking his injury. He’s an autistic boy and he’s been assaulted by a football player, that’s how I see it as a mum.” The mother of the 14-year-old who was the victim of Cristiano Ronaldo's 'phone slap' says Manchester United have handled the situation ""terribly"" and ""just made things even worse"". pic.twitter.com/0SluFTDwVJ She later added that Manchester United had ""handled it terribly"" and ""made things even worse"". ""The way I see it is, if someone assaulted him in the street and then asked us to go around for dinner, we wouldn’t,"" Kelly explained to the Liverpool Echo. ""Just because he’s Cristiano Ronaldo, why would we do it? It’s like we owe him a favour, but I’m sorry, we don’t. ""We’ve kindly declined the offer to go to United because Jake doesn’t want to go there and he doesn’t want to see Ronaldo. He’s made that pretty clear."" Ronaldo crossed the line following a frustrating afternoon against Everton and was quick to offer an apology on social media. He wrote on Instagram: ""It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ""I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.""

My sons ask me to sing the club’s anthem every morning, I am happy, but I’d be happier with a trophy.” Morata has scored 11 goals in all competitions but the season has been a frustrating one so far, with Juve nine points behind leaders Milan with six games remaining as they seek a 10th straight title. They do, however, have a Coppa Italia semi-final with Fiorentina next week to ensure they don't end the campaign empty handed. The former Chelsea striker has also had to deal with increased competition in the form of Dusan Vlahovic, who joined from Fiorentina in January. That could put his long-term future in doubt, with Barcelona reportedly close to agreeing a deal during the winter window, while Arsenal have also been linked with the forward. Morata also praised former team-mate Carlos Tevez for “making him become a footballer.” The Spaniard met up with the former Juventus and Manchester City forward at a recent Serie A game where they reflected on their time together in Turin, including their 2015 Champions League final defeat to Barcelona. Morata admitted he is still frustrated that Juve were not awarded a penalty for a foul on Paul Pogba just minutes after he had levelled the match at 1-1, with Barca going on to score two late goals in a 3-1 win. “In a way, he [Tevez] made me become a footballer,” said Morata. “I was only 21, and I didn’t have much experience. He has become one of the best players ever; Tevez had incredible quality. There aren’t many players like him in history. He would win games single-handedly. “We spoke about football, family, everything. He knows that I’ll be forever grateful to him. There is a small regret. Perhaps there was a penalty for us in the [Champions League] Final against Barcelona, but that’s how life is.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

As the premier club competition in Europe and arguably the world, it is a stage that has been graced by countless icons of football. Striking sensations such as Raul and Andriy Shevchenko dominated during the 1990s and 2000s, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have taken the art of scoring to a whole new level. Goal takes a look at the all-time top scorers in the competition's history, dating back to the inaugural European Cup in 1955. As you can see from our table below, Cristiano Ronaldo is the top scorer in the history of the Champions League (including the European Cup). Heis closely followed by his arch-rival,Lionel Messi. There is a significant gulf between that pair and the rest, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski following in third. Karim Benzema follows in fourth, while Raul completesthe top five, with the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Thomas Muller and Thierry Henry among the best of the rest. *Correct as of March 14,2021**The list takes into consideration data from 1955-present***Players in bold are still active The composition of the all-timegoalscorers list is mostly made up of players who are playing or played in the modern Champions League era (i.e. 1992 onwards) which has added more contintental games to the modern day calendar.Specifically, of the 20 players in the list above, 15 of them played from the mid 1990s on.  However, despite that,two players who played in the pre-Champions League era (when the tournament was known as the European Cup)still figure prominently, with former Real Madrid star Alfredo di Stefano and Benfica icon Eusebio featuring in and around the top 10. Ferenc Puskas , who shone for Real Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, isalso in the top 20. Former Bayern Munich striker Gerd Muller was in the top 20 before being edged out by Mohamed Salah. Despite being nudged out, no player comes remotely close to Gerd Muller's phenomenal goals-per-game ratio of 0.95. Puskas boasted a goal-to-game ratio of 0.85 and Di Stefano's was 0.84, while Messi's is currently 0.8, which is undoubtedly the best in the modern era.

Chelsea justify Hayes' dismissal of Arsenal as Women's FA Cup triumph seals treble win,"“Playing against Arsenal as Chelsea manager is always a great game for us,” Emma Hayes told the press before Sunday’s Women’s FA Cup final against the Gunners. “But it has never been our rival game. Manchester City has always been that. “This is a London derby so it's slightly different. There's a lot more fan involvement, press interest, but I've always thought the bigger game was us versus Man City over the years.” It’s the type of quote that could have become infamous, one to fire up the opponent just days before the showpiece event at Wembley in front of a record crowd. In the end, the Gunners didn’t show too many glimpses of making Hayes eat her words. Chelsea were ruthless from the off, the frantic nature of the game suiting their transitional style best as only Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger stopped them putting the game to bed before half-time. In the end, her efforts were in vain as the Blues emerged 3-0 winners. Arsenal didn’t have a shot on target all game. Chelsea had eight and hit the woodwork a further two times. Treble winners 🏆🔵 pic.twitter.com/eQnE6nMsfv With this the final from last season’s competition, due to Covid-19 disruptions, it doesn’t only make Chelsea FA Cup winners either. Indeed, after their league and Continental Cup triumphs, it makes them treble winners. In the latter competition, Arsenal were knocked out in the group stage. In the league, they finished third, nine points off the top. After the Gunners’ 3-2 win over the Blues at the Emirates to kick off the season, and their unbeaten league form that has them top of the Women’s Super League table, they are certainly making progress after a couple of difficult years under former coach Joe Montemurro. However, this game showed that those who doubted the significance of that result on the opening weekend had a point. With Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby among those on the Chelsea bench, after long summers with their national teams, the Blues weren’t at full strength. With ‘Kerrby’ on the pitch at Wembley, it was quite a different story. First goal – it was Kerr’s play that caused disruption in the Arsenal defence so Kirby could score. Second goal – it was Kirby’s pass that set Kerr free, and she did the rest. With Kirby substituted off when Kerr put away the third, it was just all about the Aussie’s skill, as she scooped the ball over Zinsberger to seal it. ""That was Fran's best game in a Chelsea shirt,"" Hayes said after the game. ""I thought she ran the show. She got on the ball in dangerous situations, she threaded Sam in on numerous occasions, but also herself was a real threat, a real handful throughout the game. ""I think Sam Kerr, so many wondered how she would handle the English game. As far as I'm concerned she's the best striker in the world and she displayed that when it mattered most. ""She's courageous. She's full of confidence. She can do that after getting off a plane from Sydney, Australia, on Thursday. ""She's a superb athlete, an amazing human, and they are two of many, many characters in this dressing room that are noteworthy for their performances today. ""The second goal was critical in the game. That was so vital just to calm any anxiety or nerves that might have existed. But I don’t think my team played like that today. ""I think everything they did was decisive, was collective, coherent, champion-like. I've said it in recent press conferences, I think we're getting better. I really do."" That’s outrageous! 🤯@samkerr1 with an incredible chip over Zinsberger 🍟@ChelseaFCW #WomensFACupFinal pic.twitter.com/uFEDQlSVbG Arsenal were not at full strength themselves for this final. Leah Williamson was missing, which was a huge absence in central defence, where Kerr and Kirby wreaked havoc. But this was still a team with stars. Vivianne Miedema is one of the most feared forwards in the world. Beth Mead is one of the league’s most in-form players. Kim Little is one of the most talented midfielders on the planet. They were all kept quiet. Arsenal might be making positive strides – there’s no doubt about that – but catching up to the progress Chelsea, and Man City, have made in the last few years will be no easy task. The commitment, investment and time that the Blues have put into this project have been excellent for many years. It got them to a Women’s Champions League final this year and has made them the team to beat in England. Jonas Eidevall is only a few months into his Arsenal tenure. He’s a clever coach, and he has some great players, but it will take time yet until the Gunners’ rivalry with Chelsea means as much to the Blues as their competition with City.

70,https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelonas-uefa-womens-champions-league-triumph-can-inspire/17ir608bafam0znmz518lkqkh,Barcelona's UEFA Women's Champions League triumph can inspire runners-up Chelsea,"When Barcelona head coach Lluis Cortes collected his winners’ medal and lifted the UEFA Women’s Champions League trophy on Sunday night, he could look to his opposite number, Chelsea manager Emma Hayes, and feel real sympathy. Her team had just lost 4-0 in the biggest game in European club football, a game that they had worked relentlessly hard towards not only this season, but for many years. This is a project Chelsea started back in 2012, slowly but surely establishing themselves as a force in England, before translating that onto the European stage in recent seasons. Two years ago, Cortes stood in that same position. His Barca team were 3-0 down inside 20 minutes to Lyon in their first final, outclassed by an opponent with more experience. Fast forward two years, Barcelona had taken Lyon’s role. They raced into an incredible three-goal lead in the same space of time in Gothenburg, using the hurt from Budapest to spur them on.  The experience, tactical lessons and also the growth in quality and chemistry in the team allowed them to come back and become European champions. For Chelsea, that path is there for them to take too. “[Barcelona's] experience counted,” Hayes said after the game. “They had the pain of two years ago and it showed. I think the best two teams in Europe were in the final today. Regardless of the score line, I think the gap is probably a little bit closer than the score line suggests. But I don't think we performed at our best levels.” Barcelona were certainly the better team, a deserved winner and dominant in every sense, but there is no need for an inquest at Chelsea after this, despite how heavy the defeat was. The first two goals were freak incidents after all, though Barca did create plenty around them. The Catalans have had the core of their squad in place for a number of years now, with most of them recruited before the 2019 final. The two years following that defeat have only helped them grow stronger as a unit. With Chelsea, there is not a massive turnover of players every year, but they have added some of their most important pieces very recently – Sam Kerr, Pernille Harder and Melanie Leupolz all signed within the last 18 months. They have settled in brilliantly and thrived from the get-go, but imagine how they will look in this team in two years.   There are obvious issues that will need addressing for Chelsea in the short-term. A lack of depth in defence has threatened to trouble them this season, with versatile and coachable players such as Jess Carter and Niamh Charles helping to combat that. But the pair struggled massively on Sunday in their unnatural full-back roles when faced with Caroline Graham Hansen and Lieke Martens, two of the most talented wingers on the planet. That’s no secret to Hayes, of course, with signings already being made; Aniek Nouwen was added from PSV this week. Barcelona have added small pieces like that each year to complement the talent they already have. They’ve kept the core group together, they’ve learned from setbacks and they’ve just continued on their journey. “In Budapest last time, we were, I suppose, like Chelsea is tonight,” Cortes noted after the game. “It was the same sort of game against Lyon that night. I've said it a lot, because it's the truth - that night we promised ourselves we would work a lot to be European champions at some point.” “We’re the second-best team in Europe,” Hayes said. “That’s a step in the right direction.” There is no doubt that Chelsea have the hunger, the talent and the belief in their project to follow in Barcelona’s footsteps. Some things just can’t be rushed. Some things just need learning curves and time. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

For the first time in thehistory of their women's team, Chelsea will boast that status for a second successive season. On Sunday, they retained their Women's Super League title in style, beating seventh placed Reading 5-0 in a game that oozed the confidence, swagger and style that has allowed them to get their hands on the silverware once more. What made it even more special is that this was the most difficult WSL title to win yet. Hayes described it as ""no doubt my favourite"" after the game, explaining: ""Teams have invested, some heavily. It's not like the competition was, 'Oh Chelsea have spent all the money and the rest haven't'. No. It doesn't work like that. ""I think there were four teams, to be fair, that could have been in with a shout at the title at one point or another. This is the hardest one. The fact that it's gone to the last day demonstrates that."" Manchester City did their best this year - signing World Cup and Champions League winners - but ultimately fell short on the final day. Arsenal and Manchester United dropped off some weeks ago. In the end,Chelsea prevailed, and have now won the WSL a record four times. How did they do it, then? There are a number of ways to explain it.  There are the obvious factors, to start, such as the fact they didn’t lose to Man City, their closest rivals, in either of their league meetings. Two points was the difference between the pair in the end, a gap Chelsea helped establish by beating City 3-1 in October, and not losing the reverse fixture in April. Consistency is another huge element of their success – both in results, with one defeat all season, and in the fact that they’ve now scored in each of their last 80 competitive outings, a streak spanning over two years. But the overriding factor in Sunday’s triumph was best showcased by the 23 players who have featured in the WSL for Chelsea this season coming together to celebrate.It is the depth of Hayes’ squad, but also the way that depth has been utilised throughout the season, that saw them come out on top. Every single player has had a moment this season which has been crucial to this title, be it someone likeSam Kerr, with a Golden Boot-winning 21 goals,or a player like Drew Spence, who has only made two league starts, but acts asa perfect example of the way the depth has been used. 🍦 A scoop from @frankirby is finished off by @samkerr10!#BarclaysFAWSL pic.twitter.com/3ZZK0c1T3U On Wednesday, she came into midfield against Tottenham for a must-win game. Her involvement allowed Melanie Leupolz, one of the stand-out players in the league this year, to be rested for Sunday and, despite Spence not starting as much as others this year, there was no sign of rust. Hayes was full of praise for the midfielder in particular this week, explaining how she's more valuable to the team now than she's ever been. ""Drew has been with me from the very beginning. She's a voice of reason and she's been in this position more than anybody else in this dressing room,"" she explained. The entire squad appreciates what those on the bench bring too. “You've got players who maybe haven't played as much as they wanted to, but they still come into training every day, and they give 110% regardless of what their situation is, or how many minutes they've got,"" Fran Kirby said last month.""I think that is the biggest game-changer for us this year.” Jess Carter and Niamh Charles are among those to have done the same. Since Maren Mjelde suffered a season-endingknee injury in March’s Continental Cup victory, the pair have shared right-back duties, despite neither normally playingthe position. The way they’ve both adapted to playing suddenly more regularly in a role slightly unfamiliar has been ever so impressive. These examples are a testament to the incredible levels in training – something that has been a staple of success at Lyon, the seven-time European champions that Chelsea are trying to emulate. “That's what the environment demands,” Hayes said.   But it’s also evidence of how special this group is when it comes to working for one another.Credit must also be given to their manager for creating an atmosphere that makesplayers want to run through brick walls for each other, and also for signing the right people – not just the best players. One of Hayes’ regular methods for preparing this groupis by showing them motivating videos of stories around the world, not just in sport.Before last week’s Champions League semi-final comeback against Bayern Munich, the inspiration came from UFC fighter Rose Namajunas, the reigning strawweight champion. But the video she’s shown her team that most resonates with their WSL title triumph is oneof, well, geese. “I’ve shown them why they fly in V formations, what its purpose is, what everybody’s role is, how they communicate, how they support each other and, importantly, you fly further together,” Hayes explained. “That’s the bottom line. They wouldn’t be getting from the winter to the sun without going together. It’s the same for my team. Sometimes different people take the lead but, ultimately, where we’re trying to go needs everyone to play a part in it.” Hayes deserves all the credit she gets, as much as she will deflect it, but so does everyone who has played their part in a truly fantastic, record-breakingseason. It's not over yet, though. Next up: the UEFA Women's Champions League final. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

72,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-defence-uswnt-star-macario-five-things-we-learned/bltf8110abc3eec2549,From Chelsea's problematic defence to USWNT star Macario's excellence: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The sixth and final matchday in the Women’s Champions League group stages was certainly not without its drama. Arsenal were all-but-through to the quarter-finals, yet were dealt an incredible scare, while Chelsea and Wolfsburg faced off for what was effectively a winner-takes-all showdown. Here is what we learned from the latest round of action in this season's UWCL... The shock of the week saw Chelsea, last season’s runners-up, crash out in the group stages of this year’s competition, with Wolfsburg hammering them 4-0 in Germany. All four goals were extremely poor from the Blues’ perspective, with the Wolves getting into the channels either side of the opposing centre-backs to cause serious problems. With manager Emma Hayes unable to address the lack of full-back options in the transfer window – despite going after targets – players are out of position in those areas, which certainly brings issues. Wolfsburg took full advantage on Thursday and others in the Women’s Super League will have taken note. Catarina Macario has played in plenty of different positions – in a playmaking midfield role, a little deeper sometimes, and leading the line in a front three. ""I'd say my preferred position would be a false nine,” she told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Soccer Show, before adding: “[But] I'll try to do my best in whatever position.” Where the U.S. women’s national team star is best is up for debate, but one thing is for sure – she can light up a game from absolutely anywhere. On Wednesday, as Lyon secured top spot in their UWCL group with a 4-0 win over Hacken, nobody shone brighter than the 22-year-old, who was back in midfield. In her first full season with the seven-time European champions, Macario is certainly looking at home wherever she’s deployed. With 11 goals in all competitions already, she’s showing every sign of fulfilling her huge potential. To progress to the quarter-finals on Wednesday, Hoffenheim, the UWCL debutantes who are not a full-time team, needed to beat Arsenal, a professional outfit top of the Women’s Super League, by five goals. With 30 minutes to play, it was 4-1 to the German side. They were putting on an incredible show. Unfortunately for them, the Gunners recomposed themselves and didn't concede any more goals. But the result was still huge. Hoffenheim’s starting XI had just two players in it over the age of 24. Teenage winger Jule Brand shone, scoring the opener, while another 19-year-old, Gia Corley, was electric in midfield. They may not have made it out of the group, but this experience of the group stages – where they won three out of six games and played the reigning European champions, Barcelona, twice – will stand them in good stead for the future. Given how they look right now, that’s incredibly exciting. 🇩🇪 Gia Corley vs Arsenal:22 touches7/9 passes completed(4/4 in final third)3/4 dribbles completed1 foul won1 assistBrilliant first half from the teenager. Every time she touches the ball, she - and Hoffenheim - look dangerous. #UWCL When Leah Williamson was diagnosed with a ""significant"" hamstring injury last month, everyone knew it would have an impact on Arsenal, such is her quality. A centre-back who rarely makes mistakes, adds pace to the defence and has a cool head, her presence has been missed massively in the six games the Gunners have played since, most notably in the Women’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea earlier this month. That was highlighted again on Wednesday against Hoffenheim. While there were other factors in their defeat, and Williamson’s presence wouldn’t have solved all their problems, Arsenal need to find a new formula to cope with her absence if they are to maintain pole position in the WSL title race. The group-stage format has been something for all fans to enjoy. For the clubs involved, it's been a welcome change, too, but it is demanding, in terms of extra games and more travel. The fixture pile-up has certainly had an impact domestically, even though many big clubs boast large squads. Chelsea rotated their team at the weekend and were beaten 1-0 by Reading. Wolfsburg, Bayern Munich and Hoffenheim all dropped points, while PSG and Lyon both won by narrow one-goal margins. ""Three games a week and the travel – that does something to teams,"" Wolfsburg CEO Ralf Kellerman said. ""It was to be expected that the new Champions League format would make things a bit tighter in domestic leagues."" Maybe this new format, then, will generate more excitement across the board.

73,https://www.goal.com/en/news/shock-champions-league-exit-winning-major-trophy-manchester-city-/blt8681f89e7d4c5e81,From shock Champions League exit to winning a major trophy: Manchester City's Conti Cup triumph summed up their season,"If there was a game that could sum up the season that Gareth Taylor’s Manchester City side have had so far, then Saturday evening’s Continental Cup final triumph came close to perfectly doing so. The holders and their opponents in the showpiece event Chelsea might have started on the front foot, often pinning City into their own box early on, but it was the Manchester club that emerged victorious from a goal down, with Caroline Weir scoring twice and Ellen White once in the turnaround. For a side who were knocked out of the Women’s Champions League in the qualifying rounds this season, and were as low as ninth in the Women’s Super League standings at one point, a comeback like this to win the first major trophy on offer this campaign was fitting. “It mirrored that, if I'm honest,” Taylor said. There have been many points throughout this turbulent year that the City coach’s future has been called into question. Ravaged by injuries to key players and going into the season cold after no pre-season, with so many of the squad away at the Olympics until late in the summer, City won just two of their first seven games. Arsenal beat them 5-0 in September. Chelsea beat them 3-0 the following month, and 4-0 a few weeks later. Their challenge for the WSL title evaporated early doors and there have been moments where qualification for next year’s Champions League has looked out of reach, too. After the game on Saturday, Chelsea manager Emma Hayes even described City’s season as “woeful” until now. “Credit to them for the bounce back from a really, really tough start.” Slowly but surely, fortunes have changed. Players have returned to fitness, Taylor has made tactical tweaks in the long-term and also in-game changes that have helped turn things around. That they boasted a bench with more than four names, all genuinely established ones too, on Saturday was a luxury that simply wouldn’t have been imaginable a few months ago. “I came off of all social media at that time,” Taylor said, recalling that period he spent under pressure from the fans. “I literally surrounded myself with the right people. “I’m an ex-player. I’ve had criticism all my career, so I kind of know how to handle it – that doesn’t mean I like it. Manchester City collecting trophies 🏆 #fyp #footballtiktok #soccer #football #mancity “I just tried to cut out the noise. I knew that I was working as hard as I was previously. I felt that it was a little bit unjustified, if I’m honest, with the amount of injuries that we had. “What were they expecting in that situation when we were only able to field two or three outfield substitutes in a game and playing players in unfamiliar positions? “I’ve been in this game for a long time, it is what it is, it’s part and parcel. It’s easy these days to point a finger and say, ‘Is this person up to it or not?’ “But I think you have to have belief in what you do. I have real faith in how I work and how I try to get the best out of players. The players are the most important thing though, the most important marker is that they’re moving in the right direction for you. They’ve shown that they’re fighting, they’ve been fighting the whole season, and sometimes things haven’t gone our way. “Fortunately, more recently, things have started to edge our way, which is nice.” There are still steps that City need to take and ways they can get better, too. The first half on Saturday, slow and under the cosh, has happened a few times this season, most recently in the Manchester derby last week. On that occasion, Taylor’s side again came from a goal down at the break. There are big players to return too, be it winger Chloe Kelly, one of only two players to hit double figures for goals and assists in the league last year, or Steph Houghton, the leader and captain of this team who lifted the Conti Cup on Saturday with her crutches. “It’s difficult sometimes when you've played against Chelsea previously and suffered a little bit, like we have this season, but I think the league game recently showed that we were getting closer in an OK display,” Taylor said. “But I think what this gives us goes beyond winning this trophy. I think it really gives us real confidence going into the remainder of the season. “Our objectives are really clear on what we want to try and do, what we want to try and achieve after having a difficult start. The belief levels will be huge after this because it just gives the players so much confidence.” This was a glimpse into what Taylor’s reign at City can bring. Now, It’s about how he and his side take that forward. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Pogba has spent the last six years of his career on United's books, having initially returned to the club for a second spell from Juventus for a club-record fee of £89 million ($117m) in 2016. The 29-year-old has struggled to live up to that price tag amid persistent fitness problems and is now just a few months away from his contract expiry date, with PSG among those reportedly interested in signing him on a free transfer in the summer. Pogba admitted that a potential move to Parc des Princes holds a certain appeal to him at the start of the international break, as he declared: ""It's always nice to play with your team-mates in the national team and club."" United reportedly offered the World Cup winner a new contract in January, but he has yet to show any sign of committing his future to the club. Pogba isn't packing his bags just yet, though, with the France international taking a patient approach when it comes to his next move so that he can maximise his output for club and country between now and the end of the season. “Nothing is decided on my future, nothing is done,"" Pogba told Telefoot. ""I can decide tomorrow, just as I can decide during the transfer window. I want to bounce back and finish the season well.” Pogba has only managed to record one goal and nine assists across 23 outings for United in 2021-22 and has missed another 14 matches due to injury. The Red Devils have slipped out of contention for silverware and are now in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the Premier League, with the former Juventus star relived to be taking in a break from the situation on international duty with France. ""You have to tell the truth: there were difficult times, especially when I was in Manchester... When I'm not playing or when the results are not there, coming here gives you a boost,"" he said. Pogba added on United's form and his desire to compete for trophies again: ""It's hard to judge this season because there have been a lot of events, between the change of coach, the injuries. ""The season is not over yet, but almost. We don't have any more titles to play for. I want to win titles, to play for something. In recent years, we haven't won any titles, that's what's sad.""

Pogba's future is up in the air with his contract due to expire in June and no sign of an extension being agreed as of yet.

Asked if he sees himself joining Ligue 1 leaders PSG one day, Pogba told Le Figaro: ""Why not? It's always nice to play with your team-mates in the national team and club."" Pogba added on a disappointing 2021-22 campaign for Manchester United that has seen them extend their wait to win a trophy: ""You have to be honest, the last five seasons have not satisfied me – really not at all. ""This year it is dead, we won't win anything. Whether it is with Manchester United or at another club, I want to win trophies."" The Frenchman also expressed his frustrations about the way he's utilised at Old Trafford, suggesting that he is not played in his best position at United. ""It's simple with France, I play and I play in my position – I know my role and I feel the confidence of the coach and the players,"" he said. ""It's normal to feel a difference at Manchester United because it's hard to be consistent when you often have a change to your position, or the team system, or your partners. ""I get along very well with [France boss Didier Deschamps], he gave me a role that I know, but at Manchester United do I really have a role? I ask the question but I don't have an answer."" Pogba has struggled to live up to expectations since returning to United from Juventus in a club-record £89 million ($118m) deal back in 2016. Fitness problems and inconsistent form have been a running theme for the World Cup winner, with the 2021-22 campaign proving to be no different, and he has faced plenty of criticism amid the Red Devils' five-year trophy drought. Pogba missed 14 games between November and February due to a serious injury, and has only managed to record one goal in the 23 matches that he has been available for this term. He has, however, provided nine assists in the Premier League - the fourth highest behind Liverpool trio Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson and Mohamed Salah.

That agreement may not be honoured, amid talk of interest from MLS, with Chiellini conceding that a new challenge may appeal to him if the decision to delay retirement for at least another 12 months is made. Speaking at the unveiling of David Lippi’s new Reset Group agency, Chiellini has said when quizzed on his future plans: “I enjoy the days, I am happy and serene, I must understand and evaluate many things. “I think about the games in the meantime and I enjoy them.” Euro 2020 winner Chiellini added on working with Lippi, the son of World Cup-winning coach Marcello and the only man to have represented him across a distinguished career: “I’ve known Davide since 2001, we have a close bond and we’ve grown together. “I’ve never thought about putting our rapport in doubt and after 20 years, we are still here.” Giorgio Chiellini captained Italy for the first time nine years ago 🤯Nine years later, he's named defender of the tournament as Italy win EURO 2020 🏆𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗲 🍷 pic.twitter.com/XVOev5XKOW The Bianconeri prised Chiellini away from Roma in 2004, but immediately allowed him to link up with Fiorentina in a co-ownership deal. He was welcomed to Turin a year later after impressing in Florence and has not looked back. Across 17 memorable seasons, Chiellini has taken in 554 appearances for Juventus – with club captaincy duties taken on when Gianluigi Buffon left for Paris Saint-Germain in 2018. He has won 19 trophies, while gracing two Champions League finals, and is the only man to have figured in all nine of Juve’s Serie A title triumphs during a golden era for the club. On an international stage, Chiellini has been capped on 116 occasions and skippered Italy to European Championship glory in 2021. He is yet to officially retire from duty with the Azzurri, but was unable to help Roberto Mancini’s side to book tickets to the 2022 World Cup after suffering a shock play-off defeat to North Macedonia.

De Bruyne came off just after the hour mark with City struggling to defend their slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg in the Wanda Metropolitano. His club will hope he has escaped serious injury as they hope to continue fighting on multiple fronts in the final months of the 2021-22 season. The Belgian pulled up in discomfort while on the run during the second half of the quarter-final second leg, just as Atletico began to push forward in their search for an equaliser. He was unable to continue, and limped off as Raheem Sterling was brought in to replace him. City were dealt a further blow minutes later when full-back Kyle Walker left the action due to injury. Walker had clashed with Renan Lodi and despite receiving treatment was ultimately obliged to leave the field, replaced by Nathan Ake. Now Pep Guardiola will hope neither of his key first-teamers has sustained lasting damage with a huge match on the horizon. On Saturday City take on Liverpool in the semi final of the FA Cup, just a week after the Premier League high-fliers shared the points in an enthralling 2-2 that left the former at the top of the table by a single point.

The 29-year-old Egypt international has gone 753 minutes since he scored a goal from open play and against Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday, he was rested (on the bench) before coming on in the second half.  According to the 45-year-old former England player, Murphy, who managed 170 appearances for the Anfield outfit and scored 25 goals between 1997 to 2004, Salah is a match-winner and must start against the Citizens.  “It is 753 minutes since Mohamed [Salah’s] last goal in open play for Liverpool but there is still absolutely no chance I would leave him out of Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City,” Murphy wrote on BBC Sports.  “Ignoring penalties, Salah has not found the net with any of his past 38 efforts at goal over the past two months but he has to start at Wembley because he is a match-winner, and he has earned the right to play in big games like this one even if he is on a bad run.  “I agree that he hasn’t been playing as well as he can do, but let’s not forget that since the 29-year-old Egyptian joined Liverpool in 2017, he has set standards with his goalscoring numbers above anything we thought could be possible.  “We are judging him against his own ridiculous record and the fact his statistics over the past two months are more ordinary does not change the fact he is capable of scoring remarkable goals that no one else on the pitch can, whoever the opposition are.”  Murphy continued: “That in itself is enough of a reason to pick him, but on top of that you have to remember the effect his mere presence will have on City. Regardless of whether Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, or Oleksandr Zinchenko play at left-back for City this weekend, they would fear Salah at all times.  “They all love to get forward themselves but they know that, when they do, they are leaving the Premier League's best goalscorer behind them. That is a very different dynamic to anyone else they could go up against in Liverpool's team.  “While Salah didn’t score at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, he still had a huge impact on the game, not least with his perfect pass for Sadio Mane to make it 2-2 at the start of the second half.  “I am expecting more of the same this time, and it would not surprise me at all if Salah actually scores the winner, because he has done it so many times before.”  The clubs will meet for the second time in the space of one week after their entertaining 2-2 Premier League draw at the Etihad Stadium.

The 18-year-old midfielder was highly regarded at Stamford Bridge, but his potential has been lured to Elland Road by the promise of a clearer pathway to first-team football. Goal revealed on Tuesday that Bate was heading to West Yorkshire after snubbing the offer of a new contract in west London. Leeds have announced the deal on their official website, saying: ""Leeds United are pleased to announce the signing of Lewis Bate. ""The midfielder joins the Whites from fellow Premier League side Chelsea for an undisclosed fee. ""Bate, who attracted interest from a number of clubs, has penned a three-year-deal at Elland Road, running until the summer of 2024.

Southampton made a strong late approach after teams including Aston Villa, RB Leipzig and AC Milan queued up to sign Chelsea's Academy Player of the Year. The Blues' approach for recent Paris Saint-Germain signing Achraf Hakimi is another possible factor that damaged their argument to keep Livramento. As first reported on Goal, Bate had already closed in on a move to Leeds United on Tuesday night after they accelerated talks. Marcelo Bielsa's side have now agreed to a £1.5 million fee with Chelsea for the 18-year-old but the deal includes add-ons based on Premier League appearances and a future sell-on fee. Bate sees a clearer pathway to the first team at Elland Road with Chelsea having N'Golo Kante, Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic, Mason Mount and Billy Gilmour ahead of him in the midfield pecking order. Chelsea also face soon losing Myles Peart-Harris who is expected to join Brentford in the coming days. Dynel Simeu is also closing in on a Premier League move but the destination has yet to be made clear. Genk are now favourites to sign Ike Ugbo after informally agreeing on a contract with the Chelsea striker but have yet to have a bid accepted. Anderlecht are also monitoring his situation. Thierno Ballo could move on loan later in the transfer window, with Rapid Vienna, Sturm Graz, Mainz and Arminia Bielefeld all interested. Meanwhile, Wigan Athletic are among the clubs interested in taking Henry Lawrence on a season-long loan deal. Marc Guehi has already left in an £18 million move to Crystal Palace.

It isa refrain many young footballers will have heard over the years as academy officials make their considerations and decide which players should be kept on as they close in on the senior ranks. Standing at just 5'6"" (1.68 metres), Lewis Bate could have been forgiven for believing that the same tap on the shoulder could have been headed his way at some stage as he made his way through the various age-group sides at Chelsea. But what the midfielder lacks in physicality he more than makes up with his prodigious talent on the ball, while he has learned to use his small frame to his advantage when battling with opposition players. Now, just over two months on from celebrating his 18th birthday, Bate is closing in on a first-team debut, with Sunday's FA Cup third-round clash against Morecambe potentially providing him with an opportunity to show Frank Lampard what he is capable of. Doing so would mark a huge step on Bate's journey at Chelsea, which began as an eight-year-oldafter he caught the eye while playing for Foots Cray Lions in Sidcup, an area of south-east London. ""He was too young to play initially and played a year up. He was a really good player,"" Chris Spearing, Bate's coach at Foots Cray, tellsGoal.""He always had a smile on his face, he was quite a bit smaller than the other guys, had a sweet left foot but he was like a whippet, he was really rapid. ""He comes from a happy family but on the pitch he could be a terrier in winning the ball back despite being one of the smallest. A post shared by Lewis Bate (@lewbate) ""Chelsea scouted him over a number of games, but particularly against Parkwood FC where we actually got beaten. The scout came over to us and saw how good he is with his feet and how he followed instructions, which can be rare with young children."" Bate has always stood out as having the talent required to make the grade, but he truly came to prominence in 2017-18 when captaining Chelsea's U15s to treble-winning glory. It was during that campaign that he caught the eye of Jody Morris, who at the time was an academy coach at the club and has gone onto become Lampard's assistant with the first-team. A diminutive but tenacious midfielder during his own playing career, Morris oversaw Bate's immediate ascension up the ranks, with the youngster going on to make his U18s debut as a15-year-old. Just over a year later, and with Morris back at the club having moved to Derby County to work alongsideLampard during his year coaching in the Championship, Bate was called-up to train with the first-team ahead of the 2019-20 season. Though he is yet to make his senior bow, he was named among the substitutes against both Sheffield United and Bayern Munich towards the end of last season as Lampard increased the size of his squad amid the threat of Covid-19. A standout performer for the club's U23s, Bate has been back among the first-team ahead of the clash with Morecambe, with the likes of Tino Anjorin, Tino Livramento, Henry Lawrence and Jude Soonsup-Bell all also hoping for a run-out against lower-league opposition. Should Bate take the field at Stamford Bridge, he will likely have to impress if he is to be given any more chances before the season is out given the huge number of midfield options available to Lampard. A post shared by Lewis Bate (@lewbate) Mason Mount and Billy Gilmour have both broken into Lampard's squad over the past 18 months, and Bate now faces a fight to prove he can join them. Last season's Academy Scholar of the Year, Bate's current contract in west London will be up at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, and though Chelsea are reluctant to lose the England youth international, there is an understanding that at his age he needs to be integrated into the first-team picture sooner rather than later. League One sideAFC Wimbledon failed in a bid to sign him on a season-long loan over the summer whileGoalcan confirm that a number of clubs have enquired about signing Bate on a permanent deal in recent months. Given his pressing ability and superb reputation from set-pieces it is understandable, with some having compared his game to that of Jack Wilshere when he was breaking through at Arsenal just over a decade ago.  A close friend of Bayern Munich starlet Jamal Musiala,Batehas seen just how quickly things can progressfor a player if they were to leave Chelsea for pastures new as he waits for his own breakthrough. That, though, will be far from his mind if he steps out onto the pitch on Sunday. The next talented midfielder off the Chelsea conveyor belt is about to arrive.

The 20-year-old, who put in a man-of-the-match display as Scotland drew with England at Euro 2020, made only 11 first-team appearances for the Blues last season. Gilmour has therefore joined the newly-promoted Canaries for their upcoming Premier League campaign, after Norwich were promoted as champions from the second tier after being relegated in 2019-20. Gilmour, who joined Chelsea's academy from Rangers in 2017, has immediately impressed after stepping up into the first-team picture at Stamford Bridge, but with N'Golo Kante, Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and more ahead of him, has found regular game time hard to come by. After making his first-team debut in a Premier League draw with Sheffield United in August 2019, Gilmour has made 22 senior appearances for Chelsea. Now 20, the time is right for him to get many more games under his belt. He has therefore moved away from the Champions League winners for the 2021-22 season, and will join up with Daniel Farke's Norwich following their impressive Championship-winning campaign in 2020-21. Gilmour has also impressed at international level. He has three senior Scotland caps and made his first start in the 0-0 draw with England at Wembley, although he was unable to prevent his country crashing out of the Euros group stages after testing positive for coronavirus before the crucial clash with Croatia. Gilmour told the official clubwebsite: “I’m very excited to be here. I can’t wait for the season ahead. I’ve been looking forward to coming here, playing as much as possible and helping Norwich City compete in the Premier League. “I spoke to the head coach here. He called me and we had a nice talk about how he wants to play and how he sees me fitting in. Everything he said was what I want to do on the pitch, get the ball down and play nice football. He spoke really highly of his team and I wanted to come join here and help. “There are very exciting times ahead, coming in for pre-season and seeing all the lads. Let’s get to it.” Farke added: “We are really happy to have brought Billy in. We must say a big thank you to Chelsea and all those involved for making this deal happen. I think it helped that in the past we have shown that young players with potential are in good hands here at Norwich City. “We are delighted to bring Billy in because we’ve lost some players in that area. We’re looking to improve our options, particularly in the centre of the park, and for that we’re happy to bring Billy in. “We got the feeling that he can help us a lot with his ability to link the play, his technical qualities and also his work against the ball. From the football point of view, but also from his character he is the perfect fit to our squad. “He will help us to achieve our targets. We still have to keep in mind that he is an unbelievably young guy and that he hasn’t played regularly on this level. We have to give him some time and space to improve and find his rhythm. All in all, we got the feeling that he can help us achieve our targets and he’s a perfect fit for us.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Of the six players to have won the club's Academy Player of the Year award between 2015-20, five have already gone onto make their full international debuts. Two of them, in Mason Mount and Reece James, started last season's Champions League final and were part of the England squad that finished as runners-up at Euro 2020. Winning that prize, then, is a good barometer for a player having future success, making the 2021 winner, Tino Livramento, a prospect worth watching out for. Unsurprisingly, a host of rival clubs have already begun to take notice of the right-back's undoubted talent. AC Milan and RB Leipzig have both shown an interest in the 18-year-old, as have Premier League trio Aston Villa, Southampton and Brighton, with Livramento's contract set to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season. For a number of Blues supporters, the prospect of losing Livramento is bringing back unhappy memories, with just 18 months having passed since another homegrown right-back, Tariq Lamptey, was sold to Brighton, only for him to almost instantly become a Premier League star. The fear of history repeating itself only grew when Chelsea's interest in signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter was revealed, and though the Morocco international eventually joining Paris Saint-Germain does not automatically mean Livramento will now extend his contract, the failure to land a new right-back does at least open up a spot for the England youth international to earn a place in Thomas Tuchel's squad. A post shared by Valentino (@tinolivramento) ""Tino immediately and frequently stands out to watchers of Chelsea’s younger age group teams for his dynamic attacking performances down the right side of the pitch,"" Phil, themononymous individual behind the popular @ChelseaYouth social media accounts, tellsGoal. ""He produced 16 goal involvements (threegoals, 13 assists) in 26 academy matches during the 2020-21season, and was the main outlet for the team’s attacks, often linking up with Lewis Bate and benefiting from his expansive and ambitious passing range. ""His ability to outpace and outmuscle defenders is a constant menace to opponents, and he has the physical capacity to make those high-intensity runs late in the match too. ""In the final third his delivery is consistently impressive, often preferring to find a perfectly-weighted low ball into the middle for an advancing runner (or a striker dropping off into a pocket of space), and finding a measured pass while moving at full speed is an especially impressive trait for one so young. ""His defending is committed and honest while developing at the rate many young defenders experience, but he has the athleticism and physique to handle himself in one-v-one battles and to be a very tricky player to beat when he adds more experience to his game. ""That he is at such an advanced stage of development by the age of 18 is no surprise to those who’ve tracked his progress through Chelsea’s junior ranks."" Livramento is closing in on a decade at Chelsea, whom he joined as an Under-9 having been scouted at his local club of Roundshaw in south London. A boyhood Chelsea fan, Livramento regularly played above his own age group, making his U23s debut less than a fortnight after his 17th birthday. A post shared by Valentino (@tinolivramento) At international level, too, he has been a consistent performer whenever making the step up, having captained England's U17s and already spent time training with the U20s squad. Croydon-born Livramento is also, however, eligible to represent Portugal, and therefore has heroes from both sides of that international rivalry. ""I always looked up to Cristiano Ronaldo,""Livramento told Chelsea's in-house media channel""The way he plays the game with no fear and so much confidence really inspired me. He plays the game like no one else and is a machine. ""To still be scoring the number of goals that he is now is astonishing, but it is a result of his work ethic and willingness to stay at the top of the game and prove that he is the best. Also, for me having Portuguese blood, he inspires me to make my family proud. ""I really aspire to be a role model for younger footballers like Ronaldo was for me."" On his idols from supporting Chelsea, he added: ""I looked up to players such as Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard. They signify what it means to be a Chelsea player and the standards they set were world-class."" A post shared by Valentino (@tinolivramento) Livramento, who has also played further forward on the right-hand side of midfield at times,has had a taste of what it takes to be a modern Chelsea star having spent some time training with the first-team squad under both Lampard and Thomas Tuchel. He was named on the bench for the first time towards the end of the last campaign, but remained an unused substitute againat both Arsenal and Manchester City as Tuchel's team chased a top-four finish in the Premier League. That such a talent is still waiting for his senior debut is potentially part of the reason why Livramento is yet to commit his long-term future to Chelsea, though he is hopeful ofgetting the chance to impress Tuchel during pre-season, with both James and Cesar Azpilicueta enjoying some time off after deep runs at the European Championship. But whether he can be convinced to stay or not, there is no doubt that he has the potential to be the latest Chelsea academy graduate to reach the very top of the game. Blues supporters just hope he does so while still plying his trade at Stamford Bridge. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues have been impressed with the 21-year-old's comeback from injury and his training performances under Thomas Tuchel in pre-season. The wing-back, whose current deal expires in 2022, is keen to stay at Chelsea but Tuchel's stance in the talks remains key, while thereare Championship clubs also contacting the Blues over a possible loan move. Tuchel has given a lot of positive feedback to Sterling over the last six months since his return from a long-term injury in January. Having spent last season playing with the Under-23s, Sterling also trained a lot under Tuchel. Sterling played in Chelsea's 6-1 opening pre-season win over Peterborough United, completing 45 minutes like all the other outfield players. He is with the first-team squad which hastravelled to Ireland and theywill face a local team behind closed doors on Thursday. Afterward, they return to England and play friendly matches against Bournemouth, Arsenal and Tottenham in front of supporters ahead of the new season. After seeing Chelsea's talksto sign Paris Saint-Germain new boy Achraf Hakimi break down, there could be a first-team space available for Sterling, who predominantly likes to play as a right wing-back. Chelsea are also set to lose their current Academy Player of the Year Tino Livramento, who plays in the same position, as part of a youth exodus at the club. Sterling was rated as highly as any Chelsea academy graduate but a serious non-Covid illness followed a hamstring injury thatleft him out for 13 months. Chelsea are convinced that he has made a full recovery having monitored his recovery over the last few seasons. Along with Sterling, the likes of Armando Broja, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley, Conor Gallagher, Malang Sarr and Trevoh Chalobah are all also out to impress Tuchel over pre-season.

The teenager impressed on loan at Vitesse Arnhem last season and has now been rewarded with a new long-term deal by Chelsea. Broja has been on the Blues' books for a decade and will now be looking to push for a place in Thomas Tuchel's first-team plans in the 2021-22 season. ""I am really excited to be signing a new contract with Chelsea,"" Broja told the club's official website. ""Having come through the Academy here it was a special moment for me to make my first-team debut last year, before gaining further experience on loan at Vitesse last season. ""I want to build on these foundations andI am really looking forward to progressing and making an impact at Chelsea in the years to come."" The 19-year-old was handed his first-team bow by former manager Frank Lampard in March 2020 against Everton in what proved to be Chelsea's final game before the Premier League campaign was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic. He spent the 2020-21 season on loan at Vitesse in an attempt to build up his first-team experience and he caught the eye during his time in Dutch football. Brojascored 11 goals in 34 appearances as Vitesse finished fourth in the Eredivisie and lost to Ajax in the final of the KNVB Cup. The highly-rated forward also made his international debut for Albania in September last year and has now made six appearances for the national team.

89,https://www.goal.com/en/news/surpass-drogba-chelsea-loanee-broja-europe-top-scoring/1343lc5kn7ypw1kipjsgb1ecfy,'I want to surpass Drogba' - Chelsea loanee Broja on becoming Europe's top-scoring teenage striker,"The term 'Covid-19' was only just beginning to appear in the English languagewhen Armando Broja signed his first professional contract with Chelsea onFebruary 26, 2020. His senior debut, against Everton 11 days later, proved to be the final game the Blues would play for over three months due to the game's shutdown in the spring. That remains Broja's only appearance for Chelsea to date but that does not mean he has stopped making an impact over the course of the 2020-21 campaign. A yearis a long time - especially in the world of football. Having joinedVitesse on a season-long loan deal over the summer,  the 19-year-old is currently the top goalscorer among teenagers playing in Europe's top 10 leagues,based on UEFA coefficient, this term. Broja has nine goals and two assists in 20 league appearances thus far and has already matchedZlatan Ibrahimovic'stotal goal tally from his first season with Ajax, while heis likely to betterLuis Suarez's total of 10 league goals that he scored for Groningen in his only season there before leaving for stardom at Ajax. ""Nine goals and two assists is good but I am never satisfied,"" Broja tells  Goal  in an exclusive interview ahead of Tuesday's KNVB Beker semi-final against VVV-Venlo. ""I want to get more goals and assists to keep tallying them up. ""I have played over 1000 minutes and I have 11 goal contributions. It is not bad but I want more goals and assists. I want to do more."" Ibrahimovic and Suarez were not the only household names to make early career moves to the Netherlands, as Brazil legend Ronaldo scored 54 goals in 58 games for PSV after joining from Cruzeiro in 1994.  The 1994 and 2002 World Cup winner is one of Broja's heroes, and he is excited to be emulating the ex-Real Madrid and Barcelona man in some way as he takes his first strides into the professional game. ""The original Ronaldo was incredible, probably the best striker of all time,"" he says.""I was a bit young to watch him on TV but I watched a lot of his clips on YouTube. ""I knew that R9 came to PSV, I knew Suarez and Zlatan were at Ajax. A lot of top strikers played in Holland in their first season, so I thought it was also a great place to learn and develop."" Vitesse has long held a strong relationship with Chelsea, and Broja is following in the footsteps of the likes of Mason Mount, Nemanja Matic, Dominic Solanke and Bertrand Traore in earning experience with the Dutch outfit before returning to west London. The bond between the clubs was built through their shared Russian ownership, althoughVitesse'sfootballing operations are now overseen byformer employees ofthe Red Bull Group in the shape of sporting director JohannesSporsand manager ThomasLetsch. The duo oversaw the scouting ofBrojaas he impressed for Chelsea's youth teams, though the history between the two sides did not necessarily mean that the deal was easy to negotiate. ""I really had to fight for Armando, it was not like: 'I want Armando' and:'Here you go',""Sporstells  Goal. ""I had to really convince him. If he said no, it is no. I had to convince Chelsea that we thought he was ready for that. We have to still make sure that everyone is convinced that it is the right step. ""It is a good relationship. Nothing happens because of the owners, but it opens doors.""   Broja's decision to head for the GelreDome has certainly paid off so far, with the Slough-born striker having come a long way from the extra training sessions he used to do with his father, Xhevahir, while playing for Sunday league side Burnham Juniors. It was at the age of six that he got his first taste of a top academy, though it did not come with Chelsea. ""A Tottenham scout came down to atournament to watch another player, I performed well,won the best player and was top scorer,"" Broja explains. ""The scout came and spoke to my parents and me, and they said: 'I would love it if your son would try out at Tottenham'. ""I had a single session there and the academy boss said they wanted me to sign. I had Fulham wanting me as well, but I chose Tottenham. ""Tottenham have a big rivalry with Chelsea. I went down to Cobham to play them and I remember starting on the bench. ""I may have supported Chelsea and loved Chelsea, but I always wanted to play against them and beat them, mostly because I wantedto actually play for Chelsea. ""Unfortunately, I was on the bench and I was really angry about it. At the time, the big decision makers at Chelsea were watching the game, so I thought if I come on I can maybe impress them. ""Straight away after coming on I scored one and assisted one. We drew against Chelsea’s' A' team and then we played against their 'B' team and I think we won 9-0.I got sevengoals! ""The Chelsea scouts came over andsaid they would love to have me. I was so happy because I could play for the club I supported. I was like:'Yes, I want to be here; this is the club I love'.I have been at Chelsea from the Under-9s until now.""   Though Broja eventually made it to the first team, his decade with the Blues has not been without its tough moments,  particularly when he reached the club's U18s. ""In the first year of Under-18s when I was 17, I wasn’t having the greatest season,"" he admits. ""I was on the bench and, when I did get a chance, I was struggling. I scored two goals all season, so I was really down. ""My parents were trying to help and encourage me, but I had lost a lot of confidence. Even in training, I was missing shots, so I didn’t play a lot. ""Then, I had a boost from my mum and dad that Albania had called me to play with them in the summer. It was the Under-19s, so I thought it would be good to go there,get some confidence in a different team with different players, and takemy mind away from Chelsea."" It certainly did the trick, with Broja's five goals in four games for the U19s, followed by two goals on his debut for Albania's U21s against Wales, setting him on a path to become the Chelsea academy's leading striker in 2019-20. He has since gone onto make his full international debut having netted 19 goals for the Blues' youth teams last term, and is not shy in revealing he wants to reach legendary status at the Bridge. ""I was like:'Wow!That's FrankLampard, [Didier]Drogbaor John Terry right in front of me' when I would see them around,"" he says. ""I loved to take pictures with them because I wanted to be them. I wanted to be in their shoes at the top level. ""Now I am approaching the age they were when they were playing, I want to try and surpassDrogba. It might not be easy, but that’s my mentality and how I am feeling.""   For now, Broja just needs to concentrate on finishing the season strongly for Vitesse. They are 90 minutes away from a cup final against either Ajax or Heerenveen, while in the league they sit fourth andare well in the hunt for European football. Should theyachieve their goals by May, then Broja will certainly remember this oddest of years with plenty of fondness. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He collected his100th cap for his country againstthe Czech Republic on Sunday, with a caution in that contest meaning that he will be suspended for the clash with Belarus on Wednesday.

Chelsea paid an initial fee of £50 million ($69m) to sign Jorginho from Napoli in the summer of 2018, tying him down to a five-year contract. That agreement is due to expire in less than two years, and Santos has now suggested that he could walk away from Stamford Bridge before then. “He has a contract with Chelsea until [June] 2023,” SantostoldRadio Bianconera. “Obviously, it would be a dream for him to return to Italy, hopefully after winning the World Cup. “We’ll have to see what the market looks like in a couple of years and what the other situations are.” Inter and Roma have been credited with an interest in Jorginho in the recent past, but Juventus has been touted as his most likely next destination should he ever leave Chelsea. Santos has also revealed that the Bianconeri made a move for the Italy international when Maurizio Sarri was in charge at Allianz Stadium in 2019-20. The pair previously worked together at Napoli and for one season at Chelsea, but Juve were unable to arrange a reunion. “In the past, when Sarri was the coach, there was a possibility that Jorginho would come to Juventus,” said Santos. “The Juventus director made an approach, it was a possibility."" Last season was arguably Jorginho's best yet at Chelsea as he played a key role in their run to Champions League glory and a top-four Premier League finish. The 29-year-old then built on that platform to help Italy win the European Championships, leading to suggestions that he could be a contender for this year's Ballon d'Or. Santos thinks he deserves to be in the running, and said: ""I think Jorginho has a good chance of winning the Ballon d’Or, because we usually think of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, but nobody has won as much as Jorginho this year.” Jorginho: Being called Sarri's son made me so angry De Bruyne, Jorginho & Kante nominated for UEFA award Cassano: Jorginho agrees Messi should win Ballon d'Or Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The European champions were keen to add Kounde to their squad before the deadline, but saw a late bid rebuffed by the Spanish side and did not return with another offer. Kounde missed last weekend’s La Liga draw at Elche andsparked speculation thata move was imminent, but he ultimately remained in Seville. Lopetegui admits he was powerless to prevent Kounde leaving had Chelsea bid the right amount. His words echo that of sporting director Monchi, who told a news conference last week that Kounde would only move to Stamford Bridge if Chelsea paid his €80m (£68m/$95m) release clause. Despite selling Kurt Zouma to West Ham to seemingly make space for Kounde in their squad, Chelsea did not return with a fresh bid. With the window now closed, Lopetegui says Kounde’s continued presence in the squad is a huge boost for the rest of the season. “Kounde in the end has stayed because the club has decided that it was the right thing to do based on the evaluation of the offers they may have had,” he told   Diario de Sevilla. “For me, as a coach, that Jules stays is positive. With the evolution he has had in these two years, it is positive, without any doubt. “We trust that he'll continueto grow with us and, above all, perform, which is the most important thing.” One of the other names to dominate the closing days of the transfer window was Kylian Mbappe. Real Madrid ultimately failed in their bid to land the PSG striker, but it was the name seemingly on everybody’s lips as the clock ticked towards the deadline. Asked whether he had missed not being asked about Mbappe, Lopetegui joked that Sevilla had made last-minute offer themselves – but were also unsuccessful. “I knew that somehow or other you were going ask me,” he said. “We tried to bring him in at the last minute, but we couldn't.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues are no longer able to renew their 29-year-old's deal,  despite significantly progressing talks before Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by both the United Kingdom and European Union. The terms of the sanctions include preventing Chelsea from extending contracts or making transfers. Reports in Italy suggest that the defender has already signed for the Turin club, but several sources have denied it to GOAL. Alongside Juventus, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich have all had talks with Rudiger but have struggled to meet his wage demands. Indeed, Rudiger is keen on remaining at Stamford Bridge where he has enjoyed brilliant form under Thomas Tuchel, playing more minutes than any other player this season. Before the owner was sanctioned,Chelsea agreed on a salary close to £200,000-a-week which would make him their best paid defender ever.However, there is still a difference on both signing on and agent fees. They can restart talks once they have resolved the ownership issue at the club.Several candidates are in talks with Raine Group, on behalf of Abramovich and the club, to buy Chelsea. The bid deadline passed on Friday evening which is now be looked over this weekend, before three or four are taken forward into next week, making it through the first round of the process. After that, the bidders will be approved or denied by the Premier League before Raine finally decide on a new owner. Everyone inside Chelsea wants this process to move forward as fast as possible but it could be slowed down by the Premier League should issues emerge. The aim is for the club to have a new owner in place before the next league game against Brentford, avoiding a prolonged period of sanctions being placed on the west London outfit.

The Germany international is yet to agree terms with the Blues, while Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are still interested and able to offer a large signing-on fee as well as competitive salary packages. Bayern Munich have ended their interest in Rudiger and are instead pushing to sign Andreas Christensen, who is their primary target to replace Borussia Dortmund-bound Niklas Sule in the summer. The Blues have identified Barcelona's Ronald Araujo as a serious transfer target. The 21-year-old Uruguay international has 18 months left on his deal with the Catalan giants but is frustrated in his own contract renewal talks. He becomes the latest potential signing for the Blues in the summer, with Sevilla’s Jules Kounde and Leicester’s Wesley Fofana also high up on the shortlist. Chelsea will have to sign more than one top defender this summer if they lose two of their automatic starters, although they have been impressed with the progress of Levi Colwill, who is on loan at Huddersfield. He could be another option for Thomas Tuchel's squad next season. Brighton's Marc Cucurella has also emerged as a target at wing-back, although any interest hinges on Marcos Alonso's future. The latter has just under 18 months left on his current deal. Barcelona remain confident of taking the Blues captain away from Stamford Bridge. The Spain international’s deal expires in the summer, just like those of both Rudiger and Christensen. Having been asked about his future ahead of the Blues’ FIFA Club World Cup semi-final with Al Hilal at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, Azpilicueta said: “I'm not going to speak about my future. We are one day before the semi-final of the tournament. “Of course, I arrived in the summer of 2012 and I didn't have kids. My kids were born in London and you know how I feel about Chelsea.

Various takeover contenderswere quick to throw their respective hats into the ring once it became apparent that the sale of the Premier League heavyweights was on the cards, with four final offers from different billionaire consortiums to be on the table by April 14. The process of whittling that list of interested parties down to a select group of preferred bidders is now well under way, withGOALtelling you all you need to know about the four bidders. It was revealed on March 25 that consortiums that Los Angeles Dodgers co-ownerTodd Boehlyhad been selected byRaine Group-the US bank handling the sale of Chelsea - toprogress to the next stage. Initially, Bohely's consortium was seen as part of a group of investors that includes Swiss billionaireHansjorg Wyssand British entrepreneurJonathan Goldstein.Subsequently, Mark Walter, who is another US-billionaire and long time associate of Boehly's joined the bid early this week. Furthermore, it has since been revealed on the day of the final bids thatClearlake Capital's share will be a full 50 percent, but Boehly remains the face and operational leader of the group, despite his minority share. Boehly has been the one attending matches and involved in the meetings with various stakeholders around the club this week. They've appointed prominent Chelsea supporters Daniel Finkelstein, who is a Conservative Member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a well-known PR guru, as advisors. Boehly had a £2.2 billion bid to buy Chelsea in 2019 rejected by Roman Abramovich and has already done his due dilligence on the club. He holds a percentage in US winning franchises the LA Dodgers and the LA Lakers. They are already in talks to revive Abramovich's abandoned project of Stamford Bridge and in talks to use the former project director David Hickey and architect Janet Marie Smith has also been consulted. The Ricketts Family Investment Groupare led by bothTom and Laura Rickettswho own the historic baseball team Chicago Cubs. Tom is arguably the best connected to the Blues amongst all the bidders having previously met Abramovich after trying to buy the club in 2018. They have also got connections to Raine having done business with them in the past. However, they have faced criticism based in part due to leaked emails from their father Joe which contained Islamophobic language. They have moved to reassure supporters that those views don't reflect their own in meetings in and around London this week. Indeed, Laura Ricketts is a world leader in LGBTQ+ rights and has ambitious plans to further the remit of the Chelsea Foundation which is the charitable arm of the Blues. They have significant backing from Citadel (a US hedge fund) founderKen GriffinandDan Gilbertof Rock Entertainment Group, who own a host of sports teams including the NBA franchise Cleveland Cavalliers. They both rank among the wealthiest people in America. With several experienced sports administrators amongst them, the Ricketts bid also have experience developing in a stadium in an urban area. They modernised the Wrigley Field stadium in Chicago after taking over the Cubs. They've promised to be 'champions on and off the field' in their most recent statement.  Little was known about Atalanta co-ownerStephen Pagliucaand his bid to buy Chelsea until this week. The US-billionaire, who is also the co-owner of the Boston Celtics and is the co-chairman of Bain Capital, has finally revealed details of his bid late in the process. They were boosted by the announcement that highly respected Canadian sports leaderLarry Tanenbaumbecame the co-managing partner of their proposal. Tanenbaum is one of the most influential figures in US sports co-owning multiple Toronto-based professional sports teams in the NHL, NBA, MLS, and CFL. He is also co-chairing Toronto's bid to host World Cup matches in 2026. He is also the founder of Kilmer Group which has experience in international construction and could help develop Stamford Bridge. Alongside the two leads, former Disney CEO Bob Iger and Facebook co-Founder Eduardo Saverin rank among eight other names backing their approach. The John Terry-led True Blues Consortium believe Pagliuca's bid is the best: ""Having engaged and being well received by all the bidders we were recently able to spend some time with Steve and Larry and getting to know their bid we're again confident that they are aligned with Chelsea fans, and of course have experience in this area of owning sports teams."" However, they are willing to work with another party should the Pagliuca-Tanenbaum bid not be chosen. It is thought that Pagliuca will aim to keep his stake in Atalanta despite wanting to run the west Londoners. Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) release a statement with other supporters groups about the ownership, reiterating their demands. Interestingly, three of the four bidders praised for engaging significantly (Ricketts, Boehly & Broughton), requesting more dialogue from Pagliuca. pic.twitter.com/oHOTb26Lpl Ex-Liverpool chairmanSir Martin Broughton's efforts to buy Chelsea was one of the first to be announced. Alongside him is Conservative Member of Parliament and former Olympic chiefLord Sebastian Coeadding political clout. Wall Street investment banker Michael Klein, adding that financial clout. Those two may be the leads of the bid but the majority of the backing is coming fromJosh Harris and David Blitzerwho are world leading sports administrators with stakes in clubs across Europe and Real Salt Lake City in MLS. However, they own 18 percent in Crystal Palace which could represent a problem with the Premier League running due diligence alongside the bidding process. They are said to have support from Creative Artists Agency (CAA), who are one of the biggest players in football talent management, and Evolution Media Capital, a sports advisory and financing partnership. According to Sky News, there's backing from Vivek Ranadive, the owner of the perennially struggling NBA basketball team Sacramento Kings. There's no known plans to develop the stadium but in early statements to the UK newspapers, they promised significant funds and fan involvement.  With Roman Abramovich sanctioned, the Chelsea board - which includes the oligarch's associates like Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck, Eugene Tenenbaum - have been tasked with picking a new owner. Raine Group are advising the process with the UK Government said to be staying out of any decision making, with their main aim to ensure that Abramovich doesn't profit from the sale while sanctioned. When it comes to timelines, there is a hope that some indication on a preferred offer as early as next week. There's a harder deadline of 31 May when the club's operating licence expires. However, that doesn't mean the exchange will be imminent with adue diligence process ongoing on behalf of both Chelsea FC and the Premier League. All the four options are thought to be paying in cash and have promised a structured £1bn spend upon winning any bid. The sale is expected to exceed the £2.5bn ($3.3bn) Joseph Tsai paid for the Brooklyn Nets, making it the most expensive sports team transaction in history. The money will go into either a charity or a frozen bank account, which means it could ultimately be claimed by Abramovich when the sanctions end. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Chelsea's pursuit of Kounde was one of the most well-documented sagas of the last transfer window as Thomas Tuchel sought to add greater depth to his defensive ranks. Sevilla ultimately managed to keep hold of Kounde, but the 23-year-old has now indicated he was disappointed not to secure the move to Stamford Bridge. Kounde told French broadcaster Telefoot: ""Did my failed transfer to Chelsea this summer affect me? Yes, a little bit, but now it's digested."" Chelsea were among a host of clubs linked with Kounde on the back of his impressive 2020-21 campaign at Sevilla. The France international played a key role in the club's run to a fourth-place Liga finish, with his versatility proving crucial for head coach Julen Lopetegui. Shortly after the summer transfer deadline, Lopetegui confirmed Sevilla's valuation of Kounde had not been met. Chelsea opted against paying his €80m (£68m/$95m) release clause, with the Spanish manager telling Diario de Sevilla: ""Kounde, in the end, has stayed because the club has decided that it was the right thing to do based on the evaluation of the offers they may have had.""

97,https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-confident-bayern-munich-free-transfer-signing/blt8949149f7e6e342c,Barcelona confident of beating Bayern Munich to free transfer signing of Chelsea's Christensen,"Barcelona are aggressively pushing to win the race to sign Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich. The Catalan side, coached by Xavi, have offered Christensen a deal until 2027, with terms which are superior to those tabled by Bayern and Chelsea. The German champions were scheduled for talks with the 25-year-old's representative this week because they see him as an ideal replacement for Niklas Sule - after he signed a pre-contract to join Borussia Dortmund in the summer - but it is unclear whether they will still go ahead. The Blues had wanted to renew their Denmark international's contract, while the defender, who was signed at 16 from Brondby for £500,000, also wanted to stay. However, talks broke down over agent's fees and signing-on bonuses, even after a £140,000-a-week contract was verbally agreed. On one side, Chelsea sources described the players's camp as moving the goalposts. Meanwhile, on the other side, they believe that a lack of agreement on agent's fees meant that no such deal was agreed. It left talks in a deep freeze with the Blues furious, and Thomas Tuchel publicly criticising the player and gradually using him less. The desire to re-sign Christensen only came after Frank Lampard was sacked and the Dane improved his form under Tuchel. Before that, Chelsea had only offered him a one-year contract extension without a pay rise, until they saw the defender play a pivotal role in the run to winning the Champions League last season. Even though Christensen's final destination remains to be confirmed, the least likely option now seems to be a contract renewal in west London. The Stamford Bridge club are now in a vulnerable position, with Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta's contracts also expiring. The uncertainty created by Roman Abramovich putting the club up for sale has created a difficult atmosphere in which to renew contracts or sign new players. Although the Blues can operate within the revenue they receive, it remains unclear to new signings or current stars what direction the club will be moving in or who will be leading it on the board. Chelsea have made signing a central defender their number one priority this summer but have since seen target Wesley Fofana renew his contract with Leicester City until 2027. Furthermore, Sevilla's Jules Kounde and Barcelona's Ronald Araujo are targets but may now need convincing about where Chelsea will be after Abramovich. They are also targeting a host of youngsters to bolster their academy after a difficult season battling relegation in Premier League 2. One target that has recently emerged is Blackburn Rovers centre-back Ashley Phillips who is playing at Under-23s level despite only being 16 years old.

98,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-have-chelsea-been-able-to-extend-azpilicueta-s-contract/blt292a765981a676b0,Why have Chelsea been able to extend Azpilicueta's contract despite sanctions?,"Cesar Azpilicueta has seen his Chelsea contract extended despite sanctions limiting the operation of the club. The limited operation licence that has been placed on the European and world champions came after accusations from the UK Government that Roman Abramovich had close links to Vladimir Putin. Alongside stopping the club from offering new contracts, they cannot sell mechandise or tickets with the concern that money could end up with their sanctioned owner, but they have been able to extend their defender's deal. The Blues skipper signed his last four-year contract last contract in December 2018 which was due to expire on 30 June 2022. Included in that deal was a clause that would extend the 32-year-old's deal should he reach a certain number of appearances in the final year. The clause, which was first revealed by GOAL earlier in the month, was reached just before the international break with Azpilicueta  having made 35 appearances so far this season. Chelsea's deal with Azpilicueta was agreed upon before the sanctions came into force on 10 March. In the statement relating to their operating language, it is stated: ""The Club to pay third parties in respect to prior obligations, including contracts signed before 10 March 2022 and in respect to legal decisions before 10 March 2022."" Therefore, they can renew Azpilicueta's deal until June 2023 after agreeing to such a contract in 2018. No, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen's deals cannot be renewed until Abramovich sells the club to a new owner. The Blues were in advanced talks to make the Germany international their highest-paid defender of all time, with a deal close to £200,000-a-week on the table. However, they still had yet to agree on either agents' fees or a signing on bonus. In Christensen's case, he was thought to be in advanced talks with Barcelona with their club president Joan Laporta now hinting that it is a done deal. “We have two agreements with players who end their contracts,” Laporta told Catalan radio station RAC 1. “Defence and midfield? Yes, that’s the thing but don’t make me say the names.” Barca are still targeting the signing of Azpilicueta who is open to moving to the Spanish giants. Having built goodwill in west London, as one of the club's most decorated ever players, they won't stand in his way should he ask for a move. Barcelona have already been in talks with Azpilicueta as he was previously able to talk to clubs because of the status of his contract situation. There's a belief in some quarters that the La Liga club could sign Azpilicueta for free or, at least, a nominal fee. It was a similar situation around Olivier Giroud's move to AC Milan last summer which saw him move for €1 million (£860,000/$1.2m) upfront and another €1m in the following year as an add-on.

99,https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-chelsea-greatest-asset-new-blues-owners-everything/blt4d1d585cdcc5de33,Tuchel is Chelsea's greatest asset - new Blues owners must give him everything he needs to succeed,"Chelsea faced 13-time Champions League winners, and, according to their Ultras’ banner, the self-proclaimed kings of Europe, in Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night and gave them the scare of their lives. This quarter-final second leg had been dubbed 'Mission Impossible' with the Blues 3-1 down from the first leg at Stamford Bridge following a Karim Benzema hat-trick, but Chelsea were only 15 short minutes away from completing that mission. At 3-0 up, after goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner, Chelsea were on the verge of arguably their greatest-ever European comeback. But individual quality in the form of Luka Modric's stunning assist for Rodrygo and Karim Benzema's 38th goal of the season ended Chelsea’s efforts to retain their European crown. ""We got beaten by the pure individual quality and offensive conversion after our mistakes,"" Thomas Tuchel told reporters after the match. ""Unfortunately, we had two mistakes after ball wins and they were the most crucial moments in games against Real Madrid. ""In the end, we were unlucky. We deserved to go through after this performance and match today, but it was not meant to be."" Of course, mistakes were made over the two legs. Edouard Mendy gave a cheap goal away at Stamford Bridge and poor play in possession was punished in the second leg with devastating goals. Whatever happens. @ChelseaFC are blessed with Thomas Tuchel. What a manager. Without his own Benzema, Tuchel saw his side become wasteful towards the end of the game, with Christian Pulisic missing two late clear chances, while urther misses followed in extra-time from Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho. However, the impression left after the two matches is that Chelsea had the superior game plan and will certainly be back to fight for more trophies… if the circumstances are right. Chelsea's supporters carried a lifesize cardboard cutout of their Champions League-winning coach Tuchel into the stadium, and there is a real possibility that he can overcome the hiring and firing culture at this club. There is total belief in his work; almost the entire squad is onside with the German's methods and dedication. They have the talents of the academy to blood and loanees such as Conor Gallagher likely to return to the club over the summer. Amid uncertainty over the club's ownership, with Roman Abramovich having been sanctioned last month, Tuchel has handled the situation with grace and class. He is the best thing about the west Londoners right now. Tuchel was asked what he wants from any potential new owners and delivered a clear and concise six-word message: ""A strong squad, confidence and support."" It owes to the maturity Tuchel has gained as a coach after being criticised for falling out with his bosses in his previous roles at Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain. With four bidders entering their final offers for Chelsea on April 14, each has been laying on the charm for supporters in an attempt to win the popularity contest. Stephen Pagliuca became the final possible owner to release a statement ahead of kick-off. ""We would first like to wish Thomas and the Chelsea squad the very best of luck ahead of tonight’s Champions League match against Real Madrid,"" the statement read. ""Having witnessed a great 6-0 win against Southampton last week, I hope to see a comeback for the ages against Real Madrid in the quarter-final second leg."" Candidate Tom Ricketts also praised Tuchel's work with the others promising continued investment. It did not quite happen for Chelsea against Carlo Ancelotti's side on the night, but it should convince any new owners to continue this perfect marriage between coach and club.

Despite having a 3-1 advantage from the first leg, Madrid were on the verge of crashing out of the competition towards the end of the return fixture in the Spanish capital. They trailed 3-0 at Santiago Bernabeu but managed to take the game into extra-time thanks to a Rodrygo goal in the 80th minute. Madrid went on to get the crucial goal through Karim Benzema to win 5-4 on aggregate and the Italian coach has highlighted how Chelsea's strategy played into his team's hands. “We’ve got through because we showed the energy, particularly towards the end of the game to keep ourselves in it,"" he told reporters. ""All of the players stood up and were counted and it was a tough night. We didn't deserve to be 2-0 down. ""We struggled on set pieces because we were missing our best player in that department who is[Eder] Militaoand what’s more, their first goal came from a rebound. ""We didn't show the desire to score goals and after going 2-0 down, the team suffered mentally. I can't explain any of the rest of it. The magic of this stadium helps the players to never give in."" He added: “I've got to keep a cool head and carefully assess what has to be done. I made the changes to try and give us a bit more energy. I then had to bringNachoandVinicius Jroff because they couldn't continue. There's nothing wrong withBenzema. ""Chelsea put an awful lot of effort in to their press and that gave us the edge in extra time because we were fresher than them at that stage."" Madrid now turn their attention back to La Liga duty as they take on Sevilla on Sunday. Ancelotti's team are 12 points clear at the top of the table with seven games left to play. They will find out their next opponents in the Champions League on Wednesday when the remaining quarter-final ties are concluded. They face the winner of the tie between Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals, with the Premier League side leading 1-0 on aggregate from the first leg.

Madrid progressed to the semi-finals of the Champions League this week despite an unconvincing performance in the second leg of their last-eight clash with Chelsea. Carlo Ancelotti's team were 3-0 down and set to crash out of the competition before a Rodrygo goal with 10 minutes left on the clock forced the game into extra time, with Karim Benzema netting the decisive goal that secured a 5-4 aggregate win. Xavi says that winning while playing badly is not a luxury his side have, as they adhere to the principles set by legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff. ""We at Barcelona look at the history of the team. When Cruyff arrived he established certain bases to play well,"" Xavi said at a press conference. ""Win by playing well.This is how we Catalans are.This is how we live it. ""I don't know how it is in Madrid.Madrid has a spectacular competitive gene, but Barca is another story."" He added: ""This is Barca.We have the obligation to win and play well.It's not worth it for us to win 1-0 and in the 90th minute.We are Barca. ""It's about being excellent in everything we do.There is no comparison.Barca is the most difficult and demanding club. ""We have an obligation to win by playing well.This is the difficult thing in football.That is why this is the most difficult club in the world."" Since Xavi's appointment as coach, the Catalan side have recovered from a disappointing start to the campaign under previous boss Ronald Koeman. They are now on a 15-game unbeaten run in all competitions and can book a place in the Europa League semi-finals if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. The former midfielder has challenged his players to show their winning mentality every day and claim the European trophy this season. ""We have improved things, but nothing has been done yet,"" he said. ""It is true that we are in a good dynamic, but we have to improve and compete better. ""The winning mentality is in footballers.Perhaps it had been a bit asleep, but at Barca you have to show it day by day.Because every game is an exam.

102,https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-why-man-utd-fans-are-protesting/blte401728811a36f5f,Explained: Why Man Utd fans are protesting during Red Devils vs Norwich,"Manchester United supporters are planning further protests against the Glazer family, who own the Premier League club, amid ongoing unhappiness at the way things are run at Old Trafford. It looks likely that resentment towards the Glazers will continue to ferment for the remainder of the season, starting in the fixture against Norwich on April 16. So, why are Man Utd fans protesting and what form will the demonstrations take? GOAL takes a look... Man Utd fans have never taken to the Glazer family ever since they took charge of the club in 2005. However, a run without a major trophy currently extending to five years, plus the club's attempts to help found the failed European Super League, have brought matters to a head. The Glazers bought the club through a leveraged buyout for around £790 million ($1.1 billion). The money for the buyout was funded by debt that they would pay off from the club’s future profits. Since then the club have already paid out over £1 billion (€1.4bn) in bank fees and dividends to the owners. There have been sporadic protests for 17 years, however they have ramped up in recent seasons as Man Utd have failed to win a trophy since the Europa League in 2017, and turned nasty following the hugely unpopular ESL proposals. Those opposed to the Glazers are often seen at Old Trafford wearing green and gold - the club's original colours when founded as Newton Heath, before changing their name and their kit to red in 1902 - and carrying banners and placards with slogans criticising the Glazers. Protests reached another level last season amid the ESL fallout, as the Premier League game against Liverpool was postponed after protestors stormed the Old Trafford pitch before the game. Some protestors pushed down barriers to force their way into the ground and made their way onto the pitch ahead of one of the biggest games of the season. Chants of ""we want Glazers out"" could be heard as they stormed into the ground.​ Some fans attempted to get into the dressing rooms, as over a thousand supporters protested against the ownership. 💪💪💪💪 pic.twitter.com/NDghqHpilL A lengthy statement from Greater Manchester Police gave insight into the events of that afternoon. They said: ""Early this afternoon, groups of protestors began to gather at Old Trafford and separately at The Lowry Hotel, Salford, where the United players were staying. By late afternoon around 200 protestors had gathered outside the Lowry and over 1,000 at Old Trafford. ""Officers continued to closely monitor the situation, engaging with those present but as the groups grew in size; it became clear that many of those present were not intending to exercise their right to peaceful protest. Flares were let off and bottles thrown at officers. ""Protestors outside Old Trafford became especially aggressive and antagonistic towards police before a group of about 100 forced entry to the ground, with some United staff having to lock themselves in rooms. ""Those in the stadium were evicted by officers but outside on the forecourt hostility grew, with bottles and barriers being thrown at officers and horses. Two officers have been injured, with one officer being attacked with a bottle and sustaining a significant slash wound to his face requiring emergency hospital treatment. ""With the situation increasing in hostility, additional officers had to be deployed and officers had to be drawn in from neighbouring forces to assist Greater Manchester officers. ""Following discussion with the Premier League, Trafford Council and the clubs, a joint decision was made to postpone the match for safety reasons."" Yes, but after the awful scenes before the Liverpool game last season, Man Utd supporter groups are pushing to ensure all further protests are non-violent and peaceful. A group of supporters gathered outside the training ground on the Friday before the Norwich game, with some banners protesting the Glazers while others showed displeasure at the team's disappointing season - one placard read ""Not fit to wear the shirt"". A club spokesperson said: “There was a small and peaceful protest outside the Carrington training ground today. We respect the opinions of fans and remain committed to strengthening our engagement with them.” Now fans, led by the 1958 group, have vowed to continue with peaceful protests against the Glazers, with the intention being to remain outside the ground for 17 minutes when the home game with Norwich gets underway on Saturday.

The Red Devils have been accused of having mentality issues amid another difficult season for the club. United have lost ground in the race for a top-four finish, having won just one of their last five games in the Premier League and crashed out of the Champions League. But Rangnick has urged his players to rise to the occasion to have a strong finish to the season. “[It's] not only at home we have to show that in the remaining seven games,"" he told the club's website. ""That’s why I called it a test of character; we have to show the supporters and the media and the public that the speculation about a lack of mentality and character is not true. ""Even if I speak about that in the press conferences every week and I tell the journalists that I don’t think this is the case, it doesn’t help the truth because the reality is on the pitch. ""We have to show it on the pitch.” United are still in contention for a place in the Premier League's top four. Tottenham currently occupy the last spot which guarantees a place in next season's Champions League, sitting six points ahead of Rangnick's men. Arsenal are just three behind their north London rivals, while West Ham are level on points with United. “Mathematically it can happen, but it doesn’t help us at all if we speculate about that,"" Rangnick said of their chances of finishing fourth. ""It’s about us winning our own games, that’s the only thing we can influence and we can affect ourselves – our own performance and results. We need to make sure that we start winning games again. ""I said before the game against Leicester that we needed nine points out of the next three games. So far we have one point out of six from Leicester and Everton. So there is no point speculating about whether it's possible or not. ""Yes, mathematically it might still be possible, but we have to start winning games and we need to do that on Saturday.""

The Red Devils have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions and face a battle to qualify for the Champions League next season. They go into Saturday’s match against bottom side Norwich in seventh place in the Premier League, six points outside the top four. Rangnick replaced Ole Gunnar Solksjaer on an interim basis in November and is due to hand over to a permanent successor in the summer before taking up a two-year consultancy role, with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag the frontrunner for the job. It was hoped his appointment would boost their chances of making the top four, but the German has failed to get the side firing on a consistant basis, winning just nine of his 22 games in charge. The fanbase has grown increasingly frustrated as the campaign has progressed, leading to a protest against the club's owners outside their training ground on Friday, with more protests planned before the Norwich game. Despite all this turbulence Rangnick insists he does not regret taking the job, though he admits he is not happy with how things have panned out so far. “No. No regrets whatsoever. I would do it over and over again,” he told reporters. “I don’t regret that at all. As a manager you always have to question and ask yourself what you could have done better, if I could have played with a different formation in certain games, if a substitution could have been done earlier. This is what always happens we always ask question ourselves what we could have done better. ""I think we are all aware it’s not an easy squad, the whole situation was not easy or I would not be sitting here and Ole would probably still be here. Again, I think we have shown in the past couple of months we were able to raise the level but not in the same sustainable way that I would have wished. That’s the reason I’m not happy at all with what we’ve done and achieved so far.” Rangnick thinks some of his players may have struggled to cope with the level of expectation, which has resulted in some stuttering performances. The Red Devils are without a win in three games and slipped to a 1-0 defeat at relegation battlers Everton last weekend. “I don’t know if this was the case but it might be with one or two or three of our players. It seems to be like that, that the level of expectation is high and some of the players seem to struggle with their own performance with that,” he added. “But, again there are no alibis and no excuses we have to be ready to cope and deal with it. ""For tomorrow I’m sure and fully aware of that and I’m convinced and very positive that all the players know about this. It's a test of character and mentality. ""Whatever speculation we have as to what I think or you think was the reason behind the performance at Everton we have to be able to in our house [stadium] beat a team like Norwich and show the best possible performance.

Things had been going swimmingly for Mikel Arteta’s side in the Premier League in 2022, with the Gunners winning six of their last seven games ahead of Monday night’s trip to Crystal Palace. But with the pressure on following Tottenham’s 5-1 drubbing of Newcastle 24 hours earlier, Arsenal produced their worst performance in months as they crashed to a shambolic 3-0 defeat Selhurst Park. It’s a defeat that keeps them fifth, below Spurs on goal difference, although they do still have one game in hand on their north London rivals. But perhaps more worryingly, it’s a defeat that raises big questions about whether Arteta’s side have what it takes to stay the pace during the final weeks of the season. They were without Kieran Tierney due to a knee injury and there are fears the Scotland left-back could be out for the remainder of the season with the problem, which was picked up on international duty. Tierney, who will have a scan on Tuesday to determine the full extent of the issue, was replaced by Nuno Tavares on the left hand side of the back four and the 22-year-old endured a torrid time. The summer signing from Benfica was beaten at the back post by Joachim Andersen in the build up to Jean-Philippe Mateta’s opening goal for Crystal Palace and was then caught flat-footed by Jordan Ayew, who doubled the home side’s lead on 24 minutes after an error by Gabriel Magalhaes. Tavares was replaced at half-time by Arteta, with Gabriel Martinelli coming on. It was the second successive time that the Portuguese full-back had failed to even make it back out for the second half when handed a start by Arteta. And with Tierney potentially out for the remainder of the campaign, that is a major problem with nine games still remaining. Arsenal ended last season with Granit Xhaka as a makeshift left-back and it cost them dearly in the big moments, most notably in the latter stages of the Europa League. It could be that history now repeats itself with the Champions League once again on the line. And to make matters even worse for the visitors, they lost Thomas Partey to what appeared to be a thigh injury midway through the second half. The Ghana international signalled that he needed to come off, but the hosts broke through Wilfried Zaha before the ball could be kicked out of play and were awarded a penalty when Martin Odegaard tripped the Palace winger.  Zaha, so often the scourge of Arsenal in recent years, made no mistake from the spot to pile even misery on Arteta’s shell-shocked side. Partey limped off before the penalty was taken. It could be a while before we see the midfielder in action again. His form alongside Granit Xhaka in midfield has been a big part of Arsenal’s recent form so a prolonged spell on the sidelines will be another major worry for Arteta. There was at least some improvement from Arsenal after the interval and they did have some chances, with Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard both wasting glorious opportunities and Eddie Nketiah hitting the woodwork. But the visitors were still well beaten. Outplayed and outfought all over the pitch.  Arteta now has to try and raise his players ahead of Saturday’s game against Brighton. This is of course just their third league defeat since December and they do still have Champions League qualification in their own hands. But with Tottenham looking increasingly impressive under Antonio Conte and with Tierney and Partey potentially facing long-term spells in the treatment room, Arteta’s small squad is going to be tested to its limits in the coming weeks. The way they respond to this truly disastrous night in south London will go a long way to deciding how their season pans out. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

106,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-injury-crisis-arteta-without-tierney-partey/blt1299b37f4d8e8347,Arsenal’s injury crisis: How will Arteta cope without Tierney and Partey?,"Arsenal were hit with a hammer blow this week with the news that Kieran Tierney will miss the remainder of the season and that Thomas Partey is also facing a long spell on the sidelines. Tierney will undergo surgery this week on his left knee and is not expected to return to full fitness until July, just in time for the start of pre-season training. It's currently unclear exactly how long Partey will be sidelined with the thigh injury he sustained during the second half of Monday night’s 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace. But a statement released by Arsenal on Thursday revealed that the midfielder will have to see a specialist over the coming weeks, suggesting that he will not be available any time soon. Both players are crucial members of Mikel Arteta’s squad and their absence over the closing weeks of the campaign will be a real issue for the Gunners as they continue to battle for a top-four finish in the Premier League. So, how will Arteta fill the void left by Tierney and Partey? GOAL takes a look at the options below... There should be a simple solution for Arteta at left-back. Nuno Tavares was brought in from Benfica last summer to be Tierney's understudy – something Arsenal had lacked before his arrival. However, the Portuguese has performed poorly in recent appearances. He was brought off at half-time against Palace after enduring a torrid time at Selhurst Park and, in his previous start, against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup, he lasted just 35 minutes before being replaced. Tavares is clearly struggling for form and confidence, looking completely different to the player who made such an impact during his first few months in north London. Arteta must, therefore, decide whether to persist with the 22-year-old and hope he plays himself back into some form, or turn to someone else to fill the void left by Tierney. Sticking with Tavares would certainly be the least disruptive option for Arteta. It would allow him to stick with the 4-3-3 system he has been using in the past few months while still having a natural left-back in defence. It would also leave him with the relatively simple choice of replacing Partey with either Sambi Lokonga or Mohamed Elneny in midfield. If Arteta wants to stick with a back four but doesn’t trust using Tavares at left-back, he does have the option of using Cedric Soares in that role. It’s a position the Portuguese international has played before during his time at Arsenal and his experience should see him do a decent enough job if called upon again. But with Takehiro Tomiyasu currently injured, Arsenal do not have another senior right-back option, so if Arteta did decide to switch Cedric over the opposite flank, it would likely mean moving Ben White out of his natural position in the centre of defence and using him as a makeshift right-back. That is far from ideal as it would leave Arsenal with two full-backs who would be playing out of position and it would also mean breaking up White’s partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes at centre-back. And with Cedric being naturally right-footed, it would leave Arsenal unbalanced down the left-hand side. This was the option Arteta chose towards the end of last season when Tierney also succumbed to injury. When Tavares was substituted at Palace, it was Xhaka who moved to the left side of the defence. But the injury sustained by Partey at Selhurst Park will surely rule out Xhaka as a long-term option for Arteta when it comes to filling in for Tierney. With the Ghana international facing up to several weeks out, it’s highly unlikely that Arteta will decide to take Xhaka out of central midfield as well. The latter has been exceptional in 2022 and Arsenal will be hoping he will not be sidelined too long. Elneny and Lokonga are the main contenders to deputise, although youngster Charlie Patino has just returned from injury and could also come into the mix. Lokonga showed flashes of real quality when he had an extended spell in the side earlier in the season and the 22-year-old could now has a real opportunity to make his mark in the first team once again. Arteta has changed to a back three more than once in recent weeks, bringing on Rob Holding to help see out games. The 26-year-old has slotted between White and Gabriel and has produced some impressive cameos in the closing stages of tight games, especially away at Wolves and Aston Villa. So, it’s a legitimate option for Arteta, as it would also allow him to use Tavares as a left-sided wing-back, which would suit him better because of his attacking capabilities. He could then pair Xhaka with either Lokonga or Elneny in the heart of midfield. But switching formations at such a crucial time of the season could be disruptive as Arteta’s players have become accustomed to the 4-3-3 system he has settled on recently. It would see some have to adjust to new roles, which could take time - which is not ideal when every single point will be crucial between now and the end of the season in the race for the top four. Playing with a back three would also make it difficult to give Martin Odegaard the type of freedom in the final third that he has flourished in since the turn of the year. Bukayo Saka is so good he could comfortably fill in at left-back and still be one of Arsenal’s best players. The 20-year-old played in the position several times when he first broke into the team and showed he can defend well while also still being a threat going forward. But while there is no doubt Saka could do the job, moving him out of the attack now would make very little sense at all. He is Arsenal’s top scorer this season and, with Alexandre Lacazette offering almost no goal threat at all in the central attacking position, Arsenal simply can’t do without Saka in the final third of the pitch. So, of all of the options available to Arteta when it comes to replacing Tierney, this should be last on the list. Nuno Tavares was brought in to be Tierney’s understudy, so he should be the man to replace the Scotland international. He may be out of form, but he should be given Saturday’s game against Brighton at least to try and get back to the sort of level he produced during the opening months of the season when he really caught the eye at left-back. Sticking with Tavares would be by far the least disruptive option for Arteta and it would allow him to switch Xhaka into the deeper midfield role to cover for the absence of Partey and play Lokonga slightly in front of the Switzerland international. Employing a back three could potentially work, but changing formations at this stage of the season is far from ideal and could do more harm than good. And the other options would cause too much upheaval in terms of moving players out of their natural positions. Tavares was signed to ensure Arsenal had natural cover for Tierney, so now is the time to put some trust in him. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

107,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-aubameyang-transfer-gamble-arteta-edu-firing-line/blt07c73a73545ce186,Arsenal's Aubameyang transfer gamble leaves Arteta and Edu in the firing line,"It was a deadline day that summed up Arsenal’s transfer window. At times, it seemed like things were running quite smoothly but, in the end, it all felt a bit chaotic. Arsenal went into January with what felt like a sense of purpose – with the club hoping to add two new additions, a central midfielder and a striker. However, they were left empty-handed after failing to bring in anyone to strengthen their push for a top four spot during the second half of the Premier League season. They will now go into the final 17 games of their campaign with a squad that is undeniably weaker than the one with which they started the year. In all, six senior players left the club during the window – with former skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joining Barcelona just a few minutes before the Monday night’s 11pm deadline. The Gabon international, who was still Arsenal’s captain just seven weeks ago, was released from his contract 18 months early, bringing to an end his Arsenal career exactly four years to the day since he arrived from Borussia Dortmund. Aubameyang becomes the latest in an ever-increasing list of players to be just given away by the Gunners. Some of their own supporters are now labelling the club as ‘Free Transfer FC’. The striker’s departure will save the North London club around £20 million ($27m) in wages the long run, however, and given his relationship with Arteta had totally broken down and there was little chance of him bring brought back into the fold, it’s difficult to argue that a move away wasn’t the best solution for all concerned. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's deadline day - a short story 😅￭ Arrives in Barcelona, with loan said to be imminent￭ Talks break down￭ Joan Laporta claims deal is back on track￭ Medical is booked￭ Barca agree to sign him on a free￭ Signs contract just before deadline pic.twitter.com/NbkPJWSfku What can be called into question, however, is the failure of technical director Edu and the club to replace him. Aubameyang’s exit has felt inevitable for some time now, yet the Gunners have not been able to bring someone in to fill the void he has left in the squad. The Dusan Vlahovic saga resulted in the Fiorentina striker joining Juventus, while long-term targets such as Alexander Isak, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jonathan David proved to be unattainable. That means – with a top four spot very much up for grabs this season – Arsenal will now go through to the end of the campaign with just Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah as their only recognised central strikers, both of whom are out of contract in the summer and expected to leave on a free. They have also scored just three Premier League goals between them this season, with Lacazette accounting for all of them. While other teams have strengthened their options during the past month, Arsenal have undoubtedly weakened theirs. It looked for a time that they would at least land Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo on loan from Juventus, but Edu was unable to close a deal with the Italian side following a disagreement over the length of the 25-year-old's stay. “The market is difficult and complicated,” Arteta had warned following Arsenal’s 0-0 draw with Burnley on January 23. That goalless draw against the Premier League’s bottom-placed club was the fourth game in succession that Arsenal had failed to score. A month that had started full of hope and excitement for the Gunners, ended in frustration. Fans left Emirates Stadium hoping that the final days of the transfer window would lift some of the gloom caused by a winless January, but instead it only added to it. ""The players who come here have to take us to the next level,” Arteta had said earlier in the window. “We already have a level and we want to set much better standards than we already have. That's how we want to recruit."" On the face of it, those are comments few can argue with. But given Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers, Sead Kolasinac, Folarin Balogun and Aubameyang were all allowed to leave during January, the need for new additions felt particularly pressing. “We are very short,” Arteta himself admitted earlier in the month. “I think with the way we want to evolve the squad we have to maximise every window in every way. “Edu and his team are working very hard because we know exactly what we need to do.” Arsenal’s results between now and the end of the season will ultimately shape how the decisions taken in January will be viewed. Should the Gunners’ new streamlined squad go on to secure a return to the Champions League, the past few weeks could be seen as a masterstroke ahead of what would be a busy summer. But a difficult end to the season will see Arteta and Edu come under huge pressure. With no new sign of a striker coming in, Arteta could have taken the decision to patch things up with Aubameyang and bring him back into the squad. That would have at least given Arsenal another attacking option during the closing months of the season. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s legacy at Arsenal 🙌6️⃣8️⃣ Premier League goals.1️⃣6️⃣ Premier League assists. pic.twitter.com/vWD4AYTX1e But he went down the other route and sanctioned the striker's exit, leaving himself with Lacazette and Nketiah as his only central striking options. Should that backfire and Arsenal miss out on the top four due to a lack of goals, then the finger of blame will quite fairly be pointed firmly in the direction of Arteta. This was his decision; he will now have to live with the results. There’s no doubt Arsenal’s transfer strategy in the summer was smart, with the additions of players like Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Martin Odegaard breathing new life into a squad that had gone stale, Few would have given Arsenal a chance of competing for the top four at the start of the season, especially after they opened with three successive defeats and went into the first international break rooted at the bottom of the table. But the revival that followed raised expectations and with Arteta’s side now sitting just two points behind fourth-placed Manchester United with a game in hand, there was a sense that a strong January could have seen them steal a real march in the race for Champions League. It wasn’t to be, however, and now Arsenal must hope their young squad has enough knowhow and firepower to get them over the line between now and May 22. The club has taken a big risk. If it works out, they will have put themselves in a fantastic position for the summer. If they fall short, however, then they will only have themselves to blame and it will be Arteta and Edu who will be left squarely in the firing line.

108,https://www.goal.com/en/news/isak-calvert-lewin-david-arsenal-replace-lacazette/blt78ad4a0b72145f08,'Lacazette makes the people around him better' - How on earth will Arsenal replace selfless striker?,"It’s no secret that Arsenal will be revamping their forward line this summer. With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gone and Alexandre Lacazette now into the final six months of his contract, a changing of the guard will be taking place at the end of the season. Mikel Arteta will be turning to something new, with at least two attackers set to arrive to freshen up the Arsenal frontline. It’s the next step in Arsenal’s rebuild under the Spaniard and it’s arguably the most important part of the overhaul. Arteta and technical director Edu proved with the signings they made last summer that they can get things right when it comes to identifying and securing talent. The six new arrivals have all made an impact this season and improved the team, but Arteta knows the forthcoming transfer window is hugely important. “Now is the moment we have to go to a different level,” he said ahead of last weekend’s win at Watford. “We have been able to get the squad balance in a much better shape and now is the moment to raise the quality.” Arsenal's shortcomings in several areas have already been addressed during the past two years. However, one position has not been touched. Indeed, Arteta has yet to sign a single attacker since he replaced Unai Emery as manager in December, 2019. That will change this summer, with the focus on finding replacements for Lacazette and the recently departed Aubameyang. Although Arteta insists there is still a chance that the former could stay at the Emirates, it's expected that he will move on once his current contract expires. And even if he were to sign an extension, the 30-year-old would find himself behind whichever striker Arsenal bring in during the summer transfer window. But how do you replace Lacazette? Critics will point to the fact he has scored just three Premier League goals this season, but that does not tell the full story in terms of his importance to Arteta’s vibrant young side. While Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard continue to grab the headlines due to their performances, Lacazette is proving to be the glue that holds Arsenal’s new ‘Fab Four’ together. He has taken on extra responsibility since Aubameyang was banished after the Everton game on December 7 and his unselfishness and workrate has allowed Arsenal’s young attackers to flourish around him. Since the defeat at Goodison Park, which was Aubameyang’s last appearance, Arsenal have taken 25 Premier League points from a possible 30 – no other side has taken more. And while Lacazette may have scored just once during that run – a penalty against Norwich – he has created more goals (seven) than any other player in the past 10 games, with his two most recent assists coming against Watford on Sunday. “Laca knows my movement and where I am,” Saka said after netting in the 3-2 success which moved Arsenal into the Champions League places. “It’s so fun to play with him.” Arsenal have certainly been transformed as an attacking force since Arteta made the decision to use Lacazette as the focal point of his forward line. The Gunners averaged just 1.2 goals per game prior to Aubameyang’s final appearance at Everton. Since then, with Lacazette playing as the central striker, they average 2.3. They are also averaging more shots (17.8 compared to 14.0), more shots on target (5.7 to 4.8) and more touches in the opposition box (34.4 to 23.1). Possession has increased to 55.6 per cent compared to 49.1% and, most importantly, they are now averaging 2.5 points per game, compared to just 1.5 previously. Obviously, there are other factors linked to that improvement, but the ability of Lacazette to hold the ball up and create for the likes of Saka, Martinelli, Smith Rowe and Odegaard has been a major factor. ""Laca makes the people around him better,"" Arteta said of his skipper.""He understands the game really well, he's a really intelligent player and his work-rate is phenomenal.” It’s vital that whoever arrives at the Emirates during the summer window has a similar skill set, so that Arsenal can continue to get the best out of their exciting crop of attacking midfielders. Real Sociedad forward Alexander Isak is a player admired by Arsenal, as is Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin. There is also a long-standing interest in Jonathan David, who looks certain to leave Lille in the summer. All three fit the profile Arteta is seeking: they are young, mobile strikers who link well with others. It's clear that the next No.9 at Arsenal will have to do more than just score goals. Arteta has some of the brightest young attacking talents in Europe to call upon right now. Finding the right man to link them together will be essential to ensuring Arsenal’s improvement continues.

109,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-career-chelsea-usmnt-injuries-improvement/bltd6de1789304de445,Pulisic reveals ‘toughest hurdle’ in career as Chelsea and USMNT star discusses injuries and improvement,"Christian Pulisic has been discussing the “toughest hurdle” in his career, but the Chelsea and USMNT forward says he strives for continuous improvement. The 23-year-old has been at Stamford Bridge since summer 2019, making close to 100 appearances for the Premier League club while becoming a talismanic presence for his country. However, there have been plenty of challenges along the way for a man who has suffered his fair share of knocks. Asked by Chelsea TV about the biggest tests he has faced, Pulisic said: “The toughest hurdle in my career so far I would say have been the injuries that I’ve had in the last two seasons. “The one that was a really tough one was just before the lockdown. During that time I think patience was really important. “I told myself that by this game I need to be back playing and I had that in my head that I need to be back by this moment, and it wasn’t giving me the right clarity and the right mindset to really make sure and get myself 100 per cent right and then I’m going to go. “I learned a lot about myself in that way. It’s about finding the right time and knowing the time will come and it will all work out and happened for a reason.” Pulisic tore an abductor muscle in January 2020 which forced him to miss 12 games, before returning to action but picking up more problems, including an ankle complaint that kept him out of a further 12 fixtures this season. He has learned how to deal with those setbacks though and remains focused on improving his game in order to become even more valuable to Chelsea and the United States. Pulisic said: “The No 1 thing that has been a big part of my career is making myself uncomfortable - putting myself in situation where I’m maybe not the best in or something that I’m not particularly good at and then working at that constantly. “My weaker foot, for example. Cutting inside and using my weaker foot, I felt like I wasn’t as strong, but I constantly worked on it and my crossing and shooting and trying to do stuff with the weak foot.” Chelsea, fresh from landing more major silverware at the Club World Cup, will be back in Premier League action on Saturday with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

The striker is working his way back to full fitness, having been limited to just five Premier League appearances since mid-October due to an injury and a bout of Covid-19. The 28-year-old, who has scored five times in 13 Premier League appearances, feels the current system employed by coach Thomas Tuchel does not suit him. However, he has pledged to work his way back to his best form for the Blues. “Physically I'm fine, even better than before. After two years in Italy, in which I worked a lot at Inter with coaches and nutritionists, I am physically fine,” he told Sky Sport. “I’m not happy with the situation and that’s only natural. The head coach has decided to play a different system and I mustn’t let up, I need to keep working hard and be professional. ""I’m not happy with the situation but I’m a grafter and I mustn’t let up."" Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge after a successful spell with Inter, leaving months after they secured the Serie A title in 11 years. The Belgium international admits he regrets the way the move was handled, as his departure angered fans, but he is open to returning to the Italian top-flight in the future. “I think everything that happened was not supposed to happen like this,” he added. “How I left Inter, how I communicated with the fans, this bothers me because it is not the right time now, but even when I left it was not the right time. “Now I think it is right to speak because I have always said that I have Inter in my heart, I will return to play there, I really hope so. “I am in love with Italy, this is rightly the time to talk and let people know what really happened without talking badly about people because I am not like that.” Lukaku continued: ""First I want to say a big apology to the Inter fans because I think the way I left should have been different.I had to talk to you first, because the things you have done for me, for my family, for my mother, for my son, are things that remain for me in life. ""I really hope in the depths of my heart to return to Inter, not at the end of my career, but at a still good level to hopefully win more."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

112,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-are-the-fa-cup-semi-finals-played-at-wembley/ttpswlicmyfv1o85s1m3mcod3,Why are the FA Cup semi-finals played at Wembley?,"In the English football tradition, getting to play at Wembley - the iconic 'Home of Football' - is seen as the pinnacle for many players. The hallowed venue was the customary battleground for the FA Cup final and other such deciders, as well as England games, so its turf was preserved for a select group. Indeed, such was the prestige associated with it that Tottenham released a song along with Chas and Dave just for reaching the 1981 final! However, in recent years it has not been such an exclusive venue. FA Cup semi-finals are now held there too, while Spurs used the ground as their temporary home as a new stadium in north London was built. The FA Cup semi-finals have been played at Wembley since the 2007-08 season, following a decision made by the FA in 2003. It was a move driven chiefly by financial reasons, with the FA keen to ensure that the stadium - which cost roughly £789 million ($1bn) to construct - brought in enough revenue to pay for itself. Indeed, as the biggest stadium in the United Kingdom with a capacity of 90,000, Wembley stands to earn more from ticket sales than other similar venues. The first FA Cup semi-finals to be played at the new Wembley were Portsmouth versus West Brom and Cardiff City versus Barnsley in April 2008. Of the teams involved on that occasion, only Portsmouth were playing in the Premier League at the time, with the rest representing the Championship. Prior to 2008, FA Cup semi-finals were traditionally played at a handful of select venues, including Old Trafford in Manchester, Villa Park in Birmingham and Hillsborough in Sheffield. Inevitably, the switch to staging all semi-finals at Wembley led to some discontent, but Nick Barron, who was a spokesperson for the FA at the time, said that it was a ""financial necessity"". ""There will be traditionalists upset by the idea of the semi-finals being at Wembley,"" Barron said in 2003. ""So will some fans of clubs who would have to travel a long way to London and we appreciate that it's not necessarily an ideal situation. ""However, it's a financial necessity in order to pay for the new stadium. And the up side is that not only will more fans be able to watch the games, but they will be doing so in the best stadium in the world."" While Wembley was traditionally preserved for the final before 2008, the old stadium did host a number of semi-finals during the 1990s, the first of which was the 1991 meeting between north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham. After over a decade of the semi-final games being played in the capital venue, however, there have been calls to restore the regional element to the FA Cup. Former Aston Villa chief executive Keith Wyness, for example, argued that playing games at Villa Park was a positive idea. ""Villa Park semi-finals were always very special games and we’d like to see them back here,"" Wyness told the Mirror in 2018. ""The England roadshow was good, and Villa Park as one of the venues would be great. “It’s also the perfect opportunity for the FA administration to relocate to the Midlands, the heart of the country."" Liverpool will play Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals 🍿 pic.twitter.com/GMGFrkYpEf Debate regarding the staging of FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley resurfaced in 2022 when Liverpool and Manchester City lined up another heavyweight encounter in domestic knockout competition. Two giants of England's north west questioned why they, along with a loyal legion of supporters, were being made to make a difficult journey to the capital when alternative venues could be considered. The Reds and Blues were booked to grace the home of English football on April 16, in the middle of the Easter Bank Holiday weekend. The Football Association pencilled their showdown in for 3:30pm BST on a Saturday, with the traditional afternoon blackout of television coverage on that particular day of the week being lifted for a special occasion. Supporters were, however, left facing severe travel disruption due to maintenance works being carried out on road and rail routes. Calls from Liverpool and City to have the fixture moved to a more suitable location fell on deaf ears, with the FA merely stating that they would put on 100 free buses for travelling fans while also working with National Highways to ensure that ""hundreds of miles of unessential roadworks will be put on hold.""

Abramovich ownership situation & potential new buyers explained,"It is no longer being denied thatRoman Abramovich is preparing to sell Chelsea Football Club after the threat of sanctions forces his hand through his association with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Although Abramovich has yet to be sanctioned by the EU, UK, or United States, and insists that he hasn't done anything wrong, the oligarch is fearing a potential backlash due to the invasion of Ukraine. Having previously denied the option of selling, the Blues now refuse to comment. As well as on the record comment, severalsources have told GOAL that they believeAbramovich is preparing a total exit from the UK economy. Chris Bryant MP, the Labour politician who has led the charge against the Blues' owner, gave insights into the situation on Tuesday: ""Roman Abramovich, well I think he’s terrified of being sanctioned, which is why he’s already going to sell his home tomorrow, and sell another flat as well. ""My anxiety is that we’re taking too long about these things."" With Abramovich's property up for sale, it was likely his club was too and it was confirmed on March 1 through Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. ""Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly,"" Wyss told theSwiss newspaper Blick. ""I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2bn. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don’t know the exact selling price."" The asking price is said to be £2.6 billion ($3.5bn)which is significantly more than the £300m ($400m)that Abramovich originally bought it for. The price will cover the £1.5bn ($2bn)debt that the Russian has pumped into the west Londoners over the last 19 years. Swiss businessman Wyss believes that, even with his £4.6bn ($6bn) net worth, Chelsea is too expensive and would look to buy the club as part of a consortium. ""I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners,"" he said. ""But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say: I’m definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then [it will be] with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors."" Wyss has now been revealed to be a part of a consortium that includes Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly. INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe considered buying the Blues in the past and has reportedly been linked with making an offer to buy the club. However, his brother, Bob, has complained about the stadium, which needs redeveloping to compete with many of their Premier League rivals.  ""There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations,"" Bob Ratcliffe told BBC Five Live. ""The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that."" Prospective new owners also wouldn't be able to own the pitch due to a fan ownership model, called the 'Chelsea Pitch Owners', retaining control of the turf itself. Abramovich has owned Chelsea for almost 19 years and has claimed an incredible 21 trophies over his almost two-decade spell. He was the first of a wave of wealthy individuals to pump their personal wealth into the sport, changing the status quo of domination from the traditional superpowers in the game. Along with the likes of Manchester City, Newcastle United and Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea have been accused of sports washing, which accuses individuals of using sport to clean their reputation in the west. #PMQs opened by @Keir_Starmer asking why Roman Abramovich isn't facing sanctions yet pic.twitter.com/lvH2e9BWAm Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The government has referred to the move towards Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich as the largest asset freeze in UK history. It's a continuation of the UK targetting those with ties to Russia President Vladimir Putin, who is overseeing an invasion of Ukraine that has drawn scorn from the West. ""We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. ""Nothing and no one is off the table."" The Chelsea owner himself has already been sanctioned by the UK government, leading him to put the club up for sale in a process that is still ongoing. For a time, the sanctions limited ticket and merchandise sales, however those aspects have since been amended. As the Chelsea sale process occurs, Abramovich has stepped away from all leadership responsibilities. There are still multiple potential buyers said to be in the running to buy the Blues, with the affair expected to be wrapped up in the near-future.

The Reds sealed their place after Sunday's draw with a narrow victory over Nottingham Forest to book their place in the last four. With both the Merseysiders and City still in the hunt for the Premier League and Champions League titles as well as the FA Cup, a hugely competitive tie can be expected in April at Wembley. Date Fixture April 16/17 Chelsea vs Crystal Palace April 16/17 Man City vs Liverpool All four teams will play their single-leg encounters over the weekend of April 16/17, in just under a month. Both games will be played over back-to-back days in a blockbuster double-header at Wembley Stadium, where all last-four ties have been played since 2008, after several years of dual neutral venues as hosts. For Liverpool and Chelsea it marks the second visit in the space of three months, after both faced off in the Carabao Cup final in February under the iconic arch. The two winners of the semi-finals will both return to Wembley Stadium four weeks later for the showpiece encounter on May 14. The match comes one week before the end of the Premier League season - and two weeks before the Champions League final, in which several of the FA Cup's remaining clubs could also be competing.

The former England defender made his long-awaited return to first-team action earlier this season, ending a 712-day absence after a debilitating run of injuries kept him out of consistent action. Yet his chances have still been limited since his first game back in January, and a reported loan move to Bordeaux collapsed - but the 30-year-old says that he feels fortunate enough to have had the career he has had, and that he still thinks he can offer more over the coming years. ""I feel lucky,"" Jones told The Guardian. “I’m 100% lucky to have played in two World Cups, been through the Euros and had some fantastic moments at Old Trafford with some amazing players. ""Of course people say: ‘You should have done this, you could have done that, blah blah blah.’ But I feel so lucky. “I’m still only 30 and I’ve missed a lot of football. I’m hoping to recapture some form and enjoy playing football. When I was out injured it was a difficult time but I’ll never give up. I feel like I’m still good enough and I’ve got a lot to give. So I’m hopeful. I’m ready to play again.” One of a handful of players among the current Manchester United crop to actually win the Premier League, alongside stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and David De Gea, Jones has often found himself battling against a less-than-stellar reputation on the field. But his admirers remain many, and even if he has to bring the curtain down on his stay at Manchester United, he is unlikely to be short of potential suitors who would consider his experience crucial. ""Let’s see what happens,"" he added. ""I’m hoping I can get some game time and I’m giving everything in training every day."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Rooney, son of United's all-time record scorer Wayne, initially joined the club's youth ranks in 2020 and is now working towards following in his father's footsteps at Old Trafford. The 12-year-old certainly has the same eye for goal based on his latest performance, which came in a derby clash with the Red Devils' local rivals City. Rooney received the ball on the edge of the box and took a touch to set himself before curling an unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner of the net, and uploaded a video of the goal for his followers to see on Instagram.

United spent big money after finishing second in the Premier League last season, securing deals for Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane while also bringing Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club from Juventus. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was unable to use those signings as a springboard to reach the next level, though, and lost his job in November following a poor start to the 2021-22 campaign, with Rangnick then drafted in on an interim basis. The Red Devils' struggles for consistency have continued under Rangnick, who feels a squad overhaul is needed for the club to close the gap on the top two in the Premier League. The German will be replaced by a new permanent manager in the summer, but will be staying on in a consultancy role, and has identified a lack of ""physicality"" as the main issue for his successor to address. Speaking after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Leicester City on Saturday, Rangnick said: ""Manchester City and Liverpool… have been built together and recruited over a period of five or six years - all of them under the premise of how the coaches want to play. I told the board this is what has to happen [at United]. ""Whenever the new head coach is clear, it has to be: how does he want to play and what kind of players do we need for that? Then we come back to DNA, speed, physicality, tempo. What do we need? This team does not lack technical players, it can do with more physicality. ""It takes right decisions and [clarity over] where you want to go: what kind of players, want kind of manager and then, in every transfer window, try to get the best possible. ""This is rocket science. It has to be done and, if that happens, it does not necessarily need three or four years. Maybe in two or three transfer windows, then the situation could be different."" The Red Devils' chances of securing Champions League qualification were damaged after the draw with Leicester as they now sit three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham with eight games remaining. Rangnick wasn't unhappy with his side's effort levels but did feel that they were outbattled by the Foxes at Old Trafford, as he added: ""I don't think we have a lack of character but what was obvious in some parts of the game is we were second best with regards to physicality. ""It was about one-on-one duels. We spoke about that counterattacking moment we had ourselves where they tackled us twice, within two seconds [and went on to score] and the same was true in quite a few other moments. ""It is difficult to challenge a technically great player into a physical, aggressive one and we have a lot of people who are technical players. ""Leicester were aggressive and physical in many parts of the game and we had problems with them. It is difficult to change. I do not think it is to do with mindset - it is to do with the DNA of the players."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Portugal produced a disappointing showing in their World Cup qualifying group as they finished second behind Serbia, dropping into the European play-offs as a result. Fernando Santos' side earned a 3-1 win over Turkey in their semi-final last Thursday and are now heavy favourites to beat North Macedonia in the final of their qualifying section, with Ronaldo confident they will avoid an upset. The 37-year-old has dismissed the suggestion that he might not be present when the tournament kicks off in Qatar in November, telling reporters: “There is no World Cup without Portugal. There are no individualities here.” North Macedonia shocked Euro 2020 winners Italy to reach the final of the play-offs, but Ronaldo has no doubt that Portugal will succeed where the Azzurri failed after a strong few days of preparation. “We were surprised,” The United striker said of Italy's defeat. “North Macedonia has surprised in many matches. But I don’t think they will surprise us tomorrow. Portugal will play better and we will make it to the World Cup. “We know that if we win we will go to the World Cup and if we lose we are out. ""We have the responsibility to be positive and win the match. I see everyone well prepared and wanting to be at their best tomorrow.” Ronaldo was also asked if the 2022 World Cup will be his last if Portugal do manage to qualify, which would be his 10th major tournament appearance in a row. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner, who is the highest-scoring player in the history of men's international football with 115 goals to his name, says he is tired of the constant speculation over his future and won't be rushing such an important career decision. ""I'm starting to be asked the same question. The one who is going to decide my future is me, nobody else,"" Ronaldo replied. ""If I feel like playing more, I'll play, if I don't feel like playing more, I won't. I'll decide, period."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Rashford is enduring the worst season of his Man Utd career, having only scored five goals across 26 appearances in all competitions. The 24-year-old has lost his starting place due to his poor form, leading to reports of a potential exit when the summer transfer window opens. Derby County boss Rooney, who enjoyed a hugely successful 13 year spell at United as a player, has dismissed the notion Rashford will have to leave the club to rebuild his confidence. The 36-year-old scored 253 goals for the Red Devils between 2004 and 2017, an all-time club record, but he believes Rashford is capable of breaking that. “To get the record and be United’s highest goal scorer is f***ing massive,"" Rooney said at a black-tie event in Manchester over the weekend - as reported by The Sun. “What I hope is that Marcus Rashford f*cking gets his head out of his a*se and goes and breaks that record. He is aManchester lad.” Rooney is earning his stripes as a coach at Derby in the Championship, but has admitted  his ulitmate goal is to return to Old Trafford. The former United and Everton striker has also confirmed that he was a candidate for the top job at Goodison Park before Frank Lampard was appointed to replace Rafa Benitez in January. ""The whole reason in me going into management is Manchester United. I got offered the job interview for theEverton job,"" said Rooney. “I want to be Manchester United manager. I know I am not ready now but I have to plan everything I do to make sure one day it will happen.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

122,https://www.goal.com/en/news/advantage-man-city-guardiola-missed-chances-liverpool/blt52506745796ce4dc,"Advantage Man City, but could Guardiola rue missed chances in Liverpool thriller?","Match statistics: Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool On Sunday morning, Manchester City held the slenderest of leads at the top of the Premier League table. And as heads hit pillows on Sunday evening, Manchester City will still hold the slenderest of leads at the top of the Premier League table. But the defending champions might yet come to rue the chance they missed to kill the title race once and for all. They remain a point clear of Liverpool at the summit of English football and it is not inconceivable that they will hold that advantage until the last day of the season. But when Riyad Mahrez broke through deep in injury time, with only Alisson to beat, he had the chance to put a huge puncture in Liverpool's title hopes. After twice coming back, there would have been no time and no third opportunity for Jurgen Klopp's side, but City's top scorer could only loop his effort over the bar, leaving one of the most thrilling title races in years to live on. ""It's a great chance,"" admitted Kevin De Bruyne to Sky Sports at full-time. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in it's a wonder goal. ""It was hard. To be fair I think we played excellent. The way we played was very good and we should score more. It is what it is. It was a great game. ""I think it should [be more before half-time] but we were still winning. The way the second half started is the disappointment. I think we played great and created enough chances to win the game."" What a way to stay exactly where they were at kick-off - a 90 minutes of breathless, brilliant football that is already an instant classic. A match between the best two teams in England - for many the best in the world - and they delivered like they always do. A clash where the tensions will have been felt around the planet, let alone in the electric atmosphere of the Etihad Stadium. In the stands, they lived every second of it, just as they did in the dugouts. One minute, Pep Guardiola was stood two yards on the pitch trying to get his message across to his players. The next he was discarding his jacket in frustration at letting Liverpool snatch an equaliser. Jurgen Klopp was not much calmer to his right, punching the air with every tackle, turning in despair at every missed opportunity. But the two managers have only themselves to blame. Only Guardiola and Klopp could go into a game with everything on the line and give everything for a victory. Who else but Guardiola would leave Aymeric Laporte and Kyle Walker isolated against the twin threat of Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane in the opening minutes? And who would trust a goalkeeper as ridiculously calm as Ederson to let the ball drift onto his own goal-line under pressure from Diogo Jota before playing a simple three-yard pass? And, in turn, who would allow Thiago to play short square passes in his own six-yard box with five City attackers within striking distance? And who would chase a win in the final minutes at the Etihad knowing a defeat could almost destroy their chances of winning the title? From the opening minutes it was pulsating. Gabriel Jesus, Guardiola's wildcard choice for this big game, setting up Raheem Sterling, but his shot was blocked by a sprawling Alisson. But just seconds later, City were ahead. De Bruyne, always a player for the big occasion, was alert to Bernardo Silva's quickly-taken free kick before firing in a low shot that deflected off Joel Matip on its way past Alisson. Forget about City taking their usual control, though. These two sides are too good to exceed that for too long. Jota had levelled inside 13 minutes, before Jesus put the home side back ahead in the 36th minute with City creating the better chances. It was more of the same in the second half, with Mane equalising inside a minute before both sides went toe-to-toe and punch-buy-punch until the very final seconds. Guardiola and Klopp embraced enthusiastically at full-time, and the football world finally could draw breath. A game that was so good that it would probably be worth doing all over again next week. As luck would have it, these two meet at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Another classic awaits! Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

123,https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-conte-turned-kante-into-best-player-in-the-world/blt634074b9d0fc744c,How Conte turned Kane into the best player in the world right now,"It has become fashionable over the last year to discuss who might be the best footballer in the world ‘right now’. The last time the idea got traction was when Mohamed Salah was widely anointed for scoring scarcely-believable solo goals for Liverpool. However, after Karim Benzema’s winning header against Chelsea in midweek, there will be conversations now about his claim to the throne, even if his fellow Frenchman Kylian Mbappe is presently No.1 in the eyes of many neutrals. Of course, the reason for the debate's growing popularity is quite simple. Up until about a year ago, the answer to the question for more than a decade was inarguably Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, and the debate around their respective talents became so tediously entrenched in tribalism as to become a worthless conversation. Pondering who might be the best player in the world is a novelty. Salah isn’t quite as fashionable now as he was a few months ago and Benzema is unlikely to get too many votes among Premier League watchers. So, in a World Cup year, why not make a claim for England’s captain? As few as four months ago, Harry Kane was at his lowest ebb, suffering from low confidence after being denied a move to Manchester City and from the fallout of a disastrous couple of Tottenham Hotspur appointments. Not many excelled under Jose Mourinho or Nuno Espirito Santo. Some even questioned whether Kane was finished, whether all those injuries and rushed returns to the starting line-up had finally taken their toll. That always happens with Kane. His unusual playing style, his clunky gait, don’t fit our expectations of an elite athlete, leaving the impression that he doesn’t belong; that he will soon fade. But if Kane possesses one standout attribute, it is his capacity to bounce back, defy the odds, return to the top. Every dry August brings pressure and Kane always rises to it. Every new Spurs implosion narrows Kane’s path to the top but he always climbs to it. Kane has scored 233 goals in 368 games for Tottenham in all competitions. He is fifth on the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers and 30 shy of Wayne Rooney in second, whom Kane will surely surpass in the next 18 months at Spurs. He is the only player in the top five without a major trophy to his name. Rooney, Andy Cole, and Sergio Aguero all played in elite teams who won multiple honours, while even Alan Shearer took part in three title challenges, winning one. This is often used as a way of criticising Kane, when the opposite is true: it shows just how incredible his numbers are. It is entirely logical to claim that Kane would already be out in front if he had spent the last eight years at a super-club (his goal-per-minute rate of 129 is better than Shearer’s 147). So, when tallying who is the best player in the world right now, Kane should not lose points for playing outside the elite. He should gain them. To do what he is doing at a club fighting for a Champions League spot most seasons is extraordinary. And he is at the peak of his powers right now, thanks largely to the brilliant work Antonio Conte is doing. Kane amassed one goal and one assist in his first 13 Premier League games of the season. In the 17 since, starting with a 2-2 draw against Liverpool that was Conte’s fifth game in charge, he has scored 11 and assisted seven. Harry Kane has now scored the most away goals in Premier League history 👏 pic.twitter.com/V3V7enqxj4 One possible explanation is self-belief, or rather belief in Tottenham. Appointing a winner like Conte gives Kane’s Spurs career clarity again, as well as remoulding the club as one ready to enter the elite; despite his public desire to leave, Kane would much rather win trophies at Tottenham. But the transformation is as much tactical as anything else. Conte’s methodology of quick, vertical football played largely in the transition – and from a lower starting block than most – suits the speed of player that surrounds Kane, allowing him to build on a recently-discovered playmaker trait. Mourinho deserves some credit for releasing Kane into a deeper role last season, with Kane assisting 14 in the Premier League in 2020-21 by using his exceptional passing range to hit runners Heung-Min Son and Lucas Moura. This has been taken up a notch under Conte thanks to the Italian’s greater level of detail in his attacking structures, which include diagonal switches to advancing wing-backs – and Kane loves playing this pass. Spurs continue to struggle at times, largely because such a low starting position can make it difficult to build and sustain meaningful attacks. Indeed, in each of the last two matches, it has taken half-time reminders from Conte (to play long forward passes for the runners) to unlock a stodgy performance. The addition of Dejan Kulusevski has also helped Kane’s output, because there are now two players making diagonal runs, from out to in, for Kane to find as he drops into the No.10 position. Furthemore, Rodrigo Bentancur has provided Spurs pass with urgency through the lines, ensuring the ball reaches Kane and his fellow forwards at pace – and with space to move into. OFFICIAL: Tottenham sign Dejan Kulusevski on loan and Rodrigo Bentancur on a permanent deal from Juventus ✍️Antonio Conte finally got some new players 🥳 pic.twitter.com/dqECar1UeN That is what was missing from laboured performances under Nuno, when Kane would invariably be either isolated up front or forced far too deep in search of the ball, only to find an entire opposition midfield and defence in front of him. Under Conte, paradoxically, he has less freedom yet, therefore, plays more freely. The ultra-detailed positioning and movement work drilled on the training ground means the Spurs players are manipulating the opponent into vulnerable situations – and Kane doesn’t even need to look anymore before playing the pass. Tottenham are a team moving in sync, and each part of the machine is tailored around Kane’s abilities as both a nine and a ten. Bu, intriguingly, Conte has recently stated his desire to sign a new No.10 (Christian Eriksen would be ideal) in order to add variety, while allowing Kane to stay closer to goal. It is about time some of the burden is removed from Kane’s shoulders. If that were to happen, his goalscoring numbers would get better still. He might even be able to start thinking about closing the gap to Shearer. Surely, then, he could lay claim to being the best footballer in the world?

The two title rivals played out a thrilling 2-2 draw, with the Merseyside charges twice coming from behind twice to earn a vital point that keeps them close to the Citizens on the table.  However, despite criticizing the Egypt captain for his struggles in the opening half, Shearer went on to laud him for the impact he had, when he set up Sadio Mane for the leveler moments after the half-time break.  ""At half-time, I looked at some of Mohamed Salah’s numbers: no shots, no crosses, no dribbles completed, and far too many examples of giving up possession,"" the now 51-year-old told the Athletic.  ""By his own standards, he was pretty awful; and then he comes onto the pitch and shapes the perfect pass that sets up the equaliser.""  The Pharaohs attacker has now gone five matches in all competitions without a goal, but the ex-England striker believes it is just a matter of time before the 29-year-old gets back to his best.  ""Greats like Salah can never be written off and it’s only a matter of time before he gets back on the goal trail. He can pull brilliance from nowhere,"" Shearer concluded.  This season, Salah has scored 20 goals in the Premier League and provided 11 assists.  In the Champions League, the winger has managed to find the back of the net on eight occasions after being involved in nine matches. He might add to these numbers on Wednesday when the Reds host Benfica in the second leg of their quarter-final.  During the last first leg in Portugal, the former English champions secured a 3-1 win, and they will be keen to have a positive outcome to make it to the semis of the annual competition.

125,https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-rejuvenation-of-man-utd-flop-moyes-at-west-ham/1rz94nonuqhkl1lns7jo7l4i9q,The rejuvenation of Man Utd flop Moyes at West Ham,"Back in autumn, when the 2020-21 Premier League season was refusing to take shape, when chaos reigned and baffling scorelines captured the nation’s mid-pandemic cabin fever, it briefly looked as though Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham would win the title. A combination of empty stadiums, a congested fixture listand pandemic fatigue led to a dramatic tactical regression in the Premier League. Pressing intensity plummeted and the more expansive possession sides got hit harder than the rest, with huge gaps appearing between and behind the jaded players at Liverpool and Manchester City. But more than that, a lack of time on the training field meant the automatisms and ultra-detailed tactical battle plans collapsed, taking the Premier League back to a simpler, pre-modern time. And if the division had regressed by 10years or more, who better for this unique campaign than Mourinho, a man whose conservative tactics were peaking in the mid-2000s? That prediction was proved emphatically wrong, of course, but the theory still holds up thanks to the work of David Moyes at West Ham United. It is no coincidence that the last time Moyes finished in the top four was the same year Mourinho won his first league title at Chelsea. An atavistic Premier League is ideal for the defence-first pragmatist, for the tactician who minimises risk and requires none of the exhausting pressing or intricately trained attacking patterns for his ideas to get across. This is the basis of the Moyes approach, and while it would be inaccurate to say he has not evolved and adapted since his heyday at Everton (the fact Mourinho has not, and is suffering the consequences, speaks volumes), the basic principles are the same. In the Covid-19 season, it is the perfect system. In the vast majority of matches, West Ham do not press, but rather sit in a mid-to-low block and only engage the opposition in their own third (only teams in the bottom four have a lower possession average than West Ham’s 43.7 per cent). This allows them to shuffle across in a compressed unit that requires little risk and little day-to-day coaching, protecting West Ham from the chaos of this endless and exhausting campaign.  The basis of their success in this regard is Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek, two intelligent defensive powerhouses who manage to cover huge amounts of space in the middle of the park. The composure both players show ensures that nothing can get through the West Ham blockade, regularly reducing opponents to harmless possession down the flanks. It is arguably the best midfield partnership in the division. Soucek, in particular, has been dominant, not only making more headers (270) and more fouls (44) than any other player in the Premier League, but chipping in with eight goals too. In fact, both he and Rice are important in instigating the West Ham counterattacks either with direct dribbles through the thirds or sharp, incisive, one-touch distribution under pressure into the West Ham forwards. Moyes’ counterattacks are also relatively simple, built through the midfield and into Jarrod Bowen or Pablo Fornals as they drift off the flank. However, it is rare for West Ham to score directly from a break, and instead the plan tends to be to get Michail Antonio in behind to win set-pieces. Antonio is equally adept at holding up the ball with his back to goal and using his pace in the channels–both lead to dangerous dead-ball scenarios. West Ham top the charts for non-penalty set-piece goals (12), with Aaron Cresswell’s delivery making him the fourth-most frequent crosser from the left wing in the division (4.33 per game) and putting him fifth in the assist charts, with five.   Their success is essentially down to that conservative defensive shape and goalscoring potential from set-pieces, and yet Moyes deserves credit for his flexibility, because despite the tactical strategy remaining the same numerous tweaks have been made throughout the season. The idea of Moyes as a tactical dinosauriswide of the mark. West Ham began the season in a 3-4-3 formation, with Cresswell often overlapping from centre-back in perhaps the starkest example of Moyes moving with the times, and, after a brief hiccup, he switched to a 4-2-3-1 without losing any of the defensive resilience. Moyes even went with a fluid 3-7-0 in the recent 3-0 defeat of Sheffield United, while adjustments are regularly made to counteract specific opposition threats. But no matter the shape, West Ham remain firmly a team in the Moyes mould of safety-first, old-school football. The flashier players have all been sold or sidelined, and in their place West Ham fans can trust consistent, hard-workingand powerful players working in a simplified rhythm. And trust is a big issue at West Ham. The supporters and players clearly needed a break from each otherand, thankfully, the damage of an often toxic atmosphere at the London Stadium has been largely repaired. West Ham have used the empty stadium to reset not just their tactical system but their image as a club and their relationship with the fan base. By the time supporters are back in their seats, they may even be watching Champions League football. For that, they would have onlyone man to thank. As the storm of Covid-19 blows through the Premier League, Moyes has battened down the hatches. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Long after the final whistle had sounded at Anfield, long after Liverpool’s place in the semi-finals of the Champions League had been confirmed, it was the fans of Benfica who could be heard. They stayed behind for more than half an hour, singing their hearts out. Their coach, Nelson Verissimo, and his players emerged from the dressing room to salute them, and no wonder. As European away support goes, this was as good as it gets. The Portuguese enjoyed their trip to Merseyside, that’s for sure, and their team certainly gave them something to get behind. Verissimo’s men scored three times on the night against the would-be Premier League and European champions, but their 3-1 first-leg loss in Lisbon cost them. And so Liverpool march on to a third semi-final in five seasons and a tie against Villarreal that they will be strong favourites to win. No time to think about that now, though. Before that come other examinations, big ones and crucial ones, starting with the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Saturday. Jurgen Klopp insisted on Tuesday that Wembley would have no bearing on his team selection for Benfica, but few believed him. And sure enough, his starting XI on Wednesday night showed seven changes from the one which had begun Sunday’s pulsating Premier League draw at the Etihad. Benfica fans 👏#UCL pic.twitter.com/vjiP5hSwW7 Only Alisson Becker, Joel Matip, Jordan Henderson and Diogo Jota kept their place, which meant we were treated to perhaps the strongest bench Liverpool have ever named for a competitive fixture, with the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Thiago Alcantara, Fabinho, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah all among the substitutes. Thiago, Mane, Fabinho and Salah all got a run-out in the second half, when the tie was pretty much done and dusted, but Van Dijk, Alexander-Arnold and Robertson were given the luxury of a rare night off, snuggled into their tracksuits and big coats. How important that proves to be, we will know at around 6pm on Saturday. But on a night when Manchester City were put through the ringer by Atletico Madrid, suffering injury scares to both Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker, Liverpool were able to conserve energy, juggle their resources and play the longer game, while still securing safe passage to the last four. They got there thanks to Ibrahima Konate’s second header of the tie, and to a second-half brace from Roberto Firmino, who became the fourth Reds player to reach double figures for the season, and who is now closing in on a century of goals at Anfield (he has 98). The Brazilian may not be the automatic pick he once was, but his worth to Klopp’s side should not be questioned. For all the good form of Diogo Jota and for all the impact Luis Diaz has made, Firmino has a very good chance of starting at Wembley. Konate, too, will be pushing for inclusion. The France Under-21 defender, as he did in the first leg in Portugal, gave his side the lead in the first half with a towering header from a left-wing corner. And though there were some wobbly moments defensively, particularly in the last 20 minutes when Benfica struck twice, Konate’s speed and strength could make him a more than useful asset, particularly on a pitch as big and as energy-sapping as Wembley. If not, he is a certainty to start against Manchester United at Anfield next week. Kostas Tsimikas, too, has done his chances no harm for that game. The Greece international proved a more-than-able stand-in for Robertson at left-back, picking up two assists and earning the Player of the Match award from UEFA. There are few more popular figures than the former Olympiacos man, but he is far from just a happy mascot. He can play as well. 🎶 Jürgen said to me....🎶#LFC 🔴 #UCL pic.twitter.com/AZkaOjFlAs As for Klopp, he understandably cut a satisfied figure, post-match. No theatrical fist-pumps for the Kop this time, just a business-like pat of the badge on his chest. There is work to be done, games to be played, decisions to be made. The business end of the season is well and truly upon us. “We never take it for granted,” he told his post-game press conference. “And the day I’m not over the moon about getting to a Champions League semi-final, then something is really wrong. Maybe then it would be the right time to just quit!” No danger of that, of course. The pressures of management will one day catch up with Klopp, but for now he looks as alive as he ever has. He is relishing each and every challenge, embracing each and every fixture. And with a team like this, with a squad like this, you can see why. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

127,https://www.goal.com/en/news/one-goal-seven-games-salah-slump-cause-concern-klopp/bltc7be402e33b7a6ce,"One goal in seven games: Why Salah's slump is concerning for Klopp, Liverpool and Man City","It’s hard to say who will be most concerned by Mohamed Salah’s recent dip in form. Liverpool, who head into the biggest game of their season with a star man who has managed only one goal – a penalty – in his last seven matches? Manchester City, who must surely fear a backlash from a player who has made them suffer plenty of times in the past? Or perhaps Salah himself, who has chosen perhaps the worst possible time to show that he is, in fact, human after all? When your standards are as high as the Egyptian’s are, anything that falls short can feel like a big thing. A run of 660 minutes without a goal from open play, then, qualifies almost as a full-blown crisis. Jurgen Klopp says he has no worries, but Salah’s frustration has been there for all to see in recent weeks. It was certainly there on Tuesday night, when he was substituted after just 61 minutes of Liverpool’s Champions League win over Benfica. Klopp’s decision may have been made with one eye on Sunday’s Premier League blockbuster at the Etihad (he insisted afterwards that it hadn’t) but Salah’s performance in Lisbon made it an easier call than usual in any case. An eyebrow or two was raised in Klopp’s post-match press conference when he suggested that Salah’s form may have been affected by “all the stories” surrounding the 29-year-old. “It’s clear that Mo wants to score,” Klopp added, “especially in this moment.” What could he have meant? And what did Salah mean when he told Sky Sports that ""there are many things that people don't know"" about his contractual situation? Are there serious issues there? And if so, can they be resolved? Sources insist there have been no developments on that front despite reports last week suggesting Salah was ready to drop his wage demands and pen a four-year deal. There remains, on both sides, a belief that a compromise will eventually be found, but for now we can expect the speculation to continue. It is unlikely, to say the least, that Salah will be dropped for Liverpool’s visit to Manchester City, but even the fact that one national newspaper ran a piece on its website this week debating the idea is telling. Salah has not completed 90 minutes in the Premier League since February 23, and his last 16 games for club and country have yielded only five goals – three of which came from the penalty spot. A foot injury, picked up during the win at Brighton last month, hasn’t helped matters, and there was also the disappointment of Egypt’s elimination at the hands of Senegal in the World Cup play-off. Mohamed Salah's changing room message to his team-mates after Egypt's loss to Senegal 💔 pic.twitter.com/qBXAVx0zqc Salah, who missed a penalty in the decisive shootout in Dakar, is said to have taken the defeat personally, though in typical fashion, he was back at Liverpool’s training ground less than 12 hours later, ready to get back to work for his club. That determination and professionalism is, in Klopp’s eyes at least, Salah’s greatest asset, and it is that which will ensure that this mini-slump remains exactly that and nothing more. “It’s a tough period,” the Reds boss said in Lisbon, “but everything will be fine.” Sunday may well be the ideal fixture in which to show that. Victory at the Etihad would send Liverpool top of the Premier League and, with seven weeks of the campaign remaining, would fuel belief that an unprecedented ‘quadruple’ really might be possible for Klopp and his side. Salah’s record against City is excellent: he has scored seven times against Pep Guardiola’s side, including four in his last five appearances. Who could forget that mesmeric, slaloming effort when the sides drew 2-2 at Anfield back in October? The goalscoring form of Diogo Jota, and the way that Luis Diaz has settled in seamlessly since his January move from Porto, means Klopp has greater attacking options than ever before. However, it would be a shock if Liverpool’s starting line-up did not include both Salah and Sadio Mane, and plenty would opt for Roberto Firmino as the third forward too, although the Brazilian was noticeably absent from the training pictures released by the club on Friday. Salah was there, of course, complete with a beaming smile. If the pressure is getting to him, he’s hiding it well enough. He’d love a goal and a big performance this weekend, mind, and if he wants a little inspiration he need look back only three years, to April 2019, when an eight-game scoreless run was ended with a memorable strike away at Southampton. A repeat on Sunday? You wouldn’t bet against it. The best never stay quiet for too long, after all. Liverpool need Salah at his loudest at the Etihad. If he is, the title is theirs for the taking.

Andrii Kravchuk, who is a former youth team-mate of City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko, was playing for Torpedo Moscow in the Russian second tier when his homeland was invaded. The 23-year-old has been offered the chance to train with the club’s elite development squad to maintain his form and fitness after his contract was terminated. Kravchuk was on a pre-season training camp in Turkey when he received a call at 5am from his mother that Russia had started bombing Ukraine. His family have remained in the capital Kyiv, with his brother fighting alongside his country’s armed forces. He fled to Manchester and has been allowed to train with City following approval from the UK government, the Football Association and the Premier League. The former Ukraine under-17 and under-21 international took part in his first training session at City’s Etihad Campus on Thursday. “I am so grateful to Manchester City for giving me this chance to train with them,” he said. ""I haven’t seen Oleks for a while but he has always been helpful for me – even going back to when we were together at Shakhtar. We’ve had a chat and I’m really happy to be here with him. “The past few weeks and months have been so difficult, but to be back on the pitch means so much to me. ""There were nice people around me at the club but I was playing in a country that invaded my homeland. Leaving the club was the only decision. People in Ukraine would not understand me if I continued to play there."" Kravchuk first met the Ukraine captain when they were aged 11 and 13 at Shakhtar Donetsk’s youth academy more than a decade ago. “While I wish the circumstances were very different, it has been good to be back with Andrii,” Zinchenko said. “I know how much football means to him, and how it can help us during these difficult times. I would like to thank my club for giving him the opportunity to train with us.” Zinchenko, who has been given warm support across football, has spoken about how he has struggled to comprehend the invasion and how he wishes he was able to return to his country to aid in the fight.

Yarmolenko, who has won over 100 caps for Ukraine at international level, was granted time off by West Ham after Russian troops began occupying regions of his homeland in February. The 32-year-old's wife and children were in Ukraine at the start of the conflict but have since returned to England after fleeing via Poland, while the Hammers have welcomed a popular figure back into the fold quicker than expected. David Moyes confirmed Yarmolenko's return for a clash with Aston Villa on March 13, and he marked the occasion by scoring, sparking emotional scenes at the London Stadium. The winger was mobbed by his team-mates after finding the net again in a subsequent Europa League clash with Sevilla, and he says his club commitments have come as a welcome distraction from the events in Ukraine. Yarmolenko struggled mentally during his brief time away from West Ham, as he said on Ukrainian YouTube channel Football 1/2/3: ""David Moyes told me I could choose to train or not and that I had to do everything I could to ensure the safety of my family. ""I needed to remain professional so I returned. I was just going crazy and you need to be distracted. But even now, I don’t know what the other results are. It is just training ends and then the phone calls home. ""It is honestly scary to talk about it. We have to help each other. If we do not then no one will. ""I am sure we will not be beaten by any country. No one will ever be able to break our spirit."" Yarmolenko went on to reveal that he was consumed by guilt and worry that left him unable to focus in training after seeing his family's arrival in Ukraine coincide with the start of Russia's invasion. ""When it all started, on February 24, I arrived at training and couldn’t even talk,"" he said. ""I had tears flowing. I asked the coach to let me go home. ""I didn’t believe this could happen. I sent my family to Kyiv because my child had to have a doctor’s appointment. ""Can you imagine what I was like when it started the next morning? I just wanted to run and hit my head against a wall. What a fool I was sending my family to Kyiv and I am sitting in London."" The West Ham star added on how the rest of his family are coping amid the war in Ukraine: ""All the relatives are alive and well. My cousins help keep in touch with uncles, aunts. ""The ones there, where there is constant shelling going on, they are in bomb shelters, hiding in basements."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Even though the loan contract forbids them from using the England international against the Blues, changes could have been made to allow it. The 22-year-old was not involved in the talks and didn't appeal to his parent club to play. Patrick Vieira's side are on a fantastic run of form, winning four of their last five matches. Indeed, Gallagher has been a huge part of that run and has played in 31 matches, including all four of his side's FA Cup matches thus far. Furthermore, he has been decisive in the final third, racking up eight goals and five assists in all competitions. Gareth Southgate has noticed his excellent form on loan and called up Gallagher during the last two international breaks, allowing him to play three times for the England men's national team. Derby County successfully convinced Chelsea to allow them special dispensation to use loanees Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori against the Stamford Bridge club in the past. However, it was a Championship club which was managed by Frank Lampard asking them in a fourth round Carabao Cup match. The stakes will be much higher for the Blues on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel is understood to be a huge admirer of Gallagher and tried to keep him with the squad over the summer. The west Londoners subsequently allowed the homegrown star to go on loan because the player believed he would get more minutes at Palace. The Blues are now strongly considering keeping him with the squad next season and giving him a prominent role. Clubs, including Palace, have inquired about signing him on a permanent deal. However, the Blues were quoting at least £50 million ($65m) needed to start a conversation over a transfer, pricing many potential suitors out of a move. His current contract at Stamford Bridge runs until June 2025. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Having excelled at Crystal Palace all season, the 22-year-old Cobham academy graduate has earned a promotion from the national under-21 setup. Gallagher plays in front of a back four in a 4-3-3 system under Patrick Vieira for the Eagles. With England, he got the chance to show Thomas Tuchel what he might be like in one of the Chelsea manager’s favoured formations. Like Tuchel, Gareth Southgate uses a three-man defence as his primary system and opted for a 3-5-2 shape on Saturday. Gallagher played on the right side of a midfield three with Jordan Henderson holding and both Mason Mount and Gallagher as box-to-box No.8s. With two forwards ahead of him in Phil Foden and Harry Kane, Gallagher had licence to join the attack. After 14 minutes, a lung-bursting run allowed him a curling shot which was cleared off the line. England went behind to a Breel Embolo header but Gallagher was involved in England's equaliser, taking up a good high pressing position as his side won the ball high up the pitch. The ball fell at his feet and he threaded an outside-of-the-foot through ball to Luke Shaw who scored just before half-time. We're live with Conor Gallagher to get his reaction to today's win! https://t.co/nH4U0PBWhj Just after the break, he almost got another assist by clipping a ball in behind the Swiss backline but Harry Kane's shot was saved by goalkeeper Jonas Omlin. Gallagher was replaced in the 60th minute by Declan Rice but got an embrace from Southgate, who had an eye on managing the minutes of his players at a crucial time of the season at their clubs. ""Conor is a player who is infectious with his energy and aggression to press,"" Southgate said after the match. ""I thought he could be tidier with the ball a few times. ""I thought he played a fabulous ball for Harry Kane in the second half. It is the first time in a long time that we’ve started without either Rice or [Kalvin] Philips and it is important to see that in terms of defensive solidity and the balance of the team."" At the time he came off, Gallagher had won possession back six times - four in the opposition half - which was more than any of his team-mates. He had also made the most tackles and clearances of any England player. Kane went on to seal the win from the penalty spot in the 79th minute, with the Three Lions winning 2-1 on the night. With eight goals and five assists for his club this season, Gallagher was showcased in his best role as a No.8 at international level for the first time, a role which allows him to impose his energy onto matches. ""The role I played today is very similar to what I have been playing all season. I think the manager did that on purpose. I felt comfortable and I was happy playing today,"" Gallagher said at Wembley after the match. ""It was great to play alongside Hendo [Jordan Henderson] - he's obviously a great leader and he was talking to me the whole time and gave me that licence to go and push forward and make the box and press when I could. It definitely suited me. ""I felt amazing, it was my first time playing at Wembley. It was a massive buzz to play in front of all these fans and with my parents watching, it was great."" Adding, when asked by GOAL about his prospects of making the World Cup squad: ""Of course, that would be amazing but that’s still a few months away. ""I need to focus on my football and take each game as it comes. Hopefully if I do well enough, impress the manager enough, then I will get a shot."" It's that exuberance which allows the young midfielder to be a goal threat, owing to his ability to arrive in the box time and again through his immense running capacity. ""It is a real family at Palace, people want to help you a lot and Patrick Vieira has been fantastic with the both of us,"" England colleague Marc Guehi told Sky Sports ahead of kick-off. ""They've given us a lot of responsibility but helping us to develop our games and move forward to help the team."" With Tuchel often preferring to play two holding players in a 3-4-3, dropping Mount or using N'Golo Kante or Mateo Kovacic as the other No.8 could allow him to replicate this system with Gallagher involved. Indeed, Tuchel and everyone at Chelsea have been delighted with the development of the player on loan at Selhurst Park. The Blues have already told clubs interested in signing the midfielder that they won't enter conversations about his sale, with a £50 million ($66m) valuation pricing almost every club in world football out of signing him. Tuchel is keen to recall the dynamic midfielder in the summer to add to his options,with doubts over Jorginho's future amid interest from Juventus and him entering the last year of his contract. Saul Niguez is also likely to return to Atletico Madrid afterhis season-long loan deal despite an option to buy in the contract at £30m ($41m). It leaves some space at Stamford Bridge for Gallagher to develop, who pushed for his Palace loan move last summer even though Tuchel was happy to keep him around. As well as trying to force his way into England's World Cup squad for Qatar 2022, Gallagher was able to offer Tuchel a glimpse at what next season might look like.

Gallagher, 22, is still waiting for his competitive debut at Stamford Bridge, but is winning rave reviews during his loan spell for Crystal Palace. Both he and Mount started Saturday's 2-1 friendly victory, but Southgate believes the duo could leave teams vulnerable at the back when playing alongside one another. ""We feel Mason Mount and Gallagher press well but can leave us vulnerable to the switch, the Swiss worked that out,"" the manager explained to Sky Sports after the final whistle. In spite of those reservations Southgate was generous in his praise of Gallagher, who made just his second England appearance on Saturday. ""He is infectious. He can set the tone for the rest of the team, you see that with his club and he presses with ambition,"" he added. ""He goes and makes contract and turns a lot of the ball over."" Gallagher in turn was delighted to appear before the Wembley faithful, although he admitted that the occasion almost got to it. ""It's a great feeling to play at Wembley in front of all the fans, I'm just really proud and it was good to get the win. A really proud moment,"" the youngster explained to Sky Sports. ""I was a little bit nervous but not too much. I was just excited to be honest, I was trying to take it all in and do the best I could. ""I was trying to do what I am best at - trying to press and win the ball back and trying to create chances. I felt like we could have done better in the first half but the game opened up in the second and I think overall it was a good performance.

The Citizens were held to a 0-0 result by Patrick Vieira's Eagles, and found themselves frequently frustrated throughout as they failed to notch a single shot on target in the second half while playing the full 90 minutes without a substitute. Though City have stretched their lead at the summit of the Premier League to four points now, they have played one more game than rivals Liverpool, with the pair still to meet this season - but aside from a dig at the turf, Guardiola saw his side's efforts in a positive light. ""There are still many games to play, we have to win a lot of games but the way we played, there's no regrets about the team,"" Guardiola told Sky Sports. ""We would have preferred to win of course but the game was well played. ""We played to win the game, we created more, the way we played was amazing in a difficult stadium with the grass not perfect."" Speaking to BBC Sport, the Spaniard reinforced his belief that his side performed well, and revealed that he saw no reason to swap players as he believed they were playing their part well. ""We play a really good game,"" he added. ""In 90 minutes, we concede mistakes a little bit, but the way we played was really good. ""Luck doesn't exist in football. We have to score goals and we didn't do it. We played to score goals and concede few. We struggled a little bit. ""The guys who were playing were playing good, that's why I didn't make changes.

Gallagher, 22, was released at the start of the season for his fourth temporary move in the last three years, and has responded with eight goals in the Premier League to date to become a fixture in the Eagles line-up. Chelsea may now face a battle to retain his services once the current term finishes, as Palace are reportedly keen to make the transfer permanent. ""No, no, not at all,"" Gallagher responded to ESPN when asked if he was considering his future. ""I just take every game as it comes to be honest. I've not thought too far ahead at all. ""I think in the stage we're at in this season and where Palace are at as a team, we can't afford to look too far into the future. ""We've got a very important end of the season, being in the quarter-final of the FA Cup now [againstEverton] and needing to get points [in the Premier League] as well."" Gallagher also praised his manager, former Arsenal favourite Patrick Vieira, who has enjoyed a fine first season at Palace as he has steered the Eagles to the safety of mid-table. ""I feel like he understands my game very well,"" the goalkeeper added. ""He knew what I was best at even before I came to Crystal Palace he seemed to know what I do best and he told me that and he said 'I want you to be yourself and to do the things you're good at because that's why you're here.' ""It was a decision made by me and Chelsea. We felt like it was it was best for my development and for me to show what I can do. ""Obviously the manager being Patrick Vieira helps because of the player he was and the man he is but I just felt like Crystal Palace was the place where I could express myself the best.""

140,https://www.goal.com/en/news/appreciate-kante-world-likes-flair-usmnt-reyna-pepi-demerit/bltf0df11ce5f8c9e73,‘We can appreciate a Kante but the world likes flair’ – USMNT stars Reyna & Pepi tipped for the top by DeMerit,"Gio Reyna has emerged as one of the hottest prospects in world football, not just U.S. soccer, with the Borussia Dortmund playmaker showing that, when clear of niggling injuries, he boasts the kind of “flair” to make a global audience sit up and take notice. The 19-year-old delivered a Diego Maradona-esque dribble during a recent 2022 World Cup qualifier against Mexico, with his creative qualities once again coming to the fore as his stock continues to rise and a legion of admirers grows. There appears to be no limit to what the talented teenager can achieve, with the general consensus being that further potential in his game will be unlocked ahead of another high-profile step up the footballing food chain being taken at some stage in the future. When that question was put to Jay DeMerit by GOAL – who was speaking on behalf of Stake.com, the leading cryptocurrency betting platform worldwide and Watford FC's principal partner – the former USMNT defender said: “He can be as good as any American that has played in Europe. For such a young guy, he is showing that he can compete, that he can contribute. “His free kicks and delivery is great, and not many Americans have been on those and scoring goals from midfield. That’s exciting. He is showing excitement in ways that a lot of American players haven’t. “But that consistency piece and that injury piece now is going to be huge. If you start burning yourself out because you are trying to carry yourself through injuries as a young person, a lot of times that can catch you up. “I think for him it will be about trying to find consistency in where you play and how you play, but also in ‘am I on the field 45 times next season?’ If the answer is yes then we have got an exciting young talent that we can really look forward to watching for years to come.” Quizzed on whether he sees Reyna making a big-money transfer to a Real Madrid or Manchester City in future windows, DeMerit said: “I do. Dortmund is such a great stepping stone for young players. You look at all the people that have come through there and the success they have had all over the world, I think he will definitely be another example of that. “I’d love to see him in the Premier League. I think his game suits it, he’s a box-to-box player, he’s a tough tackler, he’s a slasher just like his dad [former City star Claudio] but even better because he’s more offensive. “His dad was a holding midfielder and got around the park, was a great captain and a leader, and you can see Gio has got those traits but he’s got more flair. That’s exciting because we’re in a place now where the world likes a bit more flair. We can appreciate a [N’Golo] Kante but we want to see someone take a touch 20 yards out and smash it into the top corner, and Gio provides that!” Reyna is far from being the only exciting American youngster to be plying his club trade in Germany, with Ricardo Pepi another highly-rated teenager that is looking to prove a serious point in Europe. The 19-year-old striker has made a slow start to a spell at Bundesliga side Augsburg, with a goal account yet to be opened, but DeMerit expects the promising frontman to come good after agreeing to take on a big challenge. He said: “You have to have patience in these type of situations. You have to remember this kid has been in Dallas with his friends and family closer and now all of sudden you move to Germany, it’s freezing, it’s minus two degrees and snowing every day, you don’t know how to speak the language but all of a sudden you are expected to be a prodigy. “You always have to ride this ship a little bit more with young players because we forget about those other factors – just life factors or being on your own in a foreign country in the middle of winter on a team that you are still trying to get used to, with players that can hardly speak to you. That’s a hard situation to walk into for anyone. “Having young players do that is a great challenge, and that’s why they do it. I am for it, I want those players to do it at 19 because at 23 how good will they be? Then you have got 10 good years to play well for the national team because you have learned your trade in a country that is going to teach you a lot easier and a lot faster than America. “That’s the mindset that these young players have to create themselves – expect the hard stuff, don’t think you’re coming in and setting the world alight. You have to come in thinking you will sit on the bench and maybe score a 90th-minute winner in your 10th appearance, but that’s the one you need to springboard yourself into this new stratosphere of confidence.” #USMNT wonderkid Ricardo Pepi is on the way to the Bundesliga 📝 pic.twitter.com/3vrNZCpOYr Mental strength is as important as natural ability to players such as Pepi, with DeMerit of the opinion that a man who hit 15 MLS goals across two seasons prior to making a move to Germany is capable of silencing any doubters and unlocking the potential that many believe him to possess. A man who won 25 caps for his country in his playing days added on the hurdles that Pepi has to overcome: “Confidence can be killed very quickly if you haven’t scored in 10 games, the fans are booing you and you don’t even know what they are saying because you can’t understand them. “That starts to eat so he has got to be patient, work his ass off every day, be humble and take his opportunities when they come. They aren’t going to come often, because there are other good players there, you aren’t the best player on your team anymore and the young prodigy that everyone looks at. Now you are just a player on a team that is 19 years old and has to contribute because that is why you got bought. You have to go and do that. “That does test someone’s confidence, their resolve, but I would encourage him to keep putting himself in that uncomfortable zone because you are going to learn something. Now if he comes back and starts playing well for the national team, he is going to take that confidence back to Augsburg. “I love getting that experience at a young age because it is going to help him and if he stays injury free, he will get opportunities. That’s all he needs because he’s a really good player.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

141,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-let-usmnt-giovanni-reyna-slip/vq7t3tz1q72v1w6q6yzzbg5i4,How did Man City let USMNT starlet Reyna slip through their grasp?,"Manchester City’s scouting network and state-of-the-art Etihad Campus meanthey can attract the best players from not just the local area but around the world. Even with that in mind, Phil Foden will be the only academy player close to the starting line-up when City try to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League for just the second time in the club’s history. There would probably have been another had England winger Jadon Sancho decided not to leave the Etihad Stadium as an 17-year-old to join quarter-final opponents Borussia Dortmund. Faced with the choice of possible patient progress under Pep Guardiola or the promise of a fast-track to the first team in the Bundesliga, Sancho opted for Germany and it would be difficult to argue that he made the wrong choice. But he’s not the only young Dortmund star to have passed up the possibility of a chance at City. Like Foden, Giovanni Reyna grew up a City fan and, like Sancho, he faced a similar decision as a teenager between staying in the City set-up or taking his chances elsewhere when a number of top clubs took notice of his huge promise. Reyna left fellow City Football Groupclub New York City FC to join Dortmund  and the attackeris among a group of exciting young United States players starting to light up Europe’s top leagues. The son of former USMNTand City midfielder Claudio, the teenager was part of NYCFC'syouth academy when he started attracting the attention of clubs in Europe after he showed his potential for the under-15s national team. With the help of a Portuguese passport, secured via his paternal grandmother, Reyna had the option of moving to Europe when he turned 16. There was also  the possibility of promotion to the New York City first team  and it would have seemed a more natural move with his father the-then director of football operations at theMLSclub.However, Claudio left the decision to his son.  ""I’m a dad first, and I will support whatever he wants to do,"" Reyna told  Goal  before his son's move abroad. ""The thing about a player at 14, 15, 16 is they’re going to make their own decision. They’re going to take everything in and see."" Reyna opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who had moved to Germany as a youngster having spells with Bayern Leverkusen and Wolfsburg. He was encouraged by the development of promising young US star Christian Pulisic, who was starting to break into the Dortmund side as an 18-year-old. The teenager decided to make the same move and while he had to grow up quickly on his own and more than 3,500 miles away from home, it’s another decision that has paid off. Still only 18, Reyna has made 54 appearances for the Dortmund first team already as well as winning four international caps and scoring twice. Playing with fellow youngsters Sancho, Erling Haaland, and Jude Bellingham, it has helped cement the German’s club reputation as a place for blossoming talent.   “I think I was 14 at the time, or 15, when I realised that there was a possibility to go to Europe and yeah, I just came here and Christian was here at the time and everything he was doing at the time put it in my head that I could do great things here,”  he said last year. “Everything about Dortmund and the opportunities they had, giving young players playing time, playing in the Champions League and all of the biggest competitions. They made it feel like home from day one, made me feel like I was really wanted here, so it has been a perfect decision so far."" Still, having been part of the City Football Group from such an early age, it feels like another missed opportunity for City. Born in Sunderland when Claudio was playing for the Premier League side, the family to move to Manchester when he switched to the Etihad Stadium and Gio spent the early years of his life with a Mancunian accent, although that faded when they moved back to Bedford in New York. However, Reyna and brother Jack remained City fans.  He has spoken touchingly about Sergio Aguero’s famous title-clinching moment being special  - when his sibling was ill withcancerthat was to tragically take his life justweeks after. Since then, Reyna has become one of the most exciting young talents in world football. With pace, goals and the quality to provide a killer pass, the excitement around Reyna is growing - even in a squad crammed with huge potential such as Dortmund’s. A first visit to the Etihad on Tuesday night gives him another opportunity to take a big step in a career which is on a trajectory to the very top.

The 17-year-old turned in a dominant display againstFreiburg on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund got back to winning ways with a 4-0 victory at Signal Iduna Park. Reyna was at the heart of his side's performance, grabbing assists on Dortmund's first three goals — two of which were scored by Erling Haaland. Haaland got on the end of a through ball from Reyna in the 31st minute to open the scoring, before the teenager provided an assist for Emre Can off a corner kick just after half-time. With 66 minutes on the clock, Haaland grabbed his second of the game after another incisive through ball from Reyna. Reyna was taken off to a standing ovation with 10 minutes to play, before Felix Passlackrounded off the scoring for Dortmund with a goal in stoppage time.

BVB have already moved quickly to replace the England international by signing Donyell Malen from PSV, but the Dutchman will be wearing the No.21 jersey from next season instead of No.7, which has instead been passed onto teenage midfielder Reyna. Dortmund have confirmed the news in a post on their official Twitter account showing Reyna in his new shirt with the caption: ""Introducing Borussia Dortmund's newest #7, Giovanni Alejandro Reyna"" The 18-year-old previously donned the No.32 jersey, but has been given an upgrade which suggests that he could have a key role to play in new coach Marco Rose's plans next season.

Reyna helped the German giants win the DFB Pokal and finish fourth in the Bundesliga last term, and will be expected to reach even greater heights in their upcoming campaign.

144,https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-usmnt-roster-f2022-world-cup-qatar/blt42d0dc7e2460b006,Who will be on the USMNT roster for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar?,"The World Cup qualifying journey is over. A combined total of 38 players have led the United States back to the biggest stage, sealing a ticket to Qatar after navigating the rough waters of CONCACAF. But, over the next few months, those 38 players will have to be narrowed down to 23 (or perhaps 26 if a rumored roster-size increase comes to fruition). Throughout the USMNT's World Cup qualifying run, Gregg Berhalter has routinely pointed to depth, to the team's next man up mentality. As Qatar looms, however, there is only so much room on the plane, and there are only so many players that can be brought on the World Cup journey Much will likely change over the next few months, and players that are not among those 38 who appeared in qualifying could certainly leap into the picture. One only has to look at DeAndre Yedlin's rapid rise in 2014 to show just how important a good run of form could be for a young player come World Cup time. But what will the USMNT's World Cup roster likely look like? Who are the 23 players that are most likely to head to Qatar? Here's a look at what the U.S. could look like by the time the tournament kicks off later this year: Zack Steffen, Matt Turner, Gabriel Slonina In consideration: Ethan Horvath, Sean Johnson, Brad Guzan Steffen and Turner are absolute locks, with the pair set to battle it out to be the USMNT's No.1 in the coming months. The result of that race may very well come down to the last moment, as Turner moves to Arsenal this summer hoping to take his game to a different level in the Premier League. With both potentially being backups at club level by the time Qatar rolls around, Berhalter will have a tough choice to make if it gets that far. For the third spot, teams traditionally turn to either an experienced veteran or a rising up-and-comer to be rewarded with a first taste of a World Cup. That up-and-comer is certainly Slonina, likely the USMNT's goalkeeper of the future. Given how rapid his rise has been, it is almost impossible to predict how far along the Chicago Fire teenager could be by the time Qatar rolls around, but he very well could be one of the three best goalkeepers in American soccer. But if Berhalter does go the veteran route, there is a favorite in Johnson and a World Cup veteran in Guzan that could certainly help the squad. Reggie Cannon, Sergino Dest, Chris Richards, James Sands, Antonee Robinson, Miles Robinson, DeAndre Yedlin, Walker Zimmerman. In consideration: John Brooks, George Bello, Aaron Long, Shaq Moore, Joe Scally, Erik Palmer-Brown, Mark McKenzie,  Matt Miazga The USMNT has a wealth of fullbacks, but you should be able to pencil in Dest and Antonee Robinson as your two starters. Dest also provides cover on the left, with right back options like Cannon and Yedlin also in the mix. If Berhalter wants more versatility, Scally is also available, although the Borussia Monchengladbach youngster has not quite broken through with the national team yet. The bigger questions are at centerback, namely with John Brooks. Berhalter has not closed the door on Brooks' return but, having been left out of the squad for several windows, what can the 2014 World Cup veteran do now to play his way back? The U.S. has a legitimate starting pairing in Zimmerman and Miles Robinson, but look for Chris Richards to potentially play his way into that conversation in the coming months. Sands, meanwhile, is a versatility option, offering depth in midfield and at centerback but, if Berhalter wants a pure central defender, Long would be the likely call-up. Kellyn Acosta, Tyler Adams, Gianluca Busio, Luca de la Torre, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah In consideration: Cristian Roldan, Sebastian Lletget, Djordje Mihailovic A fairly straight-forward group here, with McKennie, Musah and Adams pencilled in as the starters in an ideal world. Acosta offers a backup to Adams as a more defensive-minded midfielder while De la Torre, like Musah, is a great ball-carrying midfielder to connect to the attack. Busio, meanwhile, is the wildcard given his creativity, as he could be a valuable substitute in games that require a little something extra in the midfield. Brenden Aaronson, Jesus Ferreira, Christian Pulisic, Ricardo Pepi, Gio Reyna, Tim Weah In consideration: Paul Arriola, Jordan Morris, Josh Sargent, Jordan Pefok, Matthew Hoppe, Daryl Dike, Konrad de la Fuente, Gyasi Zardes This is likely the toughest area of the field to narrow down, simply because there are still so many questions about the striker position. The U.S. has plenty of wingers - perhaps too many - which is why veterans like Arriola and Morris may be left on the outside looking in. Pulisic, Aaronson, Reyna and Weah are all locks, leaving few spots open in that area. At striker, Pepi looks like the guy, although a lot can change in the next seven months or so, particularly if his struggles at Augsburg continue. There are plenty of contenders for those spots, so it may very well come down to form this fall to determine who will be on the plane to Qatar.

Reyna, who has dealth with injuries all season, was consoled by team-mate's as he exited Friday's game against Stuttgart. He had only just returned from a long-term hamstring injury. Reyna has missed more than 100 days to injury this season alone, as muscles in his legs have repeatedly let him down. He's trying to be at full fitness and form for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and so the latest setback had a harsh emotional effect. Gio Reyna was in tears after being forced off with an injury early in Dortmund's match pic.twitter.com/CmDjU7jnll Dortmund coach Marco Rose was asked about Reyna's injury after the game. He told DAZN: ""Gio is once again exhausted. That's very bitter."" Rose continued to Sky: ""It's a drama, you really have to say that. ""A really, really great footballer, fine person.If he stays healthy he will be world class.I'm not leaning too far out of the window.We will support him in everything."" Reyna was not the only Dortmund man to sustain an injury in the game, as Mahmoud Dahoud had to be taken off in the first half because of a shoulder problem, while Mats Hummels did not emerge for the second half because of a suspected hamstring issue. The latest fitness issues come in the wake of reports in Germany claiming the club are set to part ways with long-term physiotherapist Thomas Zetsmann as he has been blamed for the recurring problems. But Rose has hit back at such claims, saying: ""It annoys me for the boys. We are extremely professional. ""The discussion about our physiotherapist that week was a farce. Zetze has been with the club for 16 years. An excellent physiotherapist, a really great person, very popular with the boys. And then he's linked to the injuries. ""It's important to me that we can get that straight. It annoys me."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

146,https://www.goal.com/en/news/unbelievable-reyna-key-usmnt-world-cup-dreams/blt68cbfd1f3ddf8c26,'Unbelievable' Reyna can be key to USMNT's World Cup dreams,"Want to know how good Gio Reyna is? Just watch the clip. It is a few seconds of individual brilliance, of grace and poise and joy and everything else that makes the beautiful game beautiful. The clip, a few seconds of Reyna darting in and out of Mexico's midfield on a mazy run in the heavy Azteca air, went viral almost immediately. His own coach, Gregg Berhalter, called it Maradona-esque, alluding to the famous Goal of the Century in Mexico scored 16 years before Reyna was even born. ""I don't know about that,"" said Reyna, as he and team-mate Christian Pulisic could do nothing but laugh at the comparison between a 19-year-old American kid and, perhaps, the most dazzling and awe-inspiring soccer player of all time. Berhalter was not comparing Reyna to Maradona, because doing so would be foolish. And, ultimately, Maradona's miraculous run through the England defense ended with a historic goal, while Reyna's ended with the young American running into a brick wall. But what Reyna does have is that ability to absolutely turn a game on its head, to create the one or two moments that determine whether the U.S. men's national team wins or loses. And, on Sunday night, those one or two moments may just determine whether or not the USMNT goes to a World Cup. 🎼 Ode to Gio 🎶 pic.twitter.com/2IAvc5u1ay The U.S. will face Panama on Sunday in their penultimate World Cup qualifying game and the situation is clear. Better Costa Rica's result against El Salvador and the U.S. is in. Lose and see the path to Qatar get a whole lot more difficult. Heading into Sunday's match, the USMNT will be pretty shorthanded. Weston McKennie and Sergino Dest are ruled out due to injury. The injury bug bit Brenden Aaronson too, robbing the USMNT of perhaps its most consistent playmaker, while Timothy Weah and DeAndre Yedlin will miss out due to suspension. You can tack on Reggie Cannon's Covid-related absence as well, with Berhalter's team missing several key pieces and backups. But what the U.S. does have is Reyna. The Borussia Dortmund star had been out of the fold since September, having missed nearly the entirety of World Cup qualifying due to injury. With Reyna gone, the U.S. has been without one of its primary playmakers and, perhaps, the team's most talented attacker. And it is not just sequences like the one spoken about at length above that. It is also the one that occurred just moments prior. Shortly after coming on, Reyna nearly created what would - and should - have been the game-winning goal, getting onto the end of a perfectly-hit, over-the-top ball from Kellyn Acosta. Reyna, quite rightly, squared the ball to Jordan Pefok, who was left with an entire net to shoot at. But, unfortunately for Pefok and the U.S., the striker shanked his shot wide to the right. But it was that moment that showed another side that Reyna brings. He brings both the physical gifts and the intelligence, the ability to score a goal and the ability to create one. 🎥 found footage from Azteca pic.twitter.com/9GprxLN0Y8 ""He's a lovely kid but, when he gets on the pitch, he's just a player that is incredibly confident with himself and it's backed by the abilities he's got,"" said defender Antonee Robinson. ""You see him coming on at the Azteca, it's his first game in a while, and there's no fear whatsoever. He just knows, 'I'm going to get on the pitch and try and run the show,' and that's what he did. ""He was really effective when he came on and it's been unfortunate that we haven't had him for every camp because we obviously want all our players to be available when possible."" That is another factor in Reyna's current situation: availability. Upon returning from injury in February, Reyna immediately aggravated that same injury. He only placed once before joining the USMNT, going 90 minutes exactly one week before the U.S. face Panama on Sunday. Because of that, Berhalter has spoken about the need to manage expectations and, more importantly, minutes. Reyna is not yet back at full strength, a frightening thought given the glimpse he provided at Mexico. So is Reyna ready to start and, if he is, can he go out wide or in the midfield? Berhalter says that remains to be seen. ""Potentially,"" Berhalter said when asked if Reyna could start centrally on Sunday. ""We talked about it. It could happen again. We've got to look at where he is physically and if he's ready to play or not. That's a concern of ours. ""I thought he had a good impact coming in the game of the night, so we'll see."" The fact of the matter is that the USMNT are a much better team with Reyna in the XI. An attacking unit featuring Pulisic and Reyna is the best the USMNT can field right now. No matter who starts at the striker position, and that very much remains up in the air heading towards gametime, they will get their chances with Reyna and Pulisic on the field. The question is just how much the U.S. can get out of Reyna, and if he can provide those moments of magic like he did against Mexico. If he does, then the U.S. will more than likely be looking forward to a trip to Qatar this winter. ""If this is the camp that he's going to come and make a real impact and help us seal the deal and get to the World Cup, then it's going to be an amazing feeling,"" said Robinson. ""The kid's got unbelievable talent, and it's great to have him on the team."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The left-back started the clash at Selhurst Park on Monday but did not reemerge for the second half as Gabriel Martinelli was brought on to replace him. The Gunners were 2-0 down when they went in at the break and ended up losing the clash 3-0, putting a dent in their challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League. Tavares was singled out after his performance against the Eagles and Arteta has called on him to respond in a positive manner and set about silencing his critics. ""Throughout your career, you have to go through difficult periods,"" the coach told reporters. ""That is the development curve of a player, it is up and down but he is ready and he is willing. ""He will be disappointed, but it is part of my job. We have to make decisions to try to win football matches - but it is nothing personal. ""Obviously, I spoke with Nuno because I care a lot about how the players feel, and we are here to make their careers better. ""The decision hurt him. He has to react on that situation because it is a great opportunity to learn a lot in that period in your career."" Tavares joined the north London side from Benfica last summer, and has appeared just 15 times in the Premier League this season. The 22-year-old has been reduced to a bit-part role under Arteta so far in 2022, having been limited to a one-minute cameo against Wolves before he was given a chance in the starting XI on Monday. However, the Portugal Under 21 player may be called on to start for the Gunners more often in the run up to the end of the campaign, with Kieran Tierney out for the rest of the season following a knee operation.

149,https://www.goal.com/en/news/attack-again-immediately-leno-bitter-setback-losing-arsenal/bltf18abd4a04089d80,'I wanted to attack again immediately' - Leno on 'bitter' setback of losing Arsenal place to Ramsdale,"Bernd Leno has been reflecting on the “bitter” setback of losing his starting berth at Arsenal to Aaron Ramsdale, with the Germany international goalkeeper saying he wanted to “attack again immediately” after slipping out of favour. The 30-year-old began the 2021-22 campaign between the sticks for the Gunners, but saw a direct rival acquired from Sheffield United for £24 million ($31m) and was replaced as the go-to option in the Premier League following a 5-0 defeat at Manchester City in late August. Leno has made just one top-flight appearance since then, against Aston Villa on March 19, with Ramsdale impressing enough to nail down a spot in Mikel Arteta’s plans while also earning senior international recognition with England. Leno told GOAL and SPOX of losing his place: “It was a setback and a bitter moment. But that's sport, you have to accept that. It wasn't easy, but I couldn't feel sorry for myself, I wanted to attack again immediately. “I don't want to say I was a pawn, but when the results aren't right, sometimes things happen quickly in football. The coach wanted to set a new impulse - and then the results came. That was bitter for me, because I had held up well before that. “I had never experienced anything like that in my career before. But I looked ahead. My ambition is to always play, I know what I can do. I'm not 20 anymore, where I could say: 'I still have time'.” Leno has been on Arsenal’s books since 2018, taking in 125 appearances for the north London club across four seasons. Quizzed on how the decision for him to step into a support role was communicated by Arteta, Leno said: “In the end, he said that the results weren't right and that he wanted to bring in new players. And when the results are good, it is of course logical that you don't change so much in a well-established team. “It was clearly communicated to me that it had nothing to do with my performance and was therefore difficult to accept at first. “I had always played well in the years before and was hardly ever injured. That hits you hard. But as I said, there's no reason to feel sorry for yourself. You have to look ahead and keep working on yourself. That's what I did.” After finding game time hard to come by, and with just a little over 12 months left on his contract, it has been suggested that Leno could be on the move in the next transfer window. He admits that a fresh start remains a possibility, saying on his future: “You can't rule anything out anyway. I'm 30 years old, so you'd think that, despite the ambition and impatience, you might be a bit more relaxed about such a topic. “Of course, there are always approaches. But, it's about playing here. That's my first ambition. If the club plans otherwise, they have to approach me. Of course, my agency and I are keeping an eye on the situation.” Pressed on talk of a return to Bayer Leverkusen being made, Leno said: “I read that too, but I don't know anything about it. “They also said I would definitely want to return to my home country, but that's not true. As I said, we feel completely at home here, even if things aren't going so well for me at the moment.” Arsenal, who remain in the hunt for a top-four finish and Champions League qualification this season, will be back in action on Saturday when taking in a home date with out-of-sorts Brighton.

Nine-figure asking prices are becoming increasingly common in modern football, with Jack Grealish breaking the British transfer record when joining Manchester City for a fee of that size in the summer of 2021. Declan Rice is reported to be worth a similar figure at West Ham, meaning that those at Molineux will make any suitors of classy playmaker Neves dig deep in order to prise him away. Wolves boss Lage told reporters when asked about the interest reportedly being shown in one of his key players: “I don't know if it's Man Utd or other teams, what I know is we have a special player here with us. “What he is doing this season is very good. I think also the way we play, he can show a better Ruben, and also the way he plays puts our team on a different level. “When you have that player, the best thing to do is improve his salary and years of contract. “But who knows, when you have a top player like him in that specific position, that can defend and attack, and is a top professional and a great man, the big teams are there with £100m to buy these kinds of players.” Ruben Neves only scores screamers 🚀 pic.twitter.com/luI12MPQCG Wolves currently have Neves tied to a contract through to 2024 but are working hard behind the scenes to put an extension in place. Fresh terms would help to fend off unwanted interest from afar, with United and Arsenal expected to be in the market for midfield reinforcements this summer. For now, Neves is ignoring the speculation he continues to generate as he finds himself stuck on the sidelines. The 25-year-old is nursing a knee injury that has kept him out of action since March 18, with the Portuguese facing a race against time in a bid to add to the 31 appearances he has made this season for a Wolves team that are chasing down European qualification.

151,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-mathieu-flaminis-net-worth-how-much-does-the-former/1taouhp8zhcwg1m5s6kzpu8bay,What is Mathieu Flamini's net worth & how much does the former Arsenal star earn?,"Who is the wealthiest footballer in the world? Most people willguess Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, but a few will offer Mathieu Flamini as an answer. The former Arsenal and AC Milan midfielder, who last played in La Liga with Getafe, has seen his name attached to headlines suggesting that he is one of the richest footballers on the planet. While he enjoyed a degree of success with the Gunners and Rossoneri, Flamini's career and talents are in no way comparable to the likes of Messi and Ronaldo, who are superstars of the game. So why is it that his fortune is touted to be in the billions? Goal takes a look at what we know about Flamini's financial standing.  Flamini's net worth is not exactly clear, but he has repeatedly stressed that he is not a billionaire as a result of his business venture with GFB. The former Gunners midfielder says that suggestions he is the richest footballer in the world and gradually ascending the Forbes rich list to rub shoulders with Bill Gates are wide of the mark. ""Contrary to what I read, I do not have €30 billion in my bank account,"" said Flamini. ""In fact,[€30 billion] is the total value of the market we want to 'attack' with the new technologies we have developed in recent years. ""There was a misunderstanding. It's as if we had given a single restaurant the value of the entire catering market in France."" So, if he's not worth €30 bn, what is he worth? Information is scarce, but some estimates online put Flamini's net worth at around the €20 million mark, which seems a tad more realistic. Now into the twilight of his playing days, Flamini is not likely to be earning the same kind of salary that he was when he was on the books at Arsenal, AC Milan or even Crystal Palace. He signed for Getafe on a free transfer in February 2018 on a short-term deal which lasted until the end of the season, but details of his remuneration were not made public by the club. To put things into context, reports in Spain from late 2017 indicated that Getafe were one of the lowest-paying teams in La Liga with an average salaryof €664,632.82 per player, per year. That average works out at around €13k a week, but it is possible that a player of Flamini's standing and experience could have earned more than the average figure. However, using the reportedaverage pay for Getafe playersthe table below shows how much that works out per month, week, day and so on. Flamini has never really been a player on which sponsors hang their hat, as they would other marketable stars, but he appears to have had a boot deal with Puma. The former France international began wearing footwear manufactured by the German sportswear giant during his second stint at Arsenal and has continued to do so at both Crystal Palace and Getafe. However, he has also kitted out in Adidas football boots, notably during his time at AC Milan, whose kits at the time were also made by the company.   Flamini's primary business interest is GF Biochemicals, which he establishedalong with his business partner Pasquale Granata in 2008. The company worked with experts from the University of Pisa and Polytechnic University of Milan to developtechnology to produce sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, such as plastic. Such an honour to have been invited to speak about bioeconomy among experts in the field, at the conference organised by the European Commission and Bio Based Industry’s Consortium. #athlete in #sports supporting #Sustainability pic.twitter.com/quxPQCfBjp Levulinic acid, which is produced directly from biomass - or organic materials -is the result of that work and in 2015, GF Biochemicals (GFB) began commercial production. According to GFB's website, their product offers a solution to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve the carbon footprint of consumers. Since 2015, the company has grown and they are expanding operations into the United States, while the value of the market increasing into thetens of billions, which has led to thereports that Flamini is one of the richest footballers in the world. As well as GF Biochemicals, Flamini founded The BioJournal, an online magazine devoted to reporting news from the world of bioconservation, and he has a 'natural personal care' business called One Unity. A post shared by Mathieu Flamini (@mathieuflamini) on Dec 24, 2016 at 11:57am PST Flamini is active on a number of social media platforms, notably using Twitter and Instagram. The midfielder has around 400,000 followers on Instagram and over 150,000 followerson Twitter. Our seas will soon be filled with more plastic than fish.

The 36-year-old Frenchman has taken in two spells at Emirates Stadium, either side of a stint with Serie A giants AC Milan. He has 246 appearances for the Gunners to his name, along with three FA Cup successes and a Champions League final appearance. A strong bond with Arsenal has been retained since heading to pastures new, with a close eye kept on how the Premier League heavyweights are faring. It has been suggested that Flamini could make his way back to north London at some stage, with his efforts away from the field helping to further raise his profile and bank balance – with denials having to be made in the recent past that he has €30 billion (£27bn/$36bn) to his name. Asked by The Athletic whether he expects to launch a bid for control at the Emirates, Flamini said: “No! “Don’t ask me how I’ll be involved in football, because it’s not something I’ve thought about. But, definitely, it’s something which I’ve been part of forever in my life. I will always want to be part of this community.” Flamini’s latest venture has seen him team up with former Arsenal colleague Mesut Ozil to launch the Unity project – a health platform that will work with a network of athletics and elite sportspeople to bring their experiences to the masses. With plenty to keep his hands full, a man with three senior international caps to his name could be forgiven for winding down his on-field commitments. Flamini is, however, adamant that he is not ready to head into retirement just yet, despite being without a club since severing ties with Getafe in 2018-19. He added on his future plans: “I haven’t announced my retirement yet. “I still feel good and healthy! When you take care of your health, when you eat healthy, when you drink water, when you sleep well, I will say you age better. I’m feeling very good and I haven’t decided to continue or to stop, that’s the first aspect. “The second aspect is obviously I’ve been in the industry of football forever, that’s the industry I know the most. So, obviously, I will always want to be close to that industry and to stay involved.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

154,https://www.goal.com/en/news/raphinha-barcelona-transfer-brazil-winger-ignores-leeds/blt2743d4eb6eb86af7,Raphinha in Barcelona transfer talks as Brazil winger ignores Leeds contract calls,"Raphinha is in talks with Barcelona over a summer move, GOAL can confirm, with the Brazil winger having so far ignored Leeds United's calls to discuss a potential contract extension. Leeds spent £17 million ($22m) to bring in Raphinha from Rennes in October 2020 and he quickly established himself as a key player during the club's first season back in the Premier League after a 16-year absence. The 25-year-old has been equally mpressive in 2021-22 as he's taken on the burden of being the Whites' main attacking threat amid Patrick Bamford's injury struggles, attracting attention from a number of top clubs in the process. Raphinha's contract at Elland Road is due to expire in 2024, but Leeds have been trying to tie him down to fresh terms since late last year. GOAL understands that the Brazilian has yet to respond to the club's approach and has initiated transfer talks with Barcelona through his agent Deco - who enjoyed a stellar career at Camp Nou as a player. Deco is the Blaugrana's representative for all dealings involving South American players and is now working on finalising a permanent transfer for Raphinha in the summer window. GOAL has learned that Deco is in the process of sorting out personal terms for Raphinha with Barca president Joan Laporta, who has publicly expressed an interest in the former Rennes star. ""Raphinha is a player we really like and it's true that Deco's his agent. We've very good relationships"", Laporta told RAC 1 earlier this week. ""I want to clarify that Deco's not paid by the club. He will just help us because he dominates the Brazilian market."" The likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain have also been linked with Raphinha, but Barca are leading the race for his signature. Reports in Spain suggest Raphinha has a €75m (£63m/$83m) release clause, while there is also a €25m (£21m/$28m) clause in his contract that will become active if Leeds are relegated.

Mahrez came on in the second half for Raheem Sterling in the 75th minute after Guardiola made three changes to the squad that played in the midweek clash against Atletico Madrid. Nathan Ake, Mahrez, and Ilkay Gundogan dropped out as Phil Foden, Gabriel Jesus, and Kyle Walker started. ""I'm in love with Riyad [Mahrez]; he is an incredible player and person. Today [Sunday], we thought we needed a different quality upfront. We will need him until the end,"" Guardiola said as he also praised the way they played and drew 2-2 against the Reds. ""I'm really happy with the way we played. We played well [in the] first half, it was tough for 10 minutes in the second half, but that is normal when you concede. ""They have quality and a lot of threats, but we performed well. It is football, these things happen. How many managers say, 'in the last minutes, we can't concede', we can concede until the referee blows the whistle."" Mahrez failed to put the Citizens in front in the dying moments of the game as he sent his effort over the bar -with Alisson Becker stranded off his line – after he had been located in a promising goal-scoring position by Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian midfielder, however, defended his Algerian teammate despite the big miss. ""[Mahrez] chose to chip the keeper. If it goes in, it’s a wonder goal, but it didn’t go in and that can happen,"" De Bruyne, who scored his 11thleague goal of the season, said in his post-match comments. The 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium means both Premier League games between the hosts and the Merseyside side this season have ended as draws, the first time they've shared a draw in both league meetings in a season since 2012-13. Additionally, the Reds are now winless in five league matches against the Citizens (D3 L2), their joint-longest run without a victory against them along with a five-game run between November 2011 and December 2013. The results mean the reigning Premier League champions remain at the top of the table with one point separating them from the Reds with seven matches to go.

156,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bielsa-america-australia-president-argentina/blt963a756cfa6e3e24,"What comes next for Bielsa - America, Australia or president of Argentina?!","February marked the end of an era at Elland Road, and possibly the last hurrah for one of football's most engaging characters. Marcelo Bielsa was relieved of his duties at Leeds United following a damaging run of defeats which left the club on the verge of the Premier League relegation zone; but there were few recriminations towards the Argentine from the supporters. Instead, there were tears, warm farewells and no little anger at the club for letting go a man who had captured fans' hearts during his near-four years years on the bench. Even as Bielsa made his way back home across the Atlantic Ocean, his presence was still being felt in banners and signs commemorating his unforgettable tenure, while in Argentina speculation had already begun over what, if any, his next job would be. One rather curious proposition came from the editor of Clarin, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper, who in an opinion column, and seemingly only half in jest, threw Bielsa's hat in the ring to become the next president of Argentina. The Rosario native, as is his wont, offered no words to reporters once back on home soil, nor did he offer any hint of what to expect in the future. But there were no few observers who were happy to do El Loco's talking for him, both in Argentina and further afield. One potential employer emerged from a rather unexpected source: Mexican Formula One driver Sergio Checo Perez, a diehard fan of Club America and on close terms with the side's current owners. “I would love Marcelo Bielsa for America, but it is not up to me,” the Red Bull driver told ESPN when asked who he wished to see succeed ex-Real Madrid boss, Bielsa's compatriot Santiago Solari, who recently parted ways with the club after just over a year in charge. “Why not? Everything is possible for America.” Another tantalising, if equally hypothetical job opportunity was dangled in front of Bielsa's eyes a little closer to home. Godoy Cruz, based in the famous wine-growing region of Mendoza near the border between Argentina and Chile, currently employ one of Bielsa's many proteges across the world of football: Diego Flores, his long-time collaborator and translator at the likes of Marseille, Lille and Leeds. According to reports, Flores would remain in day-to-day charge of the club, who have been entertaining to watch if not always consistent during his six months at the helm (remind you of anyone?), while his former mentor would enter in a more advisory, directorial role upstairs. Would such a proposal tempt the veteran? Bielsa was indeed effusive with his praise of Flores when he took the job in Mendoza, stating that: “Diego Flores' best virtues are not related to his time with our coaching staff. He is a person who built himself up. “Both Diego Flores and [fellow ex-assistant and current Huddersfield Town boss] Carlos Corberan are very valuable people and have strong personalities to assume the responsibility of coaching.” Whether the famously obsessive, detail-driven coach would accept taking a back seat in training and on matchdays, though, seems unlikely at this stage. A similar caveat would be in place for a return to international football, where he previously trained Argentina and Chile, becoming a national hero for the latter. Having previously expressed a wish to take the reins at Australia, it was not a surprise to see his name linked with the Socceroos almost as soon as he was dismissed, especially given their current struggles in World Cup qualifying. “We don’t need a new coach, we need a revolution. He’s a revolutionary,” ex-Australia man Craig Foster said to Stan Sport. “Australia needs something special, we need something different, we need better thinking. Small nations like us, we can’t be the same. He has the strength to be able to do that.” But at 66, it is difficult to see Bielsa submit himself to his third four-year World Cup cycle as a coach, particularly for a post on the other side of the globe and in uncharted territory for him. In the short term at least, Bielsa will most likely take an extended break from the game following the stress and rigour of two taxing Premier League campaigns, complicated even further by the ravages of Covid-19. Should he return, as those closest to him trust he will do, it will be as always on his terms, having performed an exhaustive investigation of his next employer and convinced that he can make a positive difference given the opportunity and resources. One thing is certain, however. Should he opt to stay in football – and to be honest it is difficult to see such a die-hard student and fanatic of the game simply walk away – Bielsa will have no shortage of offers from across the planet. His Leeds spell may have ended in disappointment rather than triumph, but he remains a legend of the game and a man who can transform a team with his encyclopaedic knowledge and unique, at times infuriating but ultimately endearing personality.

The Argentine left Elland Road after suffering four consecutive heavy defeats in the Premier League, the last of which came on Saturday at the hands of Conte's Spurs. Nevertheless, Conte is sad to see him leave English football, while Pep also had warm words for a coach whom he has admired for years. ""Honestly I’m very disappointed because we’re talking about an important manager and we are talking about a person that is a master for many managers, for many coaches in the past and in the present,"" Conte told reporters on Monday. ""I think, yesterday when I read the news, this news hurt me. We’re talking, I repeat, about not only a manager with a great idea and vision of football and taught a lot to other people, especially people in this job, but at the same time I have great respect for him as a person and as a man. ""In every situation he showed great integrity and honestly in football it’s not always you can find this type of person. I’m really disappointed for this but on the other hand, I understand that the club has to make a decision and I know very well the owner and chairman. ""[Leeds owner] Andrea Radrizzani,he’s my friend and it was nice to read the words he used yesterday about Marcelo. He spoke about the mentality he brought to the club because he worked for three and a half years. ""After the first season when they lost the promotion in the semi-final they had a promotion and then a fantastic season and also this season they were out of the relegation zone, but I understand the club has to try to change a situation and the first person you can change at this moment is the coach. But for sure Andrea knows very well the value of Marcelo and what he did for this club in this three and a half years."" Speaking ahead of City's FA Cup clash with Peterborough on Tuesday, Pep added his voice to the growing number of tributes which have poured in for the eccentric Rosario native, both from Leeds and football in general. ""His legacy is there in Leeds’ city and the club and I am pretty sure with the players,"" he told reporters. ""Unfortunately as managers we are subject to results and lately they were not good. But in the four seasons, he was spectacular to watch and I wish him all the best."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The striker has missed the majority of the season because of ankle and hamstring injuries. Bamford returned to action this month and featured in their last three Premier League matches, but he lasted just over 20 minutes in the recent clash with Wolves before he had to be taken off injured. Leeds have revealed that the 28-year-old faces several weeks on the sidelines once again. A statement on the club's website read: ""Following meetings with consultants earlier this week, we can confirm Patrick Bamford has ruptured his plantar fascia, which is an injury to the sole of the foot. On a positive note, Patrick will not require surgery. ""Whilst the recovery time for every athlete is different, it is expected that Patrick will be on the sidelines for a minimum of six weeks."" Rob Price, the club's head of medicine and performance, added: ""As all of the stats show, Patrick has put his body on the line for Leeds United for a number of seasons, he has played with a plantar fascia injury for the last 12 months and despite treatment and a prolonged period of rehabilitation, the injury has progressed from a partial tear to a full rupture. ""As all sports medics know, injuries to the plantar fascia are notoriously difficult to manage, but all concerned are confident that he will make a full recovery from this injury in good time. ""Patrick has been incredibly unlucky this year, his game time has been limited by different injuries including an ankle injury sustained at Newcastle and hamstring and quad injuries once back in training and matchday squads. ""What he needs is a period of rest and rehabilitation to allow his body to fully recover."" Kalvin Phillips has also been a long-term absentee for the Elland Road side, having been kept out since December with a hamstring problem. But Leeds announced that he is nearing his return to the team as he is back in training, as are Liam Cooper and Diego Llorente. Raphinha is also back in training after recovering from illness, while Mateusz Klichhas recovered from a concussion. However, goalkeeper Illan Meslierhas been out because of some bruising to his thigh. All six players are expected to be fit to face Southampton on April 2.

Ronaldo and his team-mates drew a blank at Goodison Park to fall further behind in the race for fourth place and Champions League qualification, having won just one of their last five Premier League outings.

The Portuguese remains at the centre of a furore after seeming to hit a mobile device out of a supporter's hand in the wake of the Red Devils' 1-0 defeat at the weekend, and though he has since sought to make overtures, the damage has already been done. Now, Sarah Kelly, the parent of the boy in question, has roundly criticised both United and Ronaldo's conduct, and says that they have rebuffed any attempts at reconciliation as per her son's wishes. ""United have handled it terribly and it's just made things even worse to be honest,"" Kelly told the Liverpool Echo. ""The way I see it is, if someone assaulted him in the street and then asked us to go around for dinner, we wouldn’t. ""Just because he’s Cristiano Ronaldo, why would we do it? It’s like we owe him a favour, but I’m sorry, we don’t. We’ve kindly declined the offer to go to United because Jake doesn’t want to go there and he doesn’t want to see Ronaldo. He’s made that pretty clear. ""They're not my words, they’re my son’s words. At the end of the day, this is what it’s about. It’s affected him more than it’s affected me, so I have put everything to him to make his own mind up on - he doesn’t want to go to United, he doesn’t want to go to see Ronaldo. All that I’m saying right now is that it’s in the hands of the police."" Dual investigations by both the FA and Merseyside Police remain underway into Ronaldo's conduct, raising the propsect that the forward could face charges. It is the latest low point at United this season, though the club have been embroiled more in on-field failings than off-field trouble, with defeat to Everton effectively ending their distant hopes of a Champions League finish in the Premier League. Since arriving to much fanfare at the start of the season, Ronaldo's homecoming has turned into something of a sour affair at United, with questions raised over whether he will remain for the second year of his contract or look to force an exit from Old Trafford.

162,https://www.goal.com/en/news/dybala-or-lukaku-i-can-t-decide-moratti-on-inter-s-summer/bltf46524abb755edac,'Dybala or Lukaku? I can't decide' - Moratti on Inter's summer transfer plans,"Former Inter president Massimo Moratti says the Nerazzurri need to sign a striker this summer - but he cannot decide between Paulo Dybala and Romelu Lukaku. Dybala is set to leave Juventus on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the campaign while Lukaku, who scored 30 goals for Inter last season before re-joining Chelsea, could also be on the move after an inconsistent campaign at Stamford Bridge. Both have been linked with a switch to San Siro, with current Inter frontman Lautaro Martinez rumoured to be interesting rival clubs across Europe - most notably Arsenal and Tottenham. Speaking to Radio Uno about Inter’s potential summer plans, Moratti said: “I’d always sign Dybala, he is really strong. However, I believe Inter need a centre forward. If it’s not Lukaku, Inter will need a new one anyway. “Lautaro is a promising striker who hasn’t yet made that extra step. He has all the means to do well. I hope he can do better in the next games. Edin Dzeko has done well also without him. Joaquin Correa is a smart striker.”  Champions Inter were the only side in Serie A's top three to win last weekend, meaning they are just two points behind leaders Milan in second place with a game in hand. With the title race set to go to the wire, Milan boss Stefano Pioli called for fixtures involving the challengers to be played at the same time to make things fair - something Moratti agrees with. The 76-year-old also warned his old side not to discount fourth-placed Juventus, who are just six points behind the leaders. ""It would be more interesting and fair,” Moratti said of Pioli's proposal. ""Everything changes every weekend, Inter made the right step and were really convincing against Verona. A few games are remaining and there is no more room for mistakes. Games against the so-called smaller teams are those that make me more worried. ""I don’t think Juventus are out of the race just yet, unfortunately. ""They always find a way to win and I believe that the first three will have to pay attention to the Bianconeri, who never give up.""   Inter, Atletico, Spurs - Where next for Juve outcast Dybala?

The Turin giants are fourth in Serie A and eight points behind leaders AC Milan, while they crashed out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage with a home loss to Villarreal. The Bianconeri's only realistic chance of silverware this season is the Coppa Italia, having reached the semi-final of the tournament. Juventus finished fourth in the Italian top-flight last season and a second consecutive disappointing season has left the club feeling they require substantial investment in the squad to bounce back. GOAL can reveal that the club have discussed their plans for the summer transfer window and have come up with three areas in which they need to improve. Their main priorities are signing a new left-back, a physical midfielder who can score goals and a good replacement for Paulo Dybala. Dybala will leave the club as a free agent when his contract expires and the Serie A giants hope to bring in a winger who can strengthen the squad. The club made a significant improvement to the attack in January when they brought in Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina, but they acknowledge that they must improve in other areas, too. As well as new players coming in, Juve are also looking to clarify the future of some of their current players. While Dybala is set for the exit door, there are still some players nearing the end if their contracts who could be convinced to stay. JuanCuadrado's deal is running out, but he has said that he wants to stay at the club. Juventus still need to work out the details of his next contract, though, and nothing is guaranteed so far. Goalkeeper Mattia Perin has also decided he would like to remain in Turin rather than leave this summer. Full-back Mattia De Sciglio seems to be the one closest to signing an extension as the next round of talks is expected to result in a full agreement over a new deal. Federico Bernardeschi is still a big uncertainty, however, as there is currently no news over him committing his future to the club. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

164,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-beaten-heath-foord-arsenal-solved-big-game-hoodoo/10p44znsnza1f16k97uit1ilj8,Chelsea beaten with Heath & Foord to come: Have Arsenal solved their big-game hoodoo?,"It hasbeen two years since Arsenal won the Women’s Super League. Incidentally, it had also been two years since the Gunners had beaten either Chelsea or Manchester City in the league, their two biggest rivals in the competition getting the better of them on five of the last six occasions. That was until Sunday. In Jonas Eidevall’s first WSL game in charge of the club he had long followed from his native Sweden, he led Arsenal to a thrilling 3-2 victory againstreigning championsChelsea. That U.S. women’s national team star Tobin Heath, signed on Friday, is stillto come into this team, whileCaitlin Foord, one of the team’s star performers last season, is also missing through a quad strain, made an already exciting performance all the more promising. The reason that Arsenal have notcompeted as closely for the title in the past two seasons has been down to results in these ‘big’ games. Chelsea admittedly had both Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby on the bench on Sundaywhile they rebuild their own fitness, but this was still a statement. The Gunners’ star forward, Vivianne Miedema, has often been marked out of these games, butshe has found success when drifting out wide. When Arsenal drew against Chelsea last season, she burst down the left wing and assisted late on for Beth Mead. And that isexactly how the Netherlands internationalgot involved on Sunday at the Emirates Stadium. The first of the home side'sthree goals was scored by herself, with Katie McCabe playing Miedema in down the left wing. That was an area Arsenal targeted all afternoon, with Chelsea's Jess Carter, a midfielder, and Niamh Charles, a forward, at right centre-back and right wing-back, respectively. From there, Miedema burst past Carter, cut inside and finished through the legs of the defender.  After playing a gorgeous through-ball in the centre of the pitch for the second goal, scored by Mead, Miedema then had an influence out wide again for the third, setting Mana Iwabuchi free down the right, who found Mead for hercontroversial second. It isnot all about Miedema and whether she is involved enough when it comes to Arsenal winning these games, but she is one of the best players on the planet. The more she gets on the ball, the more their chances of winning any game increase. “We put more emphasis on other players' positioning for Viv to be able to have a role where she could both show feet and to go in with runs behind,” Eidevall explained after the game. “I think she's a very, very difficult player to play against when she gets that decision making because she's obviously a very, very intelligent player. When you give her that freedom, I think goals like the first one will come out of that.” Asked what he had taken from last season’s games against Chelsea and City, having admittedly “stayed up all night watching every game that the team had played” in the interview process for his new job, the Swede picked out a few other things that helped the Gunners emerge victorious.   “One of the aspects is to say that we need to be better to play out [against] a team that is pressuring us high,” he explained. “That I think was important as well, because Chelsea is a pretty [hard] team to play when they press high. ""[Also], they don't like to sit low and defend. If they have any weakness, it's that. I think that was pretty clear when you saw the Champions League final against Barcelona, [a 4-0 defeat] when they were forced to defend in long spells of the game. They get into problems. “When they don't choose to defend low at all, then you need to play against their high line and either create high quality scoring opportunities, or you don't create anything at all. “You can see all the three goals we scored today, they have some similarities in them, right? I think those are the goals that you can score against Chelsea if they don't choose to be lower in defence. Today they didn't choose that. That was the opportunity they were giving us to score goals."" “It wasn't [perfect],” he added. “We are early on the process. I'm early in English football. I [made] a lot of mistakes today from a tactical perspective. I need to learn to know Chelsea better, to prepare my team even better. “Far from perfect, but the [effort] was perfect from the players all the time, they tried to do their best in all situations and that's why we won. But I hope we have a lot of things to develop.”   There were areas that certainly could be improved, including a number ofshaky moments in defence, with Chelsea looking a threat whenever they pushed forward. But it isin these games when Arsenal often look a little toothless themselves. They struggle to create. They struggle to get Miedema into the game. They struggle with that high press. In the past, that poor record in these games may have even weighed on the minds of the players at times. If so, for Eidevall to have shaken off that big game hoodoo in his first league match in charge is impressive. Chelsea were notcomplete themselves, but neither were Arsenal. For them to have got this result and looked so good with both Heath and Foord to come in yet is certainly exciting. For Eidevall to admit that there isstill work to do as well is promising. For the first time since they lifted the trophy two years ago, Arsenal look like they will be in the WSL title race once more. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

165,https://www.goal.com/en/news/wembley-nightmare-distant-memory-world-class-kerr-chelsea/muadpgxq96de1xlsedd7vw0bx,'Wembley nightmare' a distant memory as world-class Kerr keeps Chelsea in pole position for WSL title,"Match statistics: Manchester City 2-2 Chelsea ""Wembley nightmare"". That ishow Sam Kerr’s performance for Chelsea against Manchester City in August was described. The Blues still won the game and the Women’s Community Shield,but Kerr’s performance came under the microscopeafter she missed three big chances that you wouldback a world-class talent like her to put away. Ever since that game, any doubters have been silenced. Game after game, Kerr hasproduced goals and assists, has formed a record-breaking partnership with Fran Kirby and, on Wednesday, provided a crucial goal and penalty-winning run against City that could well see Chelsea pip their opponentsto the Women’s Super League title. ""It’s ludicrous to think that people were saying what they were saying about Sam,"" manager Emma Hayes said after the game, reflectingon the beginning of the campaign. ""This is a player that was creating chances for fun. Maybe not finishing at that point, but you have to respect the ease at which she used to go beyond players. ""Now, she’s got the whole package. Her hold-up play, her link play, her role from set pieces, her ability to run behind, her transition play, everything. ""I think she is playing the best football of her career. I thought she was the difference tonight for us."" Hayes has been vocal in her support for Kerr from day one. The Australia internationalcame into the league as a superstar-then the record goal-scorer in her native W-League and also the United States’ NWSL, widely regarded as the best league in the world. She isstill only 27 years old. The expectations have been high as a result, and when she has not put the ball in the back of the net, the criticism has been very loud. Despite that, Kerr has marked her first season in England witha WSL-best 18 goals in the competition, and 24 in all competitions.  But Kerr is more than just goals. The partnership she has formed with Kirby, the only player perhaps who can pip her to any individual awards this season, has been phenomenal. The pair have combined for nine goals this season in the league, matching an all-time WSL record with two games to spare. Kerr’s ability to pull wide and allow others to run into the space she leaves centrally, and her awareness of those around her to either create that space or directly create chances, have always been features as big in her game as her goals. At Chelsea, she has done that with Kirby - and Beth England when the two play together -and it was also prevalent in her days with the Chicago Red Stars, where she formed a deadly duo with Yuki Nagasato. On Wednesday, City did notknow how to deal with her. For the first goal, she caused problems down the right that Alex Greenwood initially saw to, blocking her shot, but the resulting corner was powerfully headed into the back of the net by the Aussie for 1-0. 🔵 @samkerr1 rises highest!The @ChelseaFCW forward heads a powerful effort past Roebuck in the City net!#MCICHE #BarclaysFAWSL pic.twitter.com/IDzn4yDJ1v The second goal, less than 10 minutes after a City equaliser, was not even hers, but it was her best moment of the game that created it. Running one-on-one at Greenwood, Kerr slipped the ball through the defender’s legs, raced past her, drove into the box and was brought down by goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck. That Pernille Harder slotted home from 12 yards proved huge, as City would come charging back to equalise in what proved to be a 2-2 draw. The result leaves Chelsea two points clear of City, with two games to go. The Blues have Women’s Champions League semi-finals to navigate, which could have an impact, but when they have players in form like Kerr is, with eight goals in five games, more matchesare to be welcomed, rather than worried about. ""She’s relentless,"" Hayes added.""A wonderful athlete, a wonderful human. She delivered the biggest moments for the team when it mattered [on Wednesday] and she’s doing ittime and time again."" As the season comes to a close, and Chelsea chase down anincredible quadruple, Kerr’s name is primed to be thrown into the ring for award after award. To think that at the start of this campaign some doubted her world-class talent is now laughable. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

However, nine years on, the Russian's willingness to pump money into the Blues' women's team is now set to yield another European Cup. When Chelsea won the Women's Super League, Abramovich personally congratulated manager Emma Hayes. However, the ultimate goal was always continental supremacy and,on Sunday in Gothenburg, Chelsea will face Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final. Their mere presence in the final represents a remarkable achievement, given the Blues' women's team was still an amateur operation in 2013. Now, they are bidding to completethe third–and toughest– stageof a quadruple. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea Women chairman Adrian Jacob can't quite believe just how far they've come. ""I first got involved with the clubeight years ago,"" Jacob told Goal. ""At the time, women’s football was not professional. The WSL was not televised and there was no focus on it whatsoever. The girls were part-time, which was typical. ""You had big club names but they were affiliated to the club rather than being run by the club. Our staff, like Emma and her assistants, were working 90 hour weeks to keep things going. ""All the girls were part-time, had other jobs, trained a couple of days a week and trained at Staines FC at Wheatsheaf Park. There would be about 100 people and a dog, maybe sometimes two or three dogs there. ""It was all very quaint but we had girls who had just been to the Olympics, like Claire Rafferty and Eni Aluko. They were elite athletes but you would get more people watching a Sunday league match.  ""We then got invited to go to a tournament in Japan. It was an unofficial International World Club Championship. It was in our off-season and we barely had a squad. Emma insisted we go but the board said we had to put on a show there and not get humiliated. ""That’s not what Chelsea does. We thought'let’s bring some players in for it' and we used some contacts. The reality was that Chelsea weren’t doing well but it wasn’t the focus. ""But Emma came in and said, 'Weare Chelsea. When we take part, we win.'The directorsand the owner got completely on board. ""It was at the same time the WSL got more professional. We brought in more players. Everything we asked for from the club, we got, but it was bit by bit. We became good. You see a lot of clubs say that they have a ‘one club’ feeling, but at Chelsea it is genuine."" That trip to Japan in 2013 came after the Blues finished second bottom of the WSL. But their improvement was rapid and theyalmost won the league in 2014 only to fall short on the final day, losing to Manchester City. ""We weren't worse than them, but they had gone full time and were fitter than us,"" Jacob explains. Chelsea went full-time and began to win domestically, but Europe continued to provea step too far. ""I remember when we qualified for the Champions League and faced Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge,"" Jacob says. ""Me and Emma spoke after we lost 3-0 andwere well beaten. But, at that point, the former technical director Michael Emenalo came on board to help. ""When we played Wolfsburg for the first time, we had a list of everyone they had and we were like, 'This is unbelievable, how have they got so many staff?' ""Isaw the list for Sweden and we are taking 60 people with 30 staff.It is unbelievable where we are now. Chelsea Women’s facilities at Cobham are world-leading.""   Indeed, Chelsea have been making waves on a global level for some time now and Abramovich's willingness to splash his cash has obviously been key. Last summer, for example, the Blues broke the women's world transfer record by signing Pernille Harder, while also adding superstars such asSam Kerr and Melanie Leupolz. As he so often does with new additions to the men's team, Abramovich went out of his way to welcomenew signings to the club, while he insists that he is kept in the loop on all major moves behind the scenes. He also deserves credit for the appointment of Hayes, as hiring a female coach was almost unheard of at the time. Hayes' record of nine trophies in nine years has certainly vindicated that call. ""There was a time in the WSL, which was quite long, where Emma was the only female coach,"" Jacob points out. ""The amazing thing is that there’s support without pressure. ""This is a project. We want to win and Romanhas complete faith in Emma."" Chelsea's long-term goal is increasingparticipation in women's sports through their female academy, which they hope will produce similar results to the male equivalent. The Blues have also fully committed themselves to supporting worthy causes. An appeal to supporters helped raise £500,000 ($700,000)for Refuge, an organisation that helps victims of domestic abuse, and that donation was matched by Abramovich. Chelsea Women also donated their £100,000 ($140,000)prize fund for winning the Women's Super League to the same cause. Abramovich is now hoping that both Chelsea's men's and women's teams can end the season as European champions. This is not 2012 anymore. He is now just as preoccupied with seeing the women's team lift the Champions League trophy. ""It is a really big deal for him that they are in the final,"" Jacob adds, ""and this final is a big milestone in his legacy."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

167,https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-winners-barcelona-europes-best-side-all/tsq2sd3gdyh31rnjs99nqpcvy,Now it's official: Champions League winners Barcelona have been Europe's best side all season,"Match statistics: Chelsea 0-4 Barcelona The best team in Europe. Barcelona may well have been unofficially as much this season, without a single point dropped in the league, averaging just short of five goals per game, and playing football that can only be compared to the stuff their men’s team played under Pep Guardiola, as tiresome as such comparisons can be. On Sunday, they were officially crowned as much, ruthlessly beating Chelsea 4-0 in the Women’s Champions League final. It was an absolute masterclass of a performance that will go down as one of the greatest to be played on the biggest stage. A freak own goal gave them the lead inside a minute, but what followed was by no means out of the ordinary – for Barcelona, anyway. The way they pressed, the way they dominated, the incisiveness they showed in the final third, the fluidity of the movement off the ball;it iswhat has helped them wrap up the Primera Division title with eight games to go. Such chemistry does notcome overnight. This was the product of a team being carefully put together over the last decade, players hand-picked to suit the Barcelona style from other teams or progressing through the club’s famed academy set-up themselves.They have also been trusted and backed by the club to reach this point.  “It's patience and it's project, I would say,” Maria Teixidor, head of women’s football from 2015 to 2020 and one of the most influential figures in Barcelona’s rise, told Goal this week. “It's conscious decisions about making signings that will not last one year. In the old days, you had these contracts that were renewed year by year. We changed that, signing longer contracts. “If I'm signing you for two, three years and then an additional fourth if things go well, what you are really saying to the players is, 'I am building something serious and you're in. You're not backed for this year. You're backed for a longer period and you have to be an important piece in this project’.” When this team lost in the final to Lyon two years ago, 3-0 down inside 20 minutes, just as Chelsea were this year, it somewhat overshadowed all that good work both on and off the pitch. Perhaps they had got there prematurely, but it was notundeserved. They were making the right strides, taking the right steps. Sunday’s team was virtually the same, with only a few minor tweaks. The good work has only continued, the team has only got better, more experienced, and learned from that night in Budapest. 😄 Quan ets conscient de que ets campiona d’EuropaLa felicidad es esto 😍 pic.twitter.com/cpMX7GAk2l What was particularly impressive about the way they got their hands on the biggest trophy of all, though, was that, as effortless as they made it look, it was not going to be easy. First and foremost, Chelsea are a very, very good side. The result might not have shown that, but this is a incredible team with a fantastic squad of top qualityplayers. With a suspension for Andrea Pereira, and no natural centre-back with big experience in waiting, Patri Guijarro dropped from midfield into defence for Barca. Given the frightening rate at which Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby have been linking up all season, it could have ve been a weak point for Chelsea to exploit. The Blues did have some chances, but Barcelona's dominance afforded them few. Alexia Putellas, one of the best players in the world and regularly Barcacaptain, trained alone on Saturday too, with heavy strapping on that left leg that could be mistaken for a magic wand. Yet, if there were doubts as to whether she was fit enough to start when her name appeared in the line-up, it never showed in her performance.   But this was notgoing to be a game wonby one player’s individual brilliance, so it would not be a game lost because of one individual aspect like that, either, particularly with both sides built on strong team ethos. Nonetheless, the individual stories behind each player that walked up and collected their winners’ medals in Sweden on Sunday evening made this even more special. Melanie Serrano has been at Barcelona since 2007, and no one embodies the club like her. Vicky Losada had been back and forth between the team of her heart and professional opportunities for many years, before finally being able to play full-time for the Catalans. Caroline Graham Hansen has two runners-up medals in this competition, with two different clubs. It was the stuff of nightmares for Chelsea, but for Barcelona and every player that represents their club, this has been a dream for many, many years. For a club that prides themselves on the beauty of football, it was a dream achieved in the most perfect way imaginable. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

168,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lyon-dynasty-as-impressive-as-any-in-history-of-sport/t51z7voh97cd1b845yrvkds29,Catch them if you can: Lyon’s dynasty as impressive as any in history of sport,"Lyon’s incredible journey to becoming one of the greatest sporting teams of all-time started with a gruelling bike ride up the Col de l'Iseran, one of the mountain stages on the world-famous Tour de France. Ten years ago, before they had collected any of their now seven Champions League titles, their players were sent to the French-Italian border for a team bonding activity that meant tackling part of the iconic cycling track. It would be a horrible climb, one of the hardest activities the players would ever do, but every one of them completed it and could celebrate afterwards. As the season went on, that experience would become more than just an anecdote. As Lyon pushed for their first-ever European title, they likened every part of their campaign to that awful, never-ending slope in the Graian Alps. They knew it would be tough. They knew it would take everything they had. But they knew they wanted to stand at the top at the end and celebrate winning the Champions League – and they did. Every part of their success since – the seven European titles, their fifth in succession claimed earlier this year – can be traced back to those triumphs in 2010-11. That’s not to say, though, that the dominance that has followed was anticipated. “Where the club is now, on the top of Europe, seven Champions League titles, it’s unbelievable,” Eugenie Le Sommer, who has won all seven of those titles, tells Goal. “If you told me that 10 years ago, I couldn’t trust you!”  What Lyon have achieved in the last decade is completely and utterly unprecedented. It is dominance that makes them not only one of the best teams in women’s football history, but sporting history. It makes their humble beginnings even more incredible, too. It was only in 2004 that this club started its women’s section. When Lotta Schelin, the former Sweden international who would be Lyon’s all-time top-scorer when she left the club in 2016, signed in 2008, the club was not the super-power it is today. “They played Umea twice and people said:'Oh, that was a good team'. That was all I knew,” Schelin tells Goal. “But they talked about the Champions League so much. They really wanted to achieve that. “I was like, 'okay, I can stay in Europe, in a good team, and they want to win the Champions League. Why not?' I wanted to go there and try it out. “When I got there, it didn't feel like a professional environment at the time. It wasn’t left behind, but it was an ongoing process. “For me, it wasn't the biggest issue. I felt the club really wanted something and the president [Jean-Michel Aulas] for sure, he was the one who was supporting everything.” By 2010, the team had “everything that [they] needed” and it was then that things really took off.   Players like Le Sommer arrived to join a team that already featured legends such as Camille Abily, Sonia Bompastor, Elodie Thomis, Amandine Henry and Wendie Renard, to name but a few. Under the guidance of Patrice Lair, Schelin says the club “levelled up”. After losing on penalties in the 2010 Women's Champions League final, they were determined to go one further. “I [remember] in 2011 when we played at [Stade de] Gerland and we had 20,000 Lyon fans there to cheer us on against Arsenal,” Schelin recalls, describing the semi-final as one of her favourite moments at the club. “I got to score two goals in that game. It was a huge step, because it was the semi-final. It was amazing feeling.” After coming through with a 3-2 win over the Gunners, Lyon beat holders Turbine Potsdam 2-0 to win their first Champions League title. Ask any player who was part of the winning team that day, no matter what they have achieved since, and it is the first memory they recall when asked for their favourite. “It was our trigger for the team,” Henry, the French midfielder who ranks eighth in Goal 50 this year, explains. “It was one of the best memories of my career. I will never forget that. It was the culmination of several years of work. I always want to win this trophy and, even if after that we won it several times, it's not the same.” It wasn’t just significant for the individuals involved that day, either, but for every Lyon player who would follow. “The winner culture that’s in the walls, in the locker room and in Lyon as a club, that’s a culture that was born in 2010-11 and I think that is still with them today,” Schelin says. “The girls and the staff who won that first [title], we know that was a big step of a big thing for the club and for us.” That culture was carried into the following year, when Lyon won their first-ever treble. In Europe, they were especially dominant, scoring 39 goals and conceding just once on their way to a second successive title. It was particularly special for Le Sommer. She has scored over 250 goals for this club now, becoming their all-time top-scorer, but she still picks out her penalty in the 2012 final as her favourite. “I was young and I had that responsibility,” she remembers. “That was my first really important goal for the team.” It was the France international’s spot-kick that gave Lyon the lead in Germany, against Frankfurt, in front of 50,000 people – the majority of whom were rooting against them. “The second [title] was amazing,” Schelin recalls. “We did the treble, and on top of that we had [an aggregate score of] 39-1. That's amazing if you go through the Champions League with those kinds of numbers.” But despite what the club have gone on to achieve since then, Lyon’s story isn’t all smooth sailing. The relentless drive and motivation that created the winning machine we see today can be traced back to the difficult years that followed their 2012 triumph. After losing the 2013 final to Wolfsburg on penalties, Lyon were nowhere near the showpiece event in 2014 or 2015 – eliminated in the last 16 in back-to-back campaigns. “It was really hard,” Le Sommer explains. “I remember watching the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the final, at home. “I said:‘I don’t want to watch it again on my TV. I want to play these games’. It was a motivation for me, it was for the team too. This experience made us better and stronger in our mentality.” Henry adds: “We had won several European titles. All the teams were playing 200 per cent against us and unfortunately we had less success. “It was a little slump, but we quickly got back to work. The president invested in several important players. It was a turning point for the team with a generational change too.”   Over the course of the next few years, Lyon president Aulas continued his commitment to the team with a number of signings who would grow to be crucial players. In 2013, Japan international Saki Kumagai, ranked at No.7 in Goal 50 this year, joined from Potsdam. The following summer, Ada Hegerberg, who would go on to become the first-ever female Ballon d’Or winner and the Women’s Champions League’s all-time top-scorer, arrived. In 2015, it was Griedge Mbock Bathy, the young centre-back who ranks 12th in Goal 50 this year and has formed a formidable partnership with Renard. “Not everyone can come and take a spot in this team. That's been shown a lot of times,” Hegerberg, who was just 19 years old when she moved to France, tells Goal. “You need to have the quality, but you also need to be mentally prepared and interested in investing long-term. “I knew that Lyon had the best players, that they had the best ambitions - that matched my ambitions.” England international Nikita Parris, who signed for the club in the summer of 2019, credits her ambition for helping her settle in France, too. “I understood where I was in my career and where I wanted to go. For me to step in that environment, that’s what I wanted to get out of myself,” Parris tells Goal. “Going into an environment where there’s nothing but winners and you know you have to quickly get up to speed, quickly get the understanding of the language, the culture, the way of playing, settling in off the pitch...that’s the hardest part. “I just had to believe in myself and believe in my ability and know that it does take time.”   As well as recruiting well, Lyon were also keeping hold of their key players. “The girls have been playing together for 10 years in Lyon and we can see the difference [that makes],” Henry explains. Schelin agrees. “If you look at, Paris Saint-Germain for instance, you can see that they have changed a lot in their group,” she adds. “If you look at them 10 years back, I don't think they have the same players at all. Lyon has the same players.” That combination paid dividends as Lyon finally got their hands back on the trophy in 2016 – in dramatic style too, with a penalty shootout win over Wolfsburg. “It was amazing to end my career in Lyon in that way,” Schelin, who left the club after that triumph, says. “We were heading on a good path, winning all those trophies the last year. My last kick with Lyon was a penalty that was part of winning the Champions League. It was so amazing, like a dream.” Asked if she was surprised by the success that would follow, she adds: “For me, it feels obvious because we were such a good team. Seeing them continue, [it's] normal. “It's amazing, but I totally understand why.” After the 2016 win, Dzsenifer Marozsán, one of the most technically gifted footballers in the world, was one of those who arrived to continue the winning ways. “When I played for Frankfurt, I had the impression that Lyon kept the same players all the time,” the Germany international, ranked fourth in Goal 50 this year,tells Goal. “Now, it’s changed. Big players come and go, but we still keep going as a team. That’s not easy, but we have a lot of the best players in Europe, and in the world, and they are really professional.” The 2017 final was decided on penalties once again, with Lyon getting the better of rivals PSG on yet another big occasion. Lyon’s dominance domestically and on the continent means their French rivals have won just two trophies in the last 10 years, finishing as runners-up in the league an incredible eight times. With new players adapting quickly to the ambitions and demands of the biggest club in the game, Lyon picked up two more titles in 2018 and 2019. First, they beat Wolfsburg 4-1 after extra-time, something Hegerberg believes “showed extreme mental strength”. Then, it was Barcelona who were beaten by the same scoreline the following year, albeit in 90 minutes. After Marozsán opened the scoring, Hegerberg hit a hat-trick to put Lyon 4-0 up after half an hour. “I think it's very important to say that we don't defend our titles, but we attack again,” the striker says. “Every year it’s going to be more difficult. We feel it on the field,” Marozsán laughs. “Everyone just wants to beat Lyon. “That’s why I’m really impressed with the team, because mentally, that’s really strong from us. We just keep going and, each year, we have the same goals: we want to win the Champions League and all the other titles.”   In 2020, dominance continued. Wolfsburg were defeated again in what was possibly Lyon’s most impressive win yet. While their opponents boasted arguably the most in-form player in the world – Goal 50 2020 winner, Pernille Harder – Lyon were missing Henry, Hegerberg, Mbock Bathy and Parris. However, they were 2-0 up at half-time and, although Wolfsburg pulled one back, 3-1 winners in the end. “I was so confident in the girls going into that game,” Parris says, recalling her first Champions League triumph. It was an occasion she had to enjoy from the stands due to suspension but, while watching from the sidelines can give some players a perspective that makes them nervous, that was never the case for Parris on that day in Bilbao. “I always knew, I always thought, ‘We’re going to score another goal’. It just came in the closing minutes of the game,” she says. “When you finally get that medal around your neck… wow. What an amazing occasion.” Five Champions League titles in a row is some achievement – but it’s nothing that Lyon will rest on. That focus on how to stay ahead is what keeps them at the top, after all. “It takes a lot of analysing and the club also needs to be good at thinking ‘new’ every year. How can we always be a step ahead? That's going to be the challenge,” Hegerberg says. “The club has a lot of work to do in the coming years because we can still stay on top, but it takes a lot of commitment from everyone.”   Rather than going out and signing the best players in the world, Lyon have made their dynasty by seeking out ambitious young talent and developing them in a winning culture. Their success may seem flawless from the outside looking in, but there is more to it. “It's good sometimes to just wake up and understand, 'okay, we have to work harder and do it again’,” Schelin says, reflecting on the difficult years that forged the team we see today. “That's why Lyon, as a team, as a club, they are amazing. Winning, that's hard enough, but losing and then coming back? That's when you can see the real winners. “That's why their history is perfect, in some way.” Earlier this year, ahead of the resumption of the 2019-20 Champions League campaign, Lyon’s history-chasing team returned to the Col de l'Iseran, where it all began. Only five players remained from the group that tackled the mountain back in 2010 – goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, centre-back Renard, midfield general Henry, winger Amel Majri, who finished 18th in Goal 50 2019 and 2020,and goal-machine Le Sommer. But, as that core group did 10 years ago, they conquered that gruelling peak and rose to the top of Europe once more. With additional reporting from Benjamin Quarez.

Jordi Mestre, the former vice-president of the club, laughs whenasked about the attitude towards the women's teamback in 2010, when he began hisfour-year stint in charge of the female sectorand the B team. “The first thing I did was go topre-season camp and I went to visit the coach and his second coach. When they saw me, they were looking at me with a strange face. ‘What is he doing here? A member of the board, here, in the middle of nothing?’” he reveals toGoal. Fast forward to this weekend, Barcelona will compete in their second UWCL final in three seasons. After losing the first of those, there is genuine belief that on Sunday, against Chelsea, they will go one better. The rise of this iconic club in the women’s game can be traced back many years, with their first Primera Division title, back in 2012, a huge moment. “Nobody knew and nobody spoke – no members, no board, no media – about the ladies’ team,” Mestre recalls. But when they became champions of Spain for the first time, and graced the Champions League for the first time, it would prove a catalyst forchange. Within three years, as the titles continued to pour in, Mestre proposed the idea of turning the women’s team professional – and the club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, backed it. “Barca has always been ahead of times and has always been thinking about how to impact society in the proper way,” Maria Teixidor, who joined the club in 2015 to take over the women’s team, tellsGoal. “It made total sense to build this.”  What followed seemed to only strengthen the team’s position. The women’s team would join the men’s on a summer tour of the United States and a deal was announced with Stanley, which the club described as the biggest shirt sponsorship deal to date for a women’s team. But, strangely, in the four seasons that followed the professionalism, after being crowned champions for four years in a row, there were no league titles. Mestre describes it as ""a period of transition"" in which patience was important, but that wasn’t the only thing that shaped the success seen today. The recruitment during those four years was exceptional. Sixteen of the players in Barcelona’s squad today were signed between 2015 and 2019. “We wanted to look like Barca, always, so we weren’t thinking about just hiring very good players from all over the world –which we could have done,” Teixidor says. “We wanted to have this rooted team of players that had lived the transition from amateurism to professionalism, who knew how hard this had been and who really felt the colours within and this passion about the club. “We needed this mix. We needed to look at what we had already and add those players that could make a difference. All this design is [the sporting director] Markel Zubizarreta's job. I have to say he's an amazing guy.” “When we sign a player, male or female, we look at the player and how he or she can fit in our system,” Mestre adds. “There are a lot of players, male and female, that are very good, but sometimes, the scouting team says she or he is not for our system.” What was created was a perfectly balanced and well-blended squad.   There are those who have come through the set-up and embody Barcelona, such as Melanie Serrano, Spanish players identified from a young age as good fits for thestyle, such as Patri Guijarro, and starsfrom abroad, like Caroline Graham Hansen. All this is complemented by an exciting group of youngsters coming through the academy. “They really have become like a family,” Teixidor says. “That is the best part, when you see a team that works together and you know that, because of the good relationships they've built, they can reach whatever they want.” All that was missing now was the perfect coach. In January 2019, Fran Sanchez was dismissed, something that had rarely happened in Spain before and caused huge waves in the press, and in came Lluis Cortes. “Lluis brought back something that is not tangible, but which is this glue that sticks everything together and really makes things work,” Teixidor explains. Under Cortes, Barcelona did something sudden and unexpected. Within four months of his appointment, they were in the Champions League final. Sanchez had left them in the quarter-finals, thanks to an 8-0 win over Glasgow City, and wins over Norway’s Lillestrom and Bayern Munich saw them continue the remarkable journey. “I hadn't cried for years and I remember, me and Jordi Mestre, both of us crying,” Teixidor recalls of the semi-final victory. “You had this feeling that things were on the good track. That was one of the best moments I've lived in football.” To lift the trophy was a step too far;after all, they were facing a Lyon side in their pomp. The French giants lifted their fourth successive European title, going 3-0 up inside 20 minutes. But, as Teixidor notes, to reach that stage showed that Barcelona were doing the right things. 🙊 Ups! WE DID IT AGAIN #UWCL pic.twitter.com/8Lsm9NjAm5 For the Catalans to be back in the showpiece event this weekend is a testament to the work they have continued since. They have won back-to-backleague titles – this season’s without a single point dropped – to end a five-year barren run, and have continued to strengthen the squad without disrupting the core group. “If you watch our team now, the same team played in the final in 2019,” striker Asisat Oshoala said this week. “Nothing's changed. Maybe one or two players, of course, but it's not like we're learning new things. ""We're not trying to adapt to ourselves for the past few years. We already adapted to ourselves. We just keep getting better.” What has changed, though, is the expectation. After being huge underdogs two years ago, the feeling in Barcelona is much different this weekend. “It was like a Champions League title, to be in the [2019] final,” Mestre says. “Thinking from 2010 to the final, it's like a miracle. “The other day, Lluis Cortes saidsomething that is true: at that moment, it was an award to be in the final. “Now, we are in the final to win it.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

170,https://www.goal.com/en/news/oshoala-barcelona-wont-make-the-same-mistakes-in-uefa-womens/c8ing1v5567w1boanxvosoft8,Oshoala: Barcelona won’t make the same mistakes in UEFA Women’s Champions League final,"Barcelona striker Asisat Oshoala insists that the team have learned from their UEFA Women’s Champions League final defeat to Lyon two years ago, ahead of Sunday’s final against Chelsea. The Nigeria international was on the scoresheet in Budapest in 2019, but her goal was a late consolation for the Catalan side. In the two years since, though,  Barcelona have only gone from strength to strength and, after being huge underdogs against Lyon, find themselves in a very strong position this time around. Reflecting on the past two years, speaking to the media this week, Oshoala said: “Now, we have the experience of how European football is and also how a top game like this is played. I think we're going to be better with our tactics this year, how we go out and play and everything. ""For us, it was good. We played in the final 2019, we lost and then we picked up corrections from there. “Come May 16, against Chelsea, I don't think we're going to make the same mistakes again, because we already learned from the past. We are a better team now than we were two years ago."" “You just have to expect the proper normal Barca game, the normal proper Barca style,” the 26-year-old, who has four goals in this year's UWCL,added when asked about Sunday’s game plan. ""We're not changing anything. We're working on our own team. I'm sure Chelsea are working on themselves as well. “When you hear the name Barcelona, you already know the kind of football the team plays. You already know what to expect. When you hear Chelsea, you already know the kind of football you expect. “I think it's going to be a very, very interesting one because both teams have top stars around the world. It's not going to be a boring match, I promise.”  Speaking about the tiki-taka style of play Barcelona is famous for, Oshoala added that she doesn’t believe there’s a difference between any of the teams that represent the club. “It's still the same tiki-taka style of football that we're playing,” the striker,  who ranked at No.24 in last year's Goal 50,  said. “I don't think there's much difference when it comes to the Barca Femeni and Barca men's team because it's still the same style of football. We play the tiki-taka style and finish with the beautiful goal. “I feel like, here, the first way to defend is to keep the ball. That's the first way to defend. You have to keep the ball. This is the theory of the team. It's still the same for the men and women's teams - the same even with the youth teams as well.” Oshoala, however, believes she offers something that can help Barcelona change their game plan if they need. “I think my style of football is quite different from the team's style of football,” she explained. ""It's not the same, but the end of the day, when you get to a certain place or when you play in certain teams, you have got to change the way you play if you want to win. It's not always about how you play sometimes. There's a stage the game gets to where you've got to change. You have got to evolve with the game as well, you know? “I think I'm here because, sure, I'm a good finisher, I finish a lot and my movement in the box, I make sure I time that well. For me, I can say maybe the finishing or the speed part or whatever might not be the normal style of the team, but in some games, these things are needed and I give it to the team.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues held off the challenge of Manchester City, who finished second in the standings two points behind, while Arsenal secured third. It is the fourth time that Chelsea have won the Women’s Super League, having previously picked up the titles in 2015 as well as 2017-18 and 2019-20. This tally takes them ahead of Arsenal's previous tally of three. There was also the relegation issue to be decided on the final day of the season. Bristol City came into the final day bottom of the table and in need of a victory to secure survival. The basement side, though, suffered a 3-1 loss away to Brighton and Hove Albion to finish the campaign with just 12 points and a goal difference of -54. As such, they will go down to the Championship. Chelsea’s campaign got off to a low-key start as they were held to a 1-1 draw away to Manchester United, but they soon showed their quality by running out 9-0 winners over Bristol. It was that thumping success at Kingsmeadow that set the tone for the remainder of their campaign, which has seen them drop only nine points over the course of the 22-match season. Furthermore, they have won eight of their fixtures by four goals or more, with Sam Kerr finishing as the division’s top scorer by netting 21 times. Meanwhile, Fran Kirby scored 16 times to end the campaign third in the scoring stakes behind her team-mate and Arsenal ace Vivanne Miedema. Their success has extended beyond the Super League, though. Chelsea are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in which they will play Everton, while they are also into the final of the Champions League, in which they will face Barcelona in Gothenburg next week.

Fran Kirby is not like most footballers. Her return to action this season after nine months out due to pericarditis, a heart condition, has many running out of superlatives to describe her incredible ability. But after her starring role in Chelsea’s 3-1 win over Manchester City on Sunday,Blues’ boss Emma Hayes put it perfectly. “Fran is, without question in this country, the most talented attacking playerin the England squad,” she told reporters. “Everybody needs to look after her because if England are going to win major trophies, it is important everybody recognises what a special talent she is, but also what a special person she is.” It was November of last year when Kirby played her final game of the 2019-20 season -a campaign that ended with Chelsea winning the Women’s Super League title, after picking up their first Continental Cup in February. Normallythe 27-year-old would have played a starring role, but now she ismaking up for time lost on the sidelines battling a condition that almost ended her career. After nine months without a competitive game, she stole the show in Chelsea’s Community Shield win over City in August and has provided two assists and three goals in four WSL games since. On Sunday, she put the ball on a plate for Sam Kerr for a goal that was almost identical to that scored at Manchester United on the opening day of the season. 😛 No mistake this time for @samkerr1. @ChelseaFCW lead 2-0!#BarclaysFAWSL #CHEMCI pic.twitter.com/IBuIv8siah With her fantastic delivery and Kerr’s clever movement, the pair are forming quite a duo. Kirby is crucial to the style that Chelsea are using to dominate teams this season. Her athleticism, speed and ability to pick the perfect pass are helping the Blues attack with real fluidity and ruthlessness. It is incredible, most of all, to think that she has been back for just seven competitive games. She oozed confidence throughout the encounter with City, one of Chelsea’s biggest rivals for the title this season. Running at the visiting defence with paceand terrifying them with an intense press out of possession - as the Blues did all game -she got the goal she deserved late on. Erin Cuthbert played the perfect pass, Kirby timed a perfect run and suddenly she was around the goalkeeper, Ellie Roebuck, wrapping up all three points. Fran-tastic! @ChelseaFCW restore their two goal lead courtesy of @frankirby 🤩#BarclaysFAWSL #CHEMCI pic.twitter.com/bG404XsVO8 “Fran is one of my good mates as well so seeing her journey, seeing what she’s been through, it’s an absolute pleasure to see the performances that she’s providing on the pitch” Cuthbert said. “I think that’s a testament to all of the hard work she’s done. She’s really, really worked so hard, in pre-season and over lockdown, to get herself to a fitness level that means she’s competing with the team.” Hayes added: “Yes, she’s got a club that loves her and we’ll do the best we can by her, but she deserves all the credit. She’s put all the hard work in.” Her ability to work back to such a high fitness level, after a heart condition that meant she was told by a cardiologist that she may not play again if she did not“slow down”, is amazing. But the joy with which she is now playing is the most exciting thing of all. The feel-good factor to her play, that which saw her cheekily flick the ball over a challenge from Lucy Bronze -one of the best players in the world -on Sunday, is as entertaining as it is effective.  “Her technical ability speaks for itself,” Cuthbert, who herself had a fantastic game floating into space in the middle of the park, said. “She’s a top-class player. She’s always able to find angles for me and she makes my job easy. I can do the hard work for her and she can go on and score like she did today! “I’m happy with that. She’s just outstanding and when I provide her with the ball, I know she’s going to provide something beautiful.” After struggling with injuries before her illness, something that prompted Hayes to urge patience with the England star around this time last year, Kirby could well be playing the best football of her career right now. But the most exciting thing is, she isliterally only just on the comeback trail. “I think there is still another level I can go to,” Kirby said at last month’s England camp. “I think I can be more clinical in my finishing. I can improve.” She isjust getting started. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

173,https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-wanted-to-challenge-myself-charles-thriving-with-trophy-hungry-/b1cv7hxe6yqf1lj4qza65kdcc,'I wanted to challenge myself' - Charles thriving with trophy-hungry Chelsea after switch from Liverpool,"“Could you get used to this?,” Chelsea manager Emma Hayes asked Niamh Charles. The 21-year-old had just made her club debut, her first appearance at Wembley and won her first piece of silverware, all in one go. What the forward has done since suggests she’ll have no choice but to get used to it, such has been her impressive integration at the champions of England. Her move to the Blues raised some eyebrows in the summer, leaving childhood club Liverpool after their relegation, but Hayes had no doubt about Charles’ ability to make the jump. “I recruited Niamh to the club based on the fact that her performances for Liverpool against us were outstanding,” she said this week. “I always remembered that.” When Chelsea were reduced to 10 players after 13 minutes in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Atletico Madrid last week, it was Charles who came on and helped stabilise the team. When the Blues were 2-1 down in a Continental Cup quarter-final at Manchester City, a place they’ve never won,Charles found the top corner in stoppage time. 🎩 @niamhcharles7 IS MAGIC 🎩As soon as @ManCityWomen go in front, the supersub puts @ChelseaFCW back in it! 🔵We're going to extra-time 😬#ContiCup pic.twitter.com/znaZgyIz4l That goal was perhaps the most crucial of the 16 that they have scored on their way to the final of that competition, in which they will face Bristol City on Sunday. After getting her hands on the Community Shield on her debut, the weekend presents a chance for Charles to win the first major trophy of her career. “You know when you come to Chelsea that the expectation is winning,” she tells Goal. “The expectation is being a part of these big events. “The players that we have are so experienced already in these occasions. Wembley was a great experience for me to add to that, so it's not just new to me when I'm at the Conti Cup final.” The difference between the club she joined and the club she left was evident right at the beginning of the season. While Liverpool were readying themselves for life in the second tier, the Blues were eyeing up “every single trophy” on offer.  “I've got nothing but great things to say about Liverpool and what they did for me, but the clubs are in probably different places,” Charles says. Not that it was easy for her to leave the club. Not only had she played for the Reds since she was a young girl, she has supported them for even longer. In 2019, when Liverpool's men's team lifted their sixth Champions Leaguetitle at the Wanda Metropolitano, Charles was in the crowd. She’s followed them around the world. “That was probably the hardest thing. It wasn't just leaving the team as such, it was leaving the club you represent, the badge that you have on, that I've been wearing since I was four years old as just a fan,” she explains. “But then, when you hear that Chelsea, who are one of the best clubs in the world, [are interested], that was, at my age, the natural progression. I wanted to take a step out of my comfort zone and start to challenge myself.” Making the move has helped elevate her game to another level withthe 21-year-old earning her first senior call-up for England back in September. Playing at right-back during an in-house friendly was a new experience, but one that has become a little more familiar since. In both legs of Chelsea’s European tie with Atletico, that is where she was deployed. It’s where Hayes has said she sees her future. Not that the forward has lost her attacking nous, at all. Her goal against Man City in the Conti Cup was the most notable example. With Chelsea staring a quarter-final exit in the face, Charles received Guro Reiten’s lofted cross on her chest and set herself up to strike the ball on the volley into the top corner. Goals from Reiten and Sophie Ingle won the tie in extra-time.   “There is just a feeling in the team that there is a 'never say die' attitude,” Charles says. “There's still time left in the game, so there's that belief there. “The reason my goal went in was probably because I wasn't thinking. It just happened. Then after that, it was the togetherness, from the bench to the pitch, it felt like a proper team effort.” Their opponents in the final, Bristol, are gathering great momentum and have an exceptional attacking talent in Ebony Salmon.But the Blues are the favourites, having beaten the Robins twice already this season. With a league title to fight for and the Champions League quarter-finals to come,a win on Sunday could be a springboard for Hayes’ side. “That experience of winning will hopefully breed more winning, because that's what, at the start of the season, we set out to do,” Charles says. “It was every single trophy, it wasn't just one. That's the expectation of this club.” She’s only been at Chelsea for a few months, but Charles is sounding and looking like a player with all the traits that the club want. “When she realises how good she is,” Hayes said of her summer signing, “then I think she'll take another step.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

174,https://www.goal.com/en/news/one-down-three-to-go-kerr-kirby-chelsea-historic-quadruple/z2nrrhpx30xx1xxek09idu0la,"One down, three to go? Kerr and Kirby keep Chelsea on course for historic quadruple","There were no fans atVicarage Road on Sunday as Chelsea lifted their second successive Continental Cup title, but when the second of their six goals went in, there was a large chorus of ‘ooh, ahh’ in the stands. Sam Kerr had just been played in by Fran Kirby to score her second of the afternoon after only nine minutes. She finished ruthlessly, across the face of goal, ran to the sideline and, for the first time since she signed for the Blues 16 months ago, pulled out her famous backflip celebration. “I’m shaking my head because I’ve waited 12 months for that,” Chelsea head coach Emma Hayes said after the game. “She could’ve given me a heads up! “The second half of the flip was very sloppy. It would’ve been a 4.0 at the Olympics!” The bench certainly disagreed, and such acrobatics were not the only thing Kerr and Chelsea did that left those in attendance marvelling on Sunday. The Australia international'slink-up play withKirby was mesmerising, with both having two goals and two assists to their names at half time as they setHayes’ side on their way to a 6-0 win over Bristol City and their first piece of silverware of the season. The victory might not appear a massive statement on the face of it. Chelsea were overwhelming favourites, top of the Women’s Super League and holders of the Conti Cup, while Bristol only lifted themselves off the foot of the WSL table on Monday. However, the ruthless manner in which it was achieved was superb. Particularly in the first half an hour, whenever they had a sight of goal, Chelseascored.  Such a clinical display was put on with both Pernille Harder -the most expensive women’s footballer of all time - and Ji So-yun - one of the greatest players in WSL history -left on the bench as unused substitutes. It isonly going to increase the talk of a possiblequadruple, afeat understandably shrugged off on a regular basis by Hayes, met with a roll of the eyes, a puff of the cheeks - or both. After all, only one English team has ever even won the Women’s Champions League, Arsenal back in 2007, never mind the rest. The Gunners that season went on to become the first – and still only – English side to win all four trophies on offer. They will come up against much sterner defences before the season ends -even if they avoided most of the favourites for the Champions League in Friday’s draw, falling in the most favourable half, for lack of a better word. A clash with Manchester City, the second toughest defence in the league after Chelsea, in April will, meanwhile, likely decide the WSL title. But there might not be a defence on the planet that can stop them right now, particularly with the fearsome duo that leads their attack.   Kirby is in the form of her life, involved in all six goals on Sunday. Kerr, meanwhile, put on perhaps the most clinical display of her season, becoming the first player to score a hat-trick in a Conti Cup final. There was one sour note, though. A horrible looking injury to Maren Mjelde, a player Hayes described “one of the most underrated players in the world” this week, meant she was stretchered off late in the second half. That the team celebrated while waving the Norwegian’s No.18 shirt around on the podiumsymbolised how close-knit they are. “I hate that phrase,” Hayes said this week, after describing how “together” her players are. “I shouldn’t have to say that.” With further injuries perhaps unavoidable as the games come thick and fast for this Chelsea team fighting on all fronts – Beth England was missing on Sunday after a knock in Europe, while Sophie Ingle limped around at full time - that team spirit will be crucial to more silverware. But even more important will be this team keeping their focus as the talk of so much success swells. With Hayes in charge though - “it’s no guarantee you’re going to [win] just because you’ve done it before” – it isincredibly unlikely you will see this Chelsea side get carried away.

175,https://www.goal.com/en/news/harder-priceless-champions-league-strike-why-chelsea-broke/1kjkjdp3516dp180t0q1atgcqf,Harder’s priceless Champions League strike shows exactly why Chelsea broke the bank for her,"When Chelsea made Pernille Harder the most expensive player in the history of women’s football in the summer of 2020, it was a statement of intent. They hadjust won the Women’s Super League for a third time and the Continental Cup for the first time. Manager Emma Hayes had every domestic trophy in her trophy cabinet now – and her sights were set on that elusiveWomen’s Champions League. Signing one of the best players in the world, less than 12 months after getting another of those in Sam Kerr, would help them to perform in those big moments in Europe. On Sunday, with Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich seemingly going to extra time, Harder made sure it did not, putting Chelsea 4-3 up on aggregate with only minutes to go. Her transfer fee was record-breaking, but this goal was priceless. As Fran Kirby secured victory in stoppage time, the Chelsea players dropped to the ground in realisation of what they had done. The Blues had just become onlythe third team in the competition's history to come back from a semi-final first leg defeat to progress, reaching the final for the first time. It isa feat they’ve been working towards for years, with semi-final defeats in their past, and the ultimate prize is their most craved. ""I'm not going to sit here and give you a load of crappy platitudes. I worked my whole life for today and I'm so f*cking proud of the players,” Hayes told BT Sport after the game. The desire to win this trophy is almost beyond words – but the uncensored nature of her immediate reaction said it all.  It isan ambition that extends beyond the pitch. Sunday’s game was played behind closed doors, but Bayern’s players could have been forgiven for thinking Chelsea has sneaked some fans in, such was the way the hosts were cheered on and supported by every member of staff at Kingsmeadow. Few want to win this trophy more than Harder, either. The former Wolfsburg star has experienced plenty of heartbreak in the past, losing in the 2018 and 2020 finals. She hasalways won individual awards and plaudits for her performances on the European stage, but it is not that which she is after. ""When my goal went in, it was the best feeling ever,” Harder told BT Sport afterwards. “To win the final would be the biggest thing in my career.” On Sunday, she was as tenacious and hard-working as ever, the desire clear in her performance. Indeed, no one on the pitch won more tackles or created more chances. “We've worked hard all week on her being aggressive,” Hayes explained. “We said that it's important in your pressing moments you're 100 per centin them.” Those who have seen Harder, last year’s Goal 50 winner, play will think first of wonderful technique and excellent finishing– but her goal at the weekend showed another big strength. “I think she's really dangerous from set-pieces,” Hayes added. “I think she comes alive in spaces that you might think sort of more aggressive aerial players would be, but I actually think it's a strength of hers.” It was a goal that served as a reminder of just how well-rounded she is as a footballer.   It hasbeen some first season at Chelsea so far for the 28-year-old. Harder hasscored nine goals and provided three assists in 20 WSL games, just 14 of those starts, to help the Blues sit in pole position for the title with two games to go. She hasalso won the Conti Cup and is now in another Champions League final. There were several heart-in-mouth moments for Chelsea on Sunday, several moments where it looked like that heartbreak they have experienced in the past might cruelly strike once more. But this time the outcome was different. Now, Harder will hope that the result in the final at long last goes her way. Against a Barcelona team who have also never won the trophy before, rather than the seven-time champions Lyon, whoregularly crushdreams in the UWCLwith their incredible experience, this will be her best chance yet of winning the tournament. With her world-class ability to produce in the biggest moments, you would notbet against her doing something special to help her and Chelsea win the trophy for first time, either. That isexactly why Harder is one of the best players in the world -and worth every penny. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

176,https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-all-just-cried-on-the-phone-how-brazil-born-macario-made/1ln3uxn4epl1p1cjwved321mxq,'We all just cried on the phone' - How Brazil-born Macario made USWNT dream a reality,"In January of this year, the phone call Catarina Macario had been awaiting her entire lifefinally came. The call represented a dream realized, but it hadn’t come without costs: a family separated, a 12-year-old girl thrust into a new country not speaking the language, the weight of a family’s expectations, the sense that failure wasn’t an option. However, when she heard she was finally eligible to play for the United States, her adopted country that she had grown to love and call her own, Macario knew that her fraught journey had been vindicated. “When I found out about my clearance, I called my parents and we all just cried on the phone,” Macario told Goal, “because it was something that was so incredibly special that we had been desperately waiting for.” Born in Brazil, Macario moved to the United States at age 12 with her father and brother, leaving her mother behind. The principal reason for her family’s relocation was her burgeoning soccer career, which was in danger of being hamstrung by a lack of opportunities for girls in her hometown. Brazil is renowned worldwide for its ubiquitous soccer culture but, up until recently – and some would say still – soccer was a synonym for men’s soccer. “I felt like I was constantly judged for playing soccer as a girl,” Macario said on All of US, the U.S. Women’s Soccer Show. “Like, ‘girls aren't meant to do that. They're meant to play with dolls and do ballet.’ And it was just very, very sad that I was unable to feel comfortable doing the thing that I loved.” Macario relocated to San Diego with her father and brother, while her mother stayed behind in Brazil to work as a doctor. The early days in California were not easy for Macario. On top of being in a new country and barely speaking the language, she felt the weight of expectations on her shoulders: If she didn’t succeed in soccer, would the entire relocation be a failed enterprise? “Being a 12-year-old girl and knowing that your family is doing this, really thinking about you and almost seeing you as an investment [in] your future, it definitely took a toll at times,” Macario said. “It was such a hard transitional period that I would just really get in my head and think whether we had made the right decision.At times I literally asked, ‘Can we go back?’”  But Macario and her family persevered. The pressure didn’t faze Macario, it made her better. Success at the youth level was followed by a starring role at Stanford University. In the fall of 2020, Macario was called into senior U.S. national team camp for the first time. She had been granted her U.S. citizenship but could only train with the team as she awaited clearance from FIFA to play in matches. By that time, Macario was coming off back-to-back Hermann Trophy wins as the best player in college soccer, and was considered one of the best prospects in the world. But this wasn’t Stanford anymore. This was the USWNT. “It was something so special that I just couldn't believe with my own eyes,” Macario said of her first call-up. “I was seeing Kelley [O’Hara] and Becky [Sauerbrunn] and all of them. “It's my first time playing five-v-five in like a year and I'm playing against the best back line in the whole world! So, I was like, ‘sick!’ I just got completely demolished,” Macario said with a laugh. But as she had done in the past, Macario started adapting to her new surroundings. And being in the national team environment taught her something significant, too. “That's how I decided that I needed to go pro,” Macario said, “in order to just become great like them. I was just so inspired by everything that they did.” This summer, Macario, now playing for European power Lyon, was named an alternate in the U.S. Olympic squad. In previous Olympics, alternates would only be eligible to play if they replaced a player on the active roster but for the rescheduled Tokyo Games, alternates were eligible to play each match. It was a major boost for Macario, but it ultimately didn’t provide her with the prominent role that her fellow alternate Lynn Williams managed to carve out. Instead, Macario made just one late cameo over the USWNT’s six matches. Though the team was at times crying out for a creative spark like Macario, head coach Vlatko Andonovski didn’t call her number. If there is any lingering disappointment from her first Olympics, Macario doesn’t show it. Winning a medal – even a bronze after the team was favored to take home gold – certainly helps. “At my young age, [going to an Olympics] is something that I could not be more grateful for just because I think that I have so much to learn [from] these great players,” Macario said. “Being able to just be there and kind of sit back and not have the responsibility of necessarily playing a big role in this major tournament will help me prepare for the next one, where I hope to be playing a bigger role."" On winning an Olympic medal, she added: ""That was by far one of my greatest accomplishments and a dream come true.""   At 22, Macario is a bona fide star for Lyon and a player that Andonovski recently tipped as “one of the players I call the future of this team"". Seeing how far Macario has come provides an even more poignant reminder of all the places in the past it could have all come undone,were it not for the support system Macario had in place. “I definitely doubted myself,” Macario said. “But, at the end of the day, you just have to stay committed to it and my parents were, thankfully, very supportive. They knew the potential that I had, and they didn't let me give up.” By the time Macario heard she was finally eligible to play for the USWNT, it had become a matter of when, not if. Still, clearing the final hurdle immediately brought back everything she had overcome to reach that moment. The 12-year-old girl who didn’t speak English and wanted to go back home had transformed into everything she and her family hoped she would. “I feel like at this point in my life, just like this year, it’s been like, ‘OK, I guess all the sacrifices were worth it,’” Macario said. ”It was definitely tough but I wouldn't take anything back.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

177,https://www.goal.com/en/news/jule-brand-germany-very-special-teenage-winger-trouble/bltb701bebbb1f7c6c0,Jule Brand: Germany’s ‘very special’ teenage winger ready to trouble Arsenal in the Women's Champions League,"There were 60 minutes on the clock when Jule Brand came on for her senior international debut for Germany back in April. Two minutes later, with her first four touches of the ball, she broke through the Australia defence and slotted home her first senior international goal. Two minutes after that, she was through again – this time squaring a perfectly-weighted pass for Laura Freigang to score Germany’s fourth. Voted Player of the Match for her efforts, when asked how she felt after the game, she did not have the words. “Simply indescribable,” Brand said. “To be honest, I still can't believe what happened today.” That dream debut proved to be confirmation of Brand's talent that had been shining in the Frauen-Bundesliga with Hoffenheim since the beginning of the 2020-21 season. Brand’s introduction to the first team at Hoffenheim came a few months earlier, during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany. Then-head coach Jurgen Ehrmann had spotted her in the Under-17s and U20s – the latter of whom play in the second tier of German women's football – and was impressed. “She already stood out with her long strides, but back then it all looked a bit stalky and not as harmonious as today,” Ehrmann tells GOAL. “But the talent could not be overlooked, which is why we wanted her at Hoffenheim. In the U20 team, it became more and more apparent that she has very special skills. “Jule's style of play has always been very light-hearted, and then in the 2. Liga she learned a lot in tackling. She was able to gain a sense of achievement, which also boosted her self-confidence. Her skills became more and more noticeable, her technique and her speed, also with the ball. “In the first lockdown, she trained with the Bundesliga team for the first time - at first, we were only allowed to do so in small groups and without physical contact. Then we noticed that she is technically good and very advanced for her age. That's how she came into our focus and then also trained regularly with the Bundesliga team."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: At just 17 years old, Brand would make her Frauen-Bundesliga debut from the bench in a 3-1 defeat to Turbine Potsdam. From there, Ehrmann slowly, but surely, continued to introduce her into team. By the end of the 2020-21 campaign, she had started 15 league games and registered four goals and six assists. She had also made her international debut and helped Hoffenheim secure Women’s Champions League football for the first time. ""She has become even more dynamic and has also improved physically,” Ehrmann says, asked about what exposure to the top level has done to Brand’s game. “You never know what she's going to do next in the match. She has incredible speed with and without the ball. Especially with the ball, she has developed this strength even more. She has a better understanding of the game and also made great progress in the tactical area."" It was only a matter of time until Germany head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg called Brand in for a camp. A handful of caps later and she was echoing Ehrmann’s thoughts. ""Jule sometimes doesn't even know what she can do yet,"" Voss-Tecklenburg said in November, after the winger scored once and assisted twice in Germany’s win over Turkey. ""She still has so much up her sleeve. If she stays healthy, we can look forward to a really, really great player in this German national team in the next few years."" It’s still less than 18 months since Brand made her first-team debut with Hoffenheim, but the way she has developed in that time has been excellent. She has already matched her goal tally this season in the league from last term, and has put her name on the scoresheet twice in the Champions League too. Exposure to big experiences like those in Europe will only aid her development. Despite Hoffenheim's defeat to Arsenal in October, many came out of the game singing her praises. As the German side face the difficult task of trying to secure a big win over the Gunners on Wednesday to qualify for the quarter-finals, the teenager will be key. Ehrmann believes there are areas where Brand can get even better – in her strength, her heading, her ability to use both feet – and given how he speaks of her character, there is little doubt she will apply herself to those tasks. “It's fun to coach her because you can see how much she enjoys it,” he adds. “She listens carefully and then tries to put it into practice. “She has always kept it fun. She plays with great joy. She is, nevertheless, very ambitious.” Combine that with her skillset, and Brand looks like she could achieve whatever her ambitions are in what is sure to be a wonderful career.

178,https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-bayern-s-chance-in-approach-to-williamson-s-importance/bltf01a1e2885df3294,From Bayern's change in approach to Williamson's importance at Arsenal: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"This week’s Women’s Champions League action produced the intriguing fixture quirk where teams faced each other for the second week in a row, resulting in some very interesting scorelines. Two sides picked up their first wins, Chelsea were almost held to a shock goalless draw by Swiss side Servette, while there were three heavyweight match-ups again: Real Madrid vs PSG, Bayern Munich vs Lyon and Wolfsburg vs Juventus. Here are five things we learned from matchday four of the UWCL... When Barcelona signed Fridolina Rolfo this summer, there were some eyebrows raised. That wasn’t because she doesn’t have the quality to play for the European champions – there is no doubt about that. It was more about where she would fit into this Barca team. After shining for Sweden on the left wing as they won silver at the Olympic Games, she was linking up with a squad that already had two excellent players in that position – Lieke Martens and Mariona Caldentey, both of whom ranked in this year’s GOAL50. As a result, Rolfo has often found herself playing at left-back but, on Wednesday against Hoffenheim, she was given the chance to play further forward and proved the star of the show, registering two assists in a 5-0 win. Barcelona may be well-stocked in attack but there is no doubt that both Rolfo and her team benefit when she is deployed in her preferred position. Last week, in the reverse game with Lyon, Bayern Munich were much more conservative than you’d perhaps expect from the German champions, who reached the last four of last season's Champions League. The fact that their first meeting was away from home clearly influenced the Bavarians' cautious game plan, but some were disappointed to see them play with less adventure than usual, given Bayern’s huge quality and Lyon's defensive issues. In Munich, though, Bayern's tactics were much more positive. They had more of the ball, they posed more problems for the seven-time European champions and, crucially, they got a big three points. After what some called a lucky run to the last four in 2020-21, this result showed that Bayern can take on the continent’s very best – when they really want to. Arsenal were rocked by the news this week that defender Leah Williamson has suffered a ""significant"" hamstring injury that has likely ruled her out for the rest of 2021. The Gunners have a lot of depth in that centre-back area. Simone Boye Sorensen, Jen Beattie and Lotte Wubben-Moy are all senior internationals in the position. Left-back Steph Catley has played there for Australia – and at a World Cup, no less – while Lia Waelti dropped back from holding midfield for the remaining half an hour in Wednesday’s game against Koege, a 3-0 win. But in that match against the bottom side in their Champions League group, Arsenal showed that they are not as defensively resolute when Williamson is missing. How they fare while she is sidelined could have a telling impact on their season. Going into the Champions League group stages, Group A was touted as the ‘group of death’, with last season’s runners-up Chelsea thrown in with two-time champions Wolfsburg and a raw but rapidly improving Juventus side. Such stiff competition has brought the best out of the Italians. Last week, Juve nicked a point off Wolfsburg in the dying minutes. On Thursday, they claimed all three in a 2-0 victory. That result leaves Wolfsburg third going into the final two matches and facing possible elimination. With seven goals conceded in four games so far, compared to 10 scored, it’s clear where there needs to be improvement for them to reclaim their spot at the summit of the game. One of the craziest stories in women’s football this week saw Barcelona’s treble-winning head coach, Lluis Cortes, appointed head coach of the Ukraine women’s national team. With the country having just placed a bid for the 2025 UEFA Women’s Euro, the hope is that his arrival will strengthen its case. Days later came the country’s first win in the Women’s Champions League group stages, as Kharkiv beat Icelandic side Breidablik. What was even more significant was that it put Ukraine ahead of Portugal in the race to bring two UWCL spots to its domestic league for the 2022-23 season. With a highly rated coach at the helm of the national team, two places in Europe possibly to become available domestically and the chance of hosting a major tournament on the table, it’s certainly worth keeping an eye on what is happening in Ukraine.

Having 14 players representing their countries at the Olympic Games in the summer might be a sign of just how talented the squad is, but it also created a huge problem in pre-season. With not a single fixture played, and seven new players to integrate, that lack of ideal preparation ultimately led to Wednesday’s premature UEFA Women’s Champions League exit, at the hands of a very good Real Madrid side who gave further evidencethat people should not be overlooking the Spanish league. “We didn’t do any games in pre-season and that was the situation we were in,” City head coach Gareth Taylor said after his team’s home defeat to the Spaniards, a 1-0 result going against the Women’s Super League side, who drew 1-1 in Madrid. “At the end of the day, our pre-season preparation wasn’t great and the Olympics probably hurt us more than most teams in terms of the return to training for most of the girls, but football is football. “If you don't defend in the right manner, and you don't take your chances at the other end of the pitch, you're always leaving yourself vulnerable like that. “I think it's a consideration, but this is the game, this is football and we need to be better than that. We’re really disappointed because we wanted to do better in this competition.” This was just City’s third game, full stop, since last season ended. They looked disjointed at times, like a team lacking that match sharpness, which was especially evident in the final third. ""Off the pace"";""timid in our challenges"";""quite a lot of second balls we didn't win or get to""– these were all quotes from Taylor's post-match press conference.  Throw in that the team were missing some big players through injury, particularly Lucy Bronze, perhaps the best right-back in the world, and Keira Walsh, their incredibly important deep-lying midfielder, and it’s been incredibly difficult. There was probably not a trickier draw they could have got for this Champions League tie, either. City’s issues should not take away from Real Madrid, who were the better team over two legs. This was a team missing a couple of key players themselves, with lots of new signings that needed to gel. But David Aznar’s tactics were spot on, even when it looked like this tie would not fall their way. In the first leg, they created chance after chance, even getting a penalty, but wouldn’t score until Kenti Robles’ brilliant stoppage time equaliser. In Manchester, they had a perfectly good goal ruled out for by a shocking offside decision, too. But a fortuitous deflection from Claudia Zornoza’s match-winning strike saw their luck level out. Before the game, Real’s Athenea del Castillo described qualification to the group stages as something the team had all “wanted since we were children”. 🤩 E Q U I P A Z O 🤩#HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/dq8p9OyKFp If this was a dream come true for the Spanish side, in just their second ever season as Real Madrid, then it was a nightmare turned reality for their opponents, who were quarter-finalists last season. While the Spaniards eagerly await the results of Thursday’s European ties, and then spend the build-up to Monday’s draw looking at who they could face in the groups, City will have to pick themselves up and focus on whatever positives they can. One of those will be that things will only be up from here, with players returning from injuries, new signings to come in and there being a game in just a few days’ time, at home to Tottenham on Sunday, for them to switch their focus to. The long-term focus will be very much on those WSL games, too. City have not won the league title since 2016. After starting the campaign with a 4-0 win over UWCL hopefuls Everton, they now have a slight advantage, with Chelsea and likely Arsenal, 3-0 up from their first leg against Slavia Prague, to be in Europe. “We need to look at it that way. That's the only way we can look at it,” Taylor said. ""Because that's obviously the big disappointment, because we wanted to be in this competition. “But we were put into a tough qualification process where we drew out the only other seeded team. Now, we face not being in Europe, so we have to focus on the domestic competitions.” It’s been far from ideal for City so far, and we are only three games into the new season. It’s down to them, though, whether they dwell on that disappointment or use it to fire them up for the remainder of the campaign. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Man City’s early season crisis continues with historic Arsenal defeat","When Arsenal’s substitutes were warming up at half time on Sunday night, it was almost as if they were gloating. Leading 2-0 at home to title rivals Manchester City andon their way to a crushing 5-0 victory, a two-time World Cup winner, Tobin Heath, the former record goalscorer in the Women’s Super League, Nikita Parris, and another World Cup winner, Mana Iwabuchi, were among those kicking a ball around the pitch at Borehamwood. On the other side of the halfway line, City had six substitutes, an ongoing injury crisis meaning they were unable to fill the bench with nine players. Not among those six, nor the starting line-up, was their captain, Steph Houghton, full-back Lucy Bronze or midfield lynchpin Keira Walsh, three of their most crucial players and personalities. It showed, too. Defensive errors characterised the heaviest defeat City have ever had as a professional team. Those Injuries,coupled with missing Olympians and late transfer window arrivals, had already impacted their pre-season preparations and contributed to their exit from the Women’s Champions League in the second qualifying round toReal Madrid. Katie McCabe makes it 3 for Arsenal!You'd have to say that's game over.Arsenal 3 - 0 Man City📺 Watch live on Sky Sports Football pic.twitter.com/KonhCy2N4l Now, with the injury list still consisting of eight big names, it may have led to their title race being over before it had begun. That may seem like an early statement to make, but this result at Arsenal followed a shocking, albeit controversial, defeat to a Tottenham teamthat finished six places and 35 points below City last season. If a team is to win the WSL title, it is imperative that they drop as few points as possible against those below them. After that loss, head coach Gareth Taylor said: “We need to be pretty flawless for the rest of the season.” Asked where defeat to the Gunners leaves them now, he said: “I don't know, I can't really focus on that. I think we need to start putting some wins on the board, no doubt about that. “I've spoken about this league and the need to be pretty flawless in the majority, but I think, apart from Arsenal and Spurs, everybody's dropped points. ""At the end of the day, we have to be concerned with what we do. We're not in a good moment, like I said, and we need to start putting some wins on the board.” The difficult moment that City find themselves is not only about injuries and a lack of match sharpness. It isalso about the understanding and chemistry in the team. On Sunday, Georgia Stanway, an attacking midfielder, played at right-back. In midfield, Laura Coombs filled the shoes of Walsh. Coombs showed her quality as a box-to-box midfielder last season, so much so that she won an England call-up. However, the deep-lying role is less suited to her strengths and, admittedly, completely new to her. This was a team of players that just was noton the same page at times, and injuries forcing them to have players in unfamiliar positions was never going to help. When forwards came deep for a short pass, those further back were playing a ball in behind. The defensive error for the first goal on Sunday also showed as much, too. Arsenal, on the other hand, have had quite the opposite start to their season and find themselves with highly contrasting fortunes. An early start to the season due to extra UWCL qualifiers has afforded them the matches to adapt to the style of their new head coach, Jonas Eidevall, while also gatheringmomentum. They have now won all seven of their competitive games this season, conceding two goals and scoring 26. The team is oozing with confidence, evident in their free-flowing football.  City looked quite the opposite on Sunday. After the second goal went in, there was an air of deflation. They have now lost three games in a row and there are big personalities missing to ensure heads do notdrop. Much can be said of City’s preparation for the season but, right now, moving forward, there is nothing much they can do other than try to get players back fit and hope that with games, that understanding will develop. They hit obstacles in the early stages of last season – losing to Chelsea after dropping points to Brighton. However, they went on to lose the title only narrowly to Chelsea in the end. Those setbacks were nowhere near as big as these, but it will at least give the team some positive experiences to draw on. “I'm always pretty comfortable that we'll arrive in the right moment,” Taylor said on Sunday, concluding his post-match press conference with an air of optimism. “We just hope that is not too late in the season.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The midfielder has faced constant criticism since joining Manchester United, with some pundits going as far as to question his character. He has joined a growing number of players, including Neymar and Marcus Rashford, to speak out about mental health issues. ""I've had depression in my career, but we don't talk about it,"" Pogba told Le Figaro. ""Sometimes you don't know you are, you just want to isolate yourself, be alone, these are unmistakable signs."" Besides dealing with persistent media pressure, Pogba was recently burgled while his children were at home. The incident has also had a negative effect on his well-being. ""I discover my home burglarized after the intrusion of three people who stole my safe,"" he said. ""There were jewels from my mother, my world champion medal. ""What scared me the most was that my two children were at home with the nanny during this incident. She overheard everything, called my wife and security, then locked herself in with the boys into a room. For several days, she was shocked. The main thing is that my children are well."" Pogba, of course, is known for having a huge personality and expressing himself on social media. Behind the scenes, though, his mental health has taken a hit and it has become difficult to tap into that infectious enthusiasm. Fortunately for the French star, he appears happy to be back on international duty this week. So happy to be back with the national team. The last few days obviously haven’t been easy after the burglary at my home and the Champions League exit, so it feels great to be reunited with my @equipedefrance family and concentrate on doing what I love again.

The duo have met up on international duty, with the World Cup winners set to play a part as Les Bleus take on Ivory Coast and South Africa in a pair of friendlies. Mbappe's future has been a hot topic for some time, and the forward's brief exchange with Pogba has only served to increase speculation that he will leave Paris in the summer. In a video clip on the French Football Federation website, which, after around 44 seconds, shows Mbappe and Pogba meeting up, the Manchester United midfielder and his team-mate say how it's good to see each other. Love to see the boys back together 🤩#FiersdetreBleus pic.twitter.com/KoO4zVpv6E After hugging Pogba, Mbappe then says in French, without English subtitles: ""I'm fed up."" Widely regarded as a future Ballon d'Or winner, Mbappe's position as one of the finest footballers on the planet is without question. PSG are once again romping their way to another Ligue 1 title, but suffered an all-too-familiar Champions League exit this season at the hands of Real Madrid. Mbappe wants his talent to be matched with club football's top prizes – something that continues to elude the French capital club despite the presence of the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar. The 23-year-old has made no secret of his desire to one day don the white shirt of Real Madrid, a club whose name is synonymous with European trophies. And while there is still hope within the PSG ranks that Mbappe – who is heading towards free agency this summer – will sign a contract extension, it is widely believed that he will instead make a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. Indeed, Los Blancos already tried to sign the striker in the summer transfer window last year to no avail, but they will not have to face resistance once Mbappe's contract in Paris runs out at the end of the season.

Pogba has spent the last six years of his career at Old Trafford, having re-signed for United from Juventus in a club record £89 million ($116m) deal in 2016. The Frenchman has only been able to land Europa League and Carabao Cup winners' medals during that period as he's struggled for form and fitness, and speculation over his future is now raging as he enters the final months of his contract. Meddy, who is in charge of keeping Pogba in peak physical condition, cannot see the midfielder signing a new deal in Manchester and thinks the time has come for him to move onto pastures new. ""At the end of June he will no longer be a Manchester [United] player,"" The celebrity trainer has told Il Bianconero: ""I think it is right for him to look elsewhere, perhaps Manchester also wants to renew themselves and the most sensible thing is to separate. ""The time will come to change and try new challenges, new emotions, new environments for both Pogba and Manchester, to try something different and maybe they will both be happy. ""Right now, I think he's enjoying himself, they have a good team, especially since [Cristiano] Ronaldo decided to return. The problem is that the results don't come. A top player doesn't waste his time on minor competitions, he wants to be motivated to play for ambitious trophies."" Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are both reportedly interested in signing Pogba if he becomes a free agent, but Juve are also in the mix. In fact, a return to Turin has been mooted as the most likely move for the 28-year-old, with it reported that his representatives have already started talks with the Italian giants. A renewal with United is still an option for Pogba too, but a man who has recorded one goal and nine assists in 22 games for the club this season has yet to show any indication he wants to stay. Red Devils interim boss Ralf Rangnick suggested he may now be playing to earn a transfer to another big club in January, telling reporters: ""He wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be and even if it's only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that.""

Pogba has not played for United since a Champions League match against Atalanta on November 2, having picked up a serious groin injury a week later while on international duty with France. But United boss Ralf Rangnick trusted Pogba to start against the Championship outfit in their fourth-round clash at Old Trafford. Asked by ITV Sport prior to the match if Pogba was ready to go, Rangnick replied: ""Yes, otherwise he wouldn't be in the starting XI. [I'm] looking forward to seeing him on the pitch. ""He needs game time as often as possible. He has been out for more than two months."" With Pogba making his return to the pitch, the 28-year-old could now be entering the final few months of his time playing for Manchester United. The France star's contract expires at the end of the season, with no extension appearing to be close. Pogba has been linked with a move to Spain with Real Madrid or Barcelona, as well as a switch back to his former side Juventus, or back to his home country with PSG.

Pogba has lined up against some of the finest talent on the planet over the course of a distinguished career that has seen spells at Old Trafford and Juventus as well as 89 appearances for Les Bleus. He is a big fan of fellow countryman N’Golo Kante, who remains a direct rival at club level with Chelsea, but he considers Germany international Emre Can – now at Borussia Dortmund after previously turning out for Liverpool and Juve – to be his most fearsome foe. Asked by Joe to pick out his toughest Premier League opponent, Pogba said: “Emre Can, yeah. Obviously, N'Golo and everything, but one day I remember I had a big battle with Emre Can. ""With Kante, you pass him and you think there’s another N'Golo because he comes back so fast.” While Can has posed Pogba problems in the past, the Frenchman has never ended up on the losing side against his German rival. The pair have lined up on opposing sides in five fixtures, with some memorable tussles taking place. Pogba has tended to come out on top and still boasts an unbeaten record.

His comments came after Pogba was among three Red Devils players dropped from the starting line-up on Tuesday against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16. Desailly acknowledged that Pogba could succeed in more advanced positions, but said there wasn't a place for him there in the Manchester United team right now. ""Quality-wise, you cannot compare Pogba to Fred or [Scott] McTominay or [Nemanja] Matic,"" Desailly said on beIN SPORTS. ""But he's lazy, he cheats a little bit and doesn't help with the midfield defensively. ""When he goes well, then he's fantastic. When he doesn't go well, offensively he hasn't gone to what everyone was expecting, and at the same time he will cheat a little bit and not drop back."" Pogba was sacrificed in the starting line-up as Bruno Fernandes made his return from illness. Manager Ralf Rangnick also prefered Fred and McTominay in the deeper midfield positions. There has long been a narrative that Pogba doesn't work hard enough, though part of that may be down to his silky style of play as he makes things appear effortless on the pitch even when playing well. The midfielder has been a key creator for the Red Devils in the Premier League this season, amassing nine assists in just 16 appearances.

187,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiellini-signs-new-juventus-contract/1pbs6lhkiefpo1jo6njblqcz0w,Chiellini signs new Juventus contract,"Giorgio Chiellini has signed a two-year contract at Juventus. The centre-back became a free agent this summer when his contract with the Serie A giants expired. But the Turin club have confirmed that the Italy international will still be part of the team next season, signing a deal that runs until 2023. “In the end the signing was a formality, because as soon as I knew that my body would allow me to continue playing, there was always the will of both parties to continue together,"" Chiellini told the club's media channel. ""It was just the timing of various situations that delayed this signing. “The very close relationship between myself and Juventus goes beyond everything else. I had absolutely no doubts that I would remain here.” The Bianconeri captain joined the club friom Fiorentina in 2005. He has made 535 competitive appearances for the club, winning nine Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia five times along the way. But Chiellini played a limited role for the team last season as injuries reduced him to just 17 Serie A matches. However, he recovered in time to take on an integral part in Italy's Euro 2020 campaign. He played in five matches in the competition as the Azzurri went on to win the trophy.

188,https://www.goal.com/en/news/it-wouldve-been-better-if-ronaldo-had-left-earlier-chiellini/r7lbv7t0p8uk190pr03p39keh,‘It would’ve been better if Ronaldo had left earlier’ – Chiellini admits Juventus ‘paid’ for Man Utd transfer,"Giorgio Chiellini admits that Juventus “paid” for the “shock” of allowing Cristiano Ronaldo to leave for Manchester United late in the summer transfer window, with the veteran defender conceding that he would have been better for all concerned if the Portuguese had “left earlier”. A change of scenery for a five-time Ballon d’Or winner was mooted long before a stunning agreement was put in place that freed a 36-year-old icon to retrace his steps to Old Trafford. There were, however, just a few days left for Juve to get a suitable replacement on board when the Red Devils swooped in, with Serie A heavyweights stumbling out of the blocks in 2021-22 after seeing a talismanic presence removed from their ranks. Long-serving defender Chiellini has told DAZN of Ronaldo’s decision to leave, which did come as a massive surprise to those in Turin: “We had arrived at a point in our relationship where Cristiano needed new goals and a team that would play for him, because when he finds a team like that he is decisive. He is proving it in these months and he has also shown it with us. “Here at Juventus, a programme of rejuvenation and restarting was born. If Ronaldo had stayed, he would have been an added value, but it is normal that he thought more about the present than the future. “Ronaldo left on August 28, it would have been better for us if he had left earlier. We paid something for it, a little bit of a shock, we paid something for it in terms of points. If he had left earlier we would have had time to prepare better.”  Juve went winless through their opening four Serie A games this season, but have now emerged victorious in their last seven matches across all competitions. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has continued to maintain remarkable individual standards at Manchester United. The Red Devils are still searching for consistency as a collective, but their No.7 has hit six goals through eight appearances – including a couple of dramatic late winners in Champions League action. The most recent came in a thrilling 3-2 victory over Atalanta, with Paul Pogba among those left singing the praises of an all-time great at the final whistle. He has told UEFA’s official website: “Cristiano is Cristiano. It’s just a Cristiano thing that he did. It’s like deja vu. “You’re speaking about Cristiano Ronaldo. Everybody knows. I don’t need to say anything. Everybody knows he’s here. “He’s a world champion and won the Ballon d’Or for how many years? He’s the best in the world for how many years, so what can you say about him? Just respect. He shows it on the pitch. That’s it.” United will be back in domestic action on Sunday when they play host to old adversaries Liverpool, while Chiellini and Juventus face a heavyweight encounter on the same day as they travel to defending Italian champions Inter.

189,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiellinis-back-italys-old-warrior-returns-to-wembley-for/11j1ke7bq8yv0107d3i6z2yt8z,Chiellini's back! Italy's greatest warrior returns to Wembley for one final battle with England,"Giorgio Chiellini is back. Back to his best. And back at Wembley to face England. He was there, remember, when the new Wembley opened, on March 24, 2007,  with a 3-3 draw between England's Under-21s and their Italian counterparts. Truth be told, he didn't have the best game, arguably at fault for the hosts' second goal, when he failed to cut out a ball from Matt Derbyshire for Wayne Routledge. But even by that point, he had already shown everyone what he was all about. During the first half, he had been left with blood streaming down his face after being struck by a stray boot. It remains one of the defining images of his career, as there was never any chance of him going off. His head was bandaged up and he promptly returned to the field.It was clear the man was a warrior, fully committed to the cause. He was a different player back then, of course, a powerful left-back who liked to get forward. That was perhaps unsurprising. He doesn't like to admit it now as a symbol of Juventus but  Chiellini had supported AC Milan when he was a kid, and he idolised Paolo Maldini. In truth, though, he neither looked nor played anything like the outrageously elegant Maldini.But Chiellini could never have beencharacterised as a mere brute. You don't spend 15 years at the topwithout being smart and Chiellini is one of the most intelligent players in the game, in every sense. A fluent English speaker, Chiellini earned a degree in economics and commerce, before securing a master's in business administration, in 2017. He has proven an expert in managing his career too.  As former Juventus coach Fabio Capello pointed out, when Chiellini started to lose some of his pace, he honed his skills as a central defender and formed one third of Juve's legendary 'BBC' backline alongside Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli. He did that by being cleverer in his movement; after all, such remarkablelongevity can't merely be attributed to the kind of impressive physical strength that prompted man-mountain Zlatan Ibrahimovic to call Chiellini his toughest-ever opponent. Chiellini, of course, has long played up to his persona. After celebrating a crucial Turin derby goal for Juventus by ferociously beating his chest, he embraced his 'King Kong' nickname. He didn't just make life a nightmare for opposition forwards either; he tormented his own team-mates in training, with Juve centre-forward Alvaro Morata famously telling  El Pais  that going up against Chiellini was ""like being put in a cage with a gorilla and you have to steal his food"". That kind of tenacity eventually takes its toll, though, and Chiellini has begun to feature less and less for Juve over the past year. The arrival of former Ajax sensation Matthijs de Ligt was always likely to allow the Bianconeri to rotate their backline more and more, but it was concerning to see Chiellini being repeatedly sidelined by niggling injuries. Tellingly, though, Italy boss Roberto Mancini didn't even want to entertain the idea of leaving the veteran defender out of his Euro 2020 squad. ""He doesn't need to be evaluated,""  he told the  Gazzetta dello Sport  in January. ""All that matters is that he gets back playing and is fine. ""For us, Chiellini is fundamental, also as a point of reference in the dressing room for a young squad.And the moment he steps on the field, you already know that he will give everything."" That was obvious to anyone at Wembley back in 2007. Of course, his next appearance at the home of English football will be even more physically challenging; a far greater test of his mix of endurance and intelligence.   England may not be the most free-flowing, dynamic team in world football (""They're not easy on the eye,"" as Chiellini puts it) but they do boast a plethora of fast young forwards. The likes of Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka could cause the 36-year-old Chiellini all sorts of problems with their pace and movement. Remember, Chiellini has already missed two games at the Euros through injury and former Milan boss Arrigo Sacchi felt he saw some worrying signs of fatigue during Tuesday's draining semi-final win over Spain. That would be wholly understandable, of course. Time is undoubtedly catching up with Chiellini but he's clearly still enjoying the race. His mood throughout the tournament has been remarkably relaxed, almost jubilant, as he makes the most of what is expected to be his last tournament at international level. Italy's captain has playfully compared himself to Lionel Messi, as they're both left-footed and both presently out of contract,and mischievously labelled Spain skipper Jordi Alba ""a liar"" during their minor dispute over the victor of Tuesday's coin toss. His body may be starting to betray him but his mind remains as sharp as ever. He's still the master of mind games, still dispensing lessons in the dark arts. And he remains a formidable centre-back. He proved that by containing Romelu Lukaku in the epic quarter-final win over Belgium. On that night in Munich, Chiellini utterly vindicated Mancini's decision to recall him even though Francesco Acerbi had deputised wonderfully well for him, against Wales and Austria. Then again, we shouldn't have been surprised by Chiellini'scomposure and concentration in such a high-pressure encounter. He has always said that, as far as he is concerned, ""the most beautiful part of the game"" is the first whistle, because after that, everything else goes away, all of the pressure and the tension disappears. ""You don't feel anything,"" he says, ""and only think about playing."" That fearless focus is why he's still playing at this level a month shy of his 37th birthday. It'swhy he'sback at Wembley. And it's why he will be willing to spill blood again. Italy's greatest warrior is going torelish every second of this final battle. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

190,https://www.goal.com/en/news/italy-world-cup-failure-mess-of-their-own-making/blt28d373cb25a6b3ac,'Stuck 60 years in the past' - Italy's World Cup failure a mess all of their own making,"When Giorgio Chiellini appeared for his post-match interview, the camera crew gave him a stool to sit on. He'd only played six minutes but he looked like he needed it. Chiellini was, by his own admission, ""destroyed"". Italy had just failed to qualify for a second consecutive World Cup for the first time in the nation's history, their hopes of playing in Qatar 2022 ended by a humiliating 1-0 loss at home to North Macedonia. ""There's just a great disappointment but we need to start over,"" he told RAI.""But right now it's difficult to even talk about it. There's going to be a great void."" How had this happened, though? How had the reigning European champions failed to qualify for Qatar, eliminated by the 67th-ranked team in the world? Chiellini struggled to find the right words, admitting, ""It's inexplicable."" There were several reasons, though, chief among them Italy's inability to score goals. Did they deserve to lose on the night? Hardly; they dominated possession and had 32 shots to North Macedonia's four – the expected goals [xG] ratio was 2.43 to 0.16 in Italy's favour yet Aleksandar Trajkovski decided the play-off semi-final with a 92nd-minute winner from distance. It was cruel but, as Chiellini conceded, you always end up paying for mistakes at the highest level, and the Azzurri's attack ran up quite the bill in Palermo. NORTH MACEDONIA IN THE 92ND MINUTE! 🇲🇰ITALY AREN'T GOING TO THE 2022 WORLD CUP 🤯 pic.twitter.com/S0N7rsI0R4 Domenico Berardi missed what was essentially an open goal, presented to him by an awful error from North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski. At least Berardi had been one of Italy's brighter players, though. His fellow forwards had performed pathetically. Ciro Immobile may be a Lazio legend but he has never managed to transfer his prolific record at club level to the international arena and some have already suggested that he never play for the Azzurri again. The 32-year-old certainly looked too slow and too cumbersome for the highest level. Shortly before his 77th-minute withdrawal, he set off after an inviting through-ball and yet somehow managed to end up further away from the goal than when he'd started his run. By that stage, the diminutive Lorenzo Insigne, who incredibly seemed to shrink in stature on the night, had already been taken off after a painfully ineffective performance. There remains, of course, a wonderful sense of togetherness within Roberto Mancini's squad; it was this unity, combined with the coach's atypically adventurous approach, which enabled the Azzurri to triumph at Euro 2020. So, it was no surprise to hear so many players attempt to deflect the focus away from the misfiring forwards. Jorginho, for example, was quick to acknowledge that if he'd scored either of his penalties in the home-and-away draws with Switzerland in the group stage, Italy wouldn't have even ended up in the play-offs. ""I do still think about those misses,"" the teary-eyed midfielder told RAI. ""It will haunt me for the rest of my life."" Jorginho 💔 pic.twitter.com/9oQgtoNzns Italy's World Cup elimination, though, wasn't about one particular player; this was a collective failure, one that extends well beyond what happened in Palermo. Chiellini pointed out that the players paid the price for mistakes made in previous matches, but they're also counting the cost of years of mismanagement at the very highest level. ""We're reaping what we sowed,"" as coaching legend Arrigo Sacchi told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""We talk a lot, but you don't resolve problems with only words."" Action is clearly required, as there is clearly something wrong with the production line. This is a nation that once brought Alessando Del Piero, Roberto Baggio, Filippo Inzaghi, Christian Vieri and Enrico Chiesa to the same World Cup. On Thursday night, in their desperate search for a goal, they brought the recently naturalised Joao Pedro off the bench for his international debut. The Cagliari striker hadn't even scored in Serie A for two months! There is no more damning indictment of the Italian game, which has been underperforming at both club and international level for more than a decade. Remember, it's not just that they haven't qualified for the past two World Cups; they haven't even made the knockout stage since winning the tournament in 2006, having failed to get out of their group in both 2010 and 2014. In that context, Italy's Euro 2020 triumph cannot be framed as anything other than a beautiful anomaly, one made all the more unbelievable by Serie A's struggles to remain relevant in continental competition. No Italian team has won a major European triumph since Jose Mourinho's Inter lifted the Champions League in 2010. Furthermore, just like last year, Serie A won't even have a single representative in the quarter-finals of the game's premier club cup competition. Financial disparity is often put forward as an excuse for such underperformance. Italian clubs aren't backed by oil states or boosted by gargantuan TV rights deals like the Premier League – so, the argument goes, how can they possibly compete with the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain? But the failings of the biggest Italian clubs cannot be excused. After all, Atalanta, with their tiny budget but fantastic scouting network, remain Serie A's last Champions League quarter-finalists, in 2020. By contrast, Juve, the tenth-highest revenue earners in Europe, have bowed in the last 16 for the past three years. The playing field in European football has undoubtedly been skewed by money but, again, the Italian game really only has itself to blame for falling behind. The golden years are long gone, because of incompetence, corruption, gross financial mismanagement and a devastating lack of foresight, leaving Serie A sides scrambling around trying to make up lost ground by whatever means necessary. Most top-flight stadia are a disgrace, literally falling apart, yet Italian bureaucracy makes renovation or the construction of a new home almost possible. It's a turn-off for fans. Go online and you'll actually see heated arguments over the standard of the toilets at the likes of the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Is it any wonder, then, that the grounds are so rarely full? And empty arenas do not make for good television. Say what you will about the Premier League – and there is plenty to say about the way in which many of its teams make their money – but it was, and still is, masterfully marketed. Serie A is anything but, with the organisers doing a woeful job of promoting their product. The league's supposedly English-language Twitter handle has become a figure of ridicule, a microcosm of the Italian game's inability to appeal to a larger audience. There needs to be a complete change of mindset, from top to bottom, because it's clear that the old ways are no longer working. ""Italian football suffers from cultural backwardness,"" Sacchi said. ""There are no new ideas. Other nations are evolving but we are stuck 60 years in the past. ""I’ll say it clearly: the least culpable for this situation are the players and the coach. The problem here is institutional."" One of Sacchi's principal gripes is with the amount of foreign players in Serie A academies and it's certainly concerning that, as Italian Football Federation (FIGC) chief Gabriele Gravina pointed out, ""only around 30 per cent of youth-team players are Italian"". However, as Gravina acknowledged, that wouldn't be quite so big a problem if the top talents were getting game time in the senior squads, but they're not, with forwards finding it particularly to make the breakthrough at big clubs. It's been this way for years, though, so it's no wonder that Mancini's matchday squad for North Macedonia didn't contain a single attacker from AC Milan, Juventus or Inter – Serie A's superpowers. Mancini has been criticised for keeping faith with those that served him so well at the Euros, but that was hardly surprising. It would have been a bold approach to gamble on younger players who are playing so infrequently in Serie A, given he gets so little time to work with them anyway. Indeed, it's worth noting that the league rejected Mancini's proposal to postpone the final round of fixtures just before the international break, meaning he was left with just one full day to prepare his players for a World Cup play-off. There is no better example of the self-destructive nature of the Italian game. The issue was raised afterward the game in Palermo and Gravina said while the lack of preparation ""didn't help"" and that the top Serie A sides see the national team as a ""nuisance"", he didn't want to ""cause controversy"" by discussing the matter any further. Not for now, at least. But it's clear that a new approach is required; both reform and renewal utterly essential. And Gravina, who's been at the helm of the FIGC for nearly four years, cannot shirk his responsibility for this catastrophe. He and his organisation have spoken a lot about problems yet done very little to resolve them. Italy failed to embrace change after the 2017 play-off loss to Sweden; the same mistake cannot be allowed to happen again. Investment must be made in every sector of the game, and inspiration taken from the way in which France, Germany, Spain and England have all previously overhauled their youth programmes after crushing international disappointment. However, after such a devastating defeat in Palermo, it was difficult for anyone to look too far ahead, least of all Mancini. He understandably couldn't quite work out how, in less than a year, he'd gone from the greatest night of his coaching career, to its worst. Gravina, Chiellini and others urged him to stay on to oversee the rebuilding job, but the coach would only say ""The disappointment is too big right now to talk about the future."" Indeed, for now, there is only ""a great void"". Where a World Cup place should have been. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

McKennie has been sidelined since late February due to a serious foot issue which was initally expected to rule him out of action until the end of the season. The 23-year-old has been progressing well with his recovery though, and Allegri is hopeful he can get back on the pitch for Juve's Serie A run-in. The Bianconeri boss delievered a positive update on McKennie ahead of his side's trip to Cagliari on Saturday. ""We hope to have McKennie back for the beginning of May,"" Allegri told reporters. ""Where there's at least four or five matches left."" Mckennie appeared in 28 games across all competitions for Juve before fracturing two metatarsal bones, scoring four goals. The United States international knuckled down and proved his worth after being linked with a transfer last summer, and his imminent return could prove crucial for Juve as they continue to fight for Champions League qualification. The Bianconeri are sitting fourth in Serie A at the moment on 59 points, five ahead of fifth-placed Roma with only seven games remaining. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Vlahovic joined Juventus in January after an impressive spell at Fiorentina, having scored 49 goals in 108 appearances for La Viola in all competitions. The Serbia international is off to a strong start in Turin, netting five times in 12 matches to justify the Bianconeri's €75 million (£63m/$82m) investment in his talents. The 22-year-old's performances for the Serie A giants have invited comparisons to Bayern Munich and Poland sensation Lewandowski, and Ribery sees some similarities. ""Robert is someone who works a lot and well every day,"" the Salernitana star, who played alongside Lewandowski at Allianz Arena earlier in his career, said to Tuttosport. ""Behind his goals there is talent but also a lot of professionalism. ""He is a robot, it is no coincidence that he scored a lot in the past with me and Robben and continues to do so now. He is a champion and in 2021 he deserved to win the Ballon d'Or."" Pressed on the specific qualities he believes that Lewandowski and Vlahovic share, Ribery said: ""Surely strength and mentality. ""Like all champions he is a hard worker and never gives up. He must continue to train like this with the idea of ​​improving every day. ""Dusan is young but has great means: he must get used to the pressures of Juventus, a top club where you have to win every match."" Vlahovic is not the only attacker creating headlines for his ability to find the net. Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland and Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe are seen as the most promising forwards around at the moment and are wanted by all of Europe's top teams. Asked for his favourite between Vlahovic, Haaland and Mbappe, Ribery suggested the France star is the one who stands out most. ""They are different forwards, especially Mbappé compared to the other two, but all very strong,"" he said. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Trippier moved to Atletico from Tottenham in 2019 and spent two and a half seasons in La Liga before returning to the Premier League with Newcastle United at the start of the year. Simeone has received criticism in some circles for his apparently negative style of play, but his former charge is still a huge admirer of the Argentine. ""I loved playing for Simeone and thriving off defending,"" Trippier told BT Sport ahead of Atletico's Champions League quarter-final decider against Manchester City on Wednesday. ""I improved massively playing for him. He is a special guy. Many people watch the odd game, but in La Liga they play totally different football. ""Against the top teams you need to be more defensive minded. It's not fair talking about the dark arts and him. When we used to play Liverpool and Chelsea he would tell us to get in their faces and wind them up. They want to wind players up. ""From minute one he will be asking for yellow cards from the touchline and the players will be winding up others. He wants players to get around the ref. Savic will be the big one tonight, he will be in Man City's faces."" Already an established England international - and Champions League finalist - during his time with Tottenham, Trippier's move to Atletico Madrid helped take him to another level under Simeone's astute guidance. The full-back made 86 appearances in all competitions and proved a key part of the team that beat out Real Madrid and Barcelona to take the 2020-21 Liga title, the Argentine's second with the Colchoneros.

The 36-year-old, who remains club captain at the Etihad Stadium, has been on the books of the reigning Premier League champions since 2013. He has taken in 373 appearances, while winning 12 trophies, but has slipped down the pecking order this season and plans to head back to his roots once reaching free agency in the summer – with GOAL learning that Athletico Paranaense are planning on putting an offer on the table. Fernandinho told reporters when quizzed on his future intentions ahead of a Champions League quarter-final second leg encounter with Atletico Madrid: “I want to play regularly. I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important for me."" Fernandinho has announced he will leave Manchester City at the end of the season after nine years at the club.With 11 major trophies to his name, he leaves as a club legend 💙 pic.twitter.com/U0Fdh7NwIh While Fernandinho is convinced that he is making the right decision, he is seemingly yet to inform everybody around him at Man City about what is going on. Even boss Guardiola claimed to have been left in the dark - asked for his reaction to Fernandinho’s decision, Guardiola said: “Oh. I didn't know. You give me the news. I didn't hear it. We will see what happens. I don't know what will happen. He is so important. I'll ask him. “At the end of the season we talk, maybe it's because of his family. I would love it [if he stayed]. We will talk. “The role he plays this season, I like the people who behave behind the scenes. I know what he has done, behind me, he handles many of our players and stars for the benefit of the team. “I praise him and he was here when I arrive. Raheem [Sterling], Kevin [De Bruyne], John [Stones], a few players. We know him well, from day one to now always here. “An incredible player for Man City. There are things nobody knows but I know exactly.” If Fernandinho is to depart this summer, then City will hope to send him off with more medals added to his collection as they continue to chase down Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League honours in 2022. However, he may not be leaving just yet, as the veteran indicated he is still totally committed to Man City and is still open to talks with the club when the season ends. He wrote on social media after the press conference: ""I was 100 per cent honest and spontaneous in answering that question, but anyone who knows me also knows that my greatest honesty is with Man City and my duties as team captain. ""My focus is on winning all the titles we are playing for and I will only talk about my future at the end of the season. Let’s keep pushing!"" I was 100% honest and spontaneous in answering that question at today's press conference. But anyone who knows me also knows that my greatest honesty is with Man City and my duties as team captain.

French keeper Maignan, who helped Lille dethrone PSG as champions of France, will move to San Siro this summer and serve as Milan's new No.1. He arrives after it was confirmed on Wednesdaythat Donnarumma will not sign a new contract with Milan, the Italian stopper instead departing on a free transfer. Milan confirmed in a statement on their website that Maignan will sign a five-year contract with the Serie A giants, beginning on July 1, and that he will wear No.16. The fee for Maignan, who had 12 months left on his contract in France, has not been disclosed, although it has been reported as being in the region of€15 million (£13m/$18m). The former PSG youth goalkeeper, who was born in French Guiana and has a single senior cap for France, joined Lille in 2015 and was essential to their rise- with 180 appearances across six seasons - to become Ligue 1 champions this season, for the first time in a decade. In 2020-21, he played 48 times for Lille in all competitions, conceding only 38 goals and keeping 23 clean sheets. Maignan, 25, will serve as back-up to Hugo Lloris for the French side at this summer's European Championship, and is considered the most likely candidate to be his country's long-term No.1 once the Spurs keepersteps aside.  The Rossoneri were in the market for a new No1 aftertechnical director Paolo Maldiniconfirmed on Wednesday that Donnarumma will leave the club this summer as a free agent. Donnarumma, now 22, made his Milan debut at age 16 and has established himself as one of the top young goalkeepers in world football after serving as Milan's starter for the past six seasons. He made more than 250 first-team appearances for AC Milan and has 25 senior caps for Italy, with the likes ofChelsea, Juventus and Barcelona having been linked with signing him on a free transfer.

196,https://www.goal.com/en/news/raiola-donnarumma-leaving-milan-psg-super-agent-italy/121af0l9mp1il16fu72s7vorsj,Don't blame Raiola for Donnarumma leaving Milan for PSG: Super-agent got Italy star exactly what he wanted,"Gianluigi Donnarumma will not be able to get the squad number he wants at Paris Saint-Germain.Mino Raiola, though, has already secured the one that really counts. Indeed, the news that Donnarumma will be unable to wear his preferred No.99 jersey atParc des Princes means nothing in the grand scheme of things. What matters is that PSG have agreed to pay Donnarumma the €12 million (£10.3/$14.6m) yearly salary thatself-styled 'super-agent' Raiola was seeking all along, making it quite the week for the 53-year-old. Indeed,it began with him revealing revealedthat his ""lawyers have already taken action"" against the makers of Report,the RAI 3 investigative programme aired on Monday night, which features Raiola as a protagonist. ""It is shameful that State television, using public money, should create false news,” Raiolatold the Corriere dello Sport. ""RAI ought to guarantee serious journalism. Instead, they senta journalist to Malta who said a lot of false things and was unable to find the right address of my office. ""This error is unforgivablebecause it casts a shadow over my reputation."" Raiola, of course, has never previously shown much concern for how he is perceived within the football industry.He appears to have no issue with his reputation; if anything, he revels in it. Dutch journalist Thijs Slegers famously once described Raiola as ""a mafioso"" to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who pointed out in his autobiography, ""The guy wasn't actually a mafioso. [Raiola] just looked and acted like one... He was completely fearless and prepared to pull any number of tricks."" Which was exactly what the then-Ajax attacker was looking for in an agent.""I didn't want another nice guy,"" Ibrahimovicwrote. ""I wanted to be transferred and to get a good contract."" And Raiola has always delivered in that regard, which is why the much-travelled Ibrahimovic remains just one of several high-profile footballers on his client list.  Whatever one thinks about him, Raiola usually forms long and lasting bonds with his players.And his relationship with Donnarumma appears to be no different. In Italy, there has been a predictable attempt to portray Raiola as the bad guy in the goalkeeper's decision to leave AC Milan and join PSGon a free transfer, the work of an avaricious agent who has led another young client astray. After all, the 22-year-old Donnarumma was a Rossoneri fan as a child and had been their first-choice shot-stopper since the age of 16.Before the season began, coach Stefano Pioli had even admitted that he could not""imagine Milan without Donnarumma"". However, one-club men are now a thing of the past in football. Milan's technical director, Paolo Maldini, spent the entirety of his glorious playing career at San Siro, but when confirming that Donnarumma would notbe extending his contract with the club, the defensive icon stated, ""It is increasingly difficult to start a career in one place and finish it there. ""We must thank those who gave so much for Milan and Gigio did that, without ever disrespecting the club. Our paths divide here and I can only wish him the best."" Many Milan fans have been less magnanimous after admitting defeat in their efforts to persuade 'Super Gigio'to remain a Rossonero. Before the monumental top-four showdown with Juventus at the tail end of the season, a group of ultrashad even turned up at Milanello and pleaded with Donnarumma to stay at San Siro. The Italy international reassured them that reports of a move to Juvewere false, explaining that he had yet to make a decision on his future and tearfully insisting that he wished to remain a Rossonero. At the stage, the hope was that if Milan secured a return to the Champions League for the first time since 2014, Donnarumma would sign a renewal. But this was never about football, it was all about finance. Contract extensions are just a numbers game these days and if they do notadd up, a player joins another club. In Donnarumma's case, he was on €6m (£5.1m/$7.3m) a season at San Siro. Raiola wanted double that for his client, as well as a reported €20m (£17m/$24m) commission.   Milan were never going to agree to such figures. Since taking charge of the club, after former owners Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux defaulted on loan repayments, Elliott Management have been running the club as prudently as possible. The fallen giants jumped at the opportunity to be a part of the proposed European Super League, as it would have instantaneously catapulted them back to the summit of the game.However, thanks to Maldini's shrewd signings and Pioli's clever coaching, Milan have been slowly but surely working their way back to the top anyway, as underlined by this season's third-placefinish in Serie A. Donnarumma played a pivotal role, of course. He was named the league's best goalkeeper for the 2020-21 campaign, but there was always a chance that it would be his last at the Giuseppe Meazza. Truth be told, it isprobably a surprise he stayed this long. From the moment he made his Serie A debut, Donnarummahas been the subject of almost-annual transfer talk and many Milan fans have long since grown weary ofRaiola's antics. During one of manyprevious contractual disputes, he conducted a bizarre press conference in his kitchen in Monte Carlo and accused Milan of bullying his client, as well as creating a hostile atmosphere that resulted in Donnarumma receiving death threats. Those claims were never substantiated, but both Donnarumma and his family have, at various times, been subjected to vitriolic abuse.He has been nicknamed 'Dollarumma', had fake bank notes thrown at him and even reduced to tears by a banner at San Siro. However, throughout all of the controversy, Donnarumma's relationship with Raiola has, crucially, never wavered. Before Italy's clash with Germany in Poland, the Rossonerifans in attendance unfurled a banner which read, ""If you have Milan in your heart, leave your agent.""And there was talk at the time that Donnarumma was considering followingthat advice. However, he eventually responded to the rumours by tweeting: ""#Donnarumma #Raiola Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow!""And that unbreakable bond really is the crux of the issue here.   The press have played a part in propagating the idea that Raiola is controlling Donnarumma.AGazzetta dello Sporteditorial on his Milan exit opened with the causticline, ""Ciao, Gigio, go wherever Mino takes you."" But the fact of the matter is that Raiola works for Donnarumma –and not the other way around.It is Donnarumma who is calling the shots here. Ifhe were unhappy with the job Raiola was doing, he would fire him. As Milan CEO Ivan Gazidis told the Gazzetta: ""I don't know the boundaries of the relationship between Gigio and Raiola but, ultimately, of course, the decision is always the player's...He did what he thought was best for him."" And Milan have done what isbest for them, by refusing to give in to Raiola's exorbitant demands. They made Donnarumma a very fair offer of a25 per cent pay rise (€8m a year) and it was rejected. It really is as simple as that. Funnily enough, Ibrahimovic has expressed his incredulityat his former team-mate's departure, arguing, ""He could have been Milan's goalkeeper for 20 years. He could have become 'Mr. Milan', like Maldini. What value could be given to Maldini? It's immeasurable. He added during an interview withGazzetta: ""What is 'earning too much'? Everything has its price. It depends on how much you need the player. The value is determined by the market."" And Ibra is right, of course: the market is always decisive. But it haschanged. Because of the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, many elite clubs are no longer in a position to pay ridiculous salaries, making Donnarumma's exit inevitable, particularly as Milan already had an excellent replacement lined up, in Lille's Mike Maignan. Of course, there is no way of portraying the loss of a generational talent like Donnarumma in a favourable light.We are talking about Gigi Buffon's heir,Italy's No.1 atEuro 2020. But this was Donnarumma's decision at the end of the day.Just as it was Donnarumma's decision to both hire and stick with Raiola through incessant criticism. He has always acted professionally and was perfectly entitled to leave Milan for nothing. But hemay never shake the 'Dollarumma' nickname in Italy. He may not care.Just like Ibra all those years ago, Donnarummagot transferred and got a good contract.And he has Raiola to thank for that. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

It appearsunlikely that Milan will be able tosecure the 21-year-old on a deal that would cut all ties with Madrid. It's more likely that Diaz would join Milan on another loan, or Madrid would sell the Spaniard to Milan but include a buy-back clause. Diaz joined Real from Manchester City for €17m (£15m/$21m) in January 2019, bringing to an end his three-year stay at theEtihadStadium. The midfielder found regular playing time hard to come by inZinedineZidane'sranks thereafter, and despite picking up a LaLigawinners' medal in his first full season at the club, theBlancosdecided to send him off to Milan for the duration of the 2020-21 campaign. Diaz impressed during his loan spell at San Siro, contributing seven goals and four assists to the Rossoneri's cause in 39 appearances across all competitions. The 21-year-old shone as Stefano Pioli's side enjoyed a run to the Europa League last 16, and also played a key role in helping them secure a second-place finish in Serie A. Diaz will return to Real when hisloan deal at Milan expires at the end of the month, and he still has four years left to run on his contract at Santiago Bernabeu - where Carlo Ancelotti has just replaced Zidane as the new head coach. The Italian giants are now attempting to sign the Spain Under-21 internationaloutright, butthe Blancos still have faith that he can become a key player for the club in the future. Goal has learned that Real will only sanction Diaz's departure if their €30m valuation is met and a buy-back clause is included that allows them to bring him back to the Bernabeu for a similar price. The 13-time European champions are also open to extending the former City starlet's loan stay at San Siro, but it remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached with the Rossoneri. Ancelotti has a number of pressing issues to attend to as he begins his second spell in charge of Real, but Goal has learned that he will also make time to sit down with Diaz to discuss his future. The Italian wants to get to know the Spaniard better before deciding whether his talents could be utilised at the Bernabeu next season, but competition for places in midfield is likely to be fierce as the Blancos seek to bounce back from their trophy-less 2020-21 season.

198,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-is-zlatan-ibrahimovic-not-playing-for-sweden-at-euro/1dbx9ss6w8ety1m7zfun0s1fmd,Why is Zlatan Ibrahimovic not playing for Sweden at Euro 2020?,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to break any and all boundaries in sport at 39 years old, and enjoyed a fruitful scoring season at AC Milan. What the Sweden international won't be doing, however, is going to the Euros this summer with Sweden - and Goal looks into why. Ibrahimovic will not be representing Sweden at Euro 2020 because he has been ruled out of the tournament due to injury. The striker picked upa knee injury in May, duringthe second half of the Rossoneri's 3-0 victory over Juventus in Serie A. He was involved in a tussle for the ball before going down to the ground in a non-contact injury, and eventually had to be taken off the pitch and replacedby Ante Rebic. As a result, Ibrahimovic was ruled out for the remainder of the season – and is aiming to return to fitness before the 2021-22 club campaign. After the match, AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli said: “Ibra wasn't fit before the game, now he feels pain in his knee and we hope it's nothing too serious.” Ibrahimovic was ruled out of AC Milan's next fixture against Torino, after Pioli stated that the forward was merely suffering from a ""slight sprain"", but the injury turned out to be more serious than initially thought. The Swedish FA said on their Twitter account: “Today, Zlatan has informed [head coach] Janne Andersson that his injury will stop him from participating in the European Championships this summer. “Get well, Zlatan, we hope to see you on the football field again soon!” Idag har Zlatan meddelat Janne Andersson att hans skada stoppar honom från att medverka i EM i sommar.Krya på dig Zlatan, vi hoppas att få se dig på fotbollsplanen snart igen! 🇸🇪🦁 Ibrahimovic has always been famously coy about his retirement plans, and even as he approaches 40, he is showing no signs of slowing down. The Swede did retire from international football in 2016, but was then called up for his national team forWorld Cup qualifiers in March. Ibrahimovic hung up his boots for Sweden following a disappointing and lacklustre Euro 2016 showing, mustering a single shot on target in three games and not scoring any goals. This past season, however, Ibrahimovic has been ingreat form for AC Milan, scoring 15 goals in 19 Serie Aappearances. Ibrahimovic also recently signed a one-year contract extension with AC Milan. Sweden will face Poland, Slovakia and Spain in Group E of the European Championship. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The England U21 international spent the 2020-21 campaign with Championship side Swansea, allowing him to see regular game time. He caught the eye while in South Wales and will now get the chance to test himself on a Premier League stage with the Eagles. There has been talk of a £20 million ($28m) fee being agreed, but both sides are keeping the financial side of a deal under wraps. What is clear is that Guehi is undergoing a medical with Palace and will be signing a five-year contract through to the summer of 2026. Chelsea are preparing to part with the Ivory Coast-born star as they are already well stocked at centre-half. The Blues are, however, eager to ensure that they do not sever all ties with a player of consider promise. They have included a sell-on clause within the terms agreed with their domestic rivals, while they also have the option to match any offer tabled in future transfer talks.  Guehi has been on Chelsea's books since 2007, having seen his potential spotted early. He made his professional debut in an EFL Cup game with Grimsby in September 2019 and has taken in two Carabao Cup outings for the Blues at first-team level. Much of his experience to date was, however, collected while with Swansea in 2020-21. He made 45 appearances for the Swans in all competitions, helping them to the Championship play-off final, and also figured for his country in the group stage of the European U21 Championship.

The 23-year-old has been struggling with a shoulder problem since last year and may require surgery in the wake of England's Euro 2020 campaign. But Solskjaer says they have not come to a decision so far and are still in talks with medical experts. ""No, we’re looking at the best options,"" Solskjaer told reporters when asked if Rashford will have an operation. ""Of course, he went away just to reflect on it a little bit. We have to take the best course of action for him and the club. ""We’re still addressing that with the experts."" Rashford was one of three players who faced racist abuse after missing a penalty in the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy. Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka all published statements reflecting on the loss and hit out at the abuse they have received. Solskjaer says he was saddened by the discrimination they received as he defended his player. ""It’s very disappointing and sad,""he said. ""They play football, they do the best for the club, do the best for their family, do their best for their country and are brave enough to step up and take penalties, that’s a win in itself.""

201,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pellistri-set-for-loan-move-after-showing-promise-on-first/jkii0hprx7du1mywacpmqpltp,Pellistri set for loan move after showing promise on first senior Man Utd appearance,"With so much clamour around Jadon Sancho finally agreeing a deal to join Manchester United it is easy to forget that the club did sign two right wingers last year. After the failed attempt to land Sancho last summer, deals were struck for Amad and Facundo Pellistri on deadline day. Not the right-sided attackers most were hoping for but two young talents with plenty of promise for the future, that was the word from the club. While United fans have already seen a snapshot of what Amad can offer, with eightappearances last season, they’ve had to wait longer to get a glimpse of Pellistri in first-team action. And many will not have been disappointed with what they saw from the 19-year-old as he got 45 minutes to impress in United’s first pre-season friendly fixture against Derby on Sunday. Usually at this time of year United are in some far-flung destination further promoting the brand while getting some vital minutes in ahead of the new campaign. But, with Covid-19 still affecting travel plans, the usual haunts of Miami, Singapore and Tokyo have been swapped for Derby, west London and Preston. It’s not quite the same glamour but the young squad that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has at his disposal this summer, mainly due to the regular first-team members still being away due to Euro 2020 commitments, will not mind what country their opportunity comes in. Tahith Chong, who has already agreed to join Birmingham City on loan next season, opened the scoring as he bundled his effort over Kelle Roos but it was after the break when Solskjaer made wholesale changes that United impressed going forward. Jesse Lingard set the tempo going forward, linking up well with Shola Shoretire and Pellistri. Pellistri had only been on the pitch a matter of moments when he won a free kick as he was hacked down just as he was about to set off on a run into the box; an instant reminder of how dangerous he can be when he makes those moves in the area. A look at his highlights reel during his loan spell at La Liga side Alaves in the second half of last season shows that is when he is at his most effective. His quick feet cause defenders headaches and his ability to cut in from the right gives Solskjaer an option down that side during pre-season while Sancho is still away. While it is his nifty footwork and pace that terrifies defenders, it was calmness and composure that saw him score his first senior goal. A delightful through ball from Shoretire saw Pellistri roundthe goalkeeper before coolly slotting home. It was amove that impressed Solskjaer. “I thought he was bright and he took his goal really well. Great first touch. Good pass by Shola but great first touch which sets him up,” Solskjaer said after the 2-1 win. “I think he showed what he is because he's a difficult player to play against. One against one he can go past people so I'm very pleased with him.” While he is highly regarded at Old Trafford he is expected to go out on loan again to further his development. Sancho’s imminent arrival would see him drop further down the pecking order and he has already shown last season how beneficial a loan spell can be. Solskjaer confirmed there has already been plenty of interest in the teenager and if any scouts were watching United’swin over Derby on Sunday that list of interested parties may just have increased.

The 18-year-old is widely regarded as the most talented midfielder from his age group to emerge from the club's academy set-up last season. Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton are other clubs that were interested in the midfielder, but he has opted to join Marcelo Bielsa's side as he goes in search of more regular first-team opportunities. The England Under-19 international is a left-footed midfielder that is known for his impressive passing and ability to drive through the middle of the pitch. Standing at 5'6"" (1.68 metres), he is known for being a 'terrier' in midfield, positioning his body well to make him effective in tackles despite his short stature. It's these qualities that attracted the eye of Chelsea's former assistant manager Jody Morris, who held a similar playing style. Furthermore, he is known for his leadership qualities in the youth team having led Chelsea's U-15s to treble-winning glory, leading tohim makinghis U-18s debut as a 15-year-old. Bate has never played for Chelsea's senior team but he has been an unused substitute on two occasions. Still, the Blues were keen to keep him and have only opted to sellafter he reached the final year of his contract and pushed for a move away. Chelsea have sold Marc Guehi to Crystal Palace after he excelled in an 18-month loan spell at Swansea City. Tino Livramento, Myles Peart-Harris and Dynel Simeu could also leave the Blues as they face up to an exodus from their youth groups. However, Armando Broja has signed a new five-year Chelsea contract and could get a chance in Thomas Tuchel's senior team next season. Thierno Ballo could move on loan later in the transfer window, with Rapid Vienna, Sturm Graz, Mainz and Arminia Bielefeld all interested. Meanwhile, Wigan are among the clubs interested in taking Henry Lawrence on his first loan move away from the Blues, and Anderlecht and Genk are interested in Ike Ugbo as Chelsea consider raising the asking pricefor the young striker. Tiemoue Bakayoko is keen to move to AC Milan, while Trevoh Chalobah is attracting interest from across Europe after a successful loan spell at Lorient.

Great Britain will have a women's team going for gold at this summer's Games in Tokyo, but there has been male representation at just one event since 1960 - when London hosted in 2012. Bamford wants to see that situation change, as home nations pull together, with a man still chasing down senior international recognition with England calling for a deal to be done ahead of a Paris showpiece in 2024. Bamford, who hit 17 Premier League goals for Leeds last season, told the 2020 Olympics official website: ""You know, it's still in the future and obviously there's still discussions to be had between all the home nations. ""It's the only chance I would get to go to an Olympics and there are not many people who can say they've represented Great Britain at the Olympics. ""So 100 per cent, that would be something I'd love to do, and hopefully it gets worked out."" Stuart Pearce took charge of Team GB at London 2012, with Daniel Sturridge, Craig Bellamy and Ryan Giggs among those that formed part of a star-studded squad. Bamford can remember watching that team in action, and was also in attendance when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt collected the second of his three Olympic 100m gold medals. He added on his experiences to date: ""I did actually go to the Olympics – I watched when Usain Bolt won his 100 metre final, I was in the stadium for that. So that was quite a spectacle. ""I actually love watching the Olympics, just random sports that normally on a day-to-day basis, I would never find myself watching, but somehow become really, really involved in - like the gymnastics, for instance."" Bamford will be watching Tokyo 2020 when the Games open on Friday, while he is also counting down the days to a new Premier League season with Leeds that is set to start with a testing trip to Manchester United on August 14.

A talented 25-year-old has  seen his stock soar across the last 12 months,with promotion to the Premier League secured before going on to  star for Englandat Euro 2020. It comes as no surprise to find that admiring glances are reportedlybeing shot in the direction of Elland Road, but Kevin Sharp claims his client will turn a deaf ear to any transfer gossip. Sharp has told   i: ""Before Kalvin signed his last contract, we had good interest so we sat down and explored all the pros and cons. ""His desire was never to leave, it was to be rewarded and stay and play for the team he supported as a kid. ""Within the contract he signed in September 2019, we included provisions within it for if Leeds reached the Premier League, so it’s all set up for the top flight. ""We knew it was a bit of a gamble, but we knew Leeds would get there under [Marcelo] Bielsa and obviously they did. ""There may be clubs who are actually looking at Kalvin now because the more successful you are – playing for England in big tournaments – naturally breeds interest. ""But Kalvin is happy at Leeds and has no desire to move whatsoever. It’s more a case of ‘carry on what you’re doing for club and country’.""  Leeds native Phillips is tied to a deal with the Whites through to the summer of 2024. There is no need for discussions to be opened regarding fresh terms, but it may be that an improved offer is put to the midfielder if current standards are maintained. Sharp will not be pushing for that, but is ruling nothing out. He added: ""It’s not something we’re banging on the door to make happen because it’s about Kalvin playing and enjoying his football. ""But if Leeds want to improve that and protect their assets, for sure we’d be interested in sitting down with them. His value will increase and long may that continue."" Phillips has taken in 211 appearances for Leeds, with 30 of those coming last season as the Whites returned to the Premier League after a 16-year absence.

The 21-year-old striker hit nine goals through 22 appearances for the Tykes last season, with his power and pace said to be drawing admiring glances from the likes of Leeds United, Newcastle and Everton. There has even been talk of Manchester United and Chelsea buying into the potential of a United States international, but the Orlando City-owned frontman is reluctant to be drawn on where his future will lie. Dike has told MLS Soccer on the speculation swirling around him: ""For me, all that stuff is kinda extra noise. ""Obviously for me I’ve been blessed to go on the experience at Barnsley and play with the national team as well. ""I’ve had lot of experiences and I kind of told myself from the beginning I want to bring back everything that I’ve learned about the new culture, learned about the new style of play and come back here and kind of see how I’ve grown as a player. ""In terms of all the extra things happening, that’s just something when the time comes. ""For me right now, it’s focusing on acclimating back to the team and seeing how I can be able to affect the games in the next couple of weeks.""  He added: ""For me, I’ve always said I want to play in the top competitions, play against the top competition and play under the greatest staff. ""Thus far, I’ve been blessed with being able to see guys like Nani, [who has] won tons of competitions. ""For me, I want to be able compete at high levels, whether it be at World Cups and playing in all these top competitions in the world. ""For me, I just want to continue to grow as a player and be able to do those things."" Barnsley opted against taking up a purchase option on Dike at the end of his four-month loan spell at Oakwell. The Tykes were left with little choice but to walk away from a deal after missing out on promotion to the Premier League through the Championship play-offs. It is reported that they could have landed Dyke for $20 million (£14m), but the funds are not there in South Yorkshire without top-flight football. That is leaving the door open for others to make a move, but Dike has returned to Florida to link up with Orlando City in their 2021 MLS campaign - as they sit third in the Eastern Conference after seven games.

Despite Cercle hovering around the relegation zone in the Belgian top flight, Ugbo has netted almost a goal in every other game in one of Europe's most scouted divisions. It has led to transfer interest intensifying, with the Blues academy graduate's contract expiring in June 2022. Through their ownership of Cercle, Monaco have a £5 million ($7m) option to buy on Ugbo andare interested in signing him following his impressive form at their sister club. Along with Fulham and Genk, Serie A side Bologna have expressed an interest in signing the 22-year-old. Furthermore, Russian side Rostov and Claudio Ranieri's Sampdoria in Serie A are understood to be interested in signing Ugbo, and even made offers in January that were not accepted. Chelsea's insistence on getting £5m for their loanee was expressed when they rejected Rostov's £3m ($4m) bid in January. The Blues are keen to reduce the size of their loan group with new regulations coming in this summer from FIFA, whichwill stop teams from having large groups of players out on temporary deals. The west Londoners have already let Lucas Piazon go for free in January to Bragaafter the Portuguese side agreed to match his full wage, and the deal displayed the Blues' willingness to negotiate for a host of loanees in the summer. At Cercle, Ugbo has scored 16 goals and provided one assist in his 33 games this season. It is the second consecutive season whenhe has scored regularly in Europe after netting 13 goals in 29 games at struggling Roda JC in the Netherlands. It follows less successful English football loans in the Championship with Barnsley, and League One with MK Dons and Scunthorpe, where Ugbo has previously admitted to struggling to transition from academy football to the senior game. ""On my first loan [at Barnsley], I didn't feel I showed the qualities that I really had. I think it was just a different world for me to go out into first-team football and adapt. I don't think that I adapted quickly enough,"" Ugbo told Goal last season. ""I am showing more of the qualities that I had when I played in the Under-23s [at Chelsea] and that potential that I have to push on to the next level. They were all learning curves, really, and it has moulded me into who I am now."" However, his latest loans have proven that he can replicate his form from Chelsea's academy, where he was once regarded as an equal to his strike partner Tammy Abraham.

He made 45 appearances for the Swans in all competitions, helping them to the Championship play-off final, and also figured for his country in the group stage of the European U21 Championship.

The Blues owner has often been described as a Russian billionaire after his takeover of the club in 2003 but, in recent years, his ethnicity has come into focus. Shortly after conductinga rare public interview and expressing concern about the racism faced by his club's players, he became the victim of abuse himself. It came after he launched the Say No to Antisemitism campaign through Chelsea and became a citizen of Israel. ""He was certainly disappointed in a broader sense, not just because things were directed at him, but because of generally what was going on,"" Buck said as attacks rolled in during rising tensions in the Middle East in May. ""I think that's the way everyone at the club felt. The interesting thing about today's event (a breakfast with people from across football and politics involved in fighting anti-semitism), in a certain sense it was depressing but in a certain sense, it was very hopeful. It has not been an easy time for those who fight discrimination in the last year and a half. ""It's important also to remember that when we do stand up for what we believe in and, causes like this, it leads to good things."" As with the England national teams, football clubs have almost entirely found themselves on the right side of the debate against racism. Typically, it has focused on the discrimination of other groups but Chelsea hopethat, after a recent four-fold rise in anti-semitic hate crimes in the UK, it can become part of the agenda across the Premier League and beyond. ""We honestly aren't interested in taking all sorts of credit for this, we'd love to share all our resources, all our thoughts, even some of our people to other clubs, to engage in similar, or in dissimilar activities related to fighting discrimination,"" added Buck. ""The only way this is really going to work is if there's a geometric multiplier in there. We'll be happy if we can move the needle a little bit, this is a very big issue and Chelsea will not solve this by itself. ""It needs lots of people participating in it and that's what we'd really like to see."" Yes, they have launched an exhibition at the Royal Air Force Museum in London which celebrates the contribution of Jewish people during World War II. They will also fund a campaign in Israel that sees Jewish and Arab children playing football together to improve integration. There's hope that the ideas will spread beyond the club though and Chelsea hosted a breakfast event with leaders from the anti-semitism fight in the UK. It has led to antidiscrimination charity Kick It Out saying that it intends to increase its focus on anti-semitism. ""Historically, it's been alleged that Kick It Out was formed to fight racism against black players and coaches,"" Anthony Burnett, CEO of Kick It Out, said. ""But we're very much of the belief that you can't just fight one form of discrimination, because discrimination is wrong in all its forms. ""We looked at our strategy and realised we weren't doing enough on anti-semitism. Chelsea have been a shining light, and it gives us the opportunity to follow in the slipstream. ""We're going to do more on anti-semitism because not enough has been done in football. We've got a model to follow now, and we can hopefully add to that as well.""

209,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-is-christian-pulisic-called-captain-america-usmnt-stars/15i2b4qqmton1kznplkm7uez4,Why is Christian Pulisic called 'Captain America'? USMNT star's nickname explained,"Christian Pulisic may not like it but his nickname of 'Captain America' has certainly stuck. Since making his professional debut for Dortmund in January 30, Pulisic has carried the hopes of the U.S. men's national team on his shoulders. Arguably, as the most talented USMNT player ever, he has been dubbed Captain America, named after the famous Marvel Comics character. Captain America is a Marvel Comics superhero who dresses in the red, white and blue colours of the American flag. Dating back to his creation by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon in 1941, the unashamedly patriotic super-soldier for the American government was invented in response to World War II. The alter ego of Steve Rogers, the Marvel hero boasts increased strength, speed, agility, durability and mental processing power after he was given the super-soldier serum. He also wields a shield that's almost entirely indestructable. Captain America is also one of the leaders of the Avengers -a team of superheroes brought together on the big screen by the Marvel Universe. Since moving to Chelsea for £57.6m ($73m), the attention on the winger has only intensified. It has led him to receive more column inches than most, playing at one of the world's top clubs, in the most talked-about league while serving as a posterboy for American soccer. The name Captain America has been known to be used in the dressing room environment,having alsobeen used by written media for sometime. Christian Pulisic going very mainstream in America following two titles in eight days on Good Morning America. Chelsea will love to see this and his brilliant English accent attempt: https://t.co/ueMyXehLMo #CFC Having recently won his first trophy as the captain of his national team, Pulisic appeared on the huge U.S. daytime TV show Good Morning America. The host Michael Strahan introduced him as Captain America in his latest high-profile appearance to a mass audience in the United States. Despite the popular usage, Pulisic doesn't like the nickname Captain America. “I’m not a big fan of being called that, to be honest -especially by my teammates,” Pulisic told GQwhen asked about the moniker. It could be in part due to Pulisic not enjoying the limelight of the professional sports world as much as most. Equally, he bears a lot of pressure through his status for his national team that has seen him earn both a lot of hype and vilification. Ultimately, a nickname is not something you can control when it comes into such popular usage, so the forward might have to embrace it in the years to come.

210,https://www.goal.com/en/news/kyra-cooney-cross-australia-teen-sensation-breakthrough/5n9osvx8qx3w1b7z1gduxpaxt,Kyra Cooney-Cross: Australia's 'hungry' teen sensation set for breakthrough season,"As the new W-League season gets underway in Australia, it feels like a new chapter for a league that has,from Sam Kerr to Caitlin Foord, long boasted the talents of Australia's biggest stars. This yearit is without most of those world-class players, so many having chosen to get off the exhausting cycle of playing in the W-League and the United States’ NWSL, moving to Europe for a steadier schedule. But for all the concern that surrounded Australia’s top-flight for large parts of 2020, the new yearprovides a real chance for the country’s young talent to shine as they aim to emulate the names that have since moved on to pastures new. At the forefront of that exciting next generation is Kyra Cooney-Cross. Part of the Melbourne Victory team crowned W-League Premiers in 2018-19, Cooney-Cross moved to Western Sydney Wanderers last year for a chance to be a regular starter. What followed was a campaign that showed exactly what all the hype is about. With four goals and three assists from 13 games, she returns to the Victory this season poised for a true breakthrough year. “I think she's definitely matured as a player,” Leah Blayney, head coach of the Matildas’ Under-20s, tells  Goal  . A goal-scoring phenomenon at youth level for Australia, Cooney-Cross went to the 2019 Women’s World Cup with the senior team as a training player. A post shared by Kyra Cooney-Cross (@kyracooneyx) With that valuable opportunity sitting on her CV alongside three W-League seasons and three campaigns acrossthe National Premier League competitions in Victoria and New South Wales,the 18-year-old has experience that belies her age. “She's got very good physical qualities in terms of her explosive speed and she's really in tune to those qualities, doing everything she can to make sure that helps keep her at the top of her game,” Blayney says. “She's technically developed with both feet, which is important in the modern game, and that's becoming an asset for her. She can strike a ball off her left or right foot at any given moment.” Evident in Cooney-Cross’ game last season was the ability to use that explosive speed to get into the box and contribute in front of goal. Meanwhile, her superb delivery from a set pieces, creative flair and brilliant dribbling ability -a stand-out quality from a very young age -helped her rack up the assists. “I think there's a level of maturity there where she understands now if you want to play more, you have got to be the best on the pitch,” Blayney, who first met Cooney-Cross while working as an assistant with the Matildas’ U17s, says. “That's developed in Kyra and that's why I look forward to seeing her this W-League season, where she's hungry, but she's also got a few more runs on the board to back that up.” Those at Melbourne Victory have already seen glimpses of what Cooney-Cross can do, with her having scored two goals for them back in the 2017-18 seasonwhile still just 15 years old. She returns with the potential to be a key player as the club strive for a third successive appearance in the W-League finals. A post shared by Kyra Cooney-Cross (@kyracooneyx) At 18, that pressure might be too much for some, but Cooney-Cross is the type to thrive under it. “She's always committed to putting herself in challenging environments, which I think has helped propel her along her journey,” Blayney adds. “That commitment that she's always been willing to sacrifice and put herself in uncomfortable arenas to be better is something that's pretty important about Kyra.”  With that attitude, the heights that Australian women’s football is now hitting will no doubt excite the teenager as well. As Kerr develops into one of the best players in the world,  as Foord showcases her talents in the Women’s Super League with Arsenal, as 20-year-old Ellie Carpenter shines week in, week out for the reigning European champions, Lyon, the ceiling for Australia’s talent continues to rise. “We like to think that the ceiling is that you'll be the world's best. That's where we're moving towards and we know we're capable of it,” Blayney says. While some worried about the W-League’s future, that it provides the perfect environment for talents like Cooney-Cross to explode is just yet another positive for a country that,  with a home World Cup to come in 2023,  has so much to be excited about.

211,https://www.goal.com/en/news/riccardo-calafiori-roma-wonderkid-career-almost-never-began/atsfkk23ku95158c8vi6ub7a2,Riccardo Calafiori: The Roma wonderkid whose career almost never began,"At the age of 18, Roma left-back Riccardo Calafiori is regarded as one of the best young prospects in Italian football, with the teenager beginning to make his mark on the Giallorossi first-team. Rewind just over two years, however, and there was a feeling that Calafiori's career was over before it had even started. Making just his second appearance for Roma's Under-19s against Viktoria Plzen in the UEFA Youth League in October 2018, Calafiori was the victim of a horrendous, studs-up challenge from Vaclav Svoboda in the 82nd minute that ""tore his right knee to pieces"". All of the ligaments in Calafiori's joint had been ruptured along with his meniscus and articular capsule, with doctors declaring at the time it was an injury that ""occurs once every 10 years"" and was more akin to the kind of traumaa motorcross rider would suffer from, rather than a footballer. The youngster was told, in no uncertain terms, that the injury was career-threatening. An individual with less desire to make it to the top may have given up on their dream there and then, but Calafiori had come too far to walk away. After undergoing surgery in the United States, his long road back to the training pitches began. A highly-regarded member of Roma's academy since the age of nine, Calafiori first came to prominence in the 2017-18 seasonwhen, as a 15-year-old, he played a key role in the club's U17s winning the league and cup double. Such was his talent, super-agent Mino Raiola quickly moved to become his representative, but just months later the youngsterfound himself in a hospital bed wondering what was coming next. A post shared by Riccardo Calafiori (@richycala) It was on the day his injury was suffered that it became clear just how aware those around the club were of his talent. Later that same day, Roma striker Edin Dzeko celebrated his goal against the Viktoria first-team in the Champions League by running over to the bench, grabbing Calafiori's shirt and showing it to the crowd in tribute to the stricken starlet. In total, 347 days passed between Calafiori's injury and his return to competitive action for Roma's Primavera side at the start of the 2019-20 campaign. It was at this point that his second career began. ""The journey was definitely the hardest thing I faced,"" he toldRoma TVfollowing his recovery.""I had a knee that was three times the size of the other one."" Aside from making Paulo Fonseca's matchday squad on three occasions in the autumn, Calafiori spent the majority of his first season back playing for the U19s, and scored in each of what turned out to be the final three matches of the campaign as Covid-19 forced the youth season to be prematurely abandoned. He was, however, invited to train with the first-team when Serie A resumed following lockdown, with Fonseca handing him his debut when he was named in the starting line-up to face champions Juventus on the final day of the campaign. Playing as a wing-back on the left-hand-side, Calafiori made quite the impact as he won a penalty that Diego Perotti was able to convert before finding the net himself, only for it to be ruled out for offside as Roma ran out 3-1 winners in Turin. A post shared by Riccardo Calafiori (@richycala) Despite being linked with Manchester United, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter during the 2020 summer transfer window, Calafiori remained with the capital clubas he was made a permanent member of the first-team squad. Although he missed a month between October and November after testing positive for coronavirus, the teenager returned to the fold and was immediately named in Fonseca's XI for theEuropa League clash against Romanian outfit CFR Cluj. It was in his second continental appearance, however, that he grabbed the headlines for all the right reasons. Facing Swiss side Young Boys at Stadio Olimpico, Calafiori saw a free-kick cleared to him around 25 yards from goal, and the defender did not even need to take a touch before smashing the bouncing ball into the top corner for his first professional goal. When he was just 16, Roma left-back Riccardo Calafiori suffered a serious knee injury which could have ended his career before it begun 🤕Last week, he scored his first goal for the club - and it was an absolute screamer! 🔥pic.twitter.com/BvPFoyPZjF ""[It was] more beautiful than that was difficult,"" he told reporters post-match.""Of course with the public it would have been better, but I'm happy."" Fonseca, meanwhile, was keen not to build up his new charge too much, saying: ""Calafiori is a young player with talent, but he needs time to grow. Suddenly treating him like he’s the best in the world right now is not helpful for the player. We trust he’ll have a great future."" Two substitute appearances in Serie A have since followed for Calafiori, who has experience playing as a left-sided centre-back as well in his favoured wide role.  Already a part of Italy's U21 squad, he signed a new contract with Roma in December to tie him to his boyhood club through until the summer of 2025. ""It has been my dream since I was a child,"" he said upon putting pen to paper on his fresh deal.""It is the most beautiful thing in the world. It means a lot to me. ""Every boy who grew up here, with a passion for these colours, dreams of one day making it this far. It seems that I have succeeded and I still don't realise it. My dream now is to be able to win something with this shirt."" Roma fans share that dream as, following the relatively recent retirements of Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi, they look for a new homegrown hero to root for. After what Calafiori has been through already in his career, there are plenty both in Rome and further afield who hope he can return on his undoubted potential.

212,https://www.goal.com/en/news/charles-de-ketelaere-tennis-prodigy-25m-football-wonderkid/11weycufdvsp41lcsz33hxc8df,Charles De Ketelaere: From tennis prodigy to €25m football wonderkid,"When Charles De Ketelaere stepped on stage to receive hisPromise of the Year prize at the Belgian Sports Awardsin mid-December, the video that played behind himdid not begin by showcasing his footballing achievements. Instead, grainy footage of the Club Brugge star playing tennis from around a decade ago was shown as a reminder of just how prodigiously talented a sportsman the 19-year-old really is. As De Ketelaere followed in the footsteps of Romelu Lukaku, Divock Origi and six-time Grand Slam tennis champion Kim Clijsters in claiming the annual prize, he was given the chance to reflect on the life-changing decision that saw him follow his own footballingdream over a potential career in a solo sport. ""Tennisis much more confrontational when you lose. In football, it is easier to find excuses when things go wrong, but in tennis it's only you,"" De Ketelaere, who was a Flemish tennis champion at the age of 10, toldHet Niewsblad.""You are the only one at fault if you play badly, and I couldn't handle my own mistakes. ""I couldn't stand cheaters, those boys who would scream when the ball was out and it wasn't. Then sometimes I would get mad and hit all the balls away on purpose, or even stop playing. My mum tried to help me with that, because sometimes she was ashamed. I even had a trainer I had to meditate with to calm me down."" Whether for his personal or sporting development, it is clear the De Ketelaere made the right call, with his performances over the past 12 months having seen him emerge as one of the brightest young Belgian prospects in recent years. Despite having only turned 19 in March, the playmaker is already a veteran of almost 50 first-team appearances for theBlauw-Zwart as well as a senior international having made his debut for Roberto Martinez's side against Switzerland in November. “Everything I dreamed of as a child is now all coming true,” he said upon receiving his recent award.“My first goals for Club Brugge, where I have been playing for so long and in the city where I live.My debut for the Red Devils too."" A post shared by CDK (@charlesdeketelaere) De Ketelaere's rapid ascent began in the summer of 2019 when he was chosen as one of seven academy products to join Club Brugge's first-team squad ahead of the new campaign. He was one of only two, though, that were invited to remain among the senior ranks heading into the new campaign, with De Ketelaere selected to make his debut against lower-league outfit Francs Borains in the Belgian Cup in September 2019. His second appearance in the first team, however, was a far more high-profile affair. Having only made the bench on two occasions since his debut, De Ketelaere was a surprise inclusion in Philippe Clement'sstarting line-up for his side'sChampions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain. Though the Pro League outfit were beaten 5-0 by the French champions, De Ketelaere did not let himself down playing in central midfield, and a fortnight later he was introduced off the bench in the reverse fixture, with his league debut coming in the days that followed. By the time the 2019-20season was prematurely abandoned due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 6'4"" tall forward was a regular starter, scoring his first senior goal in what turned out to be the penultimate game of the campaign against Genk. Despite showing improvements and having signed a new three-year contract in April, De Ketelaere again found himself among the substitutes by the time the current season began. Yet again, though, it was the Champions League that proved to be the competition to kick-start the youngster's campaign, with his stoppage-time winner against Zenit on the opening night of the group stages beginning a run of 12 starts in Club's last 16 games. Though that sequencebegan with him playing off the left of a front three, and included a clash with Borussia Dortmund where he was forced to fill in at left-back and mark Jadon Sancho, it is in his new role as a central striker that he is truly beginning to excel. A naturally selfless player, De Ketelaere has taken toacting as a 'false nine'as if it were a position he has played all his life. He is tasked with acting as a facilitator for othersas well as with scoring goals himself -much like Roberto Firmino at Liverpool -and is thriving. ""His versatility is a huge asset. He is complete, with a mix of physical and technical qualities,"" legendary Club Brugge midfielder Gert Verheyen toldHet Nieuwsbladof De Ketelaere. A post shared by CDK (@charlesdeketelaere) ""If they play him asthe striker for a whole season and he continues to play like this, he will score 15 goals. ""The amount that interested clubs will offer to buyhim for will beunprecedented in Belgium. I really think that."" Given his contract situation and the rapid improvements shown since his change in position, the Belgian league leaders believe that their€25 million (£23m/$31m) asking price is fair as interest begins to grow. AC Milan and Atalanta have both been credited as potential suitors, though they and others will likely hope to see more from De Ketelaere in front of goal before opening their chequebooks. He has just four senior strikes to his name during the first 18 months of his career, though he has become the first Belgian player to score more thanone Champions League goal before their 20th birthday.  ""The fact that the outside world now also knows me and has certain expectations does not deter me,"" De Ketelaere, who has also spent time studying for a law degree over the past year, told reporters recently. ""I am very critical of myself, so the pressure often comes from myself. I cannot imagine that there will ever come a moment when I think: 'Now I am here, now it cannot be any better'. ""I regularly look back at my matches.My mum sometimes wants to watch together, but I don't like that.Everything looks good for her, whereas I prefer to look at it a little more critically."" For a man who grew up idolising both Cristiano Ronaldo and Roger Federer, that pursuit of perfection should not come as anyreal surprise, and it is certainly helping his game go from strength to strength. Tennis might not have been the game for Charles De Ketelaere, but if his early career is anything to go by, football was the perfect alternative. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

213,https://www.goal.com/en/news/jamal-musiala-former-chelsea-wonderkid-breaking-records/j2jqo0g9slgc1m3vj0qckjdo8,Jamal Musiala: Former Chelsea wonderkid breaking records at Bayern,"Bayern Munich's public pursuit of Callum Hudson-Odoi dominated discussions around Chelsea for the best part of six months in 2019, as the Blues battled to retain one of the best young talents to emerge from their academy in recent years. The Bundesliga champions did all they could to bring the England international to the Allianz Arena, making four different bids – the last of which was worth£35 million (€38m/$42m) – while also offering Hudson-Odoi the No.10 shirt which was about to be vacated by Arjen Robben. The saga was eventually brought to an end in September as the 19-year-old signed a new five-year, £180,000-a-week contract at Stamford Bridge having been convinced to stay by Frank Lampard. But while the Blues were locking down one teenage star, another potential wonderkid was packing his bags to swap west London for Bavaria. While negotiating over Hudson-Odoi, Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic used the opportunity to also discuss a possible transfer for then-16-year-old midfielder Jamal Musiala. Like Hudson-Odoi, Musiala is represented by the First Access Sports agency, and though he was offered a lucrative contract to remain at Chelsea, he instead opted to return to the country of his birth on a five-year deal. ""I'm really happy about my years in England,"" Musiala said upon his arrival at Bayern.""There were a few interested teams in Europe. But if such a big clubin Germany is interested, you can't say no. And I loved Bavaria from an early age."" Born in Stuttgart to a German mother and British-Nigerian father, Musiala began his footballing education at TSV Lehnerz in his hometown of Fulda before moving to England as an eight-year-old. He spent some time at Southampton's academy before being snapped up by Chelsea, where he immediately impressed as he made his way through the various age-group sides. Having made his England Under-15s debut while still aged just 13, Musiala was promoted to make his first appearance for Chelsea's U18s teamjust two months after his 15th birthday. He would make two more appearances at that level in 2018-19 before opting to follow in the footsteps of players such as Jadon Sancho and swap one of the Premier League's top academies for a giant of the Bundesliga. Musiala was initially placed into Bayern's U17 squad, for whom he scored in each of his first three appearances. He would add three more goals to his tally in a further nine matchesbefore earning a promotion to the U19s in December. Despite failing to score in eight matches at that level, Musiala still put in a number of eye-catching performances ahead of the coronavirus-enforced shutdown of football around Europe in March. 2019 ✅ what a year it’s been❤️🔥 A post shared by @ jamalmusiala10 on Dec 31, 2019 at 6:31am PST So much so that upon the game's resumption in June he found himself on the bench for Bayern Munich II in their third division clash against Preussen Munster, with Musiala able to make a 10-minute cameo towards the end of the game. Six days later, and in just his third appearance at that level, the 17-year-old stepped off the bench to score both goals in a 2-0 win over Zwickau. ""The boy is ice cold,"" Bayern II coach, Sebastian Hoeness, said of the youngster after he became the second-youngest player to ever score for the team behind David Alaba.""If you talk to him before the game, he appears focused, calm and reserved."" His match-winning display earned him a third promotion of the season, with first-team manager Hansi Flick naming the teenager on the bench for Bayern's clash with Borussia Monchengladbach on June 13before handing him a senior debuta week later against Freiburg, with Musiala becoming Bayern's youngest-ever Bundesliga player in the process. Standing at 6'2"", Musiala certainly has the physical attributes to compete at the highest level, even if it is felt that he needs to fill out more over the coming years to truly be able to hold his own against men twice his age. Predominantly right-footed, he has been converted from a central striker into an attacking midfielder, with some likening him to Tottenham star Dele Alli or even a taller version of current Bayern club-mate Philippe Coutinho. He has also been deployed as more of a box-to-box midfielder, or No.8, at times, and England are now working hard to ensure he represents them at international level as he approaches the senior ranks.  Despite making two appearances for Germany U16s, Musiala has played the majority of his schoolboy football for England as part of a generation of players born in 2003 whothe Three Lions believe can emulate the side that won the U17 World Cup in 2017. That team contained Sancho, Hudson-Odoi, Phil Foden and Morgan Gibbs-White, all of whom have gone onto make an impact at senior level with their clubs. Musiala plays alongside the likes of Birmingham City midfielder Jude Bellingham, Liverpool winger Harvey Elliott, former Barcelona starlet Louie Barry and Celtic wonderkid Karamoko Dembele in the current squad, and it is hoped that he will stick with the country where he spent his early teenage years rather than the land of his birth. Either way, it seems only a matter of time before Musiala continues his upward trajectory at Bayern. That failure to land Hudson-Odoi might not seem so bad after all if he does.

The promising 20-year-old took in just one appearance at the tournament, but a star showing was put in during a 0-0 draw with England at Wembley. Gilmour's potential has now been noted around the world, with a loan move away from Stamford Bridge being mooted, but Kovacic expects the youngster to be a key part of the Blues' plans for many years to come. Croatia star Kovacicsaid of Gilmour,who saw his Euros cut short by a positive Covid-19 test and Scotland's group-stage elimination: ""Unfortunately I didn’t get the chance to play against Billy but I did talk with him on the phone as soon as it came out that he was positive. ""Of course I was very sad about that because he is doing excellently and he is my team-mate. I felt sad for him. ""He has had an excellent season and his qualities cannot even be brought into question. He is still a young player but he has played a lot of good matches for Chelsea and for his national team. ""He is definitely going to be one of the better players for Chelsea and an important player for Chelsea in the near future."" Kovacic,who provides competition for places in Chelsea's engine room, added: ""I have seen Billy’s abilities from the first time he started training with the first team. ""He can become a really excellent player, so it is up to him to work hard and to get better with each day.I am sure that, with his personality, he is going to do that.""  Gilmour took in another 11 appearances for Chelsea last season, to go with the 11 he made in 2019-20. His progress has been stunted by a lack of regular game time, with exit talk being sparked in west London as a result. Thomas Tuchel has talked up Gilmour's potential, but has found it difficult to work an emerging talent into his plans.

Gilmour was left on the bench for Scotland's disappointing 2-0 defeat to their Czech Republic in their opening fixture at the European Championship, but Steve Clarke drafted the 20-year-old into his starting XI for their subsequent clash with England. Scotland battled to an impressive 0-0 draw at Wembley to keep their hopes of progressing to the last 16 alive, with Gilmour producing a man-of-the-match display, but he will now be forced to go into quarantine after contracting coronavirus. The Scottish Football Association (SFA)has confirmed that the midfielder will sit out the meeting with Croatia atHampden Park on Tuesday night after the latest round of medical checks in the national team camp. ""The Scottish FA can confirm that a member of the Scotland national team playing squad, Billy Gilmour, has tested positive for Covid-19,""the official SFA statement reads. ""Having liaised with Public Health England since the positive test was recorded, Billy will now self-isolate for 10 days and therefore miss tomorrow’s UEFA Euro 2020 Group D match against Croatia at Hampden."" We can confirm that Billy Gilmour has tested positive for COVID-19.Having liaised with Public Health England, Billy will now self-isolate for 10 days and therefore miss tomorrow’s UEFA EURO 2020 Group D match against Croatia at Hampden.https://t.co/lRNWvckqCK Scotland still have an outside chance of reaching the knockout stages as one of the four best third-placed teams in the six groups if they beat Croatia. However, even if they make it through, Gilmour will play no part in the round of 16, which will kick off on June 26 and end three days later. It is not yet known who the third-placed teams could face in the next stage, but if Scotland were to advance to the quarter-finals, the Chelsea star could be eligible to return subject to a negative Covid-19 test - with the last-eight ties due to begin on July 2.

As first reported by Goal, Chelsea won the race to sign Gilmour in 2017 amonga host of superclubs ahead of his 16th birthday by offering him a pathway into their first-team. Still just 19, the midfielder recently made his Scotland debut and has established himself as a senior player at his club, but Strachan admits that upon meeting Gilmour, he told him to stay at Rangers. ""I remember meeting him when he came along to Scotland training,"" Strachan told Goal, speaking at Betfair’s Euro 2020 launch. ""Everyone was asking me to have a word with him to keep him in Scotland. I had that talk and it didn’t work! ""I remember meeting him at Hampden as well and he was just a small, skinny wee lad, buthe was determined to follow his own path, not what coaches were telling him. He was like at 15, right I am off to Chelsea. ""It can be scary. I had a chance to join Manchester United as a young boy and I joined Dundee at 16. Luckily, I got the chance again as a man. If you look at it, you can get to the top in many different ways. It is up to you how you go about it. ""There will be hurdles but you smash you way through it. Look at all these players like Harry Kane, Phil Foden, Andy Robertson and John McGinn, they all had different problems in their life but made it. ""Kane did it on loan, or be like Phil Foden and stay and watch the great players. He has become a brilliant footballer himself. There’s not a set way to get to the top."" Having started just five games for Thomas Tuchel, the exciting young midfielder will hope for more next season despite ending the season with a Champions League medal. Golmour considered a loan move in January in a bid to make the Steve Clarke's squad for the European Championships, but Tuchel opted to keep him around despite an offer from Southampton. He got more games at the end of the season due to injuries to N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic. His talents haven't got unnoticed by his rivals either,with England, Czech Republic and Croatia in his country's Euros group. ""He’s a great talent,"" Foden said when asked about Gilmour ahead of the international tournament. ""He is still so young, still a lot to learn. I’ve played against him a few times and every time I’ve played against him I’ve been impressed. He is definitely going to be a great player in the future and he will be a great player for Scotland.""

The 18-year-old attacking full-back has just one year left on his contract at Stamford Bridge and the European champions are trying to convince him to sign a new deal amid the interest. However, the Blues'attempts to sign Inter's Achraf Hakimi could lead the homegrown star to explore alternative options, even if Paris Saint-Germainare strong favourites to win the race for the Morocco international. Simply winning the youth player of the year award at Cobham puts him in the company of Mason Mount, Billy Gilmour, Conor Gallagher, Fikayo Tomori, Reece James and Dominic Solanke. He has earned that title through 46 appearances over the last two seasons. In these outings, hehas 21 goal contributions, with four goals and 17 assists. Those numbers reflect his speed and creativity in matches, where he also provides important defensive contributions. Despite being born in England, he's eligible for a Portuguese passport, which is helping to attract clubs beyond the Premier League and Championship. It is nottoo late for Chelsea to sign Hakimi but they are set to be beaten to him by PSG, who are prepared to offer more money up front. The 22-year-old could end up costing around £60 million ($83m)which is just below the Serie A champions' initial asking price as they look to raise funds in financially uncertain times. Meanwhile, Chelsea's main focus remains on signing a world-class striker,with Tottenham's Harry Kane and Dortmund's Erling Haaland both primary targets. The deal has been described by sources as 'complicated' due to the reluctance of both clubs to sell them, as well asthe exceptionally high wages being demanded. There are a host of player sales going on behind the scenes, with loanees and fringe players to be offloaded before the new season. Another focus is on contract renewals for both Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen, which will accelerate after their participation at Euro 2020 ends.

218,https://www.goal.com/en/news/gianluca-busio-american-pirlo-serie-a-usmnt-debut/1y1zokna6c67w1uvtukpy0wd81,Gianluca Busio: 'The American Pirlo' set for Serie A after USMNT debut,"When Sporting Kansas City manager Peter Vermes began preparations for his team's2018 pre-season, he also formulateda plan for the club's teenage prodigy Gianluca Busio. In the 18 months or so since Busio had joined the club as a 14-year-old, he had impressed enough to earn a taste of training with the first team. And that was what it was supposed to be for the 15-year-old: a taste. ""I remember when he first came to his first pre-season with us, I had a plan already set out on what it was gonna be like after pre-season,"" Vermes tells  Goal. ""I had a plan for what he was going to do with our second team and what he could maybe do with our first team. ""As soon as the pre-season was over, I had to tear up the plan because he already outgrew it!"" In the years since, Busio has continued growing and growing and growing. He made his professional debut for Sporting Kansas City IIjust after that 2018 pre-season finished, two months shy of his 16th birthday. Just nine days after turning 16, he made his first-team debut in the U.S. Open Cup, with an MLS debut following shortly after. He hasmade 61 appearances between the ages of 16 and 19, steadily going from reserve to starter to star for a Sporting KC team that remains an MLS Cup contender. All of these landmarks were reached faster than many imagined, with plans were torn up over and over again to accommodate a player that simply cannot stop getting better. He made his U.S. men's national team debut on Sunday, coming on as a substitute and making quite an impression in front of a home crowd during the team's Gold Cup opener against Haiti. In that debut, he shone, instantly stepping on the field and looking a class above even some of his more experienced team-mates. A post shared by Gianluca Busio (@_gianlucabusio) And, as that USMNT career starts, it appears his MLS career may be nearing its end. Busio looks to have abig-money transfer on the horizon, with several clubs in Serie A linked with a seven-figure deal for the 19-year-old. ""I’ve done a lot at a young age,"" Busio said ahead of his USMNT debut. ""From when I signed when I was 15, I always wanted to make my national team debut. This is the next step for me. ""When you’re 15, you just think about getting on the field and making your debut for your MLS team. A couple of years later, you’re trying to get into the starting lineup and be a consistent starter. I did that this year, and now my goal is to make the national team - and that’s what happened. ""This is a big step for me and, throughout my career, I’ve been really lucky with these accomplishments at such a young age. I’m lucky to have that happen and I’m excited for what’s next. I think my next step is going to be even bigger and I’m looking forward to it."" So too are many throughout American soccer, who have watched Busio's growth since he was 14. The midfielder has been in the spotlight for several years, as he became the youngest player since Freddy Adu to sign with an MLS club when he was awarded a Homegrown deal just a few weeks after his 15th birthday in 2017. And that iswhat makes his rise both rapid and steady. He's a player that has seemingly conquered every step of the American soccer pyramid before turning 20, but he hasalso been a player that fans have seen excel at each level along the way. Watching the teenager, it is easy to see how and why his ascent has occurred. Busio, who isis of Italian descent through hisBrescia-born father, has all the smoothness of the Italian game baked into his own skillset. He isincredibly calm on the ball and has the vision to match. He sees plays as they happen and seemingly always picks the right response. A bit of pressure? No matter. Busio just turns, glides and moves the ball to where it needs to go. Having originally emerged as a more attacking midfielder, Busio has played just about everywhere for Sporting KC at some point or another. He has featured on both wings at times, as a No.10 and even as a 'false nine'. But, in recent years, Vermes has attempted to mould him into a different type of player. In Busio, he sees a deep-lying playmaker, a No.6. He sees a player similar to Andrea Pirlo or Jorginho, one that can dominate his game all by himself. A post shared by Gianluca Busio (@_gianlucabusio) ""The one thing that he can do at the six is that he has an incredible engine,"" Vermes says. ""He's dynamic and has athleticism, so he can cover a ton of ground. ""He's incredibly, incredibly good on the ball. You can use him in the build-up, you can use him on the counter. He can give the final pass. ""You know how Pirlo was a deep-lying playmaker? He has those qualities in him and at the same time, he's got a pop from distance. He also can then adapt and be a ball-winner and grind the game out if he has to from a defensive perspective. Just his progression in one-v-one defending in certain games, it's astounding for me."" Even with thoseskills already at a highlevel, Vermes says Busio's biggest assets are on the mental side. He often doubles back to mention Busio's humility and also his passion, saying that those aspects have helped him get this far, this fast. But no player is a finished product at 19. Even the best continue to learn, and Busio still has growing to do and other plans to ruin. And, when asked, Vermes is able to pinpoint one weakness: respect, and not a lack of it. There are times, Vermes says, where Busio does notknow how good he is, does notunderstand what he can do if he simply decides to do it. He remembers watching Busio play Teqball as an academy player and be hesitant, afraid of embarrassing his team-mates. That attitude, in some ways, has stayed with him inthe professional game, and Vermes is eagerly waiting for the day that Busio simply stops caring about what others may think. ""He scores this incredible free-kick,"" Vermes says reflecting on a stunner Busio scored against the Houston Dynamo earlier this year. ""We were training the day before, and I told one of my assistants that if he gets a free-kick, I'llguarantee he's going toscore it.He's just so good at it. He's precise and you can just see it.You could just see it was coming. ""The key was is he going to step up and say, 'Hey, I got it,' because he's respectful of the other guys around him. We have Johnny Russell, [Alan] Pulido, who have been around the game longer than he has. ""He'srespectful of that, but when he decides that he doesn't have to do that anymore, and it's when he decides because he cando that right now, I think that's the thing. It's just him saying, 'It's now me, my turn, my time, and I don't have to be respectful of everyone else around me'."" In some ways, that will be key to Busio'snext step, which is set to come sooner rather than later. He is reportedly closing in on a move to Venezia, with  MLSSoccer.com  reporting that the newly-promoted Serie A side have offered $7 million (£5m) anda sell-on percentage to sign him away from Sporting KC. For his part, Busio has seemingly beenunfazed, having carried on making his mark with Sporting KC and, now, the USMNT. A post shared by Gianluca Busio (@_gianlucabusio) “That stuff will figure itself out, I think. I have people around me who can handle that for me,” Busio said. “My main focus is just on playing soccer, and right now I'm focused on the Gold Cup and playing as well as I can.” Good things have happened for Busio in the years since that pre-season trip. His steady rise has seen him climb higher and higher, surpassing expectations while creating new ones along the way. And now, he ispushing towards a new level, one loaded with senior internationals and European stars. In Vermes' eyes, he's more than ready for it. ""He doesn't get mixed up in what club is going to buy him and understands that everything is centered around him playing well,"" Vermes says.""Ithink he's a person of the present. He just really understands the situation and he just loves the game, which is a big piece of why he is who he is. ""He really loves the game. He knows the game of soccer internationally, follows the Champions League, follows everything and he's very aware of how he fits into that landscape and what he wants as a player. ""He's a kid that I know is going to hit anincredibly high ceiling. His ceiling is incredibly high because of what I have seen him do over the lastfour years orfive years, ""It'sbeen a consistent progression and evolution in his playthat has been just nothing but positives.""

219,https://www.goal.com/en/news/burak-ince-turkish-teenager-eyed-europe-biggest-clubs/1rewl79fd0vm01m5qjvdgcn5kc,Burak Ince: Turkish teenager being eyed by Europe's biggest clubs,"They might not be as well known to the wider world as thegiants of Galatasaray, Besiktas or Fenerbahce, but in the landscape of Turkish football, second-division side Altinordu are playing an important role. The club's motto translates as""Good person, good citizen, good player"", citing Altinordu's ambition to produce both well-educated and highly-talented footballers through their top-tier academy system. In recent years, their success rate has been growing. Both Cengiz Under and Caglar Soyuncu began their footballing journeys with the Izmir-based club, and have sincegone onto become key figures in the Turkey national team as well as quality performers in Europe's top five leagues. That conveyor belt of talent is showing no signs of slowing down, either. Highly-touted 18-year-old centre-back Ravil Tagir is already a Turkey Under-21 international and has a handful of Super Lig appearances under his belt having left Altinordu for Istanbul Basaksehir in the summer of 2020, while 19-year-old striker Enis Destan is expected to move on this summer having netted 14 goals in all competitions last season. Perhaps the jewell in the crown, though, is 17-year-old play-making midfielder Burak Ince, who has a number of the continent's top clubs on alert thanks to his mesmeric ability with the ball at his feet. Already the youngest player to both appear and score in the Turkish second division, having done both at the age of 15, Ince has gone onto become a regularin the Altinordu first team over the past two seasons. A post shared by Burak İnce (@burakincee17) Having made 24 appearances, scoring two goals, during the 2019-20 campaign, he stepped up again last term, netting six times in 30 games across all competitions. Those performances have already seen Ince make his debut for Turkey's U21s, though his development comes as no surprise to those who have watched him grow since joining Altinordu at the age of 11 from his hometown club of Manisaspor. ""Ince has a very bright future ahead of him,"" long-time Altinordu manager, HuseyinEroglu, told reporters.""I have been following his development since the academy years. ""As a club, we want to loan some of the young players out in order for them to play more. However, it was clear since day one that Burak Ince hadexceptional talent. Therefore, I wanted him to stay with us."" Though he can play deeper, Ince is most at home when playing as a No.10, with his dribbling and passingbelying his lack of experience. He also possesses superb set-piece ability, with his culturedleft foot ensuring he is a threat whenever free-kicks are given around the edge of the opposition's penalty area. Yaş 15, mesafe 25, gol enfes...👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 #Burakİnce pic.twitter.com/7fhOt5XLRM ""We were playing against Ankaragucu in a friendly game before the season,"" Eroglu recalled.""We earned a free-kick in the second half and all the experienced players gathered around the ball to take the kick. But I wanted Ince to take it because I have followed him for so long, andI know his strengths. ""He took that free-kick and he scored. In that game, I made him feel that he is a talented player and he has my full support. That isvery crucial in the process of player development."" Turkish football, of course, has had something of a love affair with left-footed playmakers in recent times, be that Galatasaray legend Gheorge Hagi or Fenerbahce icon Alex de Souza, and unsurprisingly Ince is being compared with those players. David Silva has also been mentioned as a potential comparison for Ince, whose fleet-footedness and willingness to get into the penalty area were likely picked up when watching his footballing idol, Lionel Messi. ""My biggest strengths for me are my shooting and dribbling ability,"" he said when interviewed while playing for Turkey's U19s. A post shared by Burak İnce (@burakincee17) ""I would like to play regularly in Altinordu first team and then I want to go to Europe. I like the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League. ""I also dream of playing for Barcelona one day."" No doubt Barca will be aware of Ince's talents, though they have not been credited with interest in signing him. The same cannot be said for the likes of Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, though, with reports suggesting they are all keen on the teenage star, while the teams such as Sevilla, Bayer Leverkusen and Galatasaray are also rumoured to be in the hunt. In the meantime, Ince, who stands at just 5'10"" (178cm), is looking to improve his physicality while maintaining his high performance level at Altinordu. If he is able to do that, then one of Turkish football's most important, if unheralded, clubs will have produced yet another potential superstar. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

220,https://www.goal.com/en/news/cosimo-marco-da-graca-juventus-teenage-goal-machine-chelsea/6aro3uqmlbxa11wi75gze5m45,Cosimo Marco Da Graca: Juventus' teenage goal machine that Chelsea missed out on,"As speculation continues to swirl regarding the future of Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus, plans are already being made in Turin as to how the Bianconeri will replace the five-time Ballon d'Or winner whenever he eventually departs. Of course, with Ronaldo's wages off their books, Juve could always try to make yet another splash in the transfer market. But there is also the possibility that they look internally, and right now they have a teenager in their ranks whose goal record at youth level suggests he could, at least in part, help fill the void that Ronaldo will undoubtedly leave at the Allianz Stadium. Cosimo Marco Da Graca's form in Juventus' Primavera (Under-19s) side last season was certainly enough to catch the eye of Andrea Pirlo, who included the teenager in a number of matchday squads during his sole season in charge of the first team. Da Graca scored 15 goals in just 17 league games for the Primavera side, finding the net, on average, every 65 minutes he was on the pitch. That saw him earn a first shot at playing senior football in Serie C for Juve's U23s, while he made the first-team bench on 10 occasions, though that number could have been more had he not suffered an injury late in the campaign. And though he made it onto the pitch just once, for the closing minutes of January's Coppa Italia quarter-final win over SPAL, there is real hope around Juventus that in Da Graca they have a special attacking talent. If that comes to pass, then Juve will be rewarded for the bet they made on the youngster after bringing him to Turin from his hometown club of Palermo. A post shared by Marcocosimoda (@da_graca_marco) Da Graca joined the Sicilian outfit at the age of 12, and for the first couple of years within the Palermo academy structure played as a winger. It was not until he was 14 that he was moved inside to play as a central striker, owing to a growth spurt that meant that he was suddenly a physically imposing threat for opposition defenders to deal with while also possessing great attacking instincts. His performances caught the eye of Juve, who continued to monitor his progress until, in 2018, they offered to take Da Graca on loan to get a closer look. He was partnered up front in the Bianconeri's U17 side with fellow 2002-born striker Mirco Lipari, and it was he who looked to be the player with the potential to go on and break into the Juventus first team. Lipari scored 20 goals in 22 games in 2018-19, while in comparison Da Graca found the net on just four occasions while also providing five assists. Juve knew they could only keep one in their academy structure, and opted to sign Da Graca permanently for a fee of around €600,000, while Lipari was sent on loan to Empoli, where he is still waiting to make his senior bow. A post shared by Marcocosimoda (@da_graca_marco) Da Graca's technical ability is what swung it, and in the two seasons since the rangy forward has kicked on, with his progress having not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Chelsea pushed hard to sign Da Graca, who only turned 19 in May, around the turn of the year, scouting him extensively despite the Covid-19 restrictions before considering making a huge contractual offer to the teenage forward. Juve realised they needed to move quickly to tie him down, with Federico Cherubini - who has since been promoted to football director to replace Fabio Paratici - instrumental in tying Da Graca down to a new contract in April that will keep him at the club until 2024. It remains to be seen whether the Italy youth international, who is also eligible to represent Portugal through his parents, will remain at Juve this season or be sent out on loan to gain experience, but sources have described Da Graca to Goal as a player who trains until he is reaching exhaustion so as to improve himself. A post shared by Marcocosimoda (@da_graca_marco) It does not hurt to have Ronaldo around to learn from, either, though some of Europe's other elite forwards are who Da Graca is modelling his game on. ""I would go with [Robert] Lewandowski,"" he told Juventus TV when asked about his footballing idols, ""because technically there are few like him. ""From [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, I would take character and determination, as that is important. He always gives strength, courage and spirit."" On being at Juve, he added: ""The emotion is strong and indescribable. Everything still amazes me: the staff, the managers, the team-mates."" Da Graca, though, does not play like a young man who is overawed by his surroundings. And with returning manager Massimiliano Allegri always keen to give youth a chance during his first spell in charge, the chances of him making an impact in coming months and years are pretty high.

222,https://www.goal.com/en/news/conte-secret-weapon-sterling-chelsea-comeback/1nf9fak9j16rb1cvig3kja22h4,Conte's secret weapon Sterling makes Chelsea comeback after 13 months out,"Chelsea's Dujon Sterling is back after 13 months out through injury and illness to try to realise the potential that saw him picked out by Antonio Conte to trainwith the first-team. The 21-year-old was seen as one of the best talents to come from Cobham Training Centre and his ability to excel at wing-back had alerted Conte to his potential. However, his career has since stalled after two loan spells at Coventry and Wigan, but nowhe is back with Chelsea's Under-23s following 13 months on the sidelines. The Blues are now looking to facilitate the academy graduate's return after bringing him in to face Derby and Arsenal in the last few weeks for Andy Myers's development squad. Ultimately, he has designs on reaching his full potential having arguably outshone all his colleagues in Chelsea's FA Youth Cup final win over Man City in 2016. On the pitch that day were Jadon Sancho, Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Brahim Diaz. After Maurizio Sarri replaced Conte, the youngster decided to move on loan to work with his former academy coach Adi Viveash at Coventry. That successful loan spell saw him play 40 times before joining Wigan to replace Reece James the following summer. James, who had been behind Sterling in the pecking order at Chelsea, would be called up for Frank Lampard's first-team after the west Londoners suffered a transfer ban. Sterling only played 10 matches for Paul Cook's side in the Championship after suffering a nasty hamstring tear in the FA Cup away at Leicester City. Without playing for the Latics again, Sterling was preparing for a summer loan move but catching coronavirus then another non-Covid illness set him back. It is understood that there were genuine fears for his career, only for him to return. Even though Sterling is back, he isn't with Thomas Tuchel's first-team and U23 football is seen as a better vehicle to manage his return to action at the moment. Sterling hinted at his issues in a Tweet following his side's recent 2-2 draw with Arsenal, where he played out of position at centre-back. He wrote: ""The light at the end of the tunnel. I am blessed to be back playing 90 mins last night. 2020 was a huge challenge for me physically and mentally with injury and illness sidelining me for the year, but I’ve come through healthier and stronger. Keep pushing and never give up!"" Chelsea will have to decide on Sterling's future with just one year left on his current deal. The Blues are open to renewing the contract of the academy star who has been with the club since he was just six years old. However, Sterling is keen to return to first-team football next summer and is hoping to attract the attention of Tuchel, who is using wing-backs at the moment, through good training performances and U23s displays. Tuchel has spoken of how he will take an interest in Chelsea's academy, while Joe Edwards and Anthony Barry on the German's coaching staff know Sterling well. Edwards coached Sterling to a host of honours at youth level and Barry was on Cook's staff at Wigan before joining Chelsea this summer. If Chelsea decide not to keep Sterling around, he will likely go on loan in the Championship or be sold permanently to a Premier League rival. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

223,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-hotshot-broja-reveals-why-he-chose-albania-over/1i9z8r042l8kx1fjczxx07xfaj,Chelsea hotshot Broja reveals why he chose Albania over England,"Chelsea striker Armando Broja has revealed why he has opted for Albania over England at international level ahead of a meeting between the two sides in a 2022 World Cup qualifier on Sunday. The 19-year-old, who is on loan with Vitesse in the Netherlands, featured for Edoardo Reja’s side on Thursday when they got off to a winning start in World Cup qualification with a 1-0 win against Andorra. Although born in Slough, Broja explained his reasons for opting for the land where his parents were born instead. ""It is a big decision, of course, when you choose your country to play for,"" Broja toldGoal. ""I went for it because I have got Albanian blood in me, I am Albanian, my parents are Albanian so it was an easy decision. ""I thought I would love to make the people there proud and make my parents proud. I wanted to lift Albania up as a country to get us to the World Cup or Euros. That’s the biggest thing for them. ""If we got to the World Cup, it would be crazy and we would make history. We have never got there before so it would be something crazy as a country, you know. ""My parents are Albanian, I am Albanian and I have a lot of family in Albania. I visited there every year so it is really a big part of my life."" Broja was capped at youth level with Albania, for the Under-19s and U21s, scoring eight goals in eight games. Those strikes helped his Chelsea career along, pulling him out of a slump after he lost confidence moving up to the U18 side. ""In the first year of U18s, I was 17 and I wasn’t having the greatest season,"" he said. ""I scored two goals all season so I was really down. ""I was even missing shots in training, so I didn’t play a lot. Then, I had a boost from my mum and dad that Albania called me to play with them in the summer. ""It was the U19s, so I thought it would be good to go there and get some confidence, in a different team with different players, to get my mind away from Chelsea where the season wasn’t the best. I went to Albania, played four games and I scored six goals so I felt good. ""I was scoring, playing well and Chelsea saw it. Before the start of the season, I played in Albania’s U21s against Wales in my debut. I came on at half-time and I scored within two minutes of coming on. I scored again 10 minutes later and I was feeling good and sharp and we were winning 2-0. I came off and we won. ""I felt good and I had a big confidence booster. I felt really good in pre-season with Chelsea and they saw what I achieved ahead of my second year of the youth team. I really hit the ground running and I made sure it was a good year for me. ""I went there and I scored two goals in each of my first two games and carried on scoring. It kickstarted and continued until I am here now. It is good I had that period going down to go back up. You learn a lot in that time that it is not always easy."" Broja became Chelsea's No.1 academy striker, earning his productive loan move to the Netherlands. The forward is attempting to help his side qualify for Europe and have a chance to win silverware with a KNVB Cup final place against Ajax to come. ""To be a full international at 19 is something many players have done but also a lot of others haven’t done,"" he added. ""Yes, it is good because as a player from Chelsea, they also expect a lot from me in Albania. ""They expect my quality to help the team so it is good to be in these types of games and, at the end of this month, we are playing against England. So, in these games, I can really showcase my potential. ""So, it is another stepping stone in my career where I have gone and become a full international. It is something special to play for my country."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

They will subsequently face Arsenal and Tottenham in front of almost-full stadiums as part of a series of matches to raise funds for Mind, the UK's leading mental health charity, and the three club's respective foundations. As first revealed by Goal, prior to these matches, Chelsea have a summer training camp in Ireland following their returnto training on the week commencing July 5. Below, webringyou all you need to know aboutthe Blues plans for pre-season and who will be involved... Chelsea began their pre-season match action with a behind-closed-doors friendly against Peterborough, which they won 6-1. That game was set to be followed by a similar game against Drogheda United in Ireland, but the game was cancelled due to a suspected Covid-19 case in the Blues camp. After that, Tuchel's sideplayed Bournemouth on July 27, winning 2-1,before contesting 'The Mind Series'. They have over 70 senior players on contract, so they often arrange separate friendlies for a loan team to stay match fit ahead of summer moves. Chelsea's return from Ireland is ahead of a three-game London tournament named the Mind Series. However, before that they faced Scott Parker's Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium. The Blues began the Mind Series tournament by beating Arsenal 2-1 at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, August 1, before drawing 2-2 with Tottenham at Stamford Bridge three days later. Chelsea began their preparations without a host of key men, given the Blues had more representatives at Euro 2020 than any other club, while Thiago Silva reached the Copa America final with Brazil. They haveall beengiven extra time off to recover. However, Christian Pulisic returned earlyfrom international dutywith the United States to ensure that he has a proper pre-season. The American attacker has been joined in west London by severalother stars who did not participatein any major summer tournaments, including the likes of Hakim Ziyech, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi. The most interesting aspect of Chelsea's pre-season squad is that it contains a host of players who spent last season out on loan. They are now training under Thomas Tuchel–who took over as managerat the tail end of January–for the first time. Indeed, the first few sessions at Cobham featuredRuben Loftus-Cheek, Matt Miazga, Baba Rahman, Armando Broja, Malang Sarr, Davide Zappacosta, Danny Drinkwater, Conor Gallagher, Lewis Baker, Jake Clarke-Salter, Ian Maatsen, Trevoh Chalobah, Marc Guehi, Jamie Cumming and Ike Ugbo. Tuchelis offering everyone a clean slate, meaning everyone included in his pre-season plans will have a chance to impress before the club decides whether to make any major moves inthe transfer market. The same goes for both Dujon Sterling and Charly Musonda, who are back with the first team having had long spells on the sidelines with injury. We’re back. 👍📍 Cobham Training Ground pic.twitter.com/V47xj9mPuu Meanwhile, Andy Myers's development squad have friendlies away at Celtic, Derby County and Stoke City. They then face Portsmouth at Cobham ahead of away fixtures against senior non-league sides Woking and Boreham Wood. The Under-23s Premier League 2 season gets underway on the weekend of August14. Chelsea aren't thought to be close to bringing in many new faces, despite having long-held an interest in signing a world-class No.9. Dortmund's Erling Haaland and Tottenham's Harry Kane headup the Blues'shortlist of strikersbut both deals have been described as ""complicated"" by club sources. Elsewhere,Paris Saint-Germain beat Chelsea to the signing of former Inter wing-back Achraf Hakimi from Inter,after the Londoners were put off bythe Morocco international's wage demands. However, Chelsea still hold an interest in signing a central midfielder, andWest Ham's Declan Rice and Renneswonderkid Eduardo Camavinga are two possible targets. Chelsea could also snap upa central defender but they are awaiting the outcome ofcontract talks with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. That's because both of their deals expire in less than a year. Bayern Munich's Niklas Sule and Real Madrid's Raphael Varane are options that could be explored at a later date. The Blues did bring in Marcus Bettinelli, with the former Fulham goalkeeper signed to add depth in that department following the departure of Willy Caballero. Chelsea's season startsearlier than most,with their UEFA Super Cup showdown withVillareal at Windsor Park in Belfast earmarked for Wednesday, August 11. Just three days later, they welcomeCrystal Palace to Stamford Bridge for their opening Premier League match. That kicks off a difficult run of fixtures for Tuchel's side, who must face Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Tottenham and Manchester City in their following five games.

225,https://www.goal.com/en/news/broja-vitesse-loan-ampadu-fight-for-spot-under-lampard-at/kt17u3pimt1j1qknzq9dni0xp,Broja set for Vitesse loan move but Ampadu wants to fight for spot under Lampard at Chelsea,"Chelsea have been working on the futures of their young and wantaway stars while they attempt major transfers,with 18-year-old striker Armando Broja set for his first loan movein the coming months. Dutch club Vitesse are informally a feeder club for the Blues and Broja, who scored 19 goals in 31 games across various youth levels last season which led to his debut under Frank Lampard, is set to move to the Netherlands for next season. He will follow in the footsteps of the likes of Mason Mount and Nemanja Matic in joining the Eredivisie outfit. Alongside that, Ike Ugbo has agreed on a loan move to Cercle Brugge with a €5 million (£4.5m/$6m) option to buy placed on the youngster, who got 13 goals in 28 games for Roda JC in the Dutch second division last season. Tiemoue Bakayoko wants to join AC Milan, who are in talks over another loan deal. The Serie A giants are attempting to talk down the option to buy price from the €42.5 million (£38m/$46m) that Monaco refused to use last season, to as low as €22m (£20m/$26m). It will likely settle at around €35m (£32m/$41m) with a loan fee of approximately €3m (£2.7m), with his £100,000-a-week wages being paid in full. Bakayoko is on a Chelsea contract with two years left to run. Meanwhile, despite having had a host of loan offers for next season, Ethan Ampadu is keen to try and impress Frank Lampard in training sessions, putting any moves on hold. Lampard is understood to be a huge fan of the 19-year-old who was on loan at RB Leipzig last season, but arrived into Stamford Bridge with the youngster having already agreed to a Bundesliga move. Chelsea have yet to push Ampadu to look for a loan out of west London for another season, leaving the door open for his stay, but the situation is subject to change with a host of major transfer targets being pursued in the market. Michy Batshuayi's representatives are looking to get him out of Chelsea and have sounded out Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds United over a potential move, with the newly-promoted side seeking a striker. Bielsa worked with Batshuayi at Marseille, but it is thought that there are more suitors for the Belgium international whose contract expires next summer. Trevoh Chalobah has completed a medical after a year at Huddersfield Town and he will join Ligue 1 club Lorient. Jake Clarke-Salter is another who has offers from abroad, as well as the Championship, after an impressive season with Birmingham City. Rennes have enquired about taking Fikayo Tomori on loan next season as new sporting director Florian Maurice has been tracking the Chelsea star for some time. However,  Lampard's side have paused any decision on Tomori's future leaving the Ligue 1 club waiting after their initial contact. Furthermore, Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia has turned a €15m (£13.5m/$18m) buy-back clause for Jeremie Boga at Sassuolo into a sell-on clause which is understood to be between 10 and 15 per cent. Boga is still looking to leave Sassuolo this summer with Napoli and Roma leading the queue, with Atalanta recently registering an interest. Premier League clubBrightonalso feature, with further options in France. Sassuolo will have a meeting about Boga next week and Chelsea look set to earn a portion of the €30m (£27m/$35m) asking price should he be sold. Chelsea have already brought back several of their loanees to Cobham training centre to give them a pre-season with fixtures to be announced. The Blues are chasing major pieces of transfer business alongside their outgoing options, with Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz and Leicester City's Ben Chilwell continuing active talks.

226,https://www.goal.com/en/news/armando-broja-chelseas-teen-star-next-vitesse-success-story/1c6zi1r7cwpbf18n2enl172d56,Armando Broja: Chelsea's teen star the next Vitesse success story?,"The path between Chelsea and Vitesse is a well-trodden one. The Blues' arrangement with the Eredivisie side is no secret. Each year at least one young player from Stamford Bridge is sent on loan to earn first-team minutes in the Dutch top-flight. It is a relationship that has borne fruit for both teams. Mason Mount, Nemanja Matic and Dominic Solanke have all gone onto become full internationals following their spells at Vitesse while Matt Miazga and Lewis Baker were part of the Vitesse side that won the KNVB Cup for the first time in their history in 2017. The latest Chelsea youngster to be sent to further his footballing education in Arnhem is striker Armando Broja, who completed his season-long loan move to Vitesse earlier in the transfer window. Broja, 18, has already scored two goals in his first two friendly appearances for his new club, and a memorable off-season could be about to get a whole lot better after earning a first call-up to the senior Albania squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches. A suspension carried over from a red card in his last outing for his country's Under-19s will rule him out of Friday's clash with Belarus, but a debut could be on the cards on Monday against Lithuania. Broja was born in the Berkshire town of Slough to Albanian parents, and began his footballing education at local amateur club Burnham Juniors. Having previously had trials at Reading and Fulham, he was just six whenTottenham took the decision to enrol him into their youth structure despite having come across Broja by chance. ""I went to a tournament with Burnham Juniors and there was a Spurs scout there watching,""he told Chelsea's official website. ""He actually came to watch another player in my team but I ended up winning Player of the Tournament and he took me on instead, so I went to Tottenham and signed for them."" Broja would, however, remain in north London for just two years before swapping Spurs for Chelsea following a number of impressive performances against the club he supported as a boy. ""I was at Spurs for two years from U8s until the end of U9s,"" he added. ""In those two years, we played Chelsea a lot and they really liked me as a player. That’s when I joined the academy."" Great 1-0 win vs Millwall in the FA Youth Cup quarter final happy to get a goal and progress to the semi final💙⚽️ A post shared by  Armando (@armando.broja) on Feb 28, 2020 at 11:22am PST Broja's mother would regularly make the 50-mile round trip to drive her son to training and matches in Surrey, though there were times that it seemed that the pacey forward would not break through. Having signed on as a first-year scholar in 2018, Broja spent much of the campaign on the bench for the club's U18s. During the following campaign, however, he began to showcase his true talents, scoring 19goals in 31appearances between the U18 and U23 sides. Having signed a new two-year contract in January 2020, he made his senior debut a month later as a substitute in a 4-0 win for Frank Lampard's side over Everton. That remains his only first-team appearance to date, though he hopes to do enough at Vitesse to persuade Lampard - who now possesses a fearsome forward line following a busy transfer window - to offer him more opportunities upon his return to England. ""I moved to the Netherlands for a year because another striker has signed for the first team of Chelsea,"" Broja told reporters, citing the arrival of Timo Werner at Chelsea. ""It's good for me too because I'm still young.In the Netherlands with Vitesse the first-team training is going very well and I am there for a year. ⚽️⚽️ @mijnvitesse A post shared by  Armando (@armando.broja) on Aug 23, 2020 at 6:32am PDT ""If I do well there, perform well and score lots of goals, I will return to Chelsea and have the opportunity to join the first team and also play in the Premier League."" Broja will be hoping to emulate his footballing hero, Ronaldo Nazario, during his time in Eredivisie, with the legendary Brazilstriker having scored 54 goals in 58 appearances for PSV before leaving for Barcelona in the mid-1990s. The teenager was regularly shown YouTube videos of the former Real Madrid and Inter star by his father, Xhevahir, and given his pace and physical stature, Broja has all the attributes to himself become a goalscorer of some repute.  He also citesChelsea legend Didier Drogba and five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo as role models, and if he can match either of their careers then he will do very well for himself. For now Broja is concentrating on doing what so many Chelsea youngsters have done previously: using his time at Vitesse to take the next step in his promising career.

That offer eventually proved to be enough for Serie A champions to part with a prized asset, with three previous bids being knocked back. Lukaku started to fear that a deal would never be done, leading to him seeking out talks with those at the centre of discussions as his heart started to head back to Stamford Bridge. Lukaku has told HLN of securing a return to Chelsea 10 years after he first linked up with the Blues: ""With Chelsea’s third offer, I knew it was serious and I wasn’t there anymore. ""Chelsea offered €110m plus [Davide] Zappacosta, but Inter said no, so I went to [Simone] Inzaghi’s office asking to find an agreement.” ""I was still at Inter, but my head was already in London. ""Inter pulled me out of sh*t, I would have only left the Nerazzurri for Chelsea.""  Chelsea first signed Lukaku back in 2011 when he was a promising teenager that had burst onto a senior stage at Anderlecht. He took in just 15 goalless appearances for the Blues before heading out on loan to West Brom and Everton, with a permanent move to Goodison Park made in 2014. With his stock continuing to rise, a big-money switch to Manchester United was completed in 2017 and Lukaku went on to become a member of the Premier League's 100-goal club. His qualities were never fully appreciated at Old Trafford, though, and he left for Inter after two seasons with the Red Devils. Two productive years in Italy delivered 64 goals in 95 appearances, along with a Serie A title triumph, and those exploits convinced Chelsea that he was worth another shot. The powerful 28-year-old is already up and running back in English football, with a debut goal recorded against Arsenal, and the expectation is that he will help to fire the Champions League holders into contention for a Premier League title in 2021-22.

The striker swept in from full-back Reece James' cross to kickstart the Blues' 2-0 victory in his first start since rejoining the club from Inter. While the finish was straightforward, he did well to hold up the ball in the build-up before making a darting run beyond Gunners goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Lukaku entered the match with 113 career PremierLeague goals, though none in the 10 domestic appearances he made during his first stint at Stamford Bridge. ""Yes, that one was the best [Premier League goal]for me,"" Lukaku said on beIN SPORTS. ""You guys know how emotional it was today. This one is the best of the lot. Obviously, it was only a tap-in but the build up was nice so for me this one was the best. ""It took five minutes or so to understand the movements of my team-mates but I asked a lot of questions. To be honest, this group is very, very talented and hungry. ""It was easy for me to fit in because I played this way with the Belgian national team. The coach prepared us well and we came in with confidence and got a good result."" ""I am very happy with how he has integrated already, a very smart guy who likes to be in the group,"" Tuchel told Sky Sports.""He is very democratic leader, talks to everyone, friendly and is totally competitive. He gives us something we did not have, to protect balls. You cannot start better than a goal and he assisted some chances.""I didn't expect too much but I wanted to see his capability to adapt and to link up, that is what he did very good and the guys like to play with each other."" The £98 million ($136m) transfer fee it took for Chelsea to land Lukaku will add pressure on the striker to provide immediate goalscoring results - an expectation team-mate Timo Werner struggled with last year when he joined the Blues. Lukaku's quick goal could alleviate some of that stress, and the team's perfect start to the campaign won't hurt either. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Ronaldo scored his 110th and111th international goals this week, moving two clear ofIran legend Ali Daei in the all-time men's scoring charts. At age 28, Lukaku has netted 66 times for Belgium, giving him an outside chance of eventually catching Ronaldo. But the Belgium star says any talk comparing him to the Portugal star is premature. ""Don't ever compare me to Cristiano Ronaldo, never,"" Lukaku said at a press conference ahead of Belgium's World Cup qualifier against Czech Republic on Sunday – a game in which he is set to earn his 100th cap. ""Cristiano Ronaldo is, for me, in the top three best players in the history of football,"" he continued.""I'm not going to rank him from first to third but he's in there. ""What he has achieved in football today for players of my generation is something exceptional. ""I was lucky enough to play against him in Italy and now that he's back in the Premier League, it's all good for English football. ""As for the rest, comparing statistics and all that, it's useless."" Ronaldo and Lukaku can be lumped in at least one category together: former Premier League stars who have left Italy andreturned to England this summer. After helping Inter to the Serie A title last year, Lukaku has come back to Chelsea in a£98 million ($136m) move. The forward has already started two Premier League matches for the Blues, scoring in his debut against Arsenal.

Jorginho has been tipped to win the prize after playing a major role in Italy's Euro 2020 triumph as well as Chelsea's Champions League win. But the formerAzzurri striker has claimed the midfield star agrees that the award should always go to Messi. “Remember when I said any journalist who voted for Jorginho as Ballon d’Or should have his licence taken away?” Cassano asked Christian Vieri on his Twitch channel. “Well, I was in Formentera with my family and just as I satdown, I felt a touch. ‘Antonio, you’re great!’ the voice says. I turn around to ask who he was, he took off his glasses and mask, and it was Jorginho! “I told him, Jorgi, can you believe the scandal if they should give you the Ballon d’Or and not to Messi? He replied that he absolutely agreed with me, Messi should always win it. “Now I admire Jorginho even more. We were talking for a good 90 minutes. He is an exceptional guy, very intelligent, humble and polite.” ThoughCassano claimsJorginho admitted he doesn't deserve the prize, the midfielder himself said last month he could be considered if voters prioritise trophies. ""We all have dreams,"" Jorginho toldSporTV.""But, I'll be honest, it depends on the criteria that the decision is based on. ""If we're talking about talent then I know I'm not the best in the world. But if it's going on titles, then nobody has won more than I have this season. ""How could I compare myself to Messi, Neymar or Cristiano Ronaldo? They've got completely different characteristics to me. But, I repeat, it depends on the criteria."" After the Ballon d'Or was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the award will handed out inDecember of this year.

Maurizio Sarri brought Jorginho with him from Napoli after he was named Chelsea manager, hoping the Italy international could run his midfield in London as he had in Naples. After some early struggles in London, Jorginho had to deal with talk that he was only in the lineup because of his relationship with his head coach. ""My start at Chelsea made me miss [Napoli] even more,"" Jorginho wrote in The Players' Tribune.""We all remember what they were saying, right? I was too slow. I was too weak. I was Sarri’s son. Man, it made me so angry. ""But listen, they underestimated me. You see, I’ve had a turbulent start at every club I’ve been with.Everyclub. It’s incredible. When I came to Verona, nobody wanted me. They sent me on loan to the fourth division. Nobody wanted me there either. ""But I kept working and I won respect. I went back to Verona and we went up to Serie A. I had a hard year at Napoli, too, and then Sarri came and changed everything. ""So the Chelsea stuff? Puh! I just used the criticism as fuel. I was thinking,These people are going to be embarrassed. ""And now I’m sitting here with a Europa League title and a Champions League title. So to all the critics, I just want to say one thing. ""Thank you. Really, thank you all."" Though Sarri lasted just one season at Chelsea, Jorginho is now entering his fourth campaign with the Blues having enjoyed a banner year in 2021 thus far. The 29-year-old helped Chelsea win the Champions League in May when they defeated Manchester City in the final. Less than two months later, he helped Italy win Euro 2020 when the Azzurri got pastEngland in the final.

Barcelonatrio Jennifer Hermoso, Lieke Martens and Alexia Putellas have all been nominated for the UEFA Women's Player of the Year, while Pep Guardiola, Thomas Tuchel and Roberto Mancini are the three Coach of the Year nominees. As for the Women's Coach of the Year,Lluis Cortes, Peter Gerhardsson and Emma Hayes are all in the running for the award.The winners will be revealed at the 2021-22 Champions League group-stage draw ceremony onAugust 26. Chelsea duo Jorginho and Kante are two of the nominees for the UEFA award after enjoying a stellar 2020-21 campaign that saw the Premier League club lift the Champions League. Both players started the Champions League final win over Manchester City, with Kai Havertz's first-half strike proving the difference between the two sides in Portugal. Tuchel's side also secured qualification for Europe's premier club competition for the 2021-22 campaign courtesy of their fourth-placed finish in the table, while they would also liftthe UEFA Super Cup by beating Villarreal.  In what was a remarkable year individually for Jorginho, the 29-year-old would also go on to win the European Championship with Italy. The third nominee for the men's award is Manchester City midfielder De Bruyne. Despite a season disrupted by injury, De Bruyne played a pivotal role to help City win the Premier League title, with his exploits seeing him awarded the PFA Player of the Year award for the second season in a row. The Women's list of nominees is comprised solely of Barcelona players. Hermoso, Martens and Putellashave all been recognised during a season that sawBarca Femeni storm to a 4-0 win over Chelsea in the Women's Champions League final. The trio all started that match in Gothenburg, withPutellas getting on the scoresheet, while they also won the Women's Primera Division title and the Copadel Reina, where they beat Levante in the final.   As for the Men's Coach of the Year, Tuchel, following his exploits with Chelsea after replacing Frank Lampard, is up for the award along with Manchester City boss Guardiola. Mancini, meanwhile, helped deliver European Championship glory for Italy and he completes the three-man shortlist. The Women's Coach of the Year nominees include, as expected, former Barcelona head coachCortes after he steeredthe Catalans to a treble-winning 2020-21 season prior to resigning from the role. Sweden women's national team bossGerhardsson is also included on the list, with his side earning a silver medal at the Olympics, narrowly losing the final to champions Canada on penalties. And the women's nomination pool is completed by Chelsea head coach Hayes, with the Blues winning the Women's Super League for the second season in a row, as well as claiming League Cup glory.

233,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-talks-atletico-madrid-saul-collapse-sevilla-kounde/6bpe141zc0ri17wrr7asb7sm5,Chelsea talks for Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul stall as Sevilla say Kounde will cost €80m,"Chelsea's hopes of a late transfer window signing have been rocked by the news surrounding both Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez and Sevilla's Jules Kounde. Having set out the terms for Saul, Atleti have had little response to their demands to add in a £34m (€40m) obligation to buy the 26-year-old. However, there remains a glimmer of hope if Chelsea meet their demands before the close of play. Meanwhile, in a press conference in Seville, club director Monchi has confirmed that Chelsea have missed an important deadline and must now pay the €80m (£68m) release clause for Kounde. ""Koundecan leave before midnight if anybody pays his clause, then we can do nothing. He has the same chance to leave as all his teammates,"" Monchi said. ""The only offer from Chelsea for Kounde was last Wednesday at around 5pm for an amount we didn't like. It was linked to Chelsea selling a player. It was a decent fee but it didn't meet our criteria. ""We responded with a counter-offer which had a deadline of Friday, to allow us to be able to sign a replacement. They did not respond to that counter-offer before Friday. Kounde's clause never went up to €90m. It has always been €80m. ""We all decided that it was best Jules didn't travel to Elche. It's normal for players to be affected by news of any kind. Last year he had the interest from City and now Chelsea this year."" The transfer window shuts at 11pm in the United Kingdom, leaving Chelsea with little time to seek alternative options. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been told that he is staying and Ethan Ampadu could also remain at the club to add depth to Thomas Tuchel's side. Callum Hudson-Odoi hashad a concrete offer from Borussia Dortmund over a loan move. Even though Hudson-Odoi has been an unused substitute in Chelsea's first three league games, his move looks set to be blocked. Elsewhere, Chelsea will try to offload Malang Sarr, Ross Barkley and Lewis Baker on loan. Eintracht Frankfurt are known to have contacted Sarr over a possible move. Chelsea youngster Thierno Ballo has completed a medical ahead of a season-long loan move to Rapid Vienna in his native Austria. Tino Anjorin will move on loan to Lokomotiv Moscow, after Chelsea accepted a bid that includes a £17m option to buy. These lack of deals would leave Chelsea making a net profit of around £35m after this transfer window, having only signed Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Bettinelli.

234,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-summer-transfer-window-lukaku-saul-enough-win-title/j219w4fa08241xe2kigz04slw,Chelsea's summer transfer window: Are Lukaku and Saul enough to win the title?,"Chelsea may not have been the busiest team in this summer's transfer window, but they didachievetheir primary goal by signing Romelu Lukaku. The Inter striker's arrival in a deal worth£98 million ($136m) gives the European champions a whole new dimension up front, with Lukaku having already hit the ground running back with the Blues. He has joined at Stamford Bridge by Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez, who joined on loan after a frantic deadline day that saw the deal completed just minutes before the window closed. The only other signing that Chelsea have made was Fulham goalkeeperMarcus Bettinelli, while the club has been far more busy in trimming the squad both by selling and loaning out players. Thomas Tuchel, then, will be happy with the transfer window overall, though only time will tell as to whether the club should have added one or two more new faces. Chelsea's goal to sign a clinical striker was fulfilled by bringing Lukaku back to Stamford Bridge seven years after he originally left the club for Everton. The fee is a club-record sum, but the Blues were willing to pay it after the 28-year-old hadshown himself as being a complete striker while leading Inter to the Serie A title in 2020-21.  Saul, meanwhile,adds competition to the club's already world-class midfield options, with Jorginho, N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic already on their books. The move is a loan deal with an option to buy for £30m ($41m)  , allowing the Blues to 'try-before-they-buy' with a player who has suffered from a downturn inform overthe last two years. Bettinelli has been bought to replace Willy Caballero,  who grew tired of being a third-choice goalkeeper,and the 29-year-old will sit behind Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga in the pecking order. Chelsea, though, did not get everything they wanted out of the transfer window. They had bids knocked backfor both Sevilla centre-back Jules Koundeand Interwing-back Achraf Hakimi, who went onto sign for Paris Saint-Germain,meaning Reece James and Cesar Azpilicueta will make up the right-hand side of Tuchel's defence for at least the first half of the campaign. Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland was also explored as an option, but the Blues remain delighted to have secured Lukaku as their new No.9. On paper, Chelsea expertly sold a whole host of players and raised well over £130m ($179m) to end the window with a net profit. Although the likes of Davide Zappacosta and Tiemoue Bakayoko were sold at a loss to Atalanta and AC Milan, respectively,the Blues canpoint to other success stories. The overwhelming bulk of the transfer fees earned were fromselling academy players, with Tammy Abraham bringing in £34m ($47m) after moving to Roma. The likes of Fikayo Tomori (to AC Milan), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Tino Livramento (Southampton), Tino Anjorin (Lokomotiv Moscow)and Ike Ugbo (Genk) all brought in sizeable fees too.   However,  there are fears that Chelsea have let go of some exceptional young talents that they could regret losing in the future,and in the cases of Abraham, Livramento  andAnjorin,Chelsea have inserted buyback clauses into the deals,should they want to bring the players backto west London. It is alsonotable that  Kurt Zoumaleft the club in a £29.8m ($41m) move to West Ham,and having failed to sign Kounde as a replacement, losing Zouma could be a decision they live to regret. Olivier Giroud also left the club for AC Milan, but only for a nominal fee, with Lukaku an expensive but unquestionableupgrade. This year's 'loan army' includes Billy Gilmour (Norwich City), Emerson Palmieiri (Lyon), Michy Batshuayi (Besiktas), Danny Drinkwater (Reading), Armando Broja (Southampton), Ethan Ampadu (Venezia) and highly-rated teenage centre-back Levi Colwill (Huddersfield Town). Callum Hudson-Odoi, meanwhile,was ready to leave on loan himself having increasingly found himself out of Tuchel's plans.  The 20-year-old winger targeted a temporary move to Borussia Dortmund, but Chelsea rejected an offer from the Bundesliga outfitto keep the England international in their squad. The vast majority of Chelsea's contract renewals were for their 25-strong group of loan players as the clublookedto again protect their investments in the hope that those players can be sold for a profit down the line. They are, however,in talks to reward defenders Andreas Christensen,Antonio Rudiger andTrevoh Chalobah with new deals, with the latter having impressed since his promotion to the first-team squad.   Only Christensen is understood to be close to signing a new deal, with a four-year contract plus an option for an extra year on the table. There are fears, though, that Rudiger is ready to run his contract down with less than a year left on his current deal. Chelsea's team is undoubtedly stronger than it was last season, with Lukaku having replaced Abraham and Giroud,Saul having stepped into Gilmour's shoes, and Chalobah looking set to step up and cover for the sale ofZouma. They might be a little short of left-back coverafter Emerson's departure, but have extra bodies in other positions such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek, giving them enviable overall. depth And so while they have have fallen short of the starpower added to the likes of Manchester United and PSG's squads, one game-changing signing in Lukaku and another potentially very useful addition in Saul suggests a job well done. The potential regret that comes with selling so many talented youngsters hits their overall grade a little, but a B+ is still a solid return from a club who were already in a pretty good place.

Two men with 11 Ballons d'Or between them once illuminated a division stacked with world-class talent, but both are now plying their trade elsewhere - with Ronaldo back at Manchester United following three years at Juventus and Messi severing his career-long ties with Barcelona in order to join PSG. While two all-time greats have left opposing sides of a fierce Clasico divide, the draw of life at Santiago Bernabeu or Camp Nou remains strong and the expectation is that World Cup-winning forward Mbappe will end up in the Spanish capital at some stage. Former Madrid defender Albiol, who is now with Villarreal, has told AS when asked if Mbappe would be a welcome addition in La Liga: ""I would like to see him in the league, he is a great player, world-class and I think players like this are needed in the Spanish League after the departure of Cristiano and Messi - it is important that they come. ""And important for Real Madrid, which is a team that I have played for."" Another transfer window has closed for business, meaning that no deal will be done between Real and PSG this summer. The Blancos did, however, put a €220 million (£189m/$260m) offer on the table before the latest deadline passed, with a statement of intent made by those in the Spanish capital. Said advances were ignored in Paris, with there still a desire on the part of those at Parc des Princes to get a prized asset tied to a new contract. Mbappe is, however, due to hit free agency in the summer of 2022 and will be free to speak with any suitors from January, meaning that a change of scenery could still be on the cards. Real are waiting with open arms, as are Albiol and the rest of the Spanish top-flight, with another superstar attraction required in Spain in order to capture the imagination.

236,https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-is-winning-the-27-strong-race-to-buy-chelsea-fc-from/bltbf16e4d01725027e,Who is winning the 27-strong race to buy Chelsea FC from Roman Abramovich?,"Roman Abramovich's sale of Chelsea through US investment bank Raine Group enters the final stages with the last remaining bidders entering the fray. There are thought to be 27 billionaire consortiums, hedge funds and other high net worth players registering their monetary bids with their plans for the future attached. The deadline is on Friday at 9pm UK time (5pm EST) for the majority partners to officially submit their proposals and offers, at which point they will be narrowed down to just a few before a final decision is made. First of all, this is not necessarily a bidding war, with the winners to be chosen more on their ability to run a major sports organisation. Any offers to include part-fan ownership or a place on the board for supporters will be welcomed, but it won't be a requirement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). They also want potential buyers to commit to maintaining the activity in the women's team, academy and Chelsea Foundation. Alongside that, any proposals to develop Stamford Bridge, which remains small for a club of Chelsea's size would also be seen in a positive light. The first group to go public about buying Chelsea wereTodd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss, who have since added London property developerJonathan Goldsteinto their ranks. They have also brought in Danny Finkelstein, a former UK government adviser, and Barbara Charone, a PR executive with clients including Madonna, Rod Stewart and Foo Fighters, to their ranks as non-executive board directors should their bid become successful. The pair are two of the Blues' most high-profile supporters and regularly attend home matches. The Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball (MLB) team the Chicago Cubs, have linked up with hedge fund leader Ken Griffin to make an offer. Also from the United States is Woody Johnson, who owns the NFL's New York Jets. He is said to have launched a £2bn ($2.6bn) bid for the west Londoners. There's offers from the United Kingdom with Aethel Partners, a financial institution in London, offering a £2bn ($2.6bn) proposal with a further £50 million ($66m) to be immediately released to cover the costs of this uncertain period. Although UK-based, the firm is headed by Portuguese entrepreneur Ricardo Silva. London luxury property developer and Chelsea supporter Nick Candy has been very public about his interest in buying Chelsea. He is currently working with Blues legend Gianluca Vialli's company Tifosy Capital and Advisory to help raise funds. Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Member of Parliament, Chelsea supporter and former Athletics athlete, is in the running to buy the Blues with fellow fan and former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. Creative Artists Agency's investment bank Evolution Media Capital is also backing Broughton and Coe. There are fears that it could be seen as insider trading, with CAA owning the world's biggest football agency. Outside of the UK and US are other players, with the most notable option being Saudi Media. The private consortium led by Chelsea supporting Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is also the CEO of the parent company Engineer Holding Group. Although Alkhereiji has worked and lived in the UK for an extended period, it remains to be seen whether being from Saudi Arabia will adversely affect their bid. They have wide-reaching plans for Chelsea including replacing shirt sponsor Three with an option from the Middle East and redeveloping Stamford Bridge. South KoreanC&P Sports Group and Hana Financial Group have said they have made a bid.C&PCEO Catalina Kim said: ""We are preparing our bid. ""There has never been investment into a top tier football club made by South Korean capital before. It is time for a change.” Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak, chairman of AB Grup Holding, has been vocal in his interest and 'wants to fly the flag of Turkey at Stamford Bridge.' However, several sources have played down his role as a frontrunner. The FT have added that US investment company Oaktree have made an offer on Chelsea but sources close to the company refused to comment. British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously expressed an interest in buying Chelsea before securing French side Nice in 2019. However, he has since withdrawn his interest after Abramovich put the club up for sale. There are thought to be almost a dozen other bids that have yet to be made public. John Terry is leading a £250 million ($329m) from a secret 'True Blue' consortium to put the supporters at the heart of the club, through NFT and fan tokens.Similarly,agroup called ChelseaDAO (a decentralised autonomous organisation) says they are trying to buy a 10% stake to allow supporters a say through fan tokens using the cryptocurrencyEthereum. It is hoped that it will be completed sooner rather than later to minimise costs being felt at the club. Every day that the club is sanctioned is damaging the Blues's bottom line and could lead to cash flow issues further down the line. There's an appetite to do a deal quickly to ensure Chelsea can become unsanctioned again so the club can operate as normal as soon as possible. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

237,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-sale-turkish-billionaire-bayrak-misses-bid-deadline/blt9ba8805df3268537,Chelsea sale: Turkish billionaire Bayrak misses bid deadline due to email confusion,"Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak has revealed that confusion over an email address caused him to miss the deadline to make a bid to buy Chelsea. The Blues were put up for sale after sanctions were imposed on owner Roman Abramovich due to the oligarch's ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is currently overseeing an invasion of Ukraine. Bayrak had made his intention to buy the club public in recent weeks, but has said that he missed Friday's deadline to lodge an offer. In a statement to Reuters, Bayrak claimed that his company, AB Group Holdings, was unable to contact Raine Bank – those who are handling the sale – in time. He said: “There was a misunderstanding with the lawyers about the auction procedure of AB Group and we missed the deadline as a result. “There was confusion over an email address and we couldn't lodge the offer we wanted to buy Chelsea. “I'm really sorry for the confusion that has occurred.” It is thought that close to 30 different parties expressed an interest in buying the Stamford Bridge side, with that number set to be whittled down in the coming weeks. The UK government is involved in the process and have said that the highest bidder won't necessarily win the race, but rather the club will be sold to whomever is deemed to be able to add the most value to the club. It is currently unknown exactly when the new owners will be announced, but it is understood that all parties involved are keen to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. Indeed, it could be that an agreement is put in place before Chelsea return to Premier League action against Brentford on April 2, with club football set for a break due to international fixtures taking place.

238,https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-keen-for-best-distraction-of-international-break-amid/blt8f40f8b91aee52d7,Tuchel keen for 'best distraction' of international break amid Chelsea uncertainty,"Thomas Tuchel admits he is looking forward to the ""best distraction"" of spending time with his children during the March international break amid Chelsea's ongoing off-field chaos. The Blues are in the middle of a transitional phase exacerbated by heavy sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich in relation to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, as the Stamford Bridge outfit look for a new steward. Tuchel has managed to keep his side focused on results on the pitch amid uncertainty over whether they can even complete the season - but speaking ahead of his side's FA Cup trip to Middlesbrough this weekend, he acknowledges he is relishing a short break from the madness of the situation. ""Yes!"" the German stated when asked if he needed a break. ""It is my dog and my children, there will be long walks next week in the forest around here which is beautiful and hopefully the weather stays like this. ""Doing the normal stuff, taking care of the children and taking them to school and picking them up. Being around them is the best distraction I can have. I learned to do this, I had to. I found it very hard in the beginning as a professional coach, I struggled a lot with it actually. ""To not be able to switch off, think about it night and day. Everybody needs to disconnect, breathe and see clearer. I had to learn it for myself and I am still training myself. I need to be disciplined in it and like I said my dogs and kids help as a natural source of inspiration and enjoyment to calm down. You have to take care of yourself to not get totally lost in it. By the time Tuchel returns to lead Chelsea after a fortnight off from club action, the club may well have officially transitioned out of the Abramovich era to new ownershp - and he hopes that whoever ends up with the keys to Stamford Bridge will allow them to continue to chase silverware. ""If somebody buys a club for this amount of money, then it’s about challenging on the highest kind of level, then it’s about trophies, then it’s about winning and then its about being the best you can,"" he added. ""It’s not about developing a project, it’s not about making money with the club, because for me, and who am I, I don’t know the ideas behind a buying a club or any organisation for this amount of money, because I cannot afford it and I will never be able to afford it. ""But that’s what I hope and what I think, and I think Chelsea has a club and a structure and an organization has an awful to offer, and that’s why the price is like it is.""

GOAL and SPOX can confirm centre-back Sule will leave the German giants this summer when his contract expires, despite Bayern’s offer to raise his salary to €10 million. Sule is flirting with a move to the Premier League and La Liga and can enter negotiations with other clubs this month before making a free transfer at the end of the season. Newcastle and Chelsea are reportedly sounding out the German defender, but Sport1 has reported he is not interested in joining the former. Meanwhile, Barcelona are also said to be interested in signing the 26-year-old as they look to strengthen in defence. Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn confirmed at a press conference that Sule will not continue his career in Bavaria next season. “He didn't accept our offer,” said Kahn. “We have a certain responsibility for the offers we make. It's normal that you don't always come together in this business.” Kahn added that Bayern's offer was “Very, very good” and that Sule's decision to leave became apparent over the past few days. Sule will become the fourth player to leave the club on a free transfer within the last year, following the examples of David Alaba, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez. GOAL and SPOX understand Christensen is one of the contenders Bayern will turn to in their search for a replacement. Like Sule, Christensen can make a free transfer in the summer when his contract expires. Chelsea have been trying to tie him to an extension and a new four-year deal looked imminent last year, but talks have been fraught with problems. Coach Thomas Tuchel urged him to show his commitment to the club by signing on the dotted line, telling reporters in December: ""We are waiting since a long time now for confirmation. “It is on Andreas to act how he acts on the pitch, he needs to act now off the pitch, and walk the talk because he tells us that he loves Chelsea, he tells us that he wants to stay and be a big part, because he is a big part of a big club, and I think he is a perfect fit and I think that he is not done yet here.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

240,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-leicester-defender-fofana-rudiger-replacement/blt289da0613a2c5aa7,Chelsea consider Leicester defender Fofana as Rudiger replacement,"Chelsea are interested in Leicester City centre-back Wesley Fofana as they weigh up their transfer plans amid contract disputes with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. The 20-year-old is currently out injured after suffering a broken fibula and ankle ligament in a pre-season friendly against Villarreal. However, the France Under-21 international remains regarded among the best in his age group in world football, including by scouts behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea won't make a move for Fofana in January but will weigh up a big-money deal ahead next summer as they must wait and see how he recovers from serious injury, with a return slated for the next month or so. The Foxes will likely set a huge asking price on their prized asset, though, with his contract not due to expire until June 2025. Chelsea are also still interested in signing Sevilla's Jules Kounde having had a summer approach knocked back by the Andalusian club. The France international wanted to move to the European champions but they never met his asking price. Now, in January, Sevilla will not entertain any negotiations unless Chelsea force a move by hitting his £68 million ($90m) release clause. Juventus' Matthijs de Ligt has also been offered to the Blues ahead of a possible summer move, with the Italian giants open to a sale to remove his sizable salary from their wage bill. The focus on defenders comes with Chelsea having so far failed to renew the contracts of either Rudiger or Christensen. Real Madrid are leading the race for Rudiger, but the Blues remain more hopeful of keeping Denmark international Christensen at the club for a while longer despite having faced problems in negotiations. Their deals expire in June 2022, along with the contracts of Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva. However, the talks around the two more experienced defenders are likely to be easier than with the younger stars who are generating huge interest over a free transfer. Rudiger ❤️'s playing against Leicester...pic.twitter.com/oHKomc1eiA Chelsea are facing injury concerns in midfield and at left wing-back ahead of the January transfer window. In both areas, the plan is to bring players back from injury rather than dip into the transfer market. Ben Chilwell has suffered a partial tear to his anterior cruciate ligament and it is hoped that he can return by mid-January at the latest. Despite attracting loan interest in the winter window from teams in Serie A, Chelsea will block Malang Sarr's exit until they know whether Chilwell faces surgery. Sarr's few appearances for the Blues have attracted stronger interest in him after only receiving interest from Eintracht Frankfurt, Greuther Furth and Brest last summer. Manager Thomas Tuchel wants everybody in his squad to stick around and is moving players out of position to cover injury-hit areas. Saul recently played at wing-back with only Marcos Alonso available on the left but Tuchel is also willing to play Callum Hudson-Odoi or Azpilicueta in the role. Chelsea also have the option to recall Ian Maatsen who has excelled on loan at Coventry City in the Championship. In a similar vein, should Chelsea's midfield issues continue into January, they may opt to recall Billy Gilmour from his loan spell at Norwich City. There will also be a recruitment drive for English-based academy players in January after Brexit has curbed big clubs from dipping into the European market to boost their youth squads.

The Spain international can leave Stamford Bridge on a free transfer this summer when his contract expires. Barcelona believe they can lure him to Camp Nou in the next transfer window, GOAL can confirm, but Chelsea hope to tie him to a new deal. The 32-year-old refuses to comment on his next step, however, as he is concentrating on his side's Club World Cup clash against Al Hilal. Asked if he wants to stay at Chelsea beyond this season, Azpilicueta told reporters: ""I'm not going to speak about my future. We are one day before the semi-final of the tournament. ""Of course, I arrived in the summer of 2012 and I didn't have kids. My kids were born in London and you know how I feel about Chelsea. But I am not going to comment on my future."" Azpilicueta joined the Blues from Marseille in 2012 and has been a first-team regular ever since. The full-back, who took over as permanent captain in 2018, has made 457 appearances in all competitions and has won two Premier League titles and a Champions League crown. This term, he has played 17 times in the Premier League and featured in all six of his side's Champions League group games. Azpilicueta is not the only player whose future at Chelsea is in doubt. Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger could also leave for free at the end of the season, with both players yet to commit their future to the club.

242,https://www.goal.com/en/news/my-final-decision-ziyech-rules-out-morocco-return-as-chelsea/bltb5b0a42c959b6f55,'My final decision' - Ziyech rules out Morocco return as Chelsea star confirms international retirement at 28,"Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech says he will not return to the Morocco national team amid an ongoing war of words with head coach Vahid Halilhodzic. Ziyech was excluded from Morocco's Afcon squad and, after their elimination, Halilhodzic said Ziyech would not be welcomed back into the team ""even if his name was Lionel Messi"". And the Chelsea star has now responded, hitting back by accusing the coach of ""lying"" while agreeing that he will not return to play for his country. ""I understand them, but I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision,"" Ziyech told ADSportsTV. ""It's all clear for me how things are going over there and I am focusing on what I am doing and, right now, that is my club. ""At the end of the day, it's a decision he makes and you have to respect it. All the lying that comes with it, it's, for me, clear and I will not return to the national team. ""I understand and feel sorry for [the fans], but that's the situation we're in."" The last time Ziyech played for Morocco was last June in a friendly against Burkina Faso, with that match being the starting point of his feud with the national team's coach. After the Burkina Faso friendly, Halilhodzic said: ""His behaviour in the last two matches, especially the last one, was not that of a national team player who, as a leader in the team, must be a positive role model. “He arrived late and after that, he even refused to work. There was no point in discussing it afterwards, as a coach the answer is right there to see."" Halilhodzic doubled down on that assessment last week, saying Ziyech's behaviour on national team duty ""does not fit the selection"". ""He doesn't want to train, doesn't want to play,"" he said of Ziyech. ""He doesn't take it seriously. I'm not going to beg him to come back. ""After the [Afcon] tournament three years ago, he was the most criticised. He was booed. You mustn't forget that."" Ziyech, who has earned 40 caps while scoring 17 goals, has featured 25 times for Chelsea this season, scoring six times. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

243,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-agree-pay-damages-four-former-players-racist/blt1caa813a9d3d84b1,Chelsea agree to pay damages to four former players after 'racist bullying' allegations,"Chelsea have agreed to pay damages to four former players that alleged they were the victims of “racist bullying” in the 1990s. A pre-trial hearing for the case was initially due to take place at the High Court in London on Monday, but Chelsea managed to reach an out-of-court settlement with the quartet's legal team beforehand. The Blues sought to settle with the alleged victims out of court, having initially issued an apology back in 2017 after the historic abuse was revealed by British charity Barnardo's. A Chelsea spokesperson has stated on the conclusion of the case: ""The club is pleased that we have been able to conclude a settlement of these claims without any further litigation. ""We will continue to offer support to the former players concerned through our dedicated Player Support Service."" A five-week trial date had been due to begin on March 7 to address the High Court documents alleging that four young black Chelsea players were racially abused and assaulted by their own coaches. 62 witnesses made up of ex-players and staff from the Ken Bates' ownership era at Stamford Bridge were due to appear in court, but the matter has now been closed and each of the four players will receive six-figure settlement sums. Chelsea have a programme in place to look after the victims of racist abuse and they have reaffirmed their commitment to that cause after the announcement.

244,https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics. Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps. A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10. Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea. “Sanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea’s many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom’s brand 3, and its $72m (£55m) kit deal with Nike,” says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company. “While Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association. “Chelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships. “Nike’s deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club’s sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.” Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just £20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth £9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at £3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club. It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration. In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

245,https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

246,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-sale-preferred-bidders-the-raine-group-and-when/blt76a40d2f63f8681c,"Chelsea sale: 'Preferred bidders', the Raine Group & when buyers will be updated on Blues takeover","Raine Group, the New York investment bank running the sale of Chelsea on behalf of Roman Abramovich, has set a target for when to announce the 'preferred bidders'. The process will narrow down the bids, of which six are known to GOAL, to just three, and those will be pored over in more detail by lawyers at Chelsea and the Premier League. There have been several late changes to bids permitted since the Friday, March 18 9pm GMT (5pm ET) deadline which has slowed the process down slightly. Raine Group is hoping to make the decision on which bidders will go to the next stage of the process by Tuesday, March 22. Joe Ravitch, who is theco-founder of investment bank Raine Group LLC, was initially asked by Abramovich to find a new owner for his club. After Abramovich was sanctioned by the UnitedKingdom and European Union, the group was instructedto continue its work to find a new owner. It works in consultation withAbramovich, the UK Government through theDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the senior staff at Chelsea. Although the eventual owner of Chelsea is currently not known by anybody, there are feelings around the process that a United States consortium will win. Even still, those from other countries are not giving up, with Centricus going public about their offer to buy Chelsea which is thought to be worth a whopping £3 billion ($3.9bn). The London-based global investment firm is being led by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie. It is working with hedge fund manager Jonathan Lourie of Cheyne Capital, and Talis Capital’s Bob Finch, who are all said to be long-time Chelsea season-ticket holders. Their plans include investing in the first team, academy, women's team and Chelsea Foundation. They have also outlined their intention to keep the current management running the club at all levels. There are also more details emerging of Nick Candy's bid, which is in partnership with investors from Europe, the United States and South Korea. He has named his group the Blue Football Consortium £2bn ($2.6bn) and he promises a high level of fan involvement, including the issuing of a 'golden share' in the club, voting rights and an advisory board for supporters. The proposal also involves former Blues striker Gianluca Vialli and his company Tifosy Capital & Advisory. PrimaryBid, a tech platform, is in discussions about facilitating those ideas on behalf of Candy's consortium. Alongside Candy, there's offers from the US led by the Ricketts Family, who own the Chicago Cubs, and Todd Boehly, who owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, has created a consortium with Hansjorg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein. Furthermore, as first revealed by GOAL, Saudi Media believes its bid to buy Chelsea is competitive and is awaiting further details from Raine. From the UK, Lord Sebastian Coe has put together a proposal with former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. John Terry is the public face of the True Blues consortium which is offering to buy 10 per cent for £250 million ($329m). Now, as a minority partner, they aren't officially allowed to negotiate with Raine so their inclusion in any bid will be a 'bolt on' allowing any player a vehicle for fan involvement in the process. That means that they must negotiate with the preferred bidders once they are revealed. Despite going public about the bid on Saturday, not all the details have been released to Blues supporters, but the group has several private backers. Alongside that, they are promising to issue fan tokens with voting rights to wealthy supporters. Chelsea are hoping to complete this process as soon as possible with the club remaining under sanctions through their owner Roman Abramovich who was said to have connections to Russia's president Vladimir Putin by the UK Government.

247,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-takeover-shortlist-boehly-broughton-first-successful/blt9fc8734117526403,Chelsea takeover shortlist: Boehly & Broughton among successful 'preferred bidders',"Chelsea have informed the successful potential future owners of the club that they have progressed to the next round of the takeover process, rejecting a whole host of other bidders. The sale of the Blues, handled by Raine Group, looks to be heading into the final stages with at least a quartet of options still in the mix, including the consortium headed up by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly with features Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and British entrepreneur Jonathan Goldstein. Atalanta part-owner Stephen Pagliuca is also through to the shortlist stage, along with the bid from Harris Blizter Sports & Entertainment, part owners of Crystal Palace, with backing from ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and World Athletics president Lord Sebastian Coe, alongside the offer from unpopular Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family. Nick Candy's offer, which had the £1 billion ($1.3bn)backing of a South Korean group, and Gianluca Vialli's Tifosy Capital and Advisory,is now out of the running. Meanwhile, the status ofCentricus, the London-based global investment firm who had bid close to £3 billion ($4bn), is not yet confirmed. As first revealed by GOAL, the Saudi Media Group are out of contention despite having had a 'competitive bid'. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson is also said to be out of the running, while there were thought to be other bids that didn't go public about their intention to buy Chelsea FC. Despite failing in the process, some of the interested parties are thought to be ready to join the negotiations through the preferred bidders. Saudi Media Group and Catalina Kim of C&P Sports Group, who leads the Korean influence around Candy, are both ready to offer their further backing to the successful consortiums. The successful bids will be looked over in far greater detail and include background checks on everyone involved in the process and where their money comes from. The idea is to have a clear view and do 'due diligence' on the potential future owners of Chelsea FC. Although there's a desire to complete the process at rapid speed, it could still take some time to choose a potential owner. Chelsea's board, which features Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck, Eugene Tenenbaum and David Barnard, will ultimately decide who owns the club in the future. Raine Group are not said to be making the choice and are simply advising. Meanwhile, the UK Government are involved but only to ensure that no money goes to sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds of the sale to go into a frozen account or to charity. The Blues had hoped to have a new owner before their next match against Brentford after the international break but that's highly unlikely now. The process needs to be completed before May 31 or it could cause a significant negative impact on the finances of the west Londoners. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

248,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-premier-league-owners-directors-test-fit-and-proper/blt6f8fd72889715489,What is the Premier League 'Owners' and Directors' Test'? How fit and proper football club buyers are assessed,"An influx of billionaire owners to the Premier League was sparked by the arrival of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003, with the vast majority of clubs in the English top flight now working under the watchful eye of business persons with the deepest of pockets. Not just anybody with a healthy bank balance is allowed to take control of historic institutions in English football, though, with certain criteria needing to be met by those looking to inherit the reins of clubs that have often been in existence for well over 100 years. That box-ticking exercise, which is played out during takeover discussions, is often referred to as the ‘Fit and Proper Person Test’, but it is technically known as the ‘Owners’ and Directors’ Test’. What does it entail and how do you pass? GOAL takes a look… The Premier League defines its process of identifying whether or not an interested party is deserving of owning a club in England as: - The Owners’ and Directors’ Test outlines requirements that would prohibit an individual from becoming an owner or director of a club. These include criminal convictions for a wide range of offences, a ban by a sporting or professional body, or breaches of certain key football regulations, such as match-fixing. The test is applied to prospective owners and directors, who are then subject to a review on a seasonal basis. The full criteria laid out for those expressing interest in purchasing a top-flight club can be found in Section F of the Premier League Handbook – which can be accessed here. The Premier League’s ‘Owners’ and Directors’ Test is explained in full across six pages of the organisation’s handbook. The vast majority of rules that need to be adhered to relate to finances and pre-existing interests in other clubs – with nobody allowed to work as a director of two teams in England. Among the more notable points that could lead to an application being rejected are: With interest in English clubs continuing to build around the world, the Premier League has vowed to assess its rules and regulations when it comes to matters of human rights. The league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, has said: “The Owners’ and Directors’ Test has been under a lot of scrutiny over the past 12 months and we’re looking at it again. It’s part of the process of responding to the fan-led review … We’re looking to see if more tests need to be added, if we need to be more transparent and whether those decisions should be approved by an independent body.” He added on the issue of human rights: “We’ve had some helpful conversations with Amnesty International about those kinds of things. I’m not ready to say how it should change yet because actually it should be across football; it should be us the FA and the EFL agreeing what that test should be, how it should be implemented and how it should be communicated to fans.” Team Owner/s Arsenal Stan Kroenke Aston Villa Nassef Sawiris, Wesley Edens Brentford Matthew Benham Brighton & Hove Albion Tony Bloom (75.61%) Burnley ALK Capital (84%) Chelsea Roman Abramovich Crystal Palace Steve Parish, Joshua Harris (18%), David S.

Chelsea pushed hard for Kounde this summer, but Sevilla ultimately determined that the Blues' bid did not match their valuation of the France international. Chalobahwas initially supposed to go out on loan this term but his early-season performances convinced Tuchel to keep him at the club and this week, he signed a new contract through 2026. “I think every transfer period you need to evaluate again because you cannot say what we wanted in the summer we do in the winter or the next summer. It is not like this,"" Tuchel said. “Your opinion changes, players change, you have evolvement in the group. You have atmosphere that you build, you see who is absolutely reliable and these connections build up and create something special, hopefully, in the group. “So you cannot say what we tried in the summer did not happen so we will try again for sure in the winter. Sometimes it is like this if we see the same need, but clearly Trevoh is now here with us and he deserves to be here with us. It had nothing to do with if we can sign another central defender or not. “But he stepped up. The responsibility was even more on his shoulders and he can handle it so far in a very impressive way. This is the situation and it has an effect on our next decisions in the next transfer period. It is always like this.” Tuchel, who was appointed Chelsea manager in January, has also said he is hoping to stay with the club for a long time. “I can tell you today I will do my very best to stay as long as possible because I like where I am and I enjoy working every single day in this club and in this league,"" Tuchel said. “For me it is a perfect fit. From here we go but it’s a weekly business, maybe it’s a daily business, and I am fully aware of it.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The two European giants will be able to sign the Germany international in January on a pre-contract agreement, with the defender's current deal expiring in the summer of 2022. Despite interest from abroad,  Goal  can confirm thatthe 28-year-old would be happy to stay put in west London as long as his contract demands are met, with Rudiger believing this will likely be the last big-money deal of his career. PSG have invested heavily in their squad andhave become adept at recruiting in the free transfer market, with the Ligue 1 side able to offer huge wages. Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum and Gianluigi Donnarumma all arrived after their contract expired at their previous clubs in the summer. Blues boss Thomas Tuchel previously tried to sign Rudiger during his time in charge of PSG when he fell out of favour under former manager Frank Lampardover a year ago. Similarly, Madrid can offer competitive salaries and still possessthe prestige to attract top talent. Free transfers are part of their strategy to overcome the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic that have hit Spanish clubs particularly hard. Los Blancos sold Raphael Varaneto Manchester United amid fears he would exit on a free transferand, with Ramos having already left, reinforcing the centre-back area is likely to be a priority.  Germany international Rudiger has previously acknowledged talks over a new contract, revealing back in August: ""I said before that I wanted to concentrate on the Euros and when I come back, talks can start. ""That’s what has happened. Talks have begun so we will see what time brings."" Tuchel, meanwhile, has beenreluctant to be drawn on the subject, although it is clear thatRudiger is seen as a hugely important member of the first-team squad. Indeed, he hasarguably been the top defensive performersince the former Dortmund and PSG boss took charge at Stamford Bridge and has been an ever-present in the starting XI. The boardroom view regarding Rudiger's situation maydiffer slightly, however,as the Blueslook to keep the average age of the squad down and that could see the former Roma star moved on. Sevilla centre-backJules Kounde remains a major target  having been close to joining the Premier League title hopefuls in the summer transfer window. The 22-year-old defender wanted a move to the European champions this summer but he was frustrated as Chelsea opted against paying the huge demands of theLiga side. The Blues are known to have made one official bid before refusingto match Sevilla's demands. They could, however, attempt to sign Kounde in January  but would need the Andalusian side to find a replacement if they want to sign the Frenchman for less than his €80 million(£68m/$90m) release clause. Furthermore, the Blues remain in talks to renewAndreas Christensen's contract, with minor details now needing to be sorted. The Daneis expected to sign a new four-year deal in the next month, with the contractalso includinga club option for an extra year. Chelsea are also trying to renew the contract of  Trevoh Chalobah, who has beenpromoted to thefirst team this season. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues ultimately failed to prisethe22-year-old away from Sevilla, with the Liga side holding on to their highly-rated France international. Chelseadidmanage one deadline-day addition from Spain,signing Saul Niguez from Atletico Madrid on loan. ""It was clear we tried for Kounde and Saul and it was very, very late but it was a very, very smooth transfer window because I had full concentration on training and on my team,"" Tuchel said. ""The amount of support of(technical and performance advisor) Petr Cech as a link, and together with Marina [Granovskaia, Chelsea director], was fantastic, so it was pretty relaxed with a good outcome because in the end it was possible to add Saul into the group, which was a key position for us to have more alternatives and to not put all the pressure on the three guys' shoulders. ""So there's a lot of competition now going on and it's my job to be a good moderator."" Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui has said that interested clubs did not meet his side's valuation of his star defender. “Kounde in the end has stayed because the club has decided that it was the right thing to do based on the evaluation of the offers they may have had,” he toldDiario de Sevilla. Sevilla sporting director Monchi said last weekthat Kounde would only leave if an interested club paid his€80 million (£68m/$95m) release clause. Chelsea could return with another bid for Kounde in the winter or next summer, with the defender's current contract set to expire in 2024.

The 26-year-old centre-half has opted against committing to fresh terms at the Allianz Arena, with a new challenge now being sought. There were suggestions that he could head to England, with Newcastle and Chelsea said to be among his many suitors, but a man that has been on Bayern’s books since 2017 has taken the decision to remain in the Bundesliga and sign a four-year contract with BVB. Sule confirmed that the matter of his future had been resolved several weeks before this month's announcement, stating to BILD: ""In the last few days and weeks, there has been a lot of talk about me and speculation about what I want to do and why. ""I already decided a few weeks ago to play for Borussia Dortmund in the future. ""From our first contact, I felt that those at the club were very interested in working with me. [They] gave me an impressive impression of the role I can play at [Dortmund]. ""I had the feeling that they wanted me as both a person and as a footballer. I was impressed by the way they looked after me, so I quickly knew where I was going to play in the future."" Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, told the club’s official website of securing the services of another proven performer: “We are pleased that we were able to sign a German national team player in Niklas Sule and retain him for four years. “Niklas has shown us in discussions that he is very interested in Borussia Dortmund. “He has a lot of experience, calmness in the build-up game and the necessary physique to take the next step with us from the summer.” Borussia Dortmund has signed Niklas Süle for the 2022/23 season ✍️ pic.twitter.com/WC7EeffRXj Bayern agreed a deal for Sule in January 2017 and welcomed him onto their books that summer as the physically-imposing centre-half joined them from Hoffenheim. He has taken in 159 appearances while in Munich and savoured four Bundesliga title triumphs. Sule, who has 37 caps to his name, has also won the DFB-Pokal on two occasions, formed part of a Champions League success in 2019-20 and helped Bayern to UEFA Super and Club World Cup honours. He has turned down offers of a new contract at the Allianz Arena, but his representatives insist that money was not a factor in a decision to move on. GOAL and SPOX were able to confirm in January that Sule was ready to take on a new challenge, with Bayern lining up a move for Andreas Christensen as his replacement – with the Danish defender running down his own deal at Chelsea. Dortmund have now got their man, with Marco Rose’s side looking for another reliable centre-half option to slot into their ranks. Mats Hummels, who returned to BVB from Bayern in 2019, has endured injury struggles of late, while there are suggestions that Manuel Akanji – who is working on terms until 2023 – may start to explore alternative options. Sule will be able to slot straight into the heart of Dortmund’s defence, while he is also capable of providing cover for Belgium international Thomas Meunier at right-back.

253,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-contract-talks-christensen-two-month-stand-off/zi8mt8pxo68e1arrbvu9iw636,Christensen contract talks stall with Chelsea defender in two-month stand-off,"Chelsea's contract talks with Andreas Christensen have stalled amid a two-month lack of contact between both parties over a new deal, Goal can exclusively reveal. The 25-year-old has been in the form of his life at Stamford Bridge but his current contract expires in June 2022, leaving him open to talk to clubs overseas fromJanuary 1. However, despite the Dane's intention to remainin west London, the current offer would keep him among the lowest earners in the squad. After Thomas Tuchel's arrival in January, Christensen began to start regularly and was offered an 18-month contract with a slightly larger salary. With the last contact in August between the two parties, the latestoffer would see Christensen signed up to a four-year deal with an option to extend for another season. That long-term contract would see the central defender signed up to a contract that keeps him among the lowest-earning senior players at the club, despite it still representing a significant pay rise. Even though they have lesser squad roles, it would mean that Kai Havertz and Timo Werner would be earning much more than one ofTuchel's most trusted defenders. Rival managers, including Thomas Frank and Jon Dahl Tomasson, have both described Christensen as one of the best defenders in the world in the last week. The Blues originally signed the defender from Danish side Brondby in a £500,000 dealamid huge competitionwhen he was just 16-years-old. Chelsea boss Tuchel has said that he wants Christensen to stay at Stamford Bridge for years and backed him to become a legend at the club. He told reporters:""I think it is important we accept the personality of every player. Some are more loud, some aggressive, some more calm. He’s a calm guy, very intelligent player, and sometimes you can get maybe a bit misled by judging him from his personality, because he is a hard defender and he is a guy who is not shy to have hard tackles and win challenges and step up in games. He found his place. ""He is very strong, very reliable and he has not reached his limits because in his age there is still room to improve. He can be a top defender for us in the next years and hopefully he will be because he comes from the academy. He knows what it takes and he has improved massively so far but it is not done yet – you have to show it over and over. There are big examples in this club of what it takes to be a legend in defence and there is still a way to go but we are very happy so far."" Christensen's situation is almost identical to that of Antonio Rudiger, whosedeal also expires in June 2022. Rudiger is keen to stay at Stamford Bridge but he wants to be rewarded for his role as one of the club's top players since Tuchel took charge. There is a stand-off over the salary being offered and although his priority is to remain in west London, Rudigerknows clubs like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and PSG value him more highly. Chelsea have shown serious interest in signing a defender, havingswooped for Sevilla's Jules Kounde throughthe summer, only to be knocked back over failing to agree a fee. Kounde is keen to move to Chelsea, but it is a costly exercise to sign the defender with Sevilla sporting director Monchi now demanding the full €80m (£68m) release clause. Chelsea have also been offered Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt. The Turin giants are ready to offload the Netherlands international due to his base salary being a whopping £280,000-a-week, with favourable add-ons allowing him to achieve even more in bonuses. De Ligt's agent Mino Raiola has come out publicly to say he wants his client to move in the summer of 2022, when the Blues could lose two defenders. The Blues are also in talks with Trevoh Chalobah over a new contract - those are progressing well, albeit slowly.Chelsea will also look to renew the contract of Cesar Azpilicueta over the coming months, with the Blues captain sayingin a press conference last month thatit will get resolved. He said: ""I don't have any concerns. I feel fully trusted by the club since I arrived. At the moment, it is true that my contract ends in June, but I just focus on what's next, to train and play the best I can. Everything will take care of itself. Of course, I love to be here, I feel loved since I arrived and my aim is to be here for as long as I can"" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues offered Christensen a new four-year deal with a significant pay raise in August, but the two sides have been at a standoff since as the defender has not yet signed a new contract. Tuchel says there is no imminent good news and contract talks are now all up to Christensen. ""I have no good news,"" Tuchel said. ""That was my understanding weeks ago that Andreas wants the same as me, that he wants the same as the club, and that’s why for me it was a zero problem situation because everybody wanted the same as far as I understood it. ""We are waiting since a long time now for confirmation. It is on Andreas to act how he acts on the pitch, he needs to act now off the pitch, and walk the talk because he tells us that he loves Chelsea, he tells us that he wants to stay and be a big part, because he is a big part of a big club, and I think he is a perfect fit and I think that he is not done yet here. ""His career here is, by far, not finished, [he] can still develop and be big, big player, but like I said, it’s on him, it’s on him. We want the commitment and, hopefully, we get it."" As things stand, Christensen is set to become a free agent next summer as his contract enters its final months. He's not the only Blues defender who could move on after this season, with Antonio Rudiger, Thiago Silva and Cesar Azpilicueta also all out of contract. Christensen, who has hinted that he plans on extending his stay with the club, has played in 13 games this season after featuring 27 times throughout Chelsea's Champions League-winning campaign.

Sources with knowledge of the situation described at least 10 serious buyers, with many others holding an interest. The sheer number of interested parties, which includes Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss's US-Swiss consortium and Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, gives Abramovich some hope in claiming his highly ambitious £3 billion ($4bn) valuation. Although it is not known who the individual backers are at this stage, Saudi Media are a fund that is heavily involved in funding media, advertising and sports brands across the world. However, their main content offering is for the pan-Arab broadcasting market. The company has offices in both Dubai, UAE and Saudi Arabia itself. One barrier to their success in claiming Chelseamight be the caution around accepting any bids from a 'politically sensitive' party. The aim is for the Russian oligarch to accept a bid by 15 March but the billionaire is open to extending it, should he decide it will help the process. The proceeds of the sale, we are told, will go to the 'victims of the ongoing war in Ukraine'. That careful wording in Abramovich's statement on Wednesday last week leaves open the concerns that funds could go to both sides of the war which was sparked by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Also within that statement, it was revealed that Abramovich would write off the £1.5bn ($2bn) that he is owed by Chelsea in the form of a loan through his holding company Fordstam Ltd. That means that the £1.5bnwon't be banked by Abramovich after he completes a sale. The Blues' travelling support was criticised by their own manager Thomas Tuchel for chanting Abramovich's name during the Premier League-organised tribute for Ukraine ahead of their weekend win over Burnley. Those misguided actions go to show the pain among the hardcore support of losing an owner who has funded 21 trophies in 19 years of his ownership. Any new owner is highly unlikely to offer the same level of investment in the Blues, which will likely be on a more stable footing. However, it is also an opportunity to start a new more transparent era at the club and the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST), the most influential supporters group, has issued a list of requests to any new owners. They want the outstanding balance of the Chelsea Pitch Owners' (CPO)loan to be repaid, which stands at around £8m, to be waived. Alongside that, they are asking for more fan involvement in the club, support for the Chelsea Women's team and the following of the recommendations from Tracey Crouch's government report on football governance. Although not stated in their manifesto for a new owner, the need to rebuild Stamford Bridge is a major additional issue. Although the club has many attractive aspects, including their TV deals and the quality of the playing squad, the need to redevelop Stamford Bridge could cost more than £2bn after buying the west Londoners.

Fofana, 21, had caught the eye of Chelsea with his talent in defence, despite sitting out the entire season so far with injury. But the Blues look set to miss out on their target after he penned a lengthy extension at the King Power Stadium. ""Leicester City defender Wesley Fofana has signed a new deal with the Football Club, keeping him at King Power Stadium until at least 2027,"" Leicester signalled in a statement published on the club's official website. ""The 21-year-old joined City from Saint-Etienne in October 2020 and featured for the Foxes 38 times in all competitions last season, helping the Club to its first-ever Emirates FA Cup trophy. ""Such were the level of his performances in his debut season for the Football Club, he became quickly established as one of the most exciting young talents in world football and following an injury suffered in pre-season, he is now close to a return to the squad."" After an impressive debut season for the Foxes in 2020-21, Fofana's hopes of building on that start were interrupted when he suffered a broken leg during pre-season which has kept him out for the last six months. But he is now looking towards a potential first-team return, and underlined his happiness at Leicester despite that lengthy lay-off. “I’m really happy to sign a new contract. It shows the Club have confidence in me offering me a contract to 2027,"" he explained. ""I’m really happy to be here. It’s my Club, I love the fans, so I’m really happy and really looking forward to being back playing. “I love everything about the Club. I love the city, I love the fans.

Thanks to a clause in Chelsea's agreement with their captain, another year on the Spaniard's deal will be activated based on certain conditions. However, there is a lot of goodwill between Chelsea and the Blues captain, who is negotiating the situation without an agent, and they could step aside should he push for a new opportunity. Chelsea have an option to extend Azpilicueta's contract for another year but it is conditional on his appearances in certain competitions. Although the exact numbers are unknown, the defender is thought to be close to hitting the figure that would spark a renewal. The Blues are currently under sanctions because of their owner Roman Abramovich and alleged connections to the Kremlin and Russian presidentVladimir Putin. It blocks both transfers and contract renewals but Azpilicueta's deal would likely be waved through due to it being agreed before March 10. Barcelona remain as confident as ever despite finding out about the clause in the contract. The deciding point on whether they can complete the deal is by convincing Azpilicueta himself. They have offered a competitive two-year contract with an option for an extra year. That's one year longer than the Blues, who have offered a one-plus-one-year contract deal. The Catalan club are also in advanced negotiations with Andreas Christensen and believe they can beat Bayern Munich to his signature. It comes after a complete impasse in talks between the westLondon club and the Denmark international. Reporting done with bothAdrià Soldevila and Rubén Uría.

They had previously been banned from doing so under sanctions handed to owner Roman Abramovich, who is actively looking to sell the club. While the amended licence enables the majority of sales to resume - albeit with proceeds going to competition organisers, rather than the club - tickets for Premier League home games will be limited to away fans, Chelsea season-ticket holders and Blues supporters who bought seats before the sanctions. According to documents released by the UK government, Chelsea can now sell tickets for all away matches, help visiting fans purchase tickets for all matches at Stamford Bridge, and sell new home tickets to their supporters in the Champions League, FA Cup and Women's Super League. This means that their April 6 quarter-final clash with Real Madrid in the Champions League will be held at full capacity. However, sales of Premier League tickets to Blues fans are still limited by the UK government, with proceeds going to league organisers. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston said in a statement: ""I would like to thank fans for their patience while we have engaged with the football authorities to make this possible.

The 34-year-old saw the Bluestrigger an optionthatextended his contractby a furtheryear, ending Milan's hopes of signing him on a free transfer. However, Chelsea and Milan have now agreed on a fee that will allow the striker to move to Italy. Since exiting Euro 2020 after France's shock round-of-16 defeat to Switzerland, Giroudhas been able to put focus on his future and has reiterated his desire to leave west London. The former Arsenal forwardincreasingly found himself playing a bit-part role under Thomas Tuchel last season and didn't starta match for his club after March 21. And he's now bound for Milan, with the Serie A side paying €1 million (£860,000/$1.2m) upfront and another €1m next year as an add-on. Giroud is now set to sign a two-year deal with his new club, as the striker will now depart Chelsea ahead of what could be another busy window for the Blues. Indeed, the Blues aretargeting thesigning of a new striker in the summer transfer window, withErling Haaland and Tottenham and England starHarry Kane at the top the shortlist. Tiemoue Bakayoko is also high up Milan's priority list and he is keen to force a move away from Stamford Bridge. Like Giroud, the 26-year-oldhas had interest from elsewhere, including from Ligue 1 outfit Nice, but is hopingto join Milan this summer. Bakayoko's deal with the Blues expires next summer, with Milan are hoping to sign the Frenchman for the cheapest price possible, andpotentially a loan deal with an obligatory purchase option.  Andy Bara, the 26-year-old's agent, spoke about the possibility of returning to Italy with Milan after a loan spell at Napoli. ""Milan are looking for a player with his characteristics and it’s likely that they can make a proposal,""he said, as quoted byCalcio Mercato. ""At the moment, Tiemoue is a Chelsea player, but there’s a possibility to change his shirt and go to an Italian team. ""Milan are a great team and if the opportunity arises, we will do everything possible to bring him to the Rossoneri. [Paolo] Maldini and [Frederic] Massara know him, they know what he can give."" Milan have had some success working with Chelsea in the past and most recently secured Fikayo Tomori for £25 million (€34m)after exercising a purchase optionin their loan agreement. Furthermore, the Serie A club have shown an interest in signing Hakim Ziyech this summer but a deal looks very unlikely, with Stefano Pioli's side seemingly unable to afford the Morocco international. They have also scouted Chelsea at academy level and are in the race to sign Tino Livramento, the Blues'Academy Player of the Year, with a host of other clubs also keen. Chelsea have returned to training this week ahead of the new season, with many loanees and young players among the first-team squad as several stars remain on holiday or on international duty.

The 55-year-old billionaire has since recovered from the alleged attack, which has been attributed to hard-line Russian agents who wanted to disrupt the peace process in the original report by theWall Street Journal. The symptoms were said to include ""red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands."" The Blues owner is said to have been travelling between Moscow, Ukraine and Turkey since he put Chelsea up for sale on March 2. People close to Abramovich have claimed that he has been involved in peace talks since the war broke out in late February. Indeed, he has been spotted close to the border between Belarus and Ukraine, with his private jets constantly moving between Russia, Belarus and Turkey. After being sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, the Blues owner was described as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. The European Union (EU) then followed suit and sanctioned Abramovich which caused complications for Chelsea in the day-to-day running of the club. The sale of Chelsea should exist broadly outside of Abramovich's influence for now. New York investment bank Raine Group is managing the sale of the club but the ultimate decision on a new owner rests with Chelsea's board. On that board are several close associates to Abramovich, including Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck and Eugene Tenenbaum. The UK Government has limited Chelsea by placing a special operating licence on the club in a bid to ensure no money goes to Abramovich who is currently sanctioned. However, in recent days, there has been talk that Chelsea are seeking to boost the price of the club to record-breaking levels for a sports team. It raises the prospect that the proceeds of the sale could ultimately go to Abramovich after any sanctions are eventually lifted. The current record sale is £2.5 billion, which was spent on the NBA's Brooklyn Nets by Joseph Tsai. Many close to the process, believe that £2.5bn is the minimum the Stamford Bridge club could go for with preferred bidders being encouraged to raise their offers. Among the final four bidders are now known to be the controversialRicketts family, led by Tom Ricketts and with private backing from Citadel founder Ken Griffin. Furthermore, also from the United States, isTodd Boehly who owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. His consortium features finance from Switzerland through billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and British entrepreneur Jonathan Goldstein. Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca, who also has a stake in Atalanta, emerged as a bidder late in the process. Meanwhile, there's also a consortium fronted by former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. It features prominent backing from Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Party MP, and US billionaire duo Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own a stake in Crystal Palace.

263,https://www.goal.com/en/news/kante-decline-chelsea-superstar-escape-slump-real-madrid/blt5e1b8ec609cfbfc3,Kante in decline? Chelsea superstar unable to escape his slump in time for Real Madrid defeat,"N'Golo Kante will always have all-time great status at Chelsea after his Champions League heroics in 2020-21. The midfielder was named Man of the Match in both legs of the Blues' semi-final win over Real Madrid, as well as in their final victory over Manchester City. Those performances, full of energy, determination and world-class quality both on and off the ball, will be written into the Blues' folklore. And yet in Chelsea's biggest game of the current campaign, their quarter-final first leg against Madrid, Kante was substituted at half-time. For the first time in his Chelsea career, the 31-year-old was taken off before the start of the second period for a reason other than injury. ""It was a tactical change. It's like always, it's never on one or two players,"" Tuchel said when asked by GOAL to explain the change post-match. After the same thing happened to Tammy Abraham last season, he was sold to Roma. After Callum Hudson-Odoi was substituted just 20 minutes after coming on against Southampton in February 2021, he faced a long road to re-establish himself in west London. If this is the beginning of the end for Kante at Chelsea, though, then it is a sad twist in the story of one of world football's most beloved players. Against Madrid, Kante had the lowest passing accuracy of all Chelsea's central midfielders. He did not complete a single dribble, win a single tackle, make a single interception or make a single clearance. In truth, it was a display in keeping with Kante's struggles in recent months, with the France international having not looked himself since returning from knee and groin injuries in the midst of Chelsea's difficult run through the winter. Even though injury problems are not new to Kante, given his issues ever since the 2019 Europa League final, he could still be counted on to turn up for the big games, often earning Man-of-the-Match awards. Without those kinds of displays, the Blues would not be current European and world champions. Now, though, those injuries coupled with his advancing years seem to have taken their toll on a midfielder who is relied upon for his unique blend of energy and technical quality to dominate opponents. His consistency in recent seasons has been unmatched by any of his peers in any position at Chelsea, while many have described him as the world's best midfielder. Such was his level, Tuchel took his chance and presumed that Kante would return to form against Los Blancos. That gamble did not pay off, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos pulling into wide areas, dragging Kante with them to leave huge spaces for Madrid to build attacks through the middle of the pitch. That Kante's struggles on Wednesday came after a similarly poor showing against Brentford four days earlier suggests, however, that it was not just Carlo Ancelotti's tactics that neutralised the ex-Leicester City man. Tuchel himself conceded that he made tactical errors on the night, most notably by playing Andreas Christensen on the right of a back three behind the marauding Reece James, which allowed Vinicius Junior to use his pace to run riot during the first half. But it was not just Tuchel's defensive choices that were strange. Mateo Kovacic has been Chelsea's most in-form midfielder this season, and his non-selection was confusing, particularly after he was rested for the Brentford defeat. Tuchel had lavished praise on the Croatia international during his pre-match press conference, claiming the 27-year-old looks ""like a wonderkid"" in training while insisting Kovacic is closing in on becoming a world-class midfielder. Chelsea thought they already had one of those in Kante, but physical fatigue at the end of another demanding season, along with the mental strains that come with the uncertainty over the club's ownership seem to have taken their toll on both him and a number of his team-mates. Though it would be a tough call to leave Kante out for the second leg as Chelsea aim to overturn their two-goal deficit at Santiago Bernabeu, Tuchel could do himself a favour in the long run if he were to give Kante a break in these final weeks of the season. He no longer looks like the force of nature he has been since he arrived into English football almost seven years ago, and compromises will likely need to be made for him to reach those levels once more. Kante helped carry Chelsea over the line in last season's Champions League. The time might be coming, though, for others to start taking their share of the load.

264,https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-champions-league-benzema-modric-break-chelsea/blt6074b234034032af,Never write Real Madrid off! Champions League legends Benzema and Modric step up again to break Chelsea hearts,"Match statistics: Real Madrid 2-3 Chelsea Santiago Bernabeu was on the verge of turning on Real Madrid, their Champions League campaign on the verge of reaching an embarrassing conclusion. But with just over 10 minutes to go against Chelsea, their three key men turned it on, saving Los Blancos from a humiliating capitulation, and Carlo Ancelotti from headlines calling for his head. Madrid snatched victory from the jaws of defeat - even if the final scoreline on the night was a 3-2 loss - earning themselves a 5-4 win on aggregate to reach the Champions League semi-finals. It was a triumph, though, secured by individual quality and collective sweat, rather than by Ancelotti’s cunning design. With Chelsea rampant and 3-0 up, Kai Havertz’s header was brilliantly saved by Thibaut Courtois, and two minutes later, Luka Modric sublimely set up Rodrygo’s crucial strike. The evergreen Croatian played an instinctive, brilliant, dipping pass with the outside of his boot, which landed perfectly at Rodrygo’s feet for him to fire past Edouard Mendy. On repeat 🔁So delicious from Luka Modric 🤤#UCL pic.twitter.com/FAB8aghXMj Put Luka Modric’s assist in the Louvre. 🖼 pic.twitter.com/1xNd53B6Tw The Brazilian’s goal forced extra time, and six minutes into it, Karim Benzema - who Antonio Rudiger had marshalled well until that point - headed home to put Madrid in front on aggregate. The performance as a whole to that point had been fragile. Ancelotti’s side looked unsure of their gameplan, nervously sitting on their two-goal first-leg lead. The Italian wanted Madrid to defend and try to strike on the counterattack with Vinicius Junior and Benzema if they could, but Chelsea penned them in, pressing well and slowly turning the screw. Goals followed for the visitors, in front of an increasingly angsty Bernabeu crowd. Mason Mount curled brilliantly past Courtois from the edge of the box in the 15th minute, making Madrid even more unsettled, with their advantage reduced to just one. Rudiger - who may wear white next season if his Chelsea contract situation is not resolved - put in a monumental performance and headed home the second from a corner, with Madrid missing Eder Militao’s aerial presence. And when Timo Werner netted the third, after Marcos Alonso’s goal had been ruled out for handball, it looked like Madrid were succumbing to another thrashing like the one Barcelona doled out in the capital a few weeks ago, or Paris Saint-Germain’s dominance over most of the last-16 tie could have led to. Ancelotti’s gameplan had been unpicked by Thomas Tuchel, who had picked his team up from their Benzema-inspired battering at Stamford Bridge and armed them with what they needed to get on top of Madrid. They were significantly more alert when it came to cutting passing lines to Benzema, who was starved of service for much of the game. It took three moments of individual quality to swing the balance in Madrid’s favour, from Courtois, from Modric and from Benzema, while substitute Eduardo Camavinga offered a lot to the team after his introduction, helped them win the midfield battle in extra-time. IT JUST HAD TO BE HIM! 🌟Karim Benzema gets his goal in extra-time, and it's advantage to Real Madrid once again...An absolute thriller at the Bernabéu! 🥵#UCL pic.twitter.com/S16zuWUtdz IT HAD TO BE HIM! KARIM BENEZEMA, ANOTHER HEADER! 💥 pic.twitter.com/mqkhLTjCpi Both Camavinga and Fede Valverde have been underplayed by Ancelotti this season, despite Toni Kroos’ indifferent form and Casemiro’s more significant struggles. A less conservative coach might have brought them into the fold far sooner, although the duo did not let Ancelotti down when finally given their chance. It is all food for thought for president Florentino Perez, who had not planned to bring Ancelotti in until other options were taken off the table last summer. Some reports suggest the ex-Chelsea boss was the fourth name that Perez turned to. Mauricio Pochettino, who is poised to leave PSG and is no longer likely to take over at Manchester United, may finally get the chance to take over at the Bernabeu, although there is still a Champions League to play for before then. Madrid may face an even greater challenge in the semi-final if Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City hold their advantage against Atletico Madrid, and the Catalan is another coach who will believe he can get the better of his opposite number. Although while Los Blancos retain players as decisive as Benzema, Courtois and Modric - who was serenaded by fans at full-time after playing the full 120 minutes at 36 years old and improving as the game went on - you can never, ever rule them out.

265,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-bidder-pagliuca-selling-atalanta-majority-stake-buy/blte707f55b469c298c,Chelsea bidder Pagliuca hints at selling Atalanta majority stake to buy European champions,"Steve Pagliuca, who is one of the bidders in the running to complete a takeover at Chelsea, has hinted that he is ready to sell his majority stake in Serie A side Atalanta so that a path is left clear for power to be seized at Stamford Bridge. With Roman Abramovich looking to part with Premier League heavyweights after seeing his assets frozen by the UK government, a protracted sale saga is beginning to edge towards a close. Pagiluca, along with the other three interested parties still in the running, must have finals bids tabled in west London by Thursday – two days after the Blues take in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid - with the race on to secure ownership of the current European champions. On his efforts to take control at Chelsea, Pagliuca – who co-owns the Boston Celtics basketball team alongside his sizeable stake in Atalanta – has said in a statement: “During this hugely significant week for Chelsea, we would first like to wish Thomas and the Chelsea squad the very best of luck ahead of tonight’s Champions League match against Real Madrid. Having witnessed a great 6-0 win against Southampton last week, I hope to see a comeback for the ages against Real Madrid in the quarter-final second leg. “This process has been a disconcerting time for the football club and fans. Throughout my life and career, my ethos has always been to operate quietly, with integrity, and let my actions and results speak loudly. However, it is imperative to clarify and assure supporters about our bid group and its commitments, to emphasize how seriously we take our potential responsibility to Chelsea. “Our first focus and goal is to make strategic investments to continue competing for championships and trophies. We will support our players and managers to make sure that Chelsea are habitual winners and title contenders, whether in the Premier League, Champions League or the Women’s Super League [the only Super League we intend competing in, for the record]. In addition, we will continue to invest in the youth academy to develop the stars of the future and we would not be in this process if we did not have an exciting and inclusive vision for Chelsea. “Our second focus will be to continue to cherish and preserve the legacy and traditions of the club. In over 20 years of ownership of the Boston Celtics, we have not once considered changing the name, colours, or logo of the club. This is our guarantee to Chelsea fans. “Not only are we committed to remaining at the home of Chelsea, Stamford Bridge, but we are inspired to renovate or redevelop the stadium. Chelsea is a world-class team, in a world-class city, with world-class fans: it deserves a world-class stadium. “Our third focus will be having a significant positive impact in the community. We believe passionately that clubs have a social responsibility, and we will continue to support The Chelsea Foundation and its impressive work in education, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion both locally and globally. Chelsea should be the Pride of London for its on and off-field accomplishments. It has fans all over the world and we will not tolerate bullying, antisemitism, racism, or any other form of hateful speech - and neither should our fans. “Ultimately, fans will see our commitment and, we hope, trust us to stay true to our values on and off the pitch. We understand the responsibilities that come with such an important sporting institution and hold ourselves accountable to the fans. “Later this week, we will submit a substantial and credible bid proposal – one that we expect will meet the respective requirements and regulations of the Premier League, UK Government and UEFA – and we pledge to honour our commitment to credibility and good guardianship of Chelsea Football Club from day one.” Private equity billionaire Pagliuca, who made his fortune at Bain Capital, forms part of a consortium that is eager to inherit the reins at Chelsea from the departing Abramovich. NBA chairman Larry Tanenbaum, who owns a number of North American sports teams, is reported to be involved. Other co-investors are said to be John Burbank, the founder of the San Francisco hedge fund Passport Capital, and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.

The Spanish team were almost eliminated from the competition as they trailed 3-0 in the second leg of the quarter-final tie at the Santiago Bernabeu, leaving them 4-3 down on aggregate. However, the hosts popped up with a vital goal in the 80th minute to turn the tide, with Modric supplying Rodrygo with the assist in sublime fashion. That goal took the tie into extra-time, where Karim Benzema scored to give his side the lead once more, and Modric admits their hopes of progressing were hanging on by a thread at one point. He told BT Sport: ""Unbelievable to describe this game. We were dead until the goal we scored. Chelsea scored three goals, maybe the first a bit lucky from a deflection. I can’t say we played badly. ""They used their chances well and scored the goals. We didn’t give up. We kept believing, fighting and in the end showed huge character. ""This stadium and the fans were very helpful when we were losing 3-0. They kept supporting us and it gave us a boost to keep believing."" Modric praised coach Carlo Ancelotti for the substitutions he made, with Edouardo Camavinga excelling after he came off the bench and Rodrygo being brought on just two minutes before he scored. The Croatian midfielder acknowledged that it took ""great character"" for Madrid to get the better of a side that he believes is currently the toughest to play in Europe. He added: ""I think mister [Ancelotti] did great changes and [the subs] did well, they had a great impact on the game. ""Certainly in this competition experience plays an important role and I think today it helped us a bit. ""But Chelsea, we knew it even after the first game, that we would have a tough game. ""Because they are, for me, the most difficult team to play against. I watch them a lot because of my friend Mateo [Kovacic], how they play, and they are a very tough, physical team, very compact. ""We knew that it was going to be tough – just like it was. But in the end we showed again great character, great desire, great togetherness and we managed to turn it around, which is amazing.

The German coach claims Marciniak acted too friendly towards Blancos noss Carlo Ancelotti following the second leg on Tuesday. Tuchel also came away from the game upset about a disallowed goal from Marcos Alonso that could have influenced the tie. ""I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague Carlo Ancelotti,"" Tuchel said. ""I know Carlo is a nice guy but when I wanted to go and say thank you for the match, I saw him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponents' coach. ""I think this is the wrong time to do this after a final whistle from 120 minutes where one team gave all their hearts and fought until the last drop.

269,https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-manchester-united-last-win-trophy/blt9372bcb62f9170c9,When did Manchester United last win a trophy?,"Manchester United are one of the most decorated teams in English football, with a reputation as one of the biggest clubs in the world. However, ever since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, silverware has been hard to come by. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer went close to securing a trophy in 2021, but his Red Devils side ultimately lost out to Villarreal in the Europa League final and the club legend departed his post without securing any honours. Elimination from the Champions League last 16 in 2021-22, meanwhile, ensured their wait goes on. So when exactly was the last time Manchester United hoisted a trophy overhead? GOAL brings you everything you need to know - date, who was on the team, manager and more. Manchester United last won a trophy in May 2017, when they lifted the Europa League. Then managed by Jose Mourinho, the Red Devils defeated Ajax in the final of the UEFA competition, winning the game 2-0, with goals from Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan sealing silverware. It was the first time they had won the competition in the club's history. The moment @ManUtd lifted their 6th European trophy and celebrated their place in the 2017/18 #UCL...#UELfinal pic.twitter.com/LjFebYdnNc Winning the Europa League granted the club a route into the following season's Champions League, something which would otherwise have eluded them after they finished sixth in the Premier League that year. United also won the Carabao Cup that season, beating Southampton 3-2 in the final at Wembley in February 2017. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance, with Jesse Lingard getting in on the act too. They had also won the 2016 Community Shield, allowing fans to boast of a silverware 'treble' in 2016-17. The Manchester United squad in the 2016-17 season, when they last won a trophy, featured legendary players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney. Bastian Schweinsteiger was also on the books before he left for Chicago Fire in March 2017. It was Paul Pogba's return season, after he completed a big-money transfer from Juventus, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan joined from Borussia Dortmund. Memphis Depay began the season on United's books but departed in January 2017, leaving for Lyon. You can see the full Manchester United 2016-17 squad in the table below.  No. Pos. Player.

Fans turned up at Old Trafford at 1pm to protest against the Glazer ownership with banners and flares - however things soon escalated, as some protestors pushed down barriers to force their way into the ground and made their way onto the pitch ahead of one of the biggest games of the season. Chants of ""we want Glazers out"" could be heard as they stormed into the ground.​  Goal  understands some fans attempted to get into the dressing rooms, as over a thousand supporters protested against the ownership. A Manchester United club statement read: ""Following discussion between police, the Premier League, Trafford Council and the clubs, our match against Liverpool has been postponed due to safety and security considerations around the protest today. Discussions will now take place with the Premier League on a revised date for the fixture.""Our fans are passionate about Manchester United, and we completely acknowledge the right to free expression and peaceful protest.""However, we regret the disruption to the team and actions which put other fans, staff, and the police in danger. We thank the police for their support and will assist them in any subsequent investigations."" Liverpool also released a statement, saying they were ""in full agreement"" with the decision to postpone. They said: ""It is our position that public safety must be the number one factor in any such decision, with the ability to provide a secure environment for the participants, staff and officials being a particular priority. It was clearly not possible for this to be guaranteed today due to a situation which escalated rapidly. ""We will continue to have dialogue with Manchester United, the Premier League and the local authorities to find a suitable date to reschedule. As soon as we have this information we will update our supporters accordingly."" A statement from the Premier League read: ""Following the security breach at Old Trafford, the Manchester United vsLiverpool game has been postponed. This is a collective decision from the police, both clubs, the Premier League and local authorities.""The security and safety of everyone at Old Trafford remains of paramount importance. We understand and respect the strength of feeling but condemn all acts of violence, criminal damage and trespass, especially given the associated Covid-19 breaches. Fans have many channels by which to make their views known, but the actions of a minority seen today have no justification.""We sympathise with the police and stewards who had to deal with a dangerous situation that should have no place in football.""The rearrangement of the fixture will be communicated in due course."" The protests were  spurred on by the failed proposals of the European Super League  , with supporters showingtheir angeragainst the Glazer family and trying to push for the 50+1 fan ownership model seen in Germany. It was the first planned protest the fans have taken part in since the ESL debacle nearly two weeks ago. Footage then emerged on social media of some supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford, having broken into the stadium at around 2pm. Many of the fans carried flares and banners,chanted against the club's ownership, and some even kicked a football around on the pitch and sat on the goal nets. 💪💪💪💪  pic.twitter.com/NDghqHpilL These 2 protestors have now played more football at old Trafford than donny van de beek 😭👋😭  #GlazersOut   pic.twitter.com/lyXWBqQNso The invaders were initially removed from the pitch and police were working to clear debris from the playing surface, with the kick-offinitially scheduled for 4.30pm. However, more fans subsequently broke back into the ground, and while they were also escorted out eventually, there was great doubt over whether the game couldgo ahead as 4.30pm came and went without kick-off, before an official statement was finally made over an hour after the expected start time. Players and coaching staff werenot at the stadium at the time, and were advised to remain at their team hotels with the game in doubt. Some club staff and media were being held in a car park while a decision is made. Goal understands Liverpool's players and staff were able to leave their hotel and head home around 6pm, however Man Utd's squad had to remain indoors for safety. A lengthy statement from Greater Manchester Police gave insight into the events of Sunday afternoon. They said:""Early this afternoon, groups of protestors began to gather at Old Trafford and separately at The Lowry Hotel, Salford where the United players were staying. By late afternoon around 200 protestors had gathered outside the Lowry and over 1,000 at Old Trafford. ""Officers continued to closely monitor the situation, engaging with those present but as the groups grew in size; it became clear that many of those present were not intending to exercise their right to peaceful protest. Flares were let off and bottles thrown at officers. ""Protestors outside Old Trafford became especially aggressive and antagonistic towards police before a group of about 100 forced entry to the ground with some United staff having to lock themselves in rooms. ""Those in the stadium were evicted by officers but outside on the forecourt hostility grew with bottles and barriers being thrown at officers and horses. Two officers have been injured with one officer being attacked with a bottle and sustaining a significant slash wound to his face requiring emergency hospital treatment. ""With the situation increasing in hostility, additional officers had to be deployed and officers had to be drawn in from neighbouring forces to assist Greater Manchester officers. ""Following discussion with The Premier League, Trafford Council and the clubs, a joint decision was made to postpone the match for safety reasons. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said: ""The behaviour displayed today by those at both Old Trafford and The Lowry Hotel was reckless and dangerous. ""We understand the passion many supporters have for their team and we fully respect the right for peaceful protest. Plans were in place to ensure this could happen safely, but it soon became clear that many present had no intention of doing so peacefully. ""We have launched an investigation and we will be working closely alongside partners to ensure we establish the full circumstances surrounding today's events and prosecute those responsible."" Manchester United fans have been opposed to the Glazer ownership since the American family bought the club in 2005. They bought the club through a leveraged buyout for around £790 million ($1.1 billion). The money for the buyout was funded by debt that they would pay off from the club’s future profits. Since then the club have already paid out over £1 billion (€1.4bn) in bank fees and dividends to the owners. While there have been protests over the years they have ramped up again recently due to the club’s involvement in the proposal of the ESL. Joel Glazer was one of the driving forces behind the now botched plans and it has reignited anger amongst the supporters who want the family to sell their shares in the club.

Fans congregated outside the training ground on Friday, with around 30 in attendance, before eventually being moved on by security with access having previously been gained during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign as manager. There were no acts of violence, with Man Utd moving quickly to ensure that matters did not get out of hand. A club spokesperson said: “There was a small and peaceful protest outside the Carrington training ground today. We respect the opinions of fans and remain committed to strengthening our engagement with them.” Man Utd are currently working under the guidance of interim boss Rangnick, who was drafted in as cover when Solskjaer was relieved of his duties in November 2021. The German has been unable to deliver a reversal in fortune, collecting only nine wins from 22 games at the helm, and can appreciate those in the stands feeling frustrated. He said: “We all know that football is a game of passions and emotions and we can all understand. Can understand the supporters being disappointed about where we stand in the table and the performance against Everton after we had conceded that first goal. “I still believe our supporters are one of the best, if not the best in England, as long as they do the protest in a peaceful way and as long as they still support the team in the stadium. Emotionally I can understand them being disappointed.” Red Devils midfielder Fred told MUTV of performances on the pitch sparking unrest off it: “I know the fans wanted much more from this season. “They wanted us to go further in all competitions, the cups and the Champions League. We could have gone further, but I'm sure the fans will support us throughout, we know they're behind us. We'll aim to do our best, so they're always alongside us. “We want them beside us, constantly shouting and celebrating every goal. I'm sure they'll be with us in the forthcoming games.” United fans, led by the 1958 group, have vowed to continue with peaceful protests against the Glazers, with the intention being to remain outside the ground for 17 minutes when the home game with Norwich gets underway on Saturday.

The 33-year-old has been at Old Trafford for five seasons but has struggled for regular action in the Red Devils midifeld this campaign. The former Chelsea player still has a year left on his contract but has informed the club of his intention to move on this summer. Announcing the news on Instagram, Matic said: ""After a great deal of thought, I have decided that this season will be my last with Manchester United. I have informed the board, the manager and the players of my decision. ""It has been a huge honour and a privilege to play for this great club. A big thank you to the fans for their unwavering support. ""I will now give everything until the end of the season to help my teammates finish as strongly as possible."" Matic has made 183 appearances for United since joining from Chelsea in the summer of 2017, scoring four goals. Manchester United were already facing a midfield rebuild job this summer, with Matic's departure merely exacerbating this situation. Fred and Scott McTominey have generally been first choice for the defensive midfield positions but have struggled for consistency. Paul Pogba's future is uncertain with the Frenchman out of contract at the end of the season. Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard will also become free agents and are expected to move on, while Donny van de Beek was sent out on loan to Everton in January.

The Dutch coach is in advanced talks with the Old Trafford side and looks set to take over as head coach this summer. Ten Hag's current side are still fighting for the domestic double, as the Eredivisie leaders take on PSV in the KNVB Beker final on Sunday.

The Red Devils continue to work under the interim charge of Ralf Rangnick for now, with the experienced German drafted in to bridge a gap between two permanent appointments following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United cannot afford to allow events off the field to become a distraction in the present, as they chase down a top-four finish, with Champions League qualification vital if future progress is to be made once a new coaching team is put in place. United have seven games left to take in this season and currently sit seventh in the Premier League table, six points adrift of Tottenham and with only one victory secured in their last seven matches across all competitions. Speaking to Sky Sports, Brazilian defender Telles has said of the rumours regarding potential managerial moves: ""No, I don't think it influences us because we know what we have to do. ""There are people at the club working on the new manager - but that's for next season. And next season depends on what we do in these remaining games, so we need to stay focused. ""We can't think about who the next manager will be, we need to think about working hard in our next game."" Ajax manager Erik ten Hag has been interviewed over the Manchester United job this week 🇳🇱 pic.twitter.com/n6NxODLiwk He added on the need to start righting a few wrongs on the field: ""Everyone in the dressing room really wants to win. ""No player at this club doesn't have this desire. We know about our responsibilities - we have families, we have dreams, we have objectives. ""We want to do the work, not talk and turn this situation around. We know the quality we have, we know the expectation the fans and the club have of us and we need to be prepared to do our best to change things for the better. ""If I didn't believe we can still rescue the season then I shouldn't be here. ""We know the duty we have to meet our objectives. We can't think of the games further ahead, we have a 'final' against Norwich in front of us first."" The Red Devils are due to play host to rock-bottom Norwich on Saturday, with victory imperative in that contest after losing 1-0 to struggling Everton last time out. Telles believes that a tide can be turned, saying of the areas that United need to improve in order to hit their ultimate targets: ""We need more consistency. We've started games really well, but there are moments where the opponents have been on top and then we've lacked solidity, which has affected results. We need to keep it up for 90 minutes. ""We know how quickly things can change in football and the team that concentrates best and really focuses will be successful. So it's a case of improving our solidity and being compact.""

The full-back picked up the problem in training last month and, after seeing a specialist, it has been decided it requires surgery. As well as missing the remainder of Arsenal's Premier League games, the 24-year-old could also now be a doubt for Scotland's World Cup play-off against Ukraine, which is currently scheduled for June. In a statement Arsenal said:""Kieran felt discomfort after a training session on Thursday, March 31. Further assessments and scans have confirmed that Kieran has damaged his left knee. ""A specialist consultation took place on Tuesday, and as a result of further discussions with Kieran and our medical team, it has been decided that Kieran requires surgery to his knee. This procedure will take place in London in the forthcoming days. ""Kieran’s rehabilitation programme will start immediately after his surgery, at which stage a clearer understanding will be established on his recovery timescale. However, it is likely that Kieran will now miss the remainder of this season. ""Everyone at the club will now be supporting and working hard with Kieran to get him back on the pitch as soon as possible."" In addition, Arsenal said midfielder Thomas Partey is continuing to be assessed after picking up a thigh issue against the Eagles on Monday. This is a real blow to Arsenal’s hopes of securing a top-four spot this season. The biggest issue for Mikel Arteta is that Nuno Tavares, who is Tierney’s understudy, is suffering from a major crisis of confidence at present. He was withdrawn at half-time on Monday night after being given a torrid time by Crystal Palace and Arteta must now decide whether to give the young Portuguese left-back another opportunity. If he opts against using Tavares, he would potentially have to use Granit Xhaka as a makeshift left-back. But with Thomas Partey also facing up to some time on the sidelines with a thigh problem, that would leave Arsenal very short in central midfield. Arteta has been fairly fortunate when it comes to injuries so far this season, but the loss of Tierney at such a crucial stage of the campaign is a hammer blow. And with right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu not expected back in full training until after the Southampton game on April 16, Arsenal’s options on either side of the back four are suddenly looking very limited. As well as a blow for Arsenal, it is also bad news for Scotland manager Steve Clarke ahead of that summer meeting with Ukraine. The play-off was originally scheduled for last month but was postponed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The game has been rescheduled for June, though that date could change again because of the ongoing conflict. When the game is eventually played the winner will play Wales for a place at Qatar 2022.

Arsenal and Barcelona had been locked in talks over a potential loan deal for the 32-year-old over the weekend, only for them to break down on Monday afternoon. However, in a dramatic turn of events, Aubameyang looks set for a switch to Camp Nou after all after ending his contract at Emirates Stadium by mutual consent. Talks between Arsenal and Barcelona hit a major stumbling block on Monday over what percentage of the striker’s wages - believed to be in the region of £340,000 a week - the Spanish side would cover. It looked like the 32-year-old, who flew out to Barcelona earlier in the day, would have to return to England without a deal being done. However, an agreement has now been reached between the two clubs that will see the Gabon international join the five-time European champions permanently, with Arsenal confirming his release. ⚡ For the match-winning moments 🙅‍♂️ For the iconic celebrations 😀 For making us smile Thank you for everything, @Auba ❤️ ""Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left the club by mutual agreement,"" Arsenal revealed in a statement on Tuesday.

Aubameyang had 18 months left on his contract with the Gunners, but has not featured since early December having been banished from the squad by Mikel Arteta following a disciplinary breach. The former Arsenal captain posted an emotional farewell message to Gunners supporters on his Instagram page on Tuesday night.

277,https://www.goal.com/en/news/vlahovic-juventus-transfer-potential-season-changer/blt185826b8e3141808,Vlahovic's shock €75m transfer a potential season-changer for Juventus,"As with every previous transfer between Fiorentina and Juventus, the insults began before the deal had even been done. Not long after GOAL's Romeo Agresti revealed on Monday that the Bianconeri were ready to submit an official offer for Dusan Vlahovic, banners were hung outside the Stadio Artemio Franchi attacking the Viola striker. In most, he was referred to as a 'gobbo' ('hunchback'), a derogatory term for Juventini related to superstitious belief that hunchbacks benefit from good fortune. The obvious implication is that the Bianconeri have long benefitted from favourable officiating. Some furious Fiorentina fans went far further, though. In some instances, depressingly predictable racial insults were combined with thinly-veiled death threats. ""Your guards won't save your life,"" one banner read. ""Gypsy, for you, it's over."" It was typical grandstanding from attention-hungry ultras – of which there are many in Italy – but it also provided an insight into the intensity of the rivalry between Fiorentina and Juve. There were, for example, riots on the streets of Florence in 1990 when the club decided to sell Roberto Baggio to their most hated rivals against the player's will. A young Matteo Renzi, the former Italian Prime Minister, was even part of the famous protest in Piazza Savonarola and this week he admitted Tuesday was ""like a day of mourning in Florence"". “We’re on live television, so I must try not to swear,” he told La7. ""But I'm absolutely furious. ""Why do Fiorentina always have to sell everyone to Juventus? At least send some to different clubs.” Newly-appointed Viola president Rocco Commisso even referenced the Baggio deal in 2019, when Juve emerged as one of a number of clubs interested in signing Federico Chiesa. A Firenze tifosi infuriati. #Vlahovic @tvdellosport #sportitaliamercato pic.twitter.com/AoU4UmpfR3 ""I will not make the same mistake that was made with Roby,"" the American told Il Sole 24 Ore. ""Roby was the greatest player ever and they sold him just for money... ""As far as I am concerned, Chiesa is our champion and I won’t sell him even for €100 million (£84m/$113m)."" Commisso, though, sold Chiesa in 2020 for approximately half that figure as part of deal that was structured in a very favourable way for Juve: an initial €3m (£2.5m/$3.4m) loan for the first season, €7m (£5.9m/$7.9m) loan for the second, with a conditional obligation to buy in 2022 for €40m (£33.5m/$45m), plus €10m (£8.4m/$11.3m) in variables. Commisso later claimed Juve ""stole"" Chiesa by giving him ""a lot more money"", pointing out that in modern football ""money counts"". In that sense, his decision to also flog Vlahovic to the Old Lady for €75m (£63m/$85m) is unsurprising, even if it means sixth-placed Fiorentina will now have to try to qualify for European competition next season without Serie A's current top scorer. After all, the Viola were desperate to cash in on a player who made it repeatedly clear through his agent that he had no intention of extending a contract that was set to expire in 2023. They knew that they were going to lose him eventually anyway, and wanted to do a deal before his value dropped at the end of the season. So, when the interest of a number of Premier League clubs failed to yield a concrete bid, Fiorentina had no issue letting Vlahovic leave for Juve, given the Old Lady offered even more than the €70m (£58.5m/$79m) asking price. There is also the fact that Vlahovic has long had his heart set on a move to Turin. His desire to join the Bianconeri was never any secret. As far as he and his agent were concerned, the much-touted move to Arsenal was never an option.So, Vlahovic joining Juve is no surprise; what is shocking is that it's happened now. The Serbia star has long been viewed as the ideal solution to their striking problem – Massimiliano Allegri's side have scored just 34 goals in 23 Serie A outings this season. However, even as recently as last week, it was felt unlikely that the Old Lady's Vlahovic dream could become reality. He was considered far too costly for a club hit so hard by the financial crisis caused by Covid-19. So, questions are now obviously being asked as to how Juve – who posted a record-breaking loss of €210m (£175m/$237m) for 2020-21 – have pulled off the seemingly impossible? Well, a €400m (£335m/$450m) capital increase courtesy of EXOR, which owns 63.8 per cent of the club, has certainly helped. The biggest cash injection in Italian football history was always envisaged to be ""completed by the end of 2021"", and while it was arranged primarily in order to address Juve's pandemic-related liquidity issues, money was also to be set aside for ""maintaining sporting competitiveness"". According to Calcio e Finanza, that meant approximately €80m (£67m/$90m) could be invested in the transfer market and it's worth remembering that Juve won't be paying the full Vlahovic fee up front, but rather in instalments. Cristiano Ronaldo's shock move to Manchester United just before the close of the summer transfer window has also played a part here, as he was costing Juve about €87m (£75m/$103m) on an annual basis in wages, taxes and amortisation. The Vlahovic deal simply would not have happened were Ronaldo still in Turin. However, it is also highly likely that the 22-year-old's arrival will result in at least a couple of departures, as the Bianconeri look to trim their squad and reduce their wage bill. Juve never had any intention of taking up their option to buy Alvaro Morata on a permanent basis, meaning the Spain international will most likely join Barcelona, with the permission of parent club Atletico Madrid. The Old Lady is still trying to push the unwanted Aaron Ramsey to join a Premier League club this month, while Arthur could yet end up at Arsenal if a low-cost replacement can be found (perhaps Nahitan Nandez of Cagliari), given the Gunners are willing to pay the Brazilian's wages for the duration of a proposed six-month loan stay at the Emirates Stadium. Juve would still rather Arthur leave on an 18-month loan but they are open to letting Dejan Kulusevski join another club, probably Tottenham, until the end of the current campaign and they would certainly let Rodrigo Bentancur move to Aston Villa on a permanent basis if the price is right. It will also be worth keeping an eye on Paulo Dybala and his representatives between now and the close of the transfer window. A €10m extension that was essentially agreed last year remains unsigned because of Juve's doubts over the Argentine's ever-increasing injury issues. All of those involved in these protracted negotiations are set to meet again in February, but the Vlahovic deal has cast them in an entirely new light. Juve now have the No.9 they wanted to build their new attack around. Their need to meet Dybala's wage demands has only decreased further. Any offer from elsewhere for Dybala, who could leave at the end of the season for nothing, would now be seriously considered. Certainly, Juve's bargaining position has just been significantly strengthened. If Dybala decides against taking a pay cut, he will just leave on a free transfer, with Inter and a couple of top English clubs reportedly interested, but his exit would no longer be the end of the world for Juve, as they would essentially be removing one of their highest earners (€13.5m gross) from their wage bill. They also believe that in Vlahovic they have one of the leading lights of a new generation of goalscorers, alongside Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe. Cynics will understandably point to the fact that he remains untested in the Champions League, but Vlahovic could end up securing Juve's qualification for next season's competition, which is obviously a major factor in this deal. By moving now rather than at the end of the season, the Bianconeri have got the jump on all over their rivals for his signature, while at the same time significantly boosting their hopes of securing a top-four finish – and the financial boost that comes with it. There was no better striker in Serie A in 2021, and only one more prolific across all of Europe's Big Five leagues: Robert Lewandowski. For a side lacking a killer in front of goal, Vlahovic should prove a godsend. Of course, he will not solve Juve's offensive issues on his own. Allegri's painfully pragmatic tactics remain a major cause for concern.There will not be much point in having a lethal finisher up front if you cannot get him the ball. As former Italy international Daniele Adani told the Gazzetta dello Sport, ""If Juventus don't improve their idea of football, it might not be enough."" However, there is a reason why Vlahovic's signing has provoked as much anticipation in Turin as it has fury in Florence. This isn't a game-changer for both Juventus and Fiorentina; it's a potential season-changer. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

278,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-aubameyang-decision-vlahovic-uncertainty/blt69ab1b1f0a705d0b,Arsenal's Aubameyang dilemma: Arteta faces season-defining decision as Vlahovic uncertainty grows,"What do you do with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang? It's a question that Arsenal are debating right now and whatever they decide could prove pivotal to the club’s season. Aubameyang has not kicked a ball for the Gunners since thePremier League loss at Everton on December6, with the 32-year-old finding himself banished from the squad having been disciplined for arriving back late from an overseas trip to see his mother. It was the latest in a series of disciplinary breaches by the frontman and resulted in him being stripped of the captaincy by Mikel Arteta. The striker’s future has been in doubt ever since and now Arsenal are mulling over a firm bid for the former skipper from Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr, whilst there is also believed to be interest in him from several clubs across Europe. The offer from Al Nassr is for a loan until the end of the season, with an obligation to buy in the summer for around £6.7 million ($9.1m). So far Arsenal have yet to respond, with Arteta and the club hierarchy still pondering what they should do. And it’s no surprise that they are taking their time as the decision could go a long way to deciding whether Arsenal can sustain their push for a top four finish in the Premier League this season. Arsenal would like to accept the bid and move on – but it’s not as simple as that. Ever since Aubameyang was taken out of the squad, Arteta has been using Alexandre Lacazette as his central striker, with Eddie Nketiah his primary back-up option. So far, that has been enough for Arsenal to get by, but after a free-scoring end to December, the goals have dried up in January, with the Gunners scoring just once in four games. So, it would be a big risk to commit to playing the entire second half of the season with Lacazette and Nketiah – who have just three league goals between them this season – as your only central strikers. There is also the added complication that both are out of contract in the summer and expected to leave. Arteta has previously insisted that he is not concerned by either player's contractual status and he is confident both will continue to play with total commitment despite knowing they will be free agents at the end of the campaign. However, he will know that is far from an ideal situation, which is why the Gunners are in the market for at least one striker. “At the moment, [the squad] is extremely thin,” Arteta admitted prior to Thursday night’s Carabao Cup semi-final defeat against Liverpool. “That is why we have a plan to try to bring players in with the right qualities to improve the squad in the best possible way.” The big issue facing Arsenal, however, is being able to sign a top-quality striker in January. Dusan Vlahovic, the Fiorentina forward, is the name on everyone’s lips, but he and his agent are understandably keen to wait until the summer before deciding on his next move. With just 18 months left on his contract, Fiorentina want a transfer sorted now to ensure they get as high a fee as possible. However, Vlahovic and his representatives know that he will have a host of clubs queuing up for him this summer and, crucially, he will also know which of those interested clubs can offer him Champions League football. It will, therefore, be immensely difficult for anyone to convince him to make a move now. Arsenal hold a strong interest in Jonathan David and talks took place between technical director Edu and the Lille forward’s agent before Christmas to establish the Canada international’s availability. Again, though, David’s preference is to stay put until the end of the season before taking the next step in his career. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is another striker on Arsenal’s list, but it’s extremely unlikely that Everton would even consider allowing their star striker to leave in January while they are flirting with relegation. And that all leaves Arsenal in a difficult position when it comes to Aubameyang. On one hand, the prospect of removing his £340,000 ($460,000) salary from the wage bill 18 months ahead of schedule is an enticing one, especially with a transfer fee – albeit a relatively modest one – also on the table in the summer. However, can they afford to take the risk of letting him leave now, when there is still so much of the season to play and without having a replacement already through the door? Of course, Arteta does have the option of making peace with his former captain. Should he bring him back into the fold, that would give the Gunners time to work on securing one of their key striker targets for the summer. A lot could depend on the results of the medical checks that Aubameyang has been undergoing with specialists in London during the past few days. Just as it seemed he was about to be available again, he was sent back to England – with the Gabon FA announcing he had suffered some sort of cardiac complication. “He is in London and now he is going through some examinations,” Arteta confirmed on Wednesday. “We haven’t had any clarity from the Gabon national team about the reasons why he came back ,so obviously it is our obligation to make sure that medically the player is safe. “Historically, everything we have done with the player, he has never had an issue. Hopefully, that is the case.” Aubameyang has since taken to social media to reveal that the checks didn’t pick up any issue. “My heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy,” he said, whilst also stating that he was ""already back at it"". Should that indeed be the case, then Arsenal have to decide what to do with Aubameyang. Either Arteta brings him back into the fold or the club lines up a replacement before letting the forward leave. Should Arsenal fail to do either, then a season that promised so much, could end up running out of steam. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

However, Mikel Arteta's side are now reaping the benefits of a smart summer recruitment campaign and, after a fine run of form since September, they presently sit fourth in the Premier League standings. Arsenal’s vibrant youngsters have exceeded all expectations so far and despite a few poor results – most notably the recent defeats at Manchester United and Everton – they are now starting to show they are a match for any team in the country, as underlined by their excellent showing against Manchester City on Saturday. New signings Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Martin Odegaard have made a big impression, as have Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares when called upon. So, could Arsenal look to strengthen further during the January transfer window in an attempt to boost their bid for Champions League football? Below, GOAL takes a look at the deals that could be done at Emirates Stadium in the coming weeks... Given Arsenal’s significant outlay during the summer transfer window, it’s unlikely that the Gunners will spend big this month. Arteta has already played down suggestions of the club doing any major business, but that does not mean they will not dip into the market should a good opportunity arise. A new striker is top of the agenda, while the Gunners are also eyeing a central midfielder. The likelihood is that the club will wait until the summer before pushing for one of their key targets, although they could fast-track a move for a forward should Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang end up leaving the club once the winter window opens. Arsenal are longtime admirers of Lille forward Jonathan David but are also keeping close tabs on Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Free-scoring Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic has been heavily linked, but sources at Arsenal continue to play down suggestions they are serious contenders for the 21-year-old. With Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny due to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations in early-January and Ainsley Maitland-Niles attracting interest from home and abroad, Arteta could find himself light in central midfield. Arsenal continue to be linked with Lyon’s Bruno Guimaraes, but while a move for a new midfielder cannot be ruled out, the Gunners do not want to rush into doing something hasty. A short-term option could be appealing, such as the loan move which brought Odegaard to Arsenal from Real Madrid last January, but players of such quality are hard to find at this stage of the season. A potential wild card could be Jack Wilshere, with the former England international having spent the past two months training with the first team in a bid to improve his fitness and find himself a club in January. Rising star Charlie Patino, who scored against Sunderland on his first-team debut on December 21, could also be given more opportunities with Partey and Elneny away on international duty. The major talking point heading into the January window is Aubameyang's future. The forward was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy by Arteta last month after his latest disciplinary breach and has been training away from the senior squad ever since. Aubameyang, who will represent Gabon at the AFCON, has not been involved in a matchday squad since the defeat at Everton on December6 and there are now significant doubts over his Gunners future. It is understood the club will not stand in his way should he wish to move on in January, but finding a buyer could prove difficult – despite reported interest in his services from the likes of Barcelona and Juventus. Arsenal will probably have to accept a loan bid with a view to a permanent transfer at the end of the season. It is set to be a similar story with Ainsley Maitland-Niles. The midfielder continues to struggle for minutes and Everton, who tried to sign him last summer, remained interested heading into the winter. Roma, though, have won the race for the 24-year-old after a breakthrough in talks on Tuesday, with Maitland-Niles set to join fellow England international Tammy Abraham at Stadio Olimpico after a loan deal was agreed. Another player Arsenal could sell is Eddie Nketiah. Arteta wants to keep the young striker but he has turned down several contract offers and, with his current deal due to expire in the summer, Arsenal may reluctantly accept a bid in January rather than lose him for nothing in six months' time. Crystal Palace are keen but there is also strong interest in the forward from Germany. Arsenal could allow Calum Chambers to leave on loan due to his lack of game time, while centre-back Pablo Mari – who has not featured since September – is also currently surplus to requirements. Several Arsenal youngsters are also expected to be farmed out, with Folarin Balogun all-but-certain to join a new club until the end of the season. The young striker has plenty of suitors and Arsenal are aware that he needs to be playing regular senior football to continue developing. Several Championship clubs are interested, but Middlesbrough are leading the race and a move to Teesside could be wrapped up relatively swiftly. Under-23s midfielder Tim Akinola is another player Arsenal could look to send out on loan, while the likes of George Lewis, James Olayinka and Omar Rekik could also be allowed to leave on a temporary basis. Alexandre Lacazette will be free to leave at the end of the season and is expected to bring his time in north London to a close. Arteta has consistently said that a firm decision on the Frenchman's future will only be taken in the summer and has not ruled out the possibility of him staying put. However, the likelihood is that Lacazette will move on and Arsenal will bring in a new striker ahead of the 2022-23 season. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

280,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-overhaul-arteta-restoring-gunners-lost-soul/bltfa5f328906eb3a94,The Arsenal overhaul: How Arteta is restoring Gunners' lost soul,"When Mikel Arteta returned to Arsenal in December of 2019, he was shocked by what he found. It had only been three years since he had called time on his playing career and left north London to take up a role within Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at Manchester City, but much had changed in that short space of time. The club he had left behind in 2016 felt different. The stadium, the training ground, even some of the players remained the same. But much of the soul had been sucked out of the place. It didn’t feel like Arsenal anymore. When asked during his official press unveiling whether he thought the club had lost its way, he replied, ""That's what I'm sensing from the outside. I would like to take some steps to start to understand the reasons why. “There will be reasons behind it, and a history behind it, and I have to try to understand quickly why this is. “We have to create the right vibe, the right energy, and everybody at the organisation has to feel so privileged to be here. There's no other way.” It’s now been almost two years since Arteta made those comments and he has spent much of that time trying to bring a sense of identity back to the inner sanctum of the club. During his time as a player in north London, which stretched from 2011 to 2016, Arteta was well aware of what it meant to be at Arsenal. Arsene Wenger had spent two decades building an identity for which the club had become known throughout the world. But that identity became fractured during the final stages of the Frenchman’s reign. There was in-fighting behind the scenes over how Wenger’s departure should be handled, while large sections of the fans were becoming more and more frustrated with the direction in which the club was heading. Unity was a thing of the past and the cracks that were starting to appear widened during Unai Emery’s short tenure. The Spaniard was an extremely hard worker, but that came at a cost. He would shut himself away in his office, which was situated near the entrance of the main building at London Colney, and players and staff would often go hours without seeing or hearing from him. And he would often find no time to take any sort of interest in the youth teams or attend any of the games which were staged at the training ground. A disconnect appeared. There was no togetherness, no sense of everyone pulling in the same direction in anattempt to turn things around. “I found an environment, a culture that I wasn’t feeling identified with,” Arteta said. “It’s about having a feeling of being privileged to represent this club every time you come through that door. “If that is lost, you have to go, get back in your car and drive home because we are not going to move this club the way we want without a purpose.” The Gunners boss added: “If I have to define our identity, that is one word: Unity. Without unity, you can’t achieve what we want to achieve. “Unity means every person that works in the organisation. It’s our way of playing, our way of transmitting our values, our way of connecting with our fans, our ownership. “Everybody, uniform, thinking in the same way, with the same purpose, without any individual agendas, without any egos. “That’s what we want to get, and I am going to push the boat very, very fast.” One of Arteta’s biggest strengths is his ability to get players to buy into his way of thinking. But he is also ruthless, as many have found out. His first two years at Arsenal have been spent trying to completely overhaul a fractured squad which was bloated and contained players on big money that he did not believe suited the direction he wanted to take the club. It took some time, but slowly they have all been moved out and now, for the first time since he returned as manager, he has a squad that feels like his own. The summer transfer window felt a big moment in the rebuild, with the six additions adding a fresh and vibrant feel to the changing room. And the changes are now beginning to bear fruit, with Arsenal travelling to Manchester United on Thursday night sitting fifth in the Premier League and outside the top four on goal difference only. But it’s not just on the pitch that things are improving. Arteta’s work behind the scenes has been just as productive. He has pushed through big changes at the training ground, which has been given a facelift to celebrate former glories and remind the current players of the standards they need to try and follow. Arteta felt the corridors around London Colney were too sterile, so pictures, murals and inspiring quotes have been put up on the walls, with more to follow soon. One huge mural that the squad must walk past before heading out to train every day celebrates the record setting 49-game unbeaten run, while a giant picture of Arsene Wenger now greets the players when they enter the building each morning. A quote from Wenger sits on the wall underneath it, which reads: “Here you have the opportunity to get out the greatness that is in each of you.” When asked why having Wenger’s presence at the training ground was so important to him, Arteta told GOAL: “For me, it’s something that we lost and we have to recover. “I wanted that picture and a phrase that is very inspirational at the entrance because it was a big part of what he did at Colney and how everything started at the Emirates. “You just look at his eyes and it’s as if he’s there. He has this capacity, he penetrates when he looks at you.The players really benefit from it. He had to be there.” Arteta is now pushing for Wenger to return to the club in person, albeit not in a role of any official capacity. What the Spaniard would like is for his former boss to feel welcome enough to visit London Colney whenever he wants and to be able to pass on his experience, both to the coaching staff and the players on an informal basis. ""I think he would have a great time just seeing the environment he can create around him when he is around this place,” Arteta explained.""Things take time and I think he has to dictate those timings. ""What I can say from my side, and I think on behalf of everybody, is that we would be delighted to have him much closer."" As part of the London Colney facelift, Arteta has moved out of the office that both Wenger and Emery had by the main entrance and moved into one that sits next to the offices held by other members of the coaching and management staff. He works extremely closely with technical director Edu and academy manager Per Mertesacker, with group meetings now held in an open space within the new coaching area to try ensure there is a sense of openness and togetherness throughout the building. Arteta is now regularly spotted wandering over to watch youth games and training sessions and, along with Mertesacker, he is keen to bring legends back to work with the club’s youngsters. David Seaman has returned in recent months to help out with the academy goalkeepers on an informal basis, while Jack Wilshere was given the opportunity to work towards his coaching badges while he gets himself fit ahead of the January transfer window. There is still lots to be done at Arsenal and the ‘process’ that Arteta has spoken about since he returned is far from complete. But there is certainly a sense that the club is now in the best shape behind the scenes that it has been for a long time thanks to the work that has gone on during the last two years. Arteta said he found an environment he couldn’t identify with when he arrived in 2019. Now, two years on, the environment at Arsenal is starting to feel a bit more familiar.

The trio were on target to fire the Gunners to a 3-1 lead in the Premier League clash at Vicarage Road. Fabregas took to Twitter to share his admiration for the three players during the match. ""Saka and Odegaard are the present and future of Arsenal. Two big, big talents,"" he posted after Arsenal's first two goals. How could I forget him…. 🙈 After Martinelli chipped in with the third, the ex-Arsenal star added: ""How could I forget him…."" The three players have been in fine form for Arsenal this season. Odegaard's opening goal was his fifth in the league in the current campaign, while Saka got his fifth assist when he set it up. Saka then went on to net his eighth Premier League goal of 2021-22 before Martinelli sent it curling into the top corner for his fifth strike this term. A win on Sunday would lift Mikel Arteta's team to fourth in the Premier League, with Manchester United sitting a point behind them ahead of their derby clash with Manchester City. The north London side went into the game looking for a fourth consecutive win in the English top-flight, having beaten Wolves on two occasions and Brentford. They will host Leicester next Sunday in the league, followed by a home game against Liverpool three days later. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

282,https://www.goal.com/en/news/captain-outcast-how-aubameyang-lost-way-arsenal/blt470fb418d2006bfd,From captain to outcast: How Aubameyang lost his way at Arsenal,"""My manager!"" Those were the two words Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang posted on social media on August 1, 2020, just a few hours after Arsenal had beaten Chelsea 2-1 to win the FA Cup. Those words accompanied a picture of Aubameyang and Mikel Arteta standing arm in arm while holding the famous trophy on the Wembley pitch. Just over a month later, the pair were pictured together again, this time at Aubameyang’s house as he signed his huge new contract which ended months of speculation over his future. It was a contract Aubameyang hinted he may not have signed, had it not been for the influence of his manager. ""I had a chat with Mikel,” said the 32-year-old. ""He was straight and honest, and that's what I like because we are always honest. ""He said 'okay, you can maybe leave. I don't know what your mind is [thinking] right now, but you can leave and go for trophies at other clubs, or you can stay here and have a legacy.' ""This, for me, was the key word."" At that point in time, Aubameyang and Arteta looked like a match made in heaven for Arsenal. But what a difference 16 months can make. Now, as Arsenal prepare to take on West Ham on Wednesday, the Gabon international finds himself out in the cold in north London. The player who almost single-handedly fired the Gunners to the FA Cup less than two years ago has been stripped of the captaincy, and is currently not being considered for selection. It is a remarkable fall from grace, and one that stems from a series of incidents which Arteta believes have made Aubameyang's position as captain untenable. The latest came last week when Aubameyang returned home late from a trip abroad. It is believed he was given permission by Arsenal to travel to see his mother after defeat at Everton on Monday, but that he was explicitly told to return to England by Wednesday. He did not, however, return until Thursday, and that had a knock-on effect with Arsenal’s Covid protocols - something that infuriated Arteta ahead of Saturday’s game against Southampton. Aubameyang was sent home from training and told not to come in on Friday. He was also removed from the squad to face Southampton, with Arteta telling the media before kick-off that his captain had been left out because of a ‘disciplinary breach’. Aubameyang was then called into London Colney for talks with Arteta on Monday, and was informed following those discussions that he was being stripped of the armband. But the decision is not just down to that one incident, as the statement released by Arsenal on Tuesday made clear. “Following his latest disciplinary breach, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will no longer be our club captain,” the statement said. “We expect all our players, particularly our captain, to work to the rules and standards we have all set and agreed.” The fact that the statement started off with the words ""latest disciplinary breach"" was very striking. And, speaking during his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Arteta was just as keen to point out this wasn’t down to one isolated incident. “We have made this decision based on certain moments where he has not fulfilled his duties, and that’s it,” said the Arsenal boss. “The decision that we have taken as a club is very clear. It is because we believe that he has failed to be committed at the level that we all expect and agreed. It is as simple as that.” This was not an easy call to make for Arteta “I feel really sad,” he admitted. “As a coach you are trying to help a player to become a better person, to be fulfilled and to enjoy it on the pitch. “At the moment with this decision, Auba is not going to be able to do that. So for me it is just sadness.“ For Arteta, however, the fact this latest incident arrived just nine months after Aubameyang had been disciplined for arriving late for the north London derby was too much to ignore. He felt he had to take action, especially as there had also been other incidents, including one at the start of the year that saw the striker break the club’s strict Covid protocols. But the Arsenal boss is aware that his decision could go either way with a squad which contains several players who are close to Aubameyang. He is hoping, however, that senior players will put friendships aside and understand why the club decided to go down the route that they did. “They accept the decision,” the Gunners boss said when asked about the impact Aubameyang’s situation could have on the dressing room. “I think they know because they have committed to it, that we want to take our culture, our demands and who we want to be as a club to a different level. “When those standards are not met, you know you cannot participate in our daily basics.” The focus now is on who will step into the void left by Aubameyang. Whether he will remain at the club beyond the January transfer window remains unclear, but a swift return to the starting XI does not look likely. That will leave Arteta with Alexandre Lacazette as his only experienced, senior striker, alongside youngsters Gabriel Martinelli, Eddie Nketiah and Folarin Balogun. Arsenal were not planning on dipping into the January market to bring in another forward. The plan was to wait until the summer before looking to bolster their attacking options. Whether that plan now will now have to be brought forward remains to be seen. Arteta also has to decide on who replaces Aubameyang as captain. The leadership group, which contains players such as Lacazette, Granit Xhaka and Rob Holding, will share the armband for now, a scenario that is likely to remain in place until the end of the season. But a long-term successor does need to be found. Given Xhaka’s rocky relationship with the Arsenal fans and that fact he himself was stripped of the armband in November 2019, it is almost impossible to see him getting the nod on a permanent basis. Many believe Kieran Tierney could be the man, and the left-back does tick a lot of boxes having worn the armband when he was at Celtic, but his poor injury record raises doubts about how often he would be available. Gabriel Maghales, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly influential at centre-back and is enjoying a fine season. But while the Brazilian defender’s English has improved, he is far from fluent, which many would view as a major drawback for a captain in the Premier League. Another option is Martin Odegaard, who is captain of Norway, but he has only just arrived in north London on a permanent basis. And that only really leaves Lacazette. The France striker is currently vice-captain, but with his contract up at the end of the season, he would only be a short-term option. “It is not the moment to [make] any rash decision,” Arteta said, when quizzed on who the next captain could be. Giving himself some time to think about a long-term successor to Aubameyang feels like the correct call, but given Arsenal have had 10 captains since Patrick Vieira left in 2005, this is a decision you feel Arteta has to get right. Arsenal's young manager has made a massive call. He will know that he will now be judged on what happens next. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Pulisic has been a key player for the USMNT since he was a teenager and is now hoping to help his country qualify for the 2022 World Cup after a shocking failure to reach Russia 2018. The 23-year-old's displays for the USMNT have been inconsistent of late, something he attributes to his desire to ""overperform."" ""Sometimes it is tough,"" Pulisic told ESPN. ""I still haven't completely learned. Especially going back to the U.S., sometimes I put too much pressure on myself that I need to do something special where I just need to play the best I can, do what I can do and hopefully people recognise that. ""It is just about playing my game, doing it to the best of my ability and not worrying about what any outside sources say because that's not what really matters. ""For example, in the last national team games, the first couple I'm going into it thinking, 'I need to overperform and do something to save the team,' but there's no need for that because we have a very strong team."" Pulisic made his USMNT debut in 2016 and has gone on to score 18 goals in 45 caps. As a teenager, Pulisic led the USMNT in scoring during their ill-fated qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup. Pulisic has seen a generation of young American talent emerge since then, including Gio Reyna, Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Sergino Dest. As the U.S. aims to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, Pulisic has scored twice in his team's 11 matches – four of which he was forced to miss through injury or recovery from Covid-19. Pulisic was criticised for his performances against El Salvador and Canada in World Cup qualifiers last month, though he managed to come off the bench and score against Honduras in the following match.

Pulisic is under the microscope on two continents, with his status as American soccer's biggest name drawing even more attention to a player going through the highs and lows of playing for Chelsea. Pulisic admitted those highs and lows do weigh on him as he rejoins the USMNT amid an up-and-down spell with the Blues. ""There are two sides of me,"" Pulisic said. ""Especially when people ask you how you are sometimes, there's the soccer side and then there's the person side. The person side is even more important for me and I'm doing alright, in that sense. ""It's a lot sometimes. When I come to the national team, it's: 'How are things with Chelsea? What's this? What's that?' ""It's tough, it's tough. It's definitely played a lot on me and mentally it's been difficult at times, but I'm always very excited to come back with the national team and step away and get to enjoy playing with these guys and get to just enjoying football in general."" Pulisic admitted this season at Chelsea hasn't lived up to expectations, but that he is looking forward to leading the U.S. into World Cup qualifiers this week. ""Obviously it's been up and down this year for sure, not exactly where I want to be and how I want things to be right now,"" he said. ""I'm just going to keep going. ""It doesn't affect me when I come here, so I'm excited to be here."" Pulisic has spoken out several times in recent months about the importance of mental health, revealing in July that he has benefitted greatly from talking to a therapist. He later said he initially believed that he was too strong to ask for help, but has since learned the importance of taking care of yourself mentally especially when playing at the highest level of European soccer. Those admissions came as the spotlight brightened on Pulisic, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League last season while leading the U.S. to Nations League triumph against Mexico. His role this season has been inconsistent under Thomas Tuchel, who has played Pulisic in several different positions this season for Chelsea. In total, Pulisic has made 19 appearances for the Blues this season, scoring three goals despite dealing with some injury issues. He remains a key figure for the USMNT, who are set to face El Salvador on Thursday in their next World Cup qualifiers. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The USMNT star has been on the books at Stamford Bridge since the summer of 2019, when a big-money move was made from Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund. There have been plenty of highs for the 23-year-old in English football, including a historic Champions League triumph, but he has sat out more games than he would have liked. How many has he missed in total? GOAL takes a look... Fitness concerns were never an issue for Pulisic during his days in Germany, with no more than three games sat out for Dortmund through injury at any one time. Early progress at Chelsea was, however, stunted by an abductor muscle tear in his debut campaign – although a coronavirus-enforced lockdown of sporting action did allow him to recover from that ailment. Niggling knocks were proving difficult to shake, though, and another was picked up after scoring in the 2020 FA Cup final against Arsenal. Muscle complaints have held the American back on a regular basis since then, with his ankle proving to be particularly problematic in the 2021-22 campaign as his number of days off reaches 38. Absence Date Games missed Muscle bruise Dec 28-Dec 31, 2019 1 Abductor muscle tear Jan 2-June 6, 2020 12 Calf strain/hamstring injury Aug 1-Oct 4, 2020 7 Quarantine Oct 31-Nov 3, 2020 1 Muscle injury Nov 3-Nov 27, 2020 4 Coronavirus Aug 18-Aug 30, 2021 2 Ankle injury Sep 9-Oct 31, 2021 12 Total 38 Table correct at time of writing on 26/01/2022 Chelsea invested £58 million ($79m) worth of faith in a player of considerable promise when securing his signature in a deal agreed during the winter window of 2019 – before the Blues were stung with a transfer embargo. Pulisic agreed a five-year contract with the Blues and made his debut for the club in a 4-0 defeat away at Manchester United on August 11, 2019. The USMNT star's goal account was not opened until his 10th outing, but that duck was broken in style when bagging a Premier League hat-trick against Burnley in October 2019. An untimely injury was suffered in January 2020, but Pulisic ended his debut campaign with 11 goals to his name. He only managed six efforts last season, but did make history by becoming the first American to play in a Champions League final – a contest that Chelsea won 1-0 against domestic rivals Manchester City. Keep showing the next generation what's possible, @cpulisic_10 💪 pic.twitter.com/wvoucZFm3E The 2021-22 campaign opened for Pulisic with another medal, in a penalty shoot-out victory over Villarreal in the European Super Cup final, but just one domestic appearance was made before heading back to the treatment table. Since then, Pulisic has been a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s plans – registering a well-taken goal in a thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool – but has often been asked to play out of position as his versatility is put to good use. Questions have been asked of why Chelsea have been using him as a makeshift wing-back and central striker when he is more at home on the left wing, but every effort has been made to do a job for the collective cause.

286,https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-pulisic-fifa-22-rating-wants-higher/blt27fb13a289479ba4,USMNT star Pulisic picks which FIFA 22 rating he wants to be higher,"Christian Pulisic has been casting an eye over his Next Generation card in FIFA 22, with the Chelsea and USMNT star of the opinion that a few of his numbers should be a little higher. The 23-year-old is being recognised as a star of the present and future, with an overall rating of 83, but there are areas of his game that he admits can be improved. He is happy with his ranking, which continues to head in the right direction, but feels EA Sports has marked him down in categories that he wants to prove a point in. When clear of niggling injuries, the American forward has shown across two-and-a-half seasons at Stamford Bridge that he is a force to be reckoned with on Premier League and Champions League stages. He has an English top-flight hat-trick to his name, while the target has been found on 19 occasions through 83 appearances in all competitions. While he clearly knows his way to the back of the net, Pulisic has only been given a 72 shooting rating on FIFA. He is a little disappointed with that, telling the Premier League’s official YouTube channel: “I think there is definitely room to improve there. I have scored some nice goals.” Pulisic added on his jumping rating of 79, as someone who can dunk a basketball: “I think it should be a bit higher. Growing up in the States, I played every sport and I think that helps in my all-round athleticism.” Another area that Pulisic feels he has been unfairly overlooked in is the defensive department, where he scores just 38. He said of that score, as he forms part of a Chelsea side that is expected to defend from the front under Thomas Tuchel: “I think I do pretty well defensively. As an attacking player it’s normal, but it could be higher. Our team, everyone defends very well. That seems a bit low.” Pulisic went on to say of his lowly 60 physical rating: “That is low. I’m not the biggest guy, maybe I need to get in the gym a bit more. I think I have a low centre of gravity and am hard to knock off, the ball but maybe I need to get my arms a bit bigger.” A man that joined Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2019 believes certain qualities in his game have been recognised in the latest FIFA offering, with speed an obvious strength. He said of his 90 rating in the pace department: “I’m not mad about that at all.” Quizzed on whether he could beat 91-rated team-mate Timo Werner in a race, Pulisic added: “I never like to doubt myself. I think it would be close, but to be honest Timo is fast.” Another high score comes in the dribbling department, where the U.S. international is given a mark of 87. He said of his creative ability: “I think that’s one of my biggest strengths. We could try and get it to 90, but I’ll take that.” On his 75 passing score, Pulisic went on to say: “We’ll take it. Maybe I need to show them some more flashy passes. Maybe I’m too simple, I need to no-look and stuff like that.” Overall, Pulisic is pleased with his FIFA 22 card, but is eager to reiterate that there is one area that he would like to see improve dramatically in the coming years. He said: “I think I would change shooting and bump that way up. They went a bit high with the dribbling and pace and then low with the shooting!” Chelsea, with just one win from their last four games across Premier League and Champions League competition, will be back in action on Saturday when they play host to Leeds.

287,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-wing-back-defensive-bone-body-chelsea-usmnt-johnson/bltd91b6ae249ced0d0,"‘Pulisic isn't a wing-back, he doesn't have a defensive bone in his body!’ - Chelsea’s use of USMNT star puzzles Johnson","Christian Pulisic’s versatility has been put to good use at Chelsea this season, with the United States international being asked to fill a number of different roles, but Glen Johnson says the 23-year-old is definitely not a wing-back as he “doesn’t have a defensive bone in his body”. A man more at home in a wide attacking berth would probably agree with that, but Pulisic has been doing his bit for the collective cause of late after being moved into striking and defensive berths rather than his typical winger role by Blues boss Thomas Tuchel. He has not looked entirely comfortable in either new position, when operating as a false nine or as an advanced full-back, and Johnson believes a long-term future will be earned by a talented USMNT star once he has overcome form and fitness issues to prove himself back in a more natural position. Quizzed on whether the American has a place in Chelsea’s long-term plans, ex-Blues right-back Johnson – speaking in association with BoyleSports – told GOAL: “I think he does. I like him a lot, but I don’t want to see him at right wing-back because he hasn’t got a defensive bone in his body! “He is so good going forward and you can’t expect him to be good at it all. I don’t think he is a wing-back at all. Somebody like him playing on the left of [Romelu] Lukaku, and [Hakim] Ziyech on the right, you are going to struggle to get three better. “Pulisic works his socks off, I know the lads like him in training and around the place, so he’s a good lad. He’s someone that is willing to work hard and play out of position, but I think to get the best out of him he is definitely better out wide on the left.” Tuchel is still searching for a system that brings the absolute best out of those at his disposal, with questions being asked of whether Chelsea are playing to the strengths of £98 million frontman Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has suggested that he is a little frustrated at present, but Johnson believes a proven performer needs to tinker with his game rather than expecting others to bow to his needs. He said of the Lukaku poser in west London: “You can’t play to one man’s strengths, you have to play to the team’s strengths. If he doesn’t fit that then that’s his problem, not the team’s problem. “I’m a fan of him, he’s a fantastic player and he will score goals, but Chelsea concede more goals when he plays and score more when he doesn’t play. I don’t think he should be barking orders, he should be trying to fit into the style of play. He has got some world-class players around him and he’s an intelligent player so it won’t be hard for him to work it out. “Sometimes at the moment, when he does play, they go to him too quickly and too direct. That’s too easy to defend against because they are so spread out, the defenders know it’s going to Lukaku and they jump on him, put two men around him, and if they lose the ball there, then you are open to the counter – that’s why they concede a lot. If they can find a way of playing that is across the two styles, then he could be a massive player for them. “He is the main man, they bought him to be the final piece of the puzzle as being that big striker they were missing, but they still have a fantastic side. They weren’t one man away, they still have brilliant players and a good way of playing. He needs to fit into it.”  While the Blues are looking to invest long-term in Lukaku’s obvious talents, some serious concerns are surfacing at the other end of the field. Antonio Rudiger, Thiago Silva, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta are all due to be out of contract in the summer of 2022, with there a very real threat that some serious talent and experience will walk away for nothing in a matter of months. Johnson said of that situation: “It’s bonkers. Chelsea normally do their business very, very well – they bring players through and if they aren’t good enough, they sell them for fortunes and they keep recycling. “Those players are so hard to replace. Rudiger has come back to life, he’s playing well, Azpilicueta will run through walls for you – these players are hard to find and when you’ve got them, the easiest thing to do is to keep them on a contract. You can’t let them go for free. I’m sure they will be looking at keeping at least two of them. “If you were going to buy four players that are the equivalent of those four, you are going to be spending over £200m – it’s crazy. Let’s be honest, they aren’t going to be earning £200m between them so it doesn’t make financial sense to let them go for free and try to replace them. “Thiago Silva, the youngsters watching him train is beneficial, and he’s still performing. He doesn’t have the legs to do it every week, but to have people like that, you just can’t find other players like that.” Big decisions on contracts and further additions will need to be made at some stage, but Tuchel is currently more concerned with an alarming wobble from his team that has them looking over their shoulder in a keenly-contested battle for top-four finishes. Failure will not be accepted there, despite landing another Champions League crown in 2021, and Johnson admits that Roman Abramovich will be demanding better than the Blues have been producing of late. Quizzed on how much patience a European triumph will have bought Tuchel, Johnson – who took in Premier League and League Cup triumphs with the Blues in 2004-05 – said: “Not a lot when Roman’s the boss! We know it’s the hottest seat in world football regardless of whether you win stuff or not. If the main man falls out of love with you, you aren’t going to be there very long. “I don’t think Roman will be very pleased if the title race is over by the end of January. That will be important. If the title race is over, he will see it as a flop. It’s going to be hard to catch City, but the race has got to go a lot longer. “I don’t want to say the man is under pressure, because I don’t think he is and I don’t think he deserves to be because he’s done a great job, but we know that if Roman gets something in his head, it’s going to be his way.” Tuchel will have the opportunity to get Chelsea back on track in their next outing, with fellow title hopefuls Liverpool due to pay a visit to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

The Blues have a mountain to climb in their Champions League quarter-final tie, with Blancos striker Karim Benzema having helped himself to a hat-trick in Wednesday's first leg at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel was disgusted with his side's performance, particularly during the first half, and says that they have little chance of turning things around at the Santiago Bernabeu, admitting that they will get ""hammered"" if they do not defend better than they did at home. ""The amount of chocolate I needed was immense to go through the [first leg] again and compensate,"" Tuchel told reporters at Cobham. ""You sit there in the middle of the night, it is not nice, you start writing and writing and writing. ""You realise that you are spending more and more minutes trying to explain [what went wrong] so that you don't forget it. ""At some point, you press the button to watch [the video] at double-speed, just so it passes quickly. When you do that, you know you're not in a good place! ""At some point, you have to stop and take a walk into the kitchen or the lounge, and come back and calm down. It was not nice to watch."" He added, ""Unfortunately, and a bit surprisingly, we lacked structure in the game. Normally, our big strength is that you clearly see what we are trying to do."" The Blues, who were beaten 4-1 at home by Brentford last weekend, will be without injured duo Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ben Chilwell for their next Premier League outing, at Southampton. Furthermore, Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech are also doubtful for Saturday's trip to St Mary's Stadium. Along with fitness issues, there are a number of players out of form, including Ballon d'Or nominees Jorginho and N'Golo Kante. Although Tuchel has acknowledged the pair's struggles this season, he still wants the future of his two senior midfielders resolved this summer, having already had to deal with speculation over several centre-backs on deals that are soon to expire. ""With important players, it’s a wish as a coach that we solve [contractual issues] every summer,"" he said, ""so that it’s clear what the decision is [before the season starts]. ""We have had the same [transfer] talk about Toni [Rudiger] and Andreas [Christensen], now we are just swapping the names [for Jorginho and Kante]. ""We end up talking about [contracts] throughout the winter, then January comes and the agents talk with other clubs… ""It's a bit difficult [to deal with], so it would be nice if we can avoid it. This should be our target.” The Blues boss concluded by defending £100 million ($136m) striker Romelu Lukaku, who has again been linked with a return to Inter this week: ""We bought him because we believed in him. ""Is it working out in the way that everybody wanted? No, of course not. But it is not on him after two defeats. He didn’t even start these two matches.""

The Blues welcomed La Liga heavyweights to Stamford Bridge hoping to establish momentum ahead of a tricky visit to Santiago Bernabeu, but the defence of a prestigious European crown now appears to be all but over after Karim Benzema hit a stunning hat-trick in west London. Kai Havertz did offer Chelsea hope at one stage, when he halved the deficit five minutes before the break, but some uncharacteristically sloppy defending and a spurned opportunity from second-half substitute Lukaku means that a continental mountain must now be climbed in the Spanish capital. Quizzed on how costly Lukaku’s inability to head home a deflected cross from Cesar Azpilicueta could prove to be, Tuchel said: “It was very important. “There are no more away goals so if we have only a one goal deficit or a draw, then you see the momentum is back when we score. We could have even equalised. “There were a lot of spaces and chances. But the individual decisions today were far from our level or standards. “Yes, to come back with a chance like this at 3-2, after 16 shots in the second half alone, then goals are crucial. We didn't get them. We gave a third one away. “It is simply impossible. We cannot demand that we turn it around if this is our foundation from this game.” Brazilian blur 🏃🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/RSs6xzja5s The German tactician is prepared to accept his share of the blame for a disappointing result and performance against Real. He opted to line up with a three-man defence, as Reece James and club captain Azpilicueta were asked to fill wing-back roles. Andreas Christensen endured a tough evening trying to keep Benzema and Vinicius Junior quiet down Madrid’s left flank, with Tuchel conceding that his system was not right. Asked if he got big tactical calls wrong, the Blues boss said: “Yes, it is my mistake.” A winning formula will now need to be found when heading to the Bernabeu next Tuesday, with a Premier League trip to Southampton on Saturday presenting Chelsea with their next opportunity in which to get back on track.

The £100 million club-record signing from Internazionale has been linked with a return to his former club by the Italian media after being benched for the last four league games. Having also been a substitute in the last two Champions League games against Lille, he is likely to be left out against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Hoddle gave his view of the situation and called for the Belgium international to accept his reduced role: ""I’ve never seen an amount of money score a goal to be honest!"" ""Listen, if Chelsea are going to win the Champions League, FA Cup and get into the top four then Lukaku needs to get himself going. ""When you have a substitute like Lukaku, he can affect the game in a different dimension that could be needed on any given day. At the moment, he is coming on and not impacting the game. ""If he looks himself in the mirror, he could say 'right, I am not getting in the team because Kai Havertz is playing so well but every second I am on that pitch I am going to be a threat. I will have good movement and work for chances on goal.' ""Until he does that, then Thomas Tuchel won't pick him. He could give Chelsea another dimension from the bench. He could come on for 10 minutes from the bench and get the winner in the first or second leg. That's the way he can get back into the first team starting eleven. ""It's about banging the ball in the back of the net and showing the eagerness to do it on the training field. He can think about a move in the summer when he gets there but at the moment, it is about the present and he has to look himself in the mirror and get the most out of himself."" Havertz had scored four goals in Chelsea's last three league games ahead of their recent defeat to Brentford, with Tuchel coming out to defend him despite not scoring at the weekend. Christian Pulisic is also in good form for club and country, with Hakim Ziyech having won several matches himself in recent weeks. It leaves Timo Werner as the forward on the fringes and Hoddle isn't sure whether it will ever work out for him in west London. ""He doesn't look confident in a Chelsea shirt and looks more at home in Germany,"" he added. ""He seems to affect the game more from the bench than when he starts. That's not bad to have someone like that up your sleeve from the bench who you can look upon to change the dimension of the game. ""You've got to say, it hasn't worked for him. Will Chelsea wait for another year? I don't know. Werner is a weird one as you could see him moving to a club slightly below Chelsea, they sell him and he goes on and scores a load of goals again. It makes you look stupid. ""There's a lot of players you see like that. I remember buying Helder Postiga for Tottenham who was Portugal's striker and he was scoring goals. It just didn't happen for him and he moved on and knocked England out of the Euros. ""It can happen like that. Something just doesn't click and he has found it tough. At the moment, he can only impact from the bench."" BT Sport is the exclusive home of UEFA Champions League football.

The Belgium international was at the forefront of the Serie A outfit's first Scudetto for a decade last term, but has seen his future grow cloudy amid financial constraint and boardroom turmoil. With title-winning coach Antonio Conte having already left, Inter may well move on further big names to ease costs,butmembers of the club'sCurva Nord fanbase have spoken against any such call. Taking to the team's Milan headquarters, ultras unfurled a banner that read:“To the club, watch out... Promises must be maintained."" They then added a further statement, stating: “Any type of transfer operation must now be, as agreed, to improve the squad. Bringing in cash without adequate investment is not acceptable. That is true for any player. “We will not just lay down and be treated as fools by anyone and we will act based on what we were told at the end of the season. We don’t think anything else needs saying right now.” Speaking amid Chelsea's pre-season draw with Tottenham, Thomas Tuchelwas reluctant to talk about Lukaku as speculation mounts. ""I will not talk about players who don't play in my squad."" the German told his press conference. “He's a fantastic player but he's an Inter player and I will not talk about him in this situation."" Talk of a Premier League return for Lukaku - to the club where he started his English career - would offer the striker another shot to prove his critics wrong after he was deemed to have underperformed at Manchester United. Having rediscovered his best form at Inter, he would provide a fearsome boost for the Blues as they look to back up their Champions League success from last season with further glory under Tuchel this term. Chelsea get their campaign underway in less than a week against Villarreal in the Super Cup, before they kick off their new Premier League season against Crystal Palace on August 14.

The 27-year-old, a member of Germany’s World Cup-winning squad at Brazil 2014, has spent the past half-decade at Borussia-Park, establishing himself as one of his nation’s best centre-backs. But with the news that he will exit North Rhine-Westphalia at the close of the current campaign, clubs have been put on high alert for his services – and the Serie A champions look to be frontrunners for his signature. Ginter confirmed that he would not renew his stay with Gladbach in a lengthy post on social media earlier this week, with the player thanking the club and its fans for making him feeling welcome during his time with them. “After a series of negotiations, I have decided not to extend the contract which will expire in the summer,” the defender wrote on Instagram. “After five excellent years at Borussia Monchengladbach, it is very difficult for me to take this step. “But I have decided to take another path in my career for my personal and professional growth. I owe a lot to Borussia, and I will always have the club and its fans in my heart.” Despite news only breaking this month about Ginter’s future, and with strong interest elsewhere across Europe - including from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich - it is Inter who look to be in pole position for his services. The Milan side have been in discussion with the player’s representatives since November and are hopeful of wrangling him on a free transfer at the end of the current campaign. The club were reportedly happy to have purchased Ginter for a fee in January, but Gladbach, embroiled in a rough run of form, are not willing to lose any of their key players as they attempt to avoid a relegation battle.

293,https://www.goal.com/en/news/coutinho-s-brazil-return-unlikely-due-to-salary-differences/blt7b5835b20724a725,Coutinho's Brazil return unlikely due to salary differences,"Philippe Coutinho's prospective return to his native Brazil has reached an impasse over the Barcelona star's elevated salary demands. The playmaker is unsettled at Camp Nou and keen to seek a new club. But his generous wage package in Catalunya all but rules out a move to even one of Serie A's giants. GOAL understands that Coutinho is looking to leave Barcelona after three and a half underwhelming seasons. The Catalans too are happy to sanction a transfer, despite the Brazilian playing a bigger part in the club's plans during 2021-22 than in previous years. But while several Brazilian clubs have been linked with a blockbuster homecoming for the star, the chances of a deal being struck are slim. Coutinho earns €15 million a year at Barcelona, and wishes to maintain his salary at any potential new club. Such a figure would make him the best-paid player in Brazil by a considerable distance, and not even the likes of Flamengo, Corinthians and Palmeiras, the nation's wealthiest teams, would be able to add that wage burden to their budgets. The Premier League is the ex-Liverpool star's favoured destination, and his management team have already made contact with clubs in England over a prospective move. Coutinho arrived at Camp Nou as one of the world's most valuable creative midfielders following five impressive years at Anfield. But the Brazilian, now 29, has struggled to hit his stride in Spain, and was released on loan to Bayern Munich in 2019-20 after becoming surplus to requirements. A knee injury kept him out of action for most of Barca's following season, but he has played a bigger part in the club's plans this term, featuring in 16 of the club's 18 Liga matches to date and scoring on two occasions.

294,https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-contact-morata-loan-transfer-depay-sale-juventus/blt1c3101c46f71f902,Barcelona agree terms over Morata move as Juventus weigh up offer,"Barcelona have struck a deal with Alvaro Morata for the player to make the move to Camp Nou, but both parties must wait for Juventus to find a replacement for the Spain striker before the transfer is signed off and he can exit Turin, GOAL can confirm. The forward's time in Italy is coming to an end, with Juve having already indicated that they have no intention of exercising their right to purchase the striker outright for €35 million (£29m/$40m) from parent club Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. The Blaugrana have therefore moved to seal his return back to La Liga from Serie A, and have now effectively agreed terms on an 18-month deal for the attacker - but no deal will be confirmed until the Bianconeri have sorted out a successor at Allianz Stadium. Members of the Barca hierarchy contacted Morata’s representatives in recent weeks in order to gauge interest in a return to his home country, having been away in Italy since he was loaned to Juventus last year. Having succeeded Ronald Koeman in charge, Xavi is looking to course-correct the club’s season, with the Blaugrana – much like Juve – caught in something of a rut, and a traditional striker viewed as an integral part of that transition. Now, it looks like that the Catalan outfit have almost got their man, but final concerns remain, including securing consent from both the Old Lady and Morata's parent club Atletico, to whom he has been contracted since 2020. So far, the Bianconeri remain relatively uncommitted on the deal, despite suggestions that they were offered Memphis Depay in part-exchange early on, with the central issue lingering over finding a replacement for Morata. Separately, the forward is contracted to Atletico through to 2023, meaning Barca would also have to reach an agreement with Diego Simeone's side before a move to Camp Nou could be completed. As such, those complications present a barrier to any potential deal being struck between the three clubs before the end of the January transfer window, even if personal terms are all but secure.

Questions had been asked of why two clubs from the north west should be forced to make their way down to the capital that weekend when a lack of train services would make getting to Wembley problematic. Semi-final encounters used to be held at venues such as Old Trafford and Villa Park, which would have been much easier for Reds and Blues followers to get go, but the FA has locked in a date at the home of English football and vowed to provide travel assistance to those intending to make a long journey south. The FA has revealed that the meeting between Liverpool and City will take place on Saturday April 16 at 3:30pm BST (10:30am ET). City’s women’s team are also due to be in last-four action on the same day as the men, with an outing against West Ham due to kick-off at 12:15pm BST (7:15am ET). Regarding the travel issues those in Manchester and Merseyside are facing, a statement from the FA on the organisation's official website reads: “We recognise the significant challenges that are being faced by some Liverpool and Manchester City supporters with train services being severely limited due to essential engineering works being carried out over the Bank Holiday weekend by Network Rail on the West Coast Mainline. “We are pleased to announce that a limited number of free return bus services will be provided for both the Emirates FA Cup and Vitality Women’s FA Cup semi-finals involving Liverpool and Manchester City on Saturday 16 April to support fans from the north west who wish to travel to and from London. Liverpool will play Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals 🍿 pic.twitter.com/GMGFrkYpEf “The FA will charter 100 buses from Anfield and the Etihad Stadium respectively to Wembley Stadium and back. This will ensure that up to 5,000 Liverpool and Manchester City supporters will be able to travel to Wembley Stadium free of charge for their semi-final tie. “We're also committed to providing a number of free return bus services for Manchester City Women supporters travelling from the north west to London. “These bus schedules are subject to availability, must be pre-booked, and the clubs will provide more information in due course. “In addition, we are working with our partners at National Highways to ensure that the road networks are running as efficiently as possible over the Easter period. Hundreds of miles of unessential roadworks will be put on hold to help supporters enjoy the occasion and enhance their journeys, and these motorists are encouraged to make sure that their vehicles are roadworthy before setting off.” The odd semi-final was held at Wembley prior to the venue’s costly reconstruction, with Paul Gascoigne netting a famous free-kick for Tottenham against arch-rivals Arsenal at an iconic stadium in 1991. Both last-four showdowns were staged at Wembley in 1993, when Spurs met the Gunners once again and there was a Steel City derby date between United and Wednesday of Sheffield. Once the ground had been given a serious facelift for the 21st century, the FA decided that all FA Cup semi-finals would be staged at their shiny new home from 2007-08.

The Russian national has been at the helm at Stamford Bridge for almost 20 years, but his ties to his home country have come under scrutiny amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine this week. And while he will be remaining as the club's owner, Abramovich will be less hands-on after ""giving the trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation the stewardship and care"" of the Blues. ""During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the Club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities,"" Abramovich explained in a statement released on Chelsea's official club website. ""I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. ""I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans."" GOAL's Chelsea correspondent Nizaar Kinsella says: ""The statement released through Chelsea's website is vague and leaves open a lot of questions.

""The trustees will step in and resolve any issues that the owner Roman Abramovich normally would."" ""It leaves it open that Abramovich can return to Stamford Bridge in the future. However, it is mostly about disassociating himself from the Blues as much as he can in the meantime. ""It remains to be seen if this is enough to end the club's association with Abramovich in the eyes of the UK government, who could move to sanction the club's owner in the event of further escalation of violence from Russia's president Vladimir Putin."" The 55-year-old businessman first entered English football in 2003, when he took over Chelsea from previous owner Ken Bates. Under his stewardship, the Blues have become one of the Premier League and Europe's elite clubs, winning five league titles and twice lifting the Champions League, in 2012-13 and 2020-21. It remains unclear exactly how Abramovich will be involved with Chelsea after Saturday's stunning announcement, which comes on the eve of the club's Carabao Cup final with Liverpool. He will, however, be less involved with the running of the club, having announced that the ""stewardship and care"" will rest with the trustees of the Blues' charitable foundation.

297,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-owner-abramovich-terrified-of-sanctions-and-is/blt65b817648df68ca2,"Chelsea owner Abramovich 'terrified of sanctions & is selling London properties', claims Labour MP Chris Bryant","Roman Abramovich is ""terrified"" of facing sanctions from the British government over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, claims Labour MP Chris Bryant, who suggests that the Chelsea owner is currently selling off his properties around London. The Blues supremo, a frequently linked ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has come under increasing pressure over the past week following Moscow's attack upon their neighbouring Eastern European nation. The 55-year-old has already issued a statement indicating the transition of responsibilities at Chelsea to other members of the club, but now opposition MP Bryant has suggested that he is attempting to evade potential sanctions, while criticising the government for their failure to act faster. ""The government has said that it wants, quite rightly, to sanction DUMA members, and it wants to sanction members of the Russian Federation council, but has not been able to do so yet,"" Bryant addressed the House of Commons during a session on Tuesday. ""Alisher Usmanov has already been sanctioned by the EU, but not yet by the UK, but I suspect that he will be pretty soon on a UK list, and Everton should certainly be cutting ties with him already. ""Roman Abramovich, well, I think he's terrified of being sanctioned which is why he is already going to sell his home tomorrow and sell another flat as well. My anxiety is that we're taking too long about these things. The Government is taking too long to introduce sanctions. pic.twitter.com/f9yugGVAnB ""Now, I have a suggestion on what might help. I fear that the government is frightened of letters, lawyers' letters from all these oligarchs' friends. One way to circumvent that is if ministers just read them to the record, in a proceeding in Parliament all the sanction criteria, and then they'd be protected."" As one of the most high-profile Russian figures on British shores, Abramovich could face any number of the sweeping - though not all-inclusive - sanctions laid out by the Conservative Govenment under Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Asset freezes have already been ordered on a number of individuals, as well as major Russian banks, while potential deposits by those foreign nationals will be capped, as the Ukraine-Russia crisis continues to unfold. Such sanctions could prove difficult for Abramovich to avoid, but could also spell trouble for Chelsea's own financial situation too. While their owner remains mired in the fallout of last month's invasion, Chelsea will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of Sunday's Carabao Cup final loss to Liverpool in the FA Cup this week. The incumbent Champions League and Club World Cup holders face Championship outfit Luton Town for a place in the quarter-finals. After that, they will return their attention to both the Premier League, with a game against relegation-threatened Burnley at the weekend. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Abramovich has come under increasing pressure over the past week following Russia's attack on Ukraine, with Labour MP Chris Bryant saying the Chelsea owner is ""terrified"" of facing sanctions from the British government. The Blues owner has already released a statement saying that trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation would take the ""stewardship"" of the club from him indefinitely, but Wyss says he is part of a group trying to buy the club from the Russian businessman. Wyss is a Swiss-born businessman that currently resides in the U.S., having made his fortune as founder and former president and chairman of Synthes USA, a medical device manufacturer. The 86-year-old has a reported net worth of over $5 billion and has been named one of ""the most philanthropic people in the world"" by Forbes. Wyss has donated millions to environmental causes in recent years and his Wyss Foundation charity has over $2 billion in assets.

Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is behind a consortium with Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, with the pair having worked together in business in the past. The sale of Chelsea is being run by Raine Group, a New York-based merchant bank, on behalf of Abramovich, who is keen to sell his UK-based assets before any sanctions, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, take hold. British lawmakers are working to sanction high net-worth individuals from Russia who may have associations with the federation's President Vladimir Putin. Indeed, the leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer MP, is the latest to question why Abramovich hasn't already been sanctioned by the UK. Any sanctions from the United States or European Union (EU) could also impede Abramovich's ability to move the funds of any sale of the club, with that having wide-reaching implications in the UK. This comes after a large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia which has led to the worst fighting in Europe for several decades. Abramovich confirmed that the club is officially for sale in a statement released on Wednesday. It is believed that Abramovich wouldn't have put the club up for sale had it not been for the geopolitical events that have unfolded in the last week or so. ""Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly,"" Wyss told the Swiss newspaper Blick about bidding to takeover Chelsea on March 1. ""I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea  from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2bn. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don’t know the exact selling  price."" Abramovich is seeking between £2bn ($2.5bn) and £3bn ($4bn) but people with an understanding of the situation believe the valuation will fall rapidly with each passing day. It could lead to a 'bargain' purchase for a sports team that has won 21 titles in the last 19 years, including being the current holders of both the Champions League and Club World Cup. There is thought to be competition for the US-Swiss bid which is Abramovich's only avenue to try and drive up the price of the sale, by encouraging a bidding war. Those other interested parties have yet to be revealed but leaks could occur ahead of the Friday deadline. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The decision to create a Super League hasbeen derided by UEFA, the Premier League, and even the UK Government, who will aim to put barriers in the way of Chelsea, who have also resigned from the European Clubs' Association,and the 11 other teams from starting a new competition. The situation has left Chelsea supporters alienated from their club and they will stage a socially distanced protest at Stamford Bridge against the board while removing the fan-made banners inside the stadium ahead of kick-off against Brighton on Tuesday. ""They say expect the unexpected, but today the Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST), our members and football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal,"" read a statement. It added: ""This is a decision of greed to line the pockets of those at the top and it has been made with no consideration for the loyal supporters, our history, our future orthe future of football in this country. ""It is likely that this proposal with never come into existence, however, it speaks volumes that [Chelsea] are prepared to risk our existence in the Premier League and the FA Cup."" It concludes that ""there has been no mention of this secretive proposal"" despite recent ""extensive talks"" and CST now ""demand answers"", adding: ""This is unforgivable. Enough is enough."" CST has seen a surge in membership in the last 24 hours, with a new wave of supporters looking to impact the future direction of their club. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel said: ""That’s what I love, to play the toughest competitions in Europe. That’s why I’m at Chelsea. ""I don’t get involved with all these subjects around us, I’m a bit sad all these subjects are around now, I thought we could talk about Man City and the Brighton game. That’s maybe not the case today. ""I want to play these club competitions, I trust the club to make the right decisions and it’s too early to judge everything and it’s not my part. ""On my badge from Chelsea it says I have to play my role. My role is to be coach, to be focused and we have an important game coming up tomorrow."" Chelsea have broadly supported their owner Roman Abramovich, who bought the club in 2003 to kickstart the most glorious era in the club's history. Not only did he invest in exciting superstar new signings across his ownership, but he has invested in a new training ground, the academy and a host of charitable projects that have resonated with the fans. One of the few friction points that the Russian billionaire has had with the supporters was in 2011 when he tried to take ownership of the pitch from supporters. It regarded plans to build a new stadium for Chelsea in London at another location other than Stamford Bridge, which the club's supporters had the power to reject. Although Abramovich owns almost every aspect of Chelsea Football Club, the actual pitch at Stamford Bridge is owned by the fan group called the Chelsea Pitch Owners.

Tuchel, who is in the process of picking his players up following Chelsea's Carabao Cup final defeat to Liverpool, faced the media on Tuesday ahead of their next game against Luton Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup. The German was predominantly quizzed on matters outside of football, though, and appeared exasperated when the topic of Abramovich handing over control of the club to trustees amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine repeatedly cropped up. Tuchel had already addressed the matter before the Blues' date at Wembley on Sunday, and reiterated his stance when asked about the ""big things going on"" behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge. ""Same thoughts as the day of the final, I think that for me as a coach and in charge of the first team that decision does not change too much the daily business,"" he said. ""Because I'm in the daily exchange with Petr Cech and very regular exchange with Marina, about how to improve the first team. And this will not stop because they stay in charge. So on a daily basis it will not change too much for me."" He was then pressed on whether the club ownership is a problem in the current international situation, to which he replied: ""I have to say that's a bit too much for me to answer. I'm not aware of any details, and I'm not aware of the whole situation. We all agree there are situations much, much more important than football, this will never change. ""And situations like war are of course so much more important. But the role from Mr Abramovich is not on me to comment, because I simply don't know enough about it."" The journalists present didn't stop there as they went on to reference the reports that Abramovich has been asked to help broker peace talks in Ukraine due to his status as one of the richest people in Russia. Questioned on whether the billionaire businessman can affect the conflict, Tuchel responded: ""Listen, listen, listen – you have to stop. I am not a politician. You have to stop, honestly. I can only repeat it. And I even feel bad to repeat it because I never experienced war. ""So even to talk about it I feel bad because I am very privileged. I sit here in peace and I do the best I can, but you have to stop asking me these questions. I have no answers for you."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Abramovich has already been sanctioned by the UK government, with the Chelsea owner announcing prior to those sanctions that he intended to sell the club. Restrictions on Abramovich have now heavily impacted Chelsea's business due to measures put in place by Britain. The EU have now joined the UK government in sanctioning Abramovich after member states formally approved a fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The sanctions include an import ban on Russian steel and iron, an export ban on luxury goods worth more than €300 and cars costing more than €50,000, and a ban on investments in oil companies and the energy sector. Abramovich is one of 14 Russians impacted by the latest package. ""Roman Abramovich is a Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin,"" the EU said in a statement. ""He has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him. ""This connection with the Russian leaders helped him to maintain his considerable wealth. He is a major shareholder of the steel group Evraz, which is one of Russia's largest taxpayers. He has therefore been benefiting from Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea or the destabilisations of Ukraine. ""He is also one of the leading Russian businesspersons involved in the economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federations, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine."" Abramovich has instructed merchant bank Raine Group to find a new owner for the club amid theRussian oligarch being sanctioned by the UK government, with around a dozen groups said to be interested. The UK sanctions prevent Abramovich from making money off of Chelsea's impending sale, with the bidding process deadline set for Friday. Chelsea will not necessarily be sold to the highest bidder, but rather to one that could provide ""added value"" via their ownership. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The France youth international of Nigerian descent contributed an assist as goals from Wilfried Zaha, Will Hughes, Marc Guehi and Jean-Philippe Mateta helped the Eagles see off Frank Lampard’s men at Selhurst Park. Following his latest contribution, Olise has now been directly involved in five goals in four FA Cup appearances this season (two goals and three assists) - the most of any player. 5 - @CPFC's Michael Olise has been directly involved in five goals (2 goals, 3 assists) in four FA Cup appearances this season, the most of any player. Fever. pic.twitter.com/BYdfPVmMNJ Overall, the 20-year-old’s eight assists in all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign are the joint-most of any Premier League player aged 21 or under, alongside Manchester City’s Phil Foden. After a vibrant 83 minutes display, he was subbed off for Christian Benteke. For his contributions against Lampard’s side, Olise recorded two shots, one key pass and two dribbles, while he was fouled on five occasions. In addition, he accounted for five crosses, 22 passes and a passing accuracy of 68.2 percent. For man-of-the-match Zaha - who bagged his 10th goal in the current campaign, he saw every minute of action alongside Cote d’Ivoire prospect Guehi who was also on target. Eberechi Eze was named in the starting XI but got replaced by Luka Milivojevic in the 71st minute - the same time Odsonne Edouard was thrown into the fray for Mateta. 2021 Africa Cup of Nations winner Cheikhou Kouyate also made way for Hughes who scored the last goal for Patrick Vieira's side. With Everton two goals down, Nigeria international Alex Iwobi replaced Seamus Coleman in the 73rd minute, albeit, the former Arsenal man could do nothing to stop the rout. Iwobi could only muster nine touches, one cross, six passes and a 100 percent passing accuracy. Thanks to this result, Palace have now booked their place in the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since they were runners up in the 2015-16 campaign. Iwobi and Zaha are expected to fly to Africa on Monday as they hope to help Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire respectively in their quest to qualify for the 2022 Fifa World Cup billed for Qatar.

Ziyech scored one of the goals as Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in the FA Cup at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday. Good results, according to the attacking midfielder, is what makes them proud, despite what the club is going through. ""We as a team, how difficult the situation is, we always finish the job. We can be proud of that and after the break too, [we] look forward to what is coming,"" Ziyech told Chelsea TV. ""I've been impressed [with the team]. We've played in so many competitions, we always stood there, always ready, and always make it come through over 90 minutes."" The Moroccan said his strike was a perfect one as he described the move that led to the second goal. ""It's a good day for myself, of course, and for the team as well. We go back to Wembley, that's the most important thing. We move on,"" he added. ""It started good, on the left. We switched sides at the right moment. Azpi [Cesar Azpilicueta] made the run behind me, I had two options and I found the space,"" the African star explained. ""Without thinking, I thought I've got to shoot and it went in. It was a perfect goal."" The former Ajax star shared his fears during the game but revealed he is ultimately happy that they got the job done. ""In this kind of game, it's always important to score early. If you don't score in the first half, or at the beginning of the game, they start believing in it. It will then be a difficult afternoon,"" he concluded. ""We finished it quite early in the first half. Of course, they had some moments where you could maybe think they could come back. But in the overall game, we didn't have a lot of trouble. ""Even in the second half, we had a couple of good moments to make it 3-0, but we didn't. In the end, 2-0 is good enough to go to Wembley.""

305,https://www.goal.com/en/news/djed-spence-manchester-united-linked-compared-alexander/blt6dc2e1c1de2dc6bb,Djed Spence - The Manchester United-linked star compared to Alexander-Arnold and eyeing Liverpool upset,"Trent Alexander-Arnold may be out, but there will still be a swashbuckling right-back on display at the City Ground this weekend. Nottingham Forest fans wouldn’t swap Djed Spence for anyone right now, and no wonder. The 21-year-old, on loan from Middlesbrough, has been attracting the attention of a host of top clubs with his performances in the Championship and, on Sunday, he will get the chance to test himself on the big stage, as Forest take on Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Spence has already made his mark against Premier League opposition this season. Both Arsenal and Leicester found the Londoner too hot to handle – Gabriel Martinelli named him as his toughest opponent of the season – and he warmed up for Jurgen Klopp’s side by scoring Forest’s first goal, a 25-yard screamer, in their 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night. His fan club is growing by the week. Bayern Munich are among those to have expressed an interest, while Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United have all received glowing reports. Middlesbrough expect to sell this summer with Spence, whose contract expires in 2024, already valued at more than £15 million ($20m). Some, indeed, believe that to be a conservative estimate. “He could get sold for £25m ($33m),” said Jonathan Woodgate, Spence’s former boss at Boro, after that eye-catching display against Leicester last month. “He’s that good.” Ian Wright would certainly agree. The Arsenal legend was so impressed by Spence’s performance against the Gunners in January that he sought him out afterwards to offer some advice and encouragement. ""I said 'Listen, my friend, you're on loan from Middlesbrough and I don't know what's happened there, because if you can't get into the Middlesbrough side, I don't know what's wrong, so I need to know the full story,'"" Wright revealed. ""But let me say, that was one of the best right-back performances I have seen for a very long time.” He added: ""If we are talking about right-backs performing at an unbelievable level, we're talking about Reece James and Trent, but I have not seen a combative, technical, swashbuckling performance like that for a very long time. ""I said to him, in all seriousness, 'That level we saw there? You should be in the Premier League.' Simple as that."" Born in London to Jamaican parents, Spence was first spotted playing for Junior Elite, the Beckenham-based grassroots club which helped launch the careers of Wilfried Zaha, Victor Moses, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emile Smith Rowe, among others. Smith Rowe, indeed, is a former team-mate but while he would move to Arsenal, Spence would join Fulham, leaving for Middlesbrough shortly before his 18th birthday in 2018. It was Tony Pulis, the former Stoke and West Brom boss, who gave him his professional debut, but it was under first Woodgate, and later Neil Warnock, that he emerged as a regular at the Riverside Stadium. Woodgate loved him, but Warnock’s relationship with him was a little more complicated. Spence, he said, had “all the tools”, but he questioned his mentality and dedication. He let him join Forest on loan, he said, because “he needed to sort himself out"". “He could be playing at a top club in England or in non-league in five years,” Warnock added. “I don’t know which one.” We have a better idea now, that’s for sure. Spence has flourished at Forest, where his role as a wing-back accentuates his physical and technical gifts. “I think Steve Cooper is the manager for him, to be honest,” says Warnock. “He has let him go forward more often, which suits his game.” Cooper, a former U18s coach at Liverpool, is certainly a fan. ""I am very fond of him,"" he told The Athletic recently. “He is a sensible lad and you can tell that he cares a lot about the next game, about Forest – he loves Forest. You can see it in the way he plays. “He is laid-back. That is probably the right description of him. But when you get engaged in a conversation with him, he is a thoughtful character. ""We love having him and our job is to keep trying to get the best out of him.” On Friday, Spence earned his first call-up to the England U21 squad, reward for his consistent, and eye-catching Forest performances. There, he will meet up with the likes of Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones, and on Sunday he will be able to introduce himself personally. Liverpool, of course, arrive as favourites, and with an unprecedented ‘quadruple’ in their sights, but Forest will relish the chance to get stuck into their famous visitors. And if they are to cause an upset, then Spence is likely to have a key role. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A group of highly-rated youngsters that are hoping to follow in the footsteps of the fabled Class of ‘92 and some iconic past cup winners such as David Beckham and Paul Pogba saw off Wolves 3-0 in their semi-final showdown. Maguire, who lined up against the Red Devils for Sheffield United the last time they made a Youth Cup final in 2011, spoke to the squad before their warm-ups on Wednesday while fellow first-team stars and former academy graduates Dean Henderson and Scott McTominay were also among those in attendance. United’s success at youth level has caught the eye of everyone at Old Trafford, with long-serving defender Jones – who does not grace social media very often nowadays – offering a message of support. A special message for our #MUAcademy U18s from Phil Jones 💬We’re all right behind you, lads! 🏆💪#MUFC | #FAYouthCup https://t.co/wIOMbJrlrB pic.twitter.com/q4NYQ1RYcC Whatever Maguire said before a meeting with Wolves, it clearly worked as his presence helped to inspire a comfortable win for those hoping to one day grace the same team that he currently captains. Head of Academy Nick Cox said of United’s skipper taking time out to pass on words of advice: “Harry popped down to the dressing room before the game to speak to the boys. “He approached us yesterday. Harry was watching Youth League games at Leigh Sports Village in the early rounds at the beginning of the season. He's got a keen interest, he watches youth team games, this isn't a gimmick, something he's done for tonight's game. This is consistent with his behaviour but obviously it catches the attention tonight. “He approached us yesterday and said it is something he'd like to do. Travis and Harry have a relationship because they were part of the same Sheffield United group that came to Old Trafford in the Youth Cup in 2011, so that was something we welcomed. “It was important for the boys to know they had support from across the club and the club captain, so it was nice he could pop in, say a few words, then sit back and watch the game with us in the directors' box. “I'm confident the boys would've been delighted to see Harry there in his usual reassuring and calm manner, sharing some words of experience. Of course, he's played in big games here as a youth player, he played in a Youth Cup final, so it was nice he could share some of his experiences.” #MUFC celebrate after reaching the Youth Cup final for first time since 2011. Really impressive performance. Mainoo excellent. Gore, McNeill and Garnacho all very good. pic.twitter.com/XZZLzuTzR1 Rhys Bennett, captain of United’s U18 team, added: “It was really nice of him to give us some words of wisdom. “It was a confidence boost having the Manchester United captain take his time to come into the dressing room, it was an amazing feeling. “It’s a very prestigious tournament. It was a big lift. We knew what we wanted to do but we’re not finished.” United are still waiting to discover who they will face in the 2022 FA Youth Cup final, with Chelsea set to meet Nottingham Forest on the other side of the draw.

He had just completed 90 minutes of Premier League football for the first time since January 2020 – something that in the darkest days of his recovery from injury he feared he wouldn't be capable of doing ever again. Jones' fitness issues first started before he signed for United, when he was still at Blackburn Rovers, and while he bravely battled on with the effects caused by the severe meniscus damage he suffered in his right knee in a game against West Ham in December 2010, it caught up with him after his move to Old Trafford. During his 11 years at United, he has been sidelined on 22 different occasions with various injuries. However, he has not let that deter him. During the first coronavirus-enforced lockdown, he would get up before his children to do extra running and gym work. Consequently, when he returned to training with the rest of the senior squad in 2020, he felt fitter and stronger than ever before. But then, injury struck again, and he required surgery which ruled him out for the entirety of last season. Cruelly, his injury record, facial expressions and form have led to the centre-back becoming a figure of ridicule during his United career, so much so, in fact, that he deleted all of his social media accounts in 2017. That may have spared him all of the abuse he received online, but it did not stop him becoming a scapegoat. In August 2020, Twitter were forced to apologise to the player after United lodged an official complaint with the social networking service after it posted a picture of the 29-year-old which provoked a stream of abuse. It hasn't just been faceless fans who have unfairly attacked Jones either. His former team-mate Rio Ferdinand called him a ""waste of time"" on YouTube back in August. It is believed that Ferdinand's attack prompted Jones to give a detailed interview on the struggles he has faced in getting back to full fitness. That dedication and determination to play again also triggered an impassioned defence of Jones by then-United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and it is understood Ferdinand has since been in touch to apologise for his comments. Sources say Jones has used the setbacks and criticism to drive him on and anyone that has worked with the centre-back will testify to his dedication and perseverance. After 14 months of rehabilitation, he completed his first full session in August 2021 and was applauded onto the training pitch by his team-mates. It is understood that he is still regularly one of the first at the training ground, in order to do a longer warm-up in the hope that it will minimise his risk of him suffering a recurrence of his injury issues, while his hard work in the sessions has also been noted. Furthermore, he is a popular figure around the club’s Carrington training base, with sources crediting Jones with ""keeping morale up"" during tough times such as these. Not the biggest talking point of the press conference but Solskjaer went on an impassioned defence of Phil Jones after @rioferdy5 comments about him earlier this week. Full quote 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/Uq8srReRXx Jones’ first taste of action this season came in September when he played for Neil Wood’s Under-23s side at Arsenal. Even though it meant a long journey south, he asked to play to boost his attempts to get match fit. Jones was also given the option to make his own way down to London but he chose to both travel and stay with the rest of the team. The group were really impressed with how well he integrated himself and he offered advice to several players, including fellow defenders Teden Mengi and Bjorn Hardley. Jones completed 90 minutes against Arsenal and played another full game seven days later at Leigh Sports Village as United hosted Brighton. He didn't just ingratiate himself to the Under-23s, though. During United's Champions League trip to El Madrigal in November, he asked permission to go cheer on the Under-19s in their UEFA Youth League clash with their Villarreal counterparts. He still hadn't featured in a first-team fixture, though, when he travelled to Spain with the senior squad for the Champions League clash with Villarreal before returning to the team hotel for a pre-match meal with the senior squad. It is this supportive nature, coupled with the dedication and effort he has displayed in training, which has endeared him to Solskjaer's successor, Ralf Rangnick. Indeed, despite the shock Jones' inclusion caused, the German coach had no qualms about starting the England international in Monday's Premier League clash with Wolves a staggering 712 days after his previous appearance for the club. A milestone that's been 712 days in the making.It meant so much to Phil ❤️#MUFC pic.twitter.com/Kd7H7fyedE “I think he did well,” Rangnick said at full time. “Bearing in mind he hasn’t played for two years on that level, you didn’t see that in the game. He played as if he had played in the last couple of weeks."" The emotion of what his comeback meant was clear to see on his face when he left the pitch but it also meant a lot to his team-mates. It is understood David de Gea, Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay all sought Jones out in the dressing room at full-time to pat him on the back, while the fans showed their appreciation too with their vocal backing throughout. So, what's next for Jones? He was only drafted back into the team because of the unavailability of both Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof and both are expected to return imminently. Jones is understandably desperate for game time and a number of clubs are interested in taking him on loan for the remainder of the season, while United are open to offers. Whatever happens, one can only hope that the most difficult days of Jones' career are finally behind him. And even if Monday night turns out to be the last time he starts a game at Old Trafford, then it is a moment he can look back on with pride. United may have lost on the night but playing the full 90 minutes was a victory in itself. Because many doubted it would ever happen again, Jones included.

308,https://www.goal.com/en/news/wayne-rooneys-son-kai-signs-for-manchester-united/yon8yj32905g1lhivwd0gfhh9,Wayne Rooney's son Kai signs for Manchester United,"Wayne Rooney's son Kai has signed for Manchester United at the age of just 11 with his famous father proud to see his offspring make an important first step towards becoming a footballer. Rooney established himself as a United legend during his 13-year stay at Old Trafford. The ex-England international played over 500 games for the Red Devils, scoring 253 goals. That tally saw him become the club's all-time top scorer, and he also managed to win 16 trophies in Manchester, including five Premier League titles and the Champions League. Kai has now taken the first steps on the road to following in his father's illustrious footsteps, putting pen to paper on a youth-team contract. Rooney posted an image of himself standing over the 11-year-old as he signed the deal next to his wife Coleen on social media, with his famous old number 10 shirt laying on the desk. The Derby County player-coach included the following caption: ""Proud day. Kai signing for Man Utd. Keep up the hard work son."" Proud day. Kai signing for @ManUtd. Keep up the hard work son ❤️ pic.twitter.com/tTYuUZj7yn Kai is Wayne and Coleen's firstborn son, with the couple sharing three more boys:Klay (7), Kit (4)and Cass (2). Rooney took some time off from his duties at Derby to return to Manchester and take in a landmark moment with his family, having overseen the Rams 2-0 home win over Swansea in the Championship on Wednesday night. The 35-year-old is seeking to land the top job at Pride Park on a permanent basis afterPhillip Cocu's sacking in November, having initially made his way to the club from MLS outfit D.C. United in January. Rooney spent two seasons in the United States after leaving boyhood club Everton in 2018, which is where he wrapped up his Premier League career after being sold by United a year earlier. The Red Devils great played down his achievements at Old Trafford in an interview with the UTD podcast last month, insisting he doesn't feel like the club's greatest goalscorer of all-time. “Ruud van Nistelrooy, if he had more time here, he would have gone on to get the United record,"" Rooney said.""Obviously it is great and I am really proud to have those records, but it is not something I look at. ""It says ‘Man United’s greatest goalscorer’ but I wouldn’t say I am Man United’s greatest goalscorer.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

With his dad holding the honour of being the Red Devils’ all-time leading scorer, there are some sizeable boots for Rooney junior to fill at Old Trafford. He is showing signs of heading in the right direction, with an ability to score goals clearly being passed down from one generation to the next. Rooney junior has been part of United’s academy system since landing a youth contract with the Premier League heavyweights in December 2020. Wayne wrote on Instagram at the time: ""Proud day. Kai signing for Man Utd. Keep up the hard work son."" That message has been heeded, with Kai taking to his own Instagram account to update followers on his progress. Having already registered a hat-trick for the Red Devils’ U12s, Rooney went one better in a meeting with arch-rivals Liverpool when he grabbed all four efforts for his side in a nine-goal thriller.  Kai Rooney is not the only offspring of a familiar face to be gracing the academy ranks at United. Cristiano Ronaldo’s son, Cristiano Jr, has also linked up with the Red Devils following his father’s return to Manchester from Juventus over the summer. He is the same age as Kai Rooney, meaning that they may be lining up alongside one another as their famous dads once did. Charlie Savagemeanwhilesigned a professional contract with United in April and is looking to emulate the efforts of father Robbie, who graduated out of the club’s ‘Class of 92’ to enjoy a career as a Premier League regular and full Wales international.

Fred rescued a point in a particularly anonymous display from the Red Devils at Old Trafford against the Foxes, to slip three points off fourth-placed Arsenal, with the in-form Gunners holding two games in hand over their rivals. With Tottenham level with United and with an extra match to play too, the likelihood of securing top-tier European football looks like it could be a bridge too far at the Theatre of Dreams now, and Neville concurs that their hopes may be out of reach. ""I think so,"" Neville said when asked if United's top-four prospects were over. ""The run-in started today following the international break. They had to start it with a win but they didn't get it. It was the way they drew the game - that was really bad out there today. ""Sometimes, teams can look a bit rusty when they come back but I thought the break would work for United as I thought it would be good for players to get away from the club and then come back and give it a right go. ""This is going to be a long two months for those United players and fans. It's going to be difficult in their remaining eight matches if they continue in that vein of form. It was so flat."" After coming second in the Premier League last term and narrowly missing out on the Europea League following a marathon penalty shootout, the Red Devils had been expected to challenge this term, particularly with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the fold. But instead they stuttered across the first half of the season, leading to Ole Gunner Solskjaer's dismissal and the arrival of Ralf Rangnick on an interim basis through the end of the season. The German has failed to dramatically improve matters at Old Trafford, and now the club are facing another run through Europe's second-tier competition, coupled with a potential exodus of superstars in the summer.

Van Gaal has enjoyed a hugely successful coaching career spanning over 30 years, two of which were spent in the Old Trafford dugout between 2014 and 2016. The 70-year-old is now in his third spell in charge of the Netherlands and is continuing to work despite being diagnosed with prostate cancer, and the Red Devils have shown their support via social media. Van Gaal announced his condition on Dutch TV show Humberto over the weekend, admitting he had been keeping it a secret from the Netherlands squad. ""I had a pretty aggressive form, got irradiated 25 times,"" he said.""Then you have a lot of management to do in order to go through life."" Van Gaal went on to insist that his form of cancer is not terminal while adding: ""You don't die from prostate cancer, at least not in 90 per cent of the cases."" Van Gaal delivered the FA Cup during his reign at Old Trafford, one of the few trophies the club has won since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013. United have sent their best wishes to the Netherlands boss with a statement on their official Twitter account reading: ""Everybody at Manchester United is fully behind our former manager, Louis van Gaal, in his battle against cancer. Sending you strength and courage, Louis.""

312,https://www.goal.com/en/news/rashford-must-lift-his-confidence-by-himself-rangnick/blt2fe9f8c2ab05053d,Rashford must lift his confidence by himself - Rangnick,"Manchester United coach Ralf Rangnick says Marcus Rashford must pull himself out of the rut which has plagued his season. The England international started on the bench as United drew 1-1 with Leicester, despite the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani. Rangnick opted to use Bruno Fernandes as the striker and started Paul Pogba in behind him rather than give attacker Rashford a shot against the Foxes until he came on as a substitute after 55 minutes. Rangnick admits he did not want to call on Rashford to start the game because he is low in confidence, but says it is up to the England international to resolve the situation. He told reporters: ""I don’t think that [the changes to the team] had any effect on the rhythm of the game in the first half but when we realised after 55 minutes that we need a goal we brought on Marcus for Scotty. ""He had a yellow card, otherwise I wouldn’t have taken him off, but with a yellow card I think it was the right decision to take him off. ""Marcus, it’s no secret that he is not having his best time right now, it has to do with rhythm and confidence as well, yeah, again it’s our job to help him to get this confidence back and that is why I decided to bring him on ""In the end he has to do it himself obviously, but the only thing we can do is speak to him regularly and tell him what we expect from him and what he should do. ""The rest has to be done by himself. There are quite a few examples this season of players, some of them are still here with us and one or two of them are no longer here, have shown that it is possible to develop within a couple of weeks a level of confidence where you can be a different player again. ""We all know that Marcus can play better, but again in the end the steps he has to take himself."" Rashford has started just 10 of the Premier League matches in which he has featured this season. He has scored four goals and registered two assists. United's hopes for a top four finish suffered a blow in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Leicester at Old Trafford. They are now four points behind rivals for a Champions League spot Tottenham and Arsenal, though the Gunners have two games in hand. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Lille striker, 36, had dragged his side back into the game with a goal to make it 2-1, following Otavio and Diogo Jota's first-half strikes. But when he had the chance to level with just six minutes left on the clock, Yilmaz sent his effort into the stratosphere, to the obvious relief of Portugal who went on to make the game safe through Matheus and book a final place against North Macedonia. ⏱️ 84'🇵🇹 2-1 🇹🇷Burak Yılmaz has missed a vital penalty! 😲 pic.twitter.com/aoIaODW5M4 Yilmaz misses from the spot, what a let off for Portugal! 😱 pic.twitter.com/nnqyqUEoIP After the game, which saw Yilmaz earn his 77th cap and register a 31st goal for his country, the experienced frontman announced that he will be heading into international retirement. He told reporters at the end of an emotional night for all concerned: “I don’t know how I didn’t score, I'm still in shock. We upset our country. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. This was my last World Cup chance. As of today, this is over. “I said to myself it was a definite goal when we got the penalty. I started thinking about the future. I am disappointed because I never thought about missing it. I'm sorry. I'm going to score this penalty every night of my life, maybe without sleep, in my dreams. “I wouldn't want to quit after a game like this, but I don't think it's right to continue. Thank you to my coaches. My decision to quit is not emotional. I make this decision logically. If extreme, unbelievable situations occur, then I will help. “Our country needs to pass the flag on to our young friends. The new generation, the new structure. This is the right thing.

The European champions suffered a shock defeat to North Macedonia in the qualifying play-offs, ensuring they will not compete at the finals tournament in Qatar this year. Despite the upset, the coach is not going to walk away from the national team and still hopes to achieve his dream of winning the World Cup. ""I spoke to [Italian football association] president Gabriele Gravina, we have the same ideas on everything,"" Mancini said at a press conference ahead of his side's friendly against Turkey. ""We will talk about it again after the game, we will think calmly. on what needs to be improved for the future."" Asked why he wants to remain in the role, Mancini said: ""Because I'm still young and I wanted to win European Championships and World Cups, I still need time to achieve the latter. I like my job, I know I can I still have a lot of fun and with the guys I can reorganise something important."" Mancini took charge of the national team in 2018 and still has four more years left on his contract. After the friendly with Turkey, he will turn his attention to the Nations League clashes against Germany, Hungary and England in June, and the coach has promised some changes heading into those clashes. He said: “We’ll have a chance to add younger players who, we hope, will have more chances with their clubs. This is crucial. There are many young players who can have the ambition to play with Italy and with a bright future ahead. “We can look at the potential of young players. The current team, with some addition, could have won the World Cup. There are many things we need to see, surely, we’ll change something from the next games.

315,https://www.goal.com/en/news/has-cristiano-ronaldo-ever-missed-a-major-tournament/bltafd31a86fc966b36,Has Cristiano Ronaldo ever missed a major tournament? Portugal star's World Cup & European Championship record,"Has Cristiano Ronaldo ever missed a major tournament? GOAL is here to provide a full rundown of the Portugal star's World Cup and European Championship record. Ronaldo won his first cap for Portugal as an 18-year-old way back in August 2003, coming on as a substitute for Luis Figo in a clash with Kazakhstan to mark the beginning of his 19-year international career. Many of Ronaldo's most impressive performances have been saved for major tournaments,but has he been ever-present at the World Cup and Euros over the past two decades? GOAL has all the details. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner now has 184 appearances for his country to his name, more than any other European player in history, and is also the all-time highest scorer in men's international football with 115 goals. And no, Cristiano Ronaldo has never missed a major international tournament for Portugal. The Manchester United talisman has appeared in four World Cups and five European Championships, with his sole trophy success coming at Euro 2016 in France. Ronaldo played in the 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 editions of the World Cup, scoring a grand total of seven goals. The 37-year-old is the highest-scoring active Portugal international at the tournament, but currently sits two behind Eusebio's all-time national record. Ronaldo will hope to surpass Eusebio if Fernando Santos' current squad qualify for Qatar 2022, but they must first come through a World Cup qualifying playoff semi-final tie against Turkey and a potential final match-up against either Italy or North Macedonia. Ronaldo starred in the 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 editions of the European Championships, and is currently the only outfield player to have featured in the tournament five times. The veteran forward also holds the records for the most appearances (25) and most goals (14) in European Championship history. Portugal only made it through to the round of 16 at Euro 2020, but Ronaldo still managed to earn his first Golden Boot at the tournament - sharing the accolade with the Czech Republic's Patrick Schick on five goals each.

Ronaldo has been in mixed form as of late, and was powerless to stop Manchester United crashing out of the Champions League to Atletico Madrid. He will be hoping for better fortunes on the international stage as Portugal face Turkey in a match vital to their hopes of making the World Cup in Qatar. ""I can say people who say negative things about Cristiano Ronaldo do not understand football. He is a legendary name,"" Fernandes, who plays his club football in Turkey with Caykur Rizespor, told GOAL ahead of Thursday's play-off between the two nations. ""Everyone knows what he means for Portugal as well. The critics may only look at the numbers, but I totally disagree with these criticisms. ""He is a very valuable player. I think he will contribute to us very well in every game."" Portugal had the chance to seal automatic qualification for the finals but fell in the last game of Group A to Serbia, throwing away an early lead to go down 2-1 when a draw would have seen them through. They must now overcome two tough opponents to book their place at Qatar, or else risk missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1998. Should Ronaldo and Co. prevail against Turkey, they will advance to the final play-off round on Tuesday against the winner of the clash between Italy and Montenegro. At 37, this will likely be Ronaldo's final chance to win football's most prestigious trophy, having fallen short in his previous four attempts in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. The ex-Real Madrid and Juventus striker's best campaign came in Germany 2006, when he netted four times to lead his nation to fourth place - their most successful World Cup effort since the days of Eusebio in the 1960s.

Ten Hag has been viewed as one of the United hierarchy’s top candidates to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season and they pushed ahead with the interview process this week. It is understood that no decision has yet been taken on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s permanent replacement and GOAL sources say the club will continue with the interview process with the other names on the shortlist. United have been pushing ahead with the search for their new manager during the current international break and it is understood they interviewed Ten Hag on Monday. In recent weeks he has emerged as the favourite candidate to become the club’s next permanent boss and initial conversations were held with various candidates earlier this month. The process is being spearheaded by football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher, who were both key figures in getting Rangnick to the club on a temporary basis back in December. It is understood the process has now moved on to formal interviews and, while Ten Hag has already had his interview, club sources say there is no frontrunner and all on the shortlist will be interviewed. For a long time Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino was favourite to land the job but, over the last couple of months, Ten Hag has been viewed on a level with the former Tottenham manager. It is understood Pochettino would relish a return to the Premier League and his future at PSG is under scrutiny after their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid. Pochettino, along with Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique, are the other names on the shortlist and it is expected they will all be interviewed as part of a “thorough process” to hire the right man. While Thomas Tuchel has admirers at Old Trafford, and their interest was piqued due to Chelsea’s current situation, it is understood they do not believe him to be a viable option. Ideally the club want to have an agreement in place with a manager in the next couple of months so that the new boss can be in place as quickly as possible at the end of the season. The club are planning their first pre-season tour for three years and that is set to take place at the start of July, by which time they will want the new manager to be present.

318,https://www.goal.com/en/news/cryotherapy-how-ronaldo-icy-treatment-red-hot-football/blt8ea93010669005dc,Cryotherapy: How Ronaldo’s icy treatment has become red hot in football,"Cristiano Ronaldo routinely plays as if he has ice in his veins, so one of the secrets of his tremendous longevity should come as no surprise. The evergreen Manchester United superstar, who turned 37 in February, recently posted an Instagram video clip that showed him stripping down to his pants before entering a freezing-cold chamber in Dubai. He was undergoing a recovery and rehabilitation treatment called cryotherapy, something he has practised regularly since 2013. The Portugal icon even has a £50,000 cryotherapy chamber installed in his rented mansion, according to reports. But he is not alone in the football world in indulging in this cold-blooded pursuit. Leicester City’s incredible 2016 Premier League title win was greatly aided by their use of cryotherapy – and now a number of leading British clubs have cryochambers installed at their training grounds. So what exactly is cryotherapy and what are its benefits? Dr Adnan Haq, a Sport and Exercise Science lecturer at the University of South Wales, tells GOAL: “The term cryotherapy can be ambiguous and is used loosely, but can be an umbrella term for any cold treatment, including ice packs and cold-water baths. ""When many people use the term cryotherapy, they are specifically referring to whole-body cryotherapy (WBC), which involves exposure to extremely cold air, below -100°C, for typically three minutes – this is colder than the coldest recorded temperature on Earth. “Due to the extreme nature of WBC, many people feel that it will offer superior results compared to conventional means. The body undergoes a big physiological shock when faced with extreme environments. It is about harnessing the body’s responses to such extremes to react in a unique way to accelerate recovery. “When we also see high-profile cases of footballing success, such as Leicester City winning the 2015-16 Premier League at 5,000/1 odds partly due to WBC use to support players’ recovery, the treatment becomes difficult to ignore. Athletes are constantly looking for those cutting edges to make the difference between winning and losing. “In the case of WBC, several athletes have found it beneficial when taken, post-exercise, to accelerate that recovery, thereby enabling them to train and perform again in a timely manner at a sufficiently high intensity. “An important benefit is the treatment of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Work that I published last year revealed that single treatments of WBC can effectively mitigate muscle strength reductions after muscle-damaging exercise. Alleviating muscle damage can therefore speed up recovery.” Ian Saunders, the CEO of CryoAction, which supplies whole-body cryochambers to a host of leading football clubs and other sporting organisations, first became aware of cryotherapy when he learned of the Welsh rugby team’s use of the practice in Poland. The tech entrepreneur travelled to the Eastern European country to explore cryotherapy for himself, and discovered that cryochambers were widespread at medical centres and sports organisations. Explaining the growing popularity of cryotherapy among footballers, he tells GOAL: “Cryotherapy is a much-preferred option for many footballers to the dreaded ice bath. The preference is that the session lasts only three minutes, they remain dry, and yet the effects are long-lasting. ""For the players, most report that they feel completely refreshed, energised and some way down the road of recovery from the exertions of training or a match day. “They also report a far deeper and long-lasting sleep pattern. Most players are overstimulated and have poor sleep patterns. Cryotherapy helps to increase dopamine and serotonin levels, so contributes towards a healthy sleep recovery.” Leicester City were CryoAction’s first customer and their purchase paid off in spectacular fashion six years ago. The Foxes have recently installed a newer cryotherapy chamber at their training ground as they seek to recapture their former glories, according to Saunders. He reveals that the club’s talismanic striker Jamie Vardy, who was an integral part of the triumphant 2016 squad, has emulated Ronaldo in having a chamber installed at his house. Saunders says: “The club adopted cryotherapy as part of their amazing recovery from near relegation in the 2014-15 season. Using a full-time unit in the 2015-16 season, the club’s medical staff deployed a number of new or emerging modalities, many of which have now found their way into common use across a number of clubs. ""One of these was the access to the cryotherapy chamber which was in near-daily use and sometimes twice daily. “Then head physio, David Rennie, who is now at Bristol City where they installed their own CryoAction cryotherapy chamber last year, said, ‘We get big hormonal changes from the players, big changes in moods, and obviously the big thing from my side of things, from rehabilitation, is the ability to shut down a lot of the acute soft tissue injuries much faster than we would have been before’. “The club attributed the success of the season down to keeping their best players in the game, and the players were therefore able to undertake more coaching sessions and produce the improvements on the pitch. ""Testimony to this fact is that in the 2015-16 season, Leicester City had fewer injuries than any other PL club and used the fewest players. This enhanced performance and a different playing style, with the club scoring more counterattacking goals than any other Premier League club that season. “The impact of all these elements combined led to the amazing success of the club in that historic season.” Saunders says Watford, Everton, Bournemouth, Arsenal, Rangers, Wolves, Southampton, Swansea City and Bristol City are among the clubs which have since jumped on the bandwagon and taken delivery of his firm’s cryochambers. “We are certainly finding that more and more players are driving their clubs to get a chamber for their use at clubs, particularly those individuals that have a known injury issue that they have to manage,” he says. “A number are also taking the step of getting their own installed at home so that they can use it when they like as part of their own health-management programme. “Players such as Cristiano Ronaldo are seen as a benchmark for others who want to emulate his success and aspire to have as long a career at the top of the game as he has enjoyed. We are seeing youth players acquiring chambers in order to follow his example.” As ever with medical matters, there are conflicting opinions about cryotherapy. For instance, a 2021 study led by academics at Liverpool Hope University questioned its effectiveness. However, Dr Haq insists that, on the whole, cryotherapy is something leading footballers should be using to boost performance and aid recovery. “The research, both by myself and overall, for the most part indicates that WBC has beneficial effects for sports recovery and performance. There are, however, caveats. “It is, of course, very expensive, and it can be argued that cold-water baths are just as effective yet cheaper. In the professional sporting scene, this might not be an issue, but it’s still important to consider since one cryotherapy chamber can cost six figures in installation alone.” Saunders agrees that the chambers are not cheap – his cost from £60,000 upwards – but explains how they are becoming more accessible to grassroots footballers. “This is as a result of more facilities opening up in gyms and training centres including cryotherapy as part of their upgrades, where a focus on recovery is now as important as the focus on strength and conditioning. ""It is not that an individual grassroots club would buy the unit directly, but we already have cases where clubs are using our clients’ sites for their team, post-game or training sessions.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

319,https://www.goal.com/en/news/inter-atletico-madrid-spurs-where-next-dybala-juventus-exit/blt86e2811265e7d013,"Inter, Barcelona, Man Utd, Milan, PSG, Atletico or Spurs - Where next for Dybala after Juventus exit?","Blaise Matuidi was one of many Juventini surprised by the news that Paulo Dybala's contract will not be renewed. ""I don't think it will be easy at all to replace him,"" the former Bianconeri midfielder told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""He has done fantastic things over the years, the fans adore him and they will never forget him. “But I am sure he will find a club that will allow him to improve and do well."" Matuidi was certainly correct when he said it will be difficult for Juventus to replace a player who has scored 113 goals in all competitions for the club. However, as Maurizio Arrivabene rather brutally outlined, Dybala was no longer ""central"" to their sporting project after the January arrival of Dusan Vlahovic, meaning retaining the services of an injury-prone 28-year-old on a multi-million euro contract made zero financial sense. Perhaps even more disappointingly for Dybala, he may not find a club perfectly suited to his skillset as Matuidi believes. True, the Argentina international will not be short of suitors, given he will be available for nothing this summer, but he may not have as many attractive options as he would like. As GOAL outlines below, very few top teams presently have either the room or the resources to add Dybala to their squads, even if things could change come the end of the season... Diego Simeone has been following Dybala's career ""since he was a youngster"" and watched with interest as his compatriot began to make a name for himself at Palermo before becoming a star Juventus. However, the Atletico boss lashed out at the media in 2018 when a chance meeting in a Madrid restaurant was portrayed as a surreptitious attempt to lure the forward to Atletico. Given we are in the middle of an international break, it remains unclear what Simeone makes of the latest reporters linking Dybala with a move to the Wanda Metropolitano, but one can be sure that it will come up in his press conference ahead of Saturday's Liga clash with Alaves. Which club needs to sign Paulo Dybala? 🇦🇷 pic.twitter.com/76gfSurdcV All we can say for now is that in spite of Simeone's obvious admiration for his fellow Argentine, it still seems unlikely that Dybala will end up at Atleti. While the out-of-favour Luis Suarez is expected to depart this summer, creating a need to bring in an orthodox No.9, the Rojiblancos are presently well-stocked in terms of playmakers and support strikers. Unless one of Angel Correa, Joao Felix, Matheus Cunha or Antoine Griezmann also departs this summer, Simeone simply could not justify signing Dybala. It was inevitable that as soon as Dybala's imminent Juventus exit was confirmed, he would be linked with Manchester United. After all, he came desperately close to moving to Old Trafford in 2019 as part of a deal that would have seen Romelu Lukaku move in the other direction. Back then, the prospect of leaving Juve had reduced Dybala the tears. But now the idea of ending up at United might provoke the same sadness! However, it would be a surprise if United were still interested in Dybala. He certainly would not resolve any of their problem positions. Granted, United need to strengthen their attack this summer but, with Edinson Cavani set to leave and Cristiano Ronaldo's future uncertain, their focus is on signing a prolific centre-forward, while they are also desperate to replace out-of-contract midfielder Paul Pogba, which is an expensive proposition. So, Dybala just does not fit the bill at all. United may have become synonymous with bizarre buys, while things could change when the identify of the new permanent manager is revealed, but this particular mooted move just does not make sense at all right now. PSG are tipped to sign every single high-profile player on the market, so it has not come as a surprise to see the Ligue 1 leaders linked with Dybala. Sporting director Leonardo certainly loves shopping in Serie A, while the Parisians snapped up one free agent after another last summer. However, ""the greatest transfer window in football history"" has, thus far, proved an absolute disaster for PSG, who are in utter disarray following their latest Champions League capitulation. Indeed, while Dybala's wage demands would be absolutely no issue for the capital club – who could also have a massive void to fill in attack this summer, with Kylian Mbappe set to move to Real Madrid – it is impossible to predict PSG's plans right now. We do not even know who the coach will be next season, while the future of the entire Qatari-funded project at the Parc des Princes is shrouded in uncertainty. As it stands, then, Dybala is not presently high on PSG's list of priorities. According to Dybala's former agent, Barcelona first made enquiries about signing the forward as far back as 2016. Dybala himself admitted not long after that he wanted to play alongside Lionel Messi, but that he could realise that ""dream"" with Argentina. What subsequently became clear, though, was that the pair were incompataible. Dybala even admitted that it was difficult for him to excel in the same side as Messi, which caused quite the media storm at the time, and eventually prompted an apology. So, with Messi having left Camp Nou, maybe Dybala could belatedly arrive? Barcelona do love a good free transfer these days, having been financially decimated by the reckless spending of the previous administration. It also remains to be seen whether Ousmane Dembele will leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and it has not yet been confirmed if Adama Traore's loan stay will be made permanent, so there could be voids to fill in attack. However, Barcelona are flying again under Xavi, thanks to some smart signings and a plethora of promising young players, and the question has to be asked: Is Dybala really suited to the coach's preferred 4-3-3 formation? Indeed, a gambler would probably be more inclined to put money on Messi returning to Camp Nou this summer than Dybala joining from Juve. Paolo Maldini & Co. have done a wonderful job reducing the wage bill at San Siro over the last couple of years, while at the same time transforming the recklessly run Rossoneri into favourites for this season's Scudetto with a plethora of shrewd signings. Could Dybala be the next potential game-changer to arrive? It seems unlikely right now, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility. With Brahim Diaz still only sparkling sporadically, Milan would obviously be interested in acquiring a top-class No.10 for nothing. Salary demands could well prove prohibitive for such prudent employers. However, if Zlatan Ibrahimovic's contract is not renewed, there would at least be room on the wage bill for high-profile player... Tottenham boss Antonio Conte may have left Juventus the year before Dybala joined from Palermo, but Spurs' sporting director, Fabio Paratici, was still in Turin, working alongside Beppe Marotta, as the Bianconeri acquired one of the most promising young players in Serie A. This link, coupled with the aforementioned attempt to sign Dybala in 2019, explains why a transfer to north London is now being touted. Again, though, there are a lot of variables here. Will Conte stay beyond the summer if his primary transfer targets are not acquired? And would he even want a support striker like Dybala when he already has a class act like Son Heung-min starring alongside Harry Kane in attack? And what of the England man? Will he leave at the end of another trophy-less season in pursuit of tangible success elsewhere? Furthermore, would Dybala, at 28, really want to join a club that is unlikely to be playing in the Champions League next season? So many questions, but so little certainty at the moment. It is the move that Juventus fans fear most and, worryingly from their perspective, the one that arguably makes most sense. Dybala wanted to stay in Turin. He is not only upset with his departure, but the way in which it has been handled. Moving to Juve's most hated rivals would, thus, be the perfect way to stick two fingers up at those that discarded him in such a cold and abrupt manner. However, Dybala joining Inter would be about far more than betrayal or revenge. It is probably the most logical move for a player settled in Italy. Remember, Marotta is now Inter's CEO, and he is not just a market maestro renowned for making fantastic free transfers; he is also the man who signed Dybala for Juve. From a squad perspective, the Nerazzurri's primary objective is signing a young striker this summer, with Edin Dzeko having turned 36 earlier this month and now showing his age, but it is worth noting that Alexis Sanchez is set to leave San Siro this summer, thus creating space on Inter's wage bill for another second striker. It is also worth bearing in mind that Inter may even listen to offers for their most valuable asset, Lautaro Martinez, this summer, given his profligacy and the opportunity his sale would present to completely overhaul the attack. Handing Dybala a lucrative contract would obviously represent a risk because of his injury issues, but it might be one that Marotta is willing to take given there would be no transfer fee involved.

The England international was targeted by a group of supporters that stayed behind after a 1-0 Champions League defeat to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday to watch Ralf Rangnick’s squad head out of Old Trafford. Rashford responded to the comments being aimed at him, as he struggles to find his best form, and issued a statement on social media the following day saying his actions had been “silly” as he should have turned a deaf ear to detractors. Ex-England striker Wright believes the United winger had every right to offer a response to those dishing out unnecessary abuse, with the Arsenal legend saying in a video posted on his official Twitter account: “Somebody just sent me the Marcus Rashford video where he confronted fans, because the fans were digging him out and he offered one of them out. “I don’t know who is doing it, doing this apologising for him, who the f*ck is apologising for that? “People are so quick to say ‘oh, sorry’ and that is what gives these fans that feel that they can dig people out. “Marcus, stand your ground, bro. You got people jumping on and saying ‘Marcus is so sorry’. Don’t be f*cking sorry for that, bro. “Some of those fans love giving it but can’t take it. You just do your stuff, get back to where you need to be when you are playing. F*ck them fans.” pic.twitter.com/QDxcUo4JJ7 Rashford was handed 23 minutes off the bench for United as they slipped out of Europe at the hands of La Liga opposition. The 2021-22 campaign is proving to be a tough one for him, with a delayed start to the season due to injury leaving him playing catch-up and struggling for a spark with only five goals to his name – and none through his last nine appearances. There are 2 sides to every story. pic.twitter.com/Xl2PRyaX2c After being targeted by supporters after another disappointing outing against Atletico, the 24-year-old posted on Twitter: ""A video can paint a thousand words and in this case lead to inaccurate info being shared on social media. ""Guys, for weeks I've been heckled, threatened, questioned and last night my emotion got the better of me. I'm a human being. Reading and hearing that stuff about yourself every day it wears you down. ""No one is more critical of my performance than me. But what you see in this video lacks context. ""I had been heckled from the minute I stepped foot outside the ground, abuse not just aimed at my football. ""People were looking for a reaction from me. Phones were at the ready. Of course I should have walked straight past and ignored it, that's what we're supposed to do, right? ""I want to clarify two things. The first being what I actually said to the man throwing abuse at me which was: ""Come over here and say it to my face"" (a fact security can back me up) and secondly, the fact I used my forefinger to direct the fan to: 'Come over and say it to my face'.

Reason for Man Utd star's absence explained,"England will be in international friendly action against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, before then playing host to Ivory Coast on Tuesday, but Marcus Rashford will not be figuring in either of those fixtures. The Manchester United forward has represented his country on 46 occasions, scoring 12 goals, but will not be adding to his collection of Three Lions caps any time soon after being overlooked in the latest selection made by Gareth Southgate. Why has the Red Devils star been overlooked and could his place in plans being drawn up for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year be under threat? GOAL takes a look… The 24-year-old has been a regular for England since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2016, with appearances made at two European Championships – including a Euro 2020 final against Italy – the 2018 World Cup and UEFA Nations League finals. His domestic form has, however, dipped in the 2021-22 campaign – on the back of becoming an MBE for his charity work off the field – and Southgate is looking for a proven performer to rediscover a spark at Old Trafford before being welcomed back into the international arena.

He knows he is in a situation where he has not been getting in the United team consistently and he will be searching as much as anybody to get that form back. “We all believe he can be an asset for his club and for his country. “With one or two of our players in the past, who have had dips and come through them, you can say, 'look, they came through that, they responded well and became more strong and they showed the character needed'. “That is what he is going to have to prove now in the coming weeks and months. Nobody's career goes smoothly from start to finish and of course his rise from when he first broke into the team at United was incredible, really.” Southgate is right to suggest that Rashford needs to knuckle down at club level and work on becoming a first -team regular for Manchester United once more.

323,https://www.goal.com/en/news/is-salah-best-player-in-the-world-now/uaku1p1chwmz16r6mbqd9ni68,Is Salah the best player in the world right now?,"It was noteven a quarter of a chance, was it? When Mohamed Salah received the ball from Curtis Jones in the 76th minute of Liverpool’s showdown with Manchester City, he had his back to goal and three defenders for company. He was on the left corner of the penalty area, surrounded and covered. No real threat. Or so we thought. In an instant, and through the most beautiful mix of skill, strength, balance and ingenuity, Salah left Joao Cancelo and Phil Foden for dead. He put Bernardo Silva on his backside. Then he skinned Aymeric Laporte before finally, with devastating precision, firedpast Ederson. “A goal from another planet,” Gary Neville, commentating for Sky Sports, called it. Jurgen Klopp, speaking after the game, said that people will be talking about it in 50 or 60 years’ time. “Only the best players in the world score goals like this,” the Liverpool boss added. “Absolutely exceptional.” Is there anyone in world football playing better than Salah at this moment? It isa legitimate question. The Egypt internationalhas been a star for years, but rarely, if ever, has his level been higher than it is right now. “I don’t think there’s anyone better in the world at this moment, I really don't,” said Jamie Carragher, the former Liverpool defender, on Sunday. Over on BBC Radio 5 Live, Chris Sutton, a Premier League winner with Blackburn, was in agreement. “We don’t have to get into the whole ‘is he better than [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo?’ thing,” Sutton said. “At this moment in time, he’s better than them.”  It is hard to argue, given Salah’s form. Already this season, he has nine goals and three assists. Ronaldo, if we do wish to compare, has five goals, while Messi has ‘only’ contributed that stunning strike against Manchester City since his move to Paris Saint-Germain. Salah, meanwhile, has scored in his last seven matches, equalling the personal record he set during his first season at Liverpool in 2017-18. He finished that campaign with 44 goals in all competitions, and on recent evidence he will notbe far away from that total this time around. “He’s one of the greatest players ever to play for Liverpool,” says Carragher. “Liverpool lost Roger Hunt recently, one of the greatest goalscorers ever seen. Mo Salah is right up there, no doubt about that.” It is hard to overstate Salah’s importance to Liverpool. Since his arrival from Roma in 2017, he has scored 134 goals and added 46 assists in 212 games. He has won two Golden Boots, a PFA Player of the Year award, the Champions League, Premier League, European Super Cup and Club World Cup. His four completed seasons at Anfield have seen him finish with 44 goals, 27, 23 and 31. He has missed only seven league games in that time. “He is absolutely outstanding,” says Micah Richards, who played alongside Salah at Fiorentina. “He's enhanced the role that Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery made their own, with a goal record that puts many of the top No.9s in Europe in the shade.” It is Salah’s presence, above all others, which makes Liverpool contenders for the top honours this season. Alisson Becker, Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mane are vital, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson and Fabinho are fantastic, but Salah is the difference-maker. “Without Mo, Liverpool aren't in the title race this season,” Richards adds. “Quite simply, he is irreplaceable.”   It is not just the sheer volume of goals which makes Salah so special, either. It isthe importance of them, the variation of them. “He can score all types of goals,” says Peter Crouch, the former Liverpool striker. “He's one of those players where you know what's going to happen, you know he wants to get on his left foot, but you cannot stop him.” Salah’s goals last season were worth 17 points to Liverpool, and he has started this season in a similar vein. Already, he has scored against both Chelsea and Manchester City and netted the opener against Leeds United. In the Champions League, he grabbed the equaliser against AC Milan and the all-important first goal away in Porto. In terms of European goalscorers for Liverpool, only Steven Gerrard sits above him. “He’s a joy to watch, an assassin in and around the box,” says Rio Ferdinand, the ex-Manchester United and England defender. “He’s an absolute killer. Go and watch Salah and what he does. He dominates and destroys top-level players on a regular basis. He makes the game look easy, he makes football look easy. Salah has it all.” Who are his peers right now, then? Who is rivalling him as the world’s best? Messi and Ronaldo, naturally, will always be in the conversation, though at 34 and 36 respectively, their peak has surely passed. Kylian Mbappe is widely considered the player to take over from those two, yet even his numbers trail Salah’s so far this season. Mbappe has four goals and five assists for PSG - impressive, but inferior for now. Over in Germany, Robert Lewandowski’s hot-streak has lasted a decade. He has 14 goals already for Bayern Munich this season, too. Only Covid-19 denied the Poland stara Ballon d’Or last year, and his record-breaking feats in the Bundesliga confirm his status as one of the deadliest, most consistent players around. Erling Haaland is perhaps the heir to Lewandowski’s throne, in terms of out-and-out No.9s. The Borussia Dortmund star, 21, has 11 goals this season - although three came against lower-league opposition in the German Cup - and looks, like Mbappe, ready to dominate the game for years to come. Karim Benzema, meanwhile, is another forward operating at an otherworldly level right now. Real Madrid are far from a fantastic team, but their Frenchstar has 10 goals already, and will again carry pretty much all of their hopes this season. At 33, and having lived in the shadow of Ronaldo for the peak years of his career, Benzema remains one of the world’s most underrated superstars - if such a thing exists.   The same has been said of Salah, as it happens. On Tuesday an article was published on the website of one of the UK’s biggest newspapers. “Mohamed Salah is the world’s best player - so why is he not idolised more?” it asked. Liverpool fans, understandably, took exception. ‘Idolise Salah more?’ they asked. ‘How, exactly?!’ Salah’s name rings out at each and every game, home and away. No player sells more shirts in the club shops. No player is more in demand when it comes to autographs or selfies with supporters. Fans are desperate for him to sign a new contract, with his current deal heading towards its final 18 months. If he isunderappreciated or undervalued elsewhere - and in all honesty, he probably isn’t - then he certainly isn’t at Anfield. “You can’t not love Mo Salah,” John Arne Riise, the former Liverpool defender, told Goal this week. “He just keeps going and going and going, and he’s always smiling. He just never stops. “What he’s done for so many years is just incredible, and I hope he’ll be around for many years to come.” No Reds fan would argue with that. However long Salah remains on Merseyside, he should be cherished, enjoyed, adored. We may never see his kind again. The best in the world? He just might be.

324,https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-replaced-messi-world-best-player-psg-champions-league/bltb4b653bc5e7fecf3,Mbappe has replaced Messi as the world's best player: PSG's UCL hopes hinge on French forward's fitness,"Paris Saint-Germain discovered just how tough life can be without Kylian Mbappe at the weekend as they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Nice. Mbappe missed the trip to the Allianz Riviera due to a suspension, but the silver lining was that PSG would have him fresh for Wednesday’s Champions League visit to the Bernabeu. Those plans, though, were scuppered during a training ground clash with Idrissa Gueye on Monday. Initially, the news was grim: Mbappe would more than likely miss the game. As the day wore on, though, the prognosis gradually improved, though it remains questionable just what sort of impact the World Cup winner might be able to have in the Spanish capital. “There’s one PSG with Kylian and another without Kylian,” Nice boss Christophe Galtier reasoned after watching his side shutout the Ligue 1 champions-elect on Saturday. Even Lionel Messi was unable to unpick the Nice defence as the Parisian side turned in the type of lacklustre performance that followers of the French game have become all too accustomed to seeing when Mbappe is not present. PSG have won just one of the three Ligue 1 matches in which he has sat out this season in comparison to 18 of 24 in which he has played. Furthermore, they average just a goal per game without the striker and 2.2 when he’s on the field. Kylian Mbappe is a doubt for PSG's Champions League match against Real Madrid after taking a knock in training 😬 pic.twitter.com/xZg4YhIUq0 Real Madrid know only too well the damage Mbappe can cause, of course. He produced a thrilling performance in the first leg at Parc des Princes, which was capped in the final seconds with the goal that separates the sides ahead of the midweek showdown. It was far from an average strike, too. He danced between two players in a seemingly effortless manner before firing the ball into the corner with the aid of a slight deflection. The very best players show up in clutch moments, and Mbappe, having only turned 23 in December, has made a career of doing just that. Indeed, he is now a player who is absolutely indispensable to PSG – far more so than either Neymar or Messi, who were considered to be his equals when the season began. This explains why the Parisians are so desperately scrambling to have him sign a new contract. It’s not that they’re concerned about losing face after signing him for €180 million in 2018 after a one-year loan, it’s not that he would strengthen one of their European rivals – it’s that they know he is now the greatest player in the world and simply cannot be replaced. What a goal! Paris win it late via Kylian Mbappé's brilliant finish ⚽️#UCL pic.twitter.com/1moVlYhFBk If Mbappe is not fit enough to take to the field on Wednesday, that fact could become starkly evident on one of the biggest stages. Messi has managed to conjure only flashes of magic since arriving in Paris, while Neymar and Angel Di Maria appear to be similarly fading forces. Beyond them, PSG offer little menace. This was a side, after all, designed to be carried offensively by its front three. In reality, it is Mbappe who has been shouldering the burden for all 11. Psychologically, it would be a huge blow for the squad if their talisman is not present in Madrid. Qualification may even hinge on the fact. In some ways, it would be a fitting Champions League goodbye to Paris if his last action for the club was to score a brilliant winner against the outfit he is apparently destined to join in the summer. It would not be, however, the fairy tale ending that we have grown used to Mbappe enjoying throughout his young career – and will no doubt continue to experience for many years to come, wherever that may be.

325,https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-conte-transformed-tottenham-into-champions-league/bltf72ab105d0eddcaa,How Conte transformed flagging Tottenham into genuine Champions League challengers,"Antonio Conte has been in charge of Tottenham Hotspur for 58 days but only nine matches, reflecting the peculiarity of his pandemic-hit start to life in north London. Three Premier League games have been postponed and one Europa Conference League match has been forfeited, resulting in Spurs crashing out of continental competition. They remain five points short of the Champions League places – exactly where they were when Nuno Espirito Santo was sacked. However, that does not capture the story of Conte’s start or the optimism that has taken hold at Tottenham as the team gradually comes together. Things could hardly be more different from the disordered and energy-sapping Nuno reign. Already we are seeing a clear identity, marked improvements, and hard work. The Italian immediately implemented a 3-4-3 formation upon arrival (deviating only once, using a 3-5-2 for the 2-2 draw with Liverpool) and began to put the structure in place. Like Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel, Conte is all about positional discipline and tactical minutiae, drilling the idea of shape and movement, of pressing and compression, in long training sessions. The postponed fixtures appear to have helped get the foundational ideas across relatively quickly. Spurs matches, as in the early days of Guardiola and Tuchel in particular, have focused more on defensive solidity and a rigid formation than creativity, giving the impression of a restrictive setup that limits fluidity or improvisation. The latter will come in time but, like all the best managers, Conte is starting from the bottom up: get the basic shape nailed down before loosening the strings. That basic shape includes, broadly speaking, holding a stern mid-block with very short distances between players both horizontally and vertically. Spurs press hard immediately after losing possession but, aside from those moments, only once the opponent enters the middle third of the pitch. On the ball, the idea is sharp, vertical football played in the transition, and while this includes plenty of long balls forward and incisive dribbles through the lines (more on that later), it is also about distributing as fast as possible into a narrow front three, who turn and run directly in behind. Spurs’ progressive passes attempted have gone up from 57.4 to 76.0 per match, according to WyScout, while their number of 'smart passes' (""a creative and penetrative pass that attempts to break the opposition's defensive lines to gain a significant advantage in attack"") has risen from 6.4 to 9.0 per game. That is a huge jump that captures the newfound urgency in their play, while Conte’s ruthless tactical coaching is already paying off. They are averaging 2.17 expected goals [xG] per match in the Premier League, up from 1.2 prior to his arrival, and, having failed to hit a 2.0 xG in any of their league games under Nuno, have exceeded 2.0 xG in five of their seven under Conte. Defensively, their expected goals against [xGA] has gone down from 1.3 xGA under Nuno to 0.8 xGA. Spurs are improving at both ends of the pitch. The most important attacking feature so far has been the interactions of Lucas Moura, an early favourite of Conte’s, and Son Heung-min in the No.10 space. Operating together as inside forwards, these two are taking up much narrower positions than they have done historically, with the aim being to stay close to Harry Kane and work quickly on the break. Conte’s narrow front three allows players to exchange short, sharp passes in transitional moments, and it also ensures his most effective footballers are in the most dangerous areas of the pitch. The half-spaces – the columns that run between opposition full-back and centre-back – are the most fertile, and already we have seen Lucas and Son benefit from lurking here. Lucas’ brilliant goal in a 3-0 win over Norwich City was created with Son by dancing through this area in a match defined (in the first half at least) by how often Spurs got their most creative players on the ball in the space between Norwich’s defensive and midfield lines. The Brazilian’s headed goal against Crystal Palace was the result of him driving through the middle of the park, while Steven Bergwijn’s superb performance in the EFL Cup against West Ham owed to his central position. Just as important to the reconfiguration of their attack is the number of runners Spurs look to get in behind and the urgency with which they are looking for a through ball. Both goals against Liverpool came from slide passes in behind, as did the first against Crystal Palace, with Son and Kane, in particular, enjoying playing on the shoulder of the last defender. A move towards counterattacking football and fast vertical passing has particularly benefited Kane, who works better with open patches of grass in front of him that provide the opportunity for Hollywood passes. This newfound sense of transitional attacks would not be possible without a rethink of how central midfield operates, and it is interesting to note how Conte has gradually evolved his set-up in the middle. He began with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Oliver Skipp as guaranteed starters, but despite their tactical intelligence and solid defensive attributes, their workmanlike quality – and tendency to recycle the ball sideways – left Spurs a little flat at times. It was almost as if Conte was using them to get the foundation settled before turning up the dial on the more ambitious side of things, because in the last four games he has gradually introduced Harry Winks, Dele Alli and Tanguy Ndombele. Winks’ willingness to always look for a forward pass, and to move the ball quickly even in tight areas, has proved revelatory. This was most effective in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool, although he was also Tottenham’s best player in the 1-1 draw with Southampton; his brilliant pass for Kane’s marginally-offside goal was the moment of the match. Fast counterattacks or moving quickly in transitional moments has also required bypassing midfield altogether at times, and this is where Dele’s resurgence has been encouraging. Against Liverpool and Southampton, he made runs beyond the forwards, following the long-established pattern of how Conte teams operate by ghosting ahead of the strikers as they pinned both centre-backs. Defensively, Conte’s Spurs sit very narrow and are happy to drop back for long periods when necessary; against Liverpool, their squeezed formation left Klopp’s full-backs free out wide with hazardous consequences and, against Southampton, they were camped in their own third throughout the first half. However, it is wrong to view Conte as a defensive coach and what his back-line do on the ball is just as important as what they do off it. Eric Dier has become an important player in the middle of the back three, by sweeping long balls forward (either over the top, as he did again and again versus Liverpool, or diagonals into the wing-backs, as against Norwich and Brentford) and dribbling out from the back. Dier and Ben Davies, another early favourite, are now expected to break the lines in possession, dribbling out as the spare man to disorganise the opposition before switching play with a longer pass. What these two lack in pure defensive attributes – thankfully Tottenham’s control of the game, plus their compression between the lines, means fewer touches for defenders in their own third – they make up for in their ball-playing qualities. Finally, the wing-backs are expected to play a big role in Conte’s system, although this is the area in most need of improvement. Sergio Reguilon is finding his feet on the left but the same cannot be said for Emerson Royal, and Conte’s frustration in this department is betrayed by recent team selections. Although Spurs are crossing far more now than under Nuno (15.7 per game, up from 11.3), a reflection of how the wing-backs are expected to fly forward and supply traditional width, most are aimless. Against Southampton, Conte turned to Bryan Gil and Mat Doherty as inverted wing-backs, a confused choice that stifled both players as crosses were easily batted away. Conte needs to find the right partnership on the two flanks to complement encouraging early signs in every other area of the pitch. He has worked remarkably quickly and, despite cancellations and dropped points, supporters can feel quietly confident of a top-four challenge. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

326,https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenhams-extraordinary-conte-coup-tactical-genius-will/1rra1yohzqfej1pw5fa6k1l6ia,Tottenham's extraordinary Conte coup: Tactical genius will turn struggling Spurs into top-four contenders,"The Nuno Espirito Santo era never got started and it will not be remembered. That is the brutal truth of what always felt like an interim appointment, a manager without the tactical expertise or charisma in the dugout to cope with the hospital pass of being the fifth or sixth choice at Tottenham Hotspur. Nuno’s football was bleak. The system formless, the plan impossible to see. As a disciple of Jose Mourinho, whom he played under atPorto, he represented everything the club was so desperately hoping to move away from. But he is blameless in this. Nuno cannot help being the manager he is, cannot change his spots. He is educated in the reactive, counterattacking school of football that puts defensive shape first and possession a distant second. Like Mourinho, he expects his players to improvise their football and form natural partnerships on the break. Like Mourinho, his philosophy has no place at the top of the game anymore. Tottenham have taken the joint-fewest shots in the Premier League (10.3 per game). Only Norwich City have scored fewer goals. But the problem of chance creation isn’t purely about deploying a foggy system without much positional detail; plenty of teams sit deep and deploy hard-hitting direct attacking football with moderate success. No, Nuno’s issue was attempting to do this at a club that demands expansive football and that is expected to hog the ball. You can’t average 51.8 per cent possession and expect to play on the break.Or in other words, you can’t manage a big club with a small-club mentality.He was hamstrung from the outset by a club already in crisis mode, their chairman under pressure following the disaster of the Mourinho era and the Harry Kane debacle. It would have taken something miraculous to succeed in that environment. Well, maybe Spurs have their miracle, because  appointing Antonio Conte –surely among the top five managers in the world –is an extraordinary coup. ✍️ We are delighted to announce the appointment of Antonio Conte as our Head Coach on a contract until the summer of 2023, with an option to extend. Since 2016 the Premier League has led the way in the tactical revolution of the sport by collecting the game’s best coaches, all of whom prescribe to a style of structured possession football that applies painstaking detail to every pass and every move. As time goes on, the divide between those who can coach what to do on the ball with ludicrous precision and those who cannot becomes ever starker. What separates Nuno and Mourinho from Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola is increasingly understood instinctively by fans and pundits, hence why everyone these days is talking about ‘having a plan’. The reason 2016 is the starting point is because this is the year Klopp’s vision at Liverpool started to come together, Guardiola joined Manchester City – and Conte blew the Premier League away at Chelsea. The speed of Chelsea’s revival (after Mourinho, no less, which may well have been in Spurs’ thinking) is testament to the astonishing work-rate, leadership, and tactical intelligence of Tottenham’s new manager. The players will be expected to sweat blood, to give every ounce of themselves to a master-plan drilled and drilled again on the training ground. Conte will spend hundreds of hours working on team shape, on and off the ball.  Like his contemporaries managing at the top of English football, he will literally pull players a few millimetres across the pitch, coaching where to stand, pass, and move until the team are perfectly choreographed. It is how he gets such dramatic improvement out of teams and it is exactly what this loose, baggy Tottenham squad need after years of unfocused attacking interplay under Nuno and Mourinho. From Dele Alli to Giovani Lo Celso, from Eric Dier to Tanguy Ndombele, every Spurs player who looks like they need structure in their life will get an almighty kick up the backside.  Kane needs focus more than mostand, in Conte,  Spurs might just have hired the one man who can promise their talisman a title challenge and have their story believed. Certainly, top four is within reach, the only major stumbling block being Conte’s challenge to implement his system mid-season, and should that be achieved then the Italian’s track record suggests he’ll only need one summer to get them ready for the top. He’s that good. What’s particularly interesting about Conte’s return to the Premier League at this moment in time is how the division has evolved, gradually, towards his very philosophy. In the early days of Klopp/Guardiola dominance gegenpressing was the buzzword of the day, but both managers have adopted a less furious approach in recent years. In fact, the two coaches are now much closer to the man currently at the top of the pile. Thomas Tuchel, who doesn’t press much outside the middle third of the pitch, deploys a system of hyper-positional structure at all times, focusing on compression between the lines and an even distribution of bodies (vertical and horizontal) rather than snapping into challenges high up the pitch. This is how Conte plays, too. In a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 formation the players have highly specialised roles (a ball-playing back three, a deep-lying playmaker, wingers converted into wing-backs), using meticulously built passing patterns to draw the opposition forward and then break at speed into the space behind, mostly via the attacking wing-backs or a sharp and pacey strike partnership. This is going to be fun 👀  pic.twitter.com/VJERc5r2hC But whereas in the past he has been mischaracterised as counterattacking, the tamer pressing now at the top of the game has rightfully seen Conte understood to be a possession manager. Tottenham will be an exciting attacking team, just not one tearing around the pitch in constant pursuit of the ball. It is difficult to say which Spurs players will become favourites, because that largely depends on who reacts well to the exhausting regiment; who can take the drill-sergeant approach and who has the tactical intelligence to follow their new leader’s instructions. Kane and Heung-Min Son could be the perfect partnership up front. Dele could be exactly what Conte wants from a playmaker just behind them. Sergio Reguilon and perhaps Lucas Moura make sense as wing-backs. It’s hard to see who fills the Christian Eriksen/Cesc Fabregas role in central midfield, or which configuration of error-prone defenders makes up the back three, but you certainly would not put it past Conte to quickly figure that out. Before this extraordinary move, it looked as though years of mismanagement from Daniel Levy had left Tottenham on the brink of sinking to the level of Everton or West Ham, locked out of the elite. Appointing an innovator – a tactical genius – like Conte changes everything. Their ceiling now depends entirely on how much money Levy is willing to invest in the first truly world-class coach Tottenham have had in the Premier League era.

327,https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-and-tottenham-can-be-the-outsiders-to-win-the-most/1q3jtmpgx4ith1qvloy1br3y4b,The Outsiders: Why Mourinho's Spurs can win the strangest of Premier League titles,"Chaos reigns in the Premier League right now. On a club-by-club basis we can begin to decipher why – Liverpool have stopped pressing, Manchester City’s midfield lacks bite – but on a macro level there is an absurdity that stretches beyond tactical analysis. It could be that empty stadiums have lifted too much pressure off players’ shoulders, creating training-ground scenarios that favour clinical finishing and switched-off defending. But that doesn’t explain why the same glut of 5-2s and 4-3s hasn’t happened anywhere else in Europe. No wonder there are predictions this will be another Leicester City season, another chance for something bonkers to happen over the course of an entire campaign. It’s unlikely we will ever again get a 5000/1 come in, much to the disappointment of Leicester’s natural successors Aston Villa, but there is a compelling case to be made for an outsider. If the tactical bedlam of the first four rounds is anything to go by, that team will be Tottenham Hotspur. Football tactics are supposed to progress linearly, but the Covid-19 pandemic’s interruption might be about to break a century of forward momentum in that regard. For the last 15 years we have been on a path of possession dominance and high pressing, of increasing expansiveness and verticality as the Spanish tiki-taka and German gegenpressing models fused, melted and reformed. Jose Mourinho began his career aligned with the defensive tactics of the time (such as Rafa Benitez’s Liverpool and Greece at Euro 2004) and then enjoyed the back end of his peak years as a welcome antidote to the possession style that emerged through Pep Guardiola and Vicente del Bosque.Then things started to turn sour in 2015. Mourinho’s slow fade into tactical irrelevance happened because of the ever-widening financial inequality in football, which made dominating possession a necessity, rather than a choice, as poorer clubs learnt to sit back and absorb pressure. At a certain point his midblock, conservatism, and counter-attacking preference stopped working in the majority of Premier League games. But perhaps, out of nowhere, he is becoming relevant again. The ultra-aggressive high lines and the ultra-hard pressing are seemingly unsustainable in this eerie new age of Covid football, whether for fitness reasons or otherwise. Liverpool and Man City lead the way in that regard, but high-scoring matches across the division suggest the approach requires too much fine-tuning to be successful when delirium is the primary emotion. Mourinho, then, may be falling back into fashion; may benefit from tactical history becoming cyclical for the very first time. Tottenham’s string of good performances, culminating in the 6-1 win at Manchester United, have been classic Mourinho, relying on a tightly compressed and safe midblock when not in possession and rapid counter-attacks when the ball is won back.  Harry Kane, dropping into the No.10 zone, and Son Heung-min, making runs in behind, epitomise the very best of Mourinho. His summer signings have also helped improve Tottenham’s ability to absorb his methods and cast aside the Mauricio Pochettino era for good. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in particular adds the Matic-like bite sorely needed in midfield, while Matt Doherty has the intelligence to add greater defensive resolve from right-back. How Gareth Bale fits into the system is less clear, although he at least offers the option of something entirely different from Son or Lucas. Add to that the attacking dynamism of Sergio Reguilon and Spurs now have strength in depth and a squad packed with players willing to listen diligently to the manager’s instructions. Suddenly, as games stretch out and goals fly in at both ends, that risk-averse and hyper-reactive approach feels extremely logical. Through Jose’s defensive coaching Tottenham are arguably the only ‘Big Six’ club that aren’t alarmingly porous, vulnerable to shock defeats, and easy to lure forward. Their games don’t descend into chaos because every fibre of Mourinho’s being seeks order. His infamous edict about how to win big games - the match is won by the team who commits fewer errors; whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake – has never felt more rational, more soothing to hear, than during a season that’s so messy we are still struggling find a coherent narrative. But the problems that have plagued Mourinho over the last few years haven’t exactly gone away. The 1-1 draw with Newcastle United at the end of September showed Spurs still look stodgy when attempting to break down a deep-lying defence, which is why Sunday’s game against West Ham United is a litmus test for the true extent of their progress in 2020-21. If they win - if they crack how to beat the most defensive teams in the division - then Tottenham really could cause a huge shock and challenge for the title. Football always seems to imitate life. In this most unpredictable of times to be alive, it would be a fitting twist if the tactical foundations of the last decade were turned on their head – and if the most divisive of figures, Jose Mourinho, was to enjoy a baffling renaissance.

328,https://www.goal.com/en/news/covid-era-football-nonsense-man-utd-title-bid-proves-it/1a7k8ttu4zttt1m7cdvlq7ywm1,Covid-era football is nonsense - and Man Utd's title bid proves it,"As fansprepare for the return ofPremier League action amid a new national lockdown in England, perhaps it is time to admit something a bit uncomfortable about this unique campaign. No teams areactually good, and none of it really makes sense. It seems increasingly likely that fans willnotbeback instadiums before the curtain comes down on the season in May, but things might be entirely back to normal in time for the beginning of 2021-22 – set to start in the usual August time slot and, potentially, with close to capacity crowds. That suggests a rather neat summer divide for football, which in turnwill only serve to heighten the sense of dissonance between the two campaigns, isolating 2020-21 as a weird, other-worldly, heavily-asterisked Premier League season. It will feel like a distant nightmare sooner than you think. And, looking back on it from the safety and comfort of post-pandemic football, we will probably agree that it was - for the most part - surreal nonsense masquerading as the real thing. Currently we are too deeply embedded in the present to get that perspective, so instead we trudge on with the pretence, indulging in the usual metrics of punditry and opinion. We should notblame ourselves for that: the self-hypnosis of believing that the Premier League is governed by logic and reason is a necessary delusion. Football has been a blessed relief from the pandemic; we crave normality and will seek it out wherever we can, however delusional. Hence our rather bonkers ability to change perspectives on clubs as they bounce up and down the table. It isall a part of the circus, the escapism, of desperately wanting this absurd 'Covid season' to be like any other. Take Manchester United, for example. In recent weeks the Red Devils have beenrubber-stamped as a ""Good Team"",even though less than two monthsago theymost definitely came under the bracket of being ""In Crisis"".  With victories over Burnley and Liverpool in the next week, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side could find themselves six points clear of the Anfield outfit having played the same number of games as Jurgen Klopp'sdefending champions and current Premier League leaders. On that basis they surely must be good, right? But it does nottake much digging to see that Unitedare exactly the same side as they were a month or even a year ago, with the same flaws and limitations; the same lack of tactical detail and the same reliance on individual quality. The difference is, in this weird campaign when everyone is struggling, Solskjaer’s tactical shortcomings are no longer significant. His team have not improved by much; it isjust that others have come down to their level. Covid-19 has seen the Premier League tactical landscape regress by about five years – essentially back to the time before Leicester City’s title win in 2016. As Claudio Ranieri’s triumph left stunned elite clubs scrambling to modernise, England caught up with mainland Europe’s most important contemporary features: in-depth positional coaching both on and off the ball. Off it, this amounts to a more textured and varied use of pressing, which became increasingly choreographed and used as a mechanism of attack, while on the ball this meant the introduction of ‘automatisms’: set moves drilled in training until they become instinctive on match day, allowing teams to think and act several steps ahead of play. The big teams turned to the best young coaches in the game, and Antonio Conte, Jurgen Klopp, and Pep Guardiola introduced the country to the microscopic details; to structured attacks built in carefully demarcated zones, and to structured pressing built in phases and traps.   The pandemic has pretty much thrown all of this out of the window. A truncated pre-season and constant churn of midweek matches has limited time on the training ground, severely impacting the ability of Klopp or Guardiola to coach in microscopic detail, while fatigue – both physical and mental – has dramatically reduced pressing intensity. Unsurprisingly, tactics have disintegrated back to their pre-2016 level. Exhausted players are meandering through matches, focusing almost entirely on recovery between games. They lack detailed instruction from the dugout and are unable to fully enact game-plans, creating a zombie-like season of upsets and disjointed football; of lurches between bizarre high-scoring games and slews of 0-0s. With the norms subverted, the best-placed manager to succeed is the one who comes from that tactically regressive time. Step forward Solskjaer, an excellent man-manager and motivator whose Sir Alex Ferguson-inspired talk of the ‘United Way’ and vague notions of playing exciting, attacking football suddenly appeal perfectly to the moment. Over the last two years the Norwegianhas consistently displayed a lack of tactical acumen, instead relying on the improvisations of key individuals. This helps explain why it remains difficult to work out what Solskjaer is actually trying to do, and why it is so hard to summarise United’s playing style in a few sentences. An individualistic team is an emotional and unreliable one, because when confidence drops there is no foundation – no ‘automatisms’, no muscle memory – to fall back on, leading to bursts of brilliant form and sudden collapses. It would be naive to assume United will notsuffer another mini-crisis this season – we ought to be wise to Solskjaer’s false dawns by now – but it would be just as naive to assume that this would prevent them from mounting a serious title challenge. In a pre-modern tactical season, you want a pre-modern manager. To put it another way, United’s players are given complete creative freedom, allowing them to problem solve this unique year, whereas ManchesterCity and Liverpool are finding their tactical purity clashing brutally with the pandemic-induced chaos.   But we should not overstate Solskjaer’s case. Thisseason has suited him, and yet United’s league position is still more to do with the failures of others than their own success. The club’s current points returnputs them on course for 78 points in 2020-21, significantly more than last year’s 66 but three fewer than the tally achieved by Jose Mourinho in 2017-18. Mourinho’s total collapse the following season has somehow been allowed to recalibrate what constitutes success at United. It should not, because although Solskjaer technically inherited a team in mid-table in reality he took charge of a squad that just six months earlier had collected 81 points and finished second. That was the real level of the team, and the Norwegian’s achievements ought to be judged against that foundation. Two years and £275 million worth of new signingslater, United are still not back to that level. And so we are left with a paradox befitting the absurdity of the moment: Solskjaer is both masterminding a title challengeand under-achieving; is both not good enough for the club and the perfect manager to navigate the 2020-21 Premier League campaign. When we look back on the Covid-era in years to come, we will see this Premier League season for what it really is: absolute nonsense, an anomaly that bears almost no resemblance to what came before or after. No club encapsulates this better than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s oxymoronic Manchester United. They could win the league. And they are notvery good. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

329,https://www.goal.com/en/news/please-come-and-knock-me-out-klopp-jokes-about-being-not/blt3bea66a5b318ba4b,'Please come and knock me out!' - Klopp jokes about being 'not happy' after Liverpool draw seals Champions League progression,"Jurgen Klopp quipped that he was ""not happy"" despite Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final progression after a 3-3 second-leg draw with Benfica, but the German admitted that it would have been ""not important"" if his side had turned out their performance of the season. The Reds ran out 6-4 aggregate victors against their Portuguese opponents following Wednesday's clash at Anfield, setting up a semi-final encounter with Villarreal and a potential final date in France with either Manchester City or Real Madrid. Having led 3-1 though, two consolation concessions made matters a little tougher than they arguably should have been for the hosts, and Klopp joked afterwards that it would only be right for him to be disappointed despite their progression. ""[It is] the day we qualify for the Champions League semi-final and I'm not happy,"" the German told BT Sport. ""Please come and knock me out! ""It was not exactly what we wanted but it is absolutely not important because if we played the best game of the season tonight, it wouldn't have made it more likely to get to the final. We are through and that's all that matters and I'm really happy. ""The one thing we knew is it [would] be hard as the [back] line [had] never played together. You lose the boys like Virgil [van Dijk] and these things are normal. This is not a problem. Benfica kept believing and kept going, that's all."" Liverpool's reward for their victory over Benfica is a clash with the competition's major remaining underdog, who have transitioned last term's Europa League triumph over Manchester United into knockout wins over Juventus and Bayern Munich this season. Klopp admitted that the Yellow Submarine are a hard opponent to profile, given their success in knockout football, adding: ""If I could do an analysis of Villarreal right now, that would be very strange. I saw the results, the game was very impressive. ""I only picked up pieces, but to beat Juventus and Bayern Munich, they deserve to be in the Champions League semi-finals. Unai Emery is the king of the cups, it is unbelievable what he is doing. But give me a bit of time to prepare it properly."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

330,https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-there-are-many-things-people-don-t-know-amid-liverpool/bltf739ce657f0beeaa,Salah: There are many things people don't know amid Liverpool contract negotiations,"Mohamed Salah had admitted that he has yet to reach an agreement with Liverpool over a contract extension while claiming that ""there are many things people don't know"" about the situation. Salah has been a talismanic figure for Liverpool throughout his five-year stay at Anfield, scoring 153 goals in 241 games across all competitions. The Egyptian has helped fire the club to Premier League and Champions League glory, but is now approaching the final year of his contract and speculation over his future is building with each passing week. A number of top clubs have been linked with Salah, including Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the 29-year-old did insist that he would happily spend the remainder of his career at Liverpool back in October. It appears that non-footballing issues are holding up a potential renewal for Salah, who has now given an update on the state of negotations with the club. ""What can I say? There are many things that people don't know about it,"" the forward has told Sky Sports. ""I can't be selfish and talk about my situation, we are in the most important moment for the team."" Asked if he is confident that he will be able to sort out a new contract at Anfield, Salah replied: ""I can't say yes and I can't say no. I've said many times before about what I want but again I can't go deep into my contract right now because it's a sensitive situation and the team needs to win."" The Reds talisman also dismissed any suggestion that the saga is distracting him from his duties on the pitch ahead of a top of the table showdown against Manchester City on Sunday. ""Not at all, I know my job very well and I am very professional,"" he said. ""I'm almost the first one here and the last one to leave, I'm just focusing on the team and winning trophies and giving everything I can to the club."" Klopp offered his take on Salah's contract last month, insisting that the ball is in the Egypt international's court with regards to his future. The Liverpool boss indicated that an offer has already been tabled, telling reporters: ""We cannot do much more, that's how it is. But I don't think it's about that. It's Mo's decision pretty much. The club did what the club can do. That's how it is. ""Nothing bad to say about it. It's fine from my point of view. It's exactly like it should be in this moment in time. Everything is set. Nothing happened further, no signing, no rejection or whatever. ""We just have to wait for that. It's completely fine. No rush in that situation.""

331,https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-klopp-salah-contract-we-cant-do-much-more/bltd3ca6d960cdf6f6c,Liverpool boss Klopp on Salah contract: We can't do much more,"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that no further progress has been made in talks between the club and Mohamed Salah over a new contract. Salah, 29, sees his current deal expire at the end of next season. The Reds would be loathe to lose one of the world's premier strikers, and one moreover who is in the form of his life right now. ""Mo definitely expects this club to be ambitious,"" Klopp explained to reporters on Friday. ""We were in the last few years and we are. ""We cannot do much more, that's how it is. But I don't think it's about that. It's Mo's decision pretty much. The club did what the club can do. That's how it is. ""Nothing bad to say about it. It's fine from my point of view. ""It's exactly like it should be in this moment in time. Everything is set. Nothing happened further, no signing, no rejection or whatever. ""We just have to wait for that. It's completely fine. No rush in that situation."" Klopp's words appeared to elicit a strong reaction from Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas. Shortly after the manager's conference Abbas took to Twitter and, while he did not offer any words in his message, a torrent of laughing faces certainly encouraged the interpretation that he may not have been impressed with what he heard. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 One factor in Salah and his agent's favour is that given his current form, the Egyptian would have no shortage of suitors waiting to pick him up on a free transfer in 2023. The forward has smashed 27 goals in 34 games this season in all competitions for the Reds, who have already lifted the Carabao Cup and remain competitive in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.

That prompted the Egyptian football association to file a ""racism"" complaint against their opponents, with the loss meaning that Salah and his team-mates would miss out on the World Cup in Qatar. In the run-up to his penalty, which Salah skied to eventually see Sadio Mane and Senegal advance, the Liverpool star was seen with several lasers being aimed at his face by spectators at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor. After a 1-0 first-leg win, Egypt conceded a goal in the fourth minute with the two sides deadlocked all the way through to a penalty shootout. Throughout the match, the partisan home crowd were seen shining lasers onto the field, with those pointers out in full force for the penalty kicks. Dozens of lasers could be seen on Salah's face before he missed from the spot, with Egypt eventually losing 3-1 in the shoot-out to miss out on the World Cup. As the Liverpool forward left the pitch, he was again being targeted as security had to escort him down the tunnel and attempt to protect him from the missiles that were raining down from the stands. Following the match, Egypt manager Carlos Queiroz stepped down, ending his time in charge of the team after taking the role in September. Mohamed Salah will turn 34 during the 2026 World Cup, his next opportunity to play at the tournament.Will this be the final, defining image of the Liverpool superstar's attempts to truly make his mark on the grandest stage of all?#SENEGY #WCQ2022 #LFC #YNWA pic.twitter.com/rpuQqBEoWr While they didn't address the lasers specifically, the Egypt FA have confirmed that they have filed a complaint based on the atmosphere in Senegal. The complaint, posted on their Instagram page, also claimed that racist banners were held up targeting Salah during the contest, while posting pictures of the damage done to their team bus after an attack from fans prior to the game. “The Egyptian Football Association have lodged a formal complaint against its Senegalese counterpart to the match observer, the security official, CAF, and FIFA, before the start of the match between the two teams,"" the federation said. “The Egyptian team was subjected to racism after the appearance of offensive banners in the stands aimed at the players, specifically Mohamed Salah. “Moreover, the Senegalese fans terrorised the Egyptian players by throwing bottles and stones at them during the warm-up, as well as attacking the Egyptian team bus, which caused glass shattering and some injuries, which was documented with pictures and videos attached to the complaint.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

333,https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-man-city-premier-league-title-race/ry1uxr1ylhp01rn41zgj6jdmm,Liverpool and Manchester City show why Premier League title race will thrill - but defensive depth is worrying for Reds,"At the end, Pep Guardiola, his team and their fans were the ones celebrating. Maybe that, more than anything else, tells the true story of this brilliant, pulsating Premier League clash. “You’ve seen the champions, now f**k off home,” crowed the Manchester City supporters, packed tightly into the old Anfield Road end. In front of them, Guardiola gave a smile and a fist pump. He looked happy, focused, determined, themeshe would continue in his post-match press conference. His side could have, should have won perhaps, but the 2-2 draw they chiselled out here will have felt like a victory, given the setting and given the circumstances. ""I am satisfied,"" confirmed Guardiola. For Liverpool, it was a case of what might have been. They remain unbeaten,above City in the table and below only Chelsea;but as they head into the second international break of the campaign, they know their position should be even stronger than it is. They led twice, overcoming a terrible first half to raise the Anfield rooffirst through Sadio Mane and then, spectacularly, through the genius of Mohamed Salah. With nine minutes to go, the game was theirs, but City are champions for a reason, and when Guardiola’s side needed a response, and a little bit of good fortune, they got it. Kevin De Bruyne’s deflected leveller at the Kop end ensured the spoils were shared. It was fair, to be perfectly honest. City bossed the first half but Liverpool responded strongly after the break. Both sides had openings, both sides had near misses. Even at 2-2, it needed a remarkable goalline block from Rodri to deny Fabinho a winner. At the other end, Andy Robertson stood firm to prevent Gabriel Jesus from pinching it. That’s how fine the margins are between these sides, and how fine they will be in this most mouth-watering of title races. In Liverpool, City and Chelsea, we have three heavyweight contenders, and it would be wise not to discount Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United as well, even if their recent form suggests they still sit a rung below the others. Liverpool certainly look like they will be in the mix, although this was their third draw of the campaign, and in all three they had looked well-placed to get the win. Just as at Brentford last time out, they let the game slip in the final 10 minutes. Warning signs, perhaps? We are used to such levels of consistency from this team, that anything less than perfect tends to stand out. Certainly the pre-match concerns surrounding the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold were realised here. James Milner is as good a professional as there is, and a more than competent right-back when needed, but the veteran was given a torrid time by Phil Foden throughout. Foden scored the first and created the second, by which time Milner had been substituted for his own good, having picked up a first-half yellow card and been fortunate to avoid a second after the break. As Milner guiltily walked away after upending Bernardo Silva, Guardiola raged at fourth official Mike Dean on the sideline. Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile, simply told Joe Gomez to get ready. It was a wise call. ""We planned it anyway,"" he said afterwards. Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool hope, will be back for the trip to Watford on October 16, and the Reds need him. Not necessarily for his defensive quality - Foden would have given any full-back a hard time today - but for that quality and range of passing which is so integral to the way Liverpool play. Without him, the Reds looked stodgy and scrambled for 45 minutes. They started OK, but by half-time they were on the ropes, unable to keep the ball and grateful to Alisson Becker for two fine interventions to prevent Foden - who else? - from opening the scoring. Liverpool managed one shot in the first half and it was blocked before it got to within 15 yards of Ederson’s goal. Jordan Henderson, the captain, misplaced 50 per cent of his passes in midfield. City were sloppy themselves, but dominated. ""We did it exactly how you shouldn't do against City,"" Klopp pointed out. ""We didn't play football."" Whatever hesaid at half time worked, though. Liverpool emerged a different side, hungrier and sharper, with far more threat. Just before the hour mark, Salah slipped two defenders on the right flank and fed Mane, 1-0 to the home side. City still had Foden though, and 10 minutes later he levelled, ghosting in behind Milner to receive Gabriel Jesus’ pass and fire home. Liverpool’s weak spot punished by City’s star man. Then Liverpool’s star man came to the party. Salah received a pass from Curtis Jones on the left corner of the City box, with four defenders for company. He beat them all, his nimble feet taking him into the area. Then he beat Aymeric Laporte to chop the ball onto his right foot. Then he beat Ederson. Anfield exploded. A moment of genius, fit to win any football match. It didn’t. Foden still had a part to play, this time in space behind Gomez and seeing his low cross reach De Bruyne, whose strike went in off Joel Matip. “Justice,” tweeted City’s official account. Rough justice, Liverpool will feel. Matip was, They emerge unscathedthough, and have now faced both of their main rivals and held their own. City, too, will take confidence. They won at Stamford Bridge last week and stood up tall at Anfield this time around. ""The way we lost in Paris showed me we are a good side,"" Guardiola said. ""And so did the way they drew today."" They’ll be up there come May, no doubt.So will Liverpool, though. If this really is to be the tightest title race in years, then this was the ideal game to prove it. More of this, please!

334,https://www.goal.com/en/news/jota-liverpool-quadruple-bid-manchester-city-showdown/bltf8a82df15eff07f6,Jota firing Liverpool's quadruple bid as Reds set up Manchester City showdown,"Mohamed Salah might be their superstar, Sadio Mane their warrior, Roberto Firmino their magician and Luis Diaz their new darling. But where on earth would Liverpool be without Diogo Jota? There are plenty of difference-makers at Anfield these days, but few are as decisive as the Portugal international. They do not call him ‘Jota the Slotter’ for nothing. He's the King of the Penalty Area, as far as Liverpool are concerned. “What a player, what a boy!” boomed Jurgen Klopp on Sunday after Jota’s goal, his 19th of the season, had edged the Reds past Nottingham Forest and into the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where a mouthwatering Wembley clash with Manchester City awaits. Strap yourselves in, Reds fans, because if February and March have been memorable, then April and May could be absolutely seismic. They don’t like to talk about it, and understandably so, but the quadruple is alive and kicking. Klopp’s side are 16 games from immortality. With Jota in this kind of form, they have a chance. There are some players who just have that knack, that ability to be in the right place at the right time, and he is most definitely one. A game-changer, a match-winner. The 𝘴𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘦𝘴𝘵 of touches from @DiogoJota18.@LFC #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/medNXfWdSI Another was sat in the television studio at the City Ground on Sunday, actually. Jota still has some way to go if he’s to match Robbie Fowler’s goalscoring feats at Anfield, but there are certainly similarities between the two, in terms of their movement and instinct around the penalty area. “He’s been brilliant,” Fowler told ITV Sport. “There are some strikers who are always dropping deep, which is fine, but he does his work in the box and that makes him a huge threat.” This is now the most prolific campaign of Jota’s career, but it is not just the volume of goals which is striking. It is the variety of his strikes, and the significance of them. Twelve times this season, he has scored the Reds’ first goal in a game. The latest came at Forest, where he stretched to touch home Kostas Tsimikas’ inviting left-wing cross, 12 minutes from time. “Massive,” said Klopp. Jota did not play particularly well, if truth be told, but just as at Arsenal on Wednesday, and just as on so many other occasions before that, it was he who found the code to crack open the safe. “If you’re going to pass the ball to Diogo, then make sure it’s in the box!” joked one member of Liverpool’s staff. All of Jota's goals this season have come from inside the 18-yard box. He has scored seven with his right foot, seven with his left, and five with his head. In terms of finishing, he has no real weakness. With Diaz on board, Klopp is suddenly able to chop and change his frontline without it damaging his side’s chances. That could well prove decisive in the coming weeks, as the season reaches a thrilling climax. Before then comes an international break, however. “I don’t hate them,” Klopp said on Sunday, “but they worry me!” He will spend the next 10 days with his fingers crossed, as his stars head off around the world. Jota is among those in action. Portugal face Turkey in a crunch World Cup qualification play-off in Porto on Thursday. Win that, and they will play either Italy or North Macedonia next Tuesday for a place in Qatar. He is not the only one with big games to play, either. Salah and Mane face off as Egypt take on Senegal, Takumi Minamino is on the brink of qualification with Japan, while Diaz’s Colombia need a minor miracle as they take on Bolivia and Venezuela. Klopp will hope and pray that all emerge unscathed. He already has concerns over Trent Alexander-Arnold, the defender having missed the Forest game due to a hamstring injury. The feeling is that he could be back to face Benfica in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on April 5, but it will be touch and go. They handled the England international’s absence on Sunday, with Joe Gomez filling in admirably. Klopp’s whole squad will be needed between now and the end of May, that is for sure, with everyone asked to play their part. Jota is certainly playing his. “He will take us to victory,” sang the Liverpool fans at Forest. Better get used to that tune. One suspects you will be hearing it quite a lot over the next few weeks.

335,https://www.goal.com/en/news/diaz-benfica-boos-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final/blt83cedb322f7d5738,Deadly Diaz shrugs off Benfica boos to put Liverpool in sight of Champions League semi-finals,"Match statistics: Benfica 1-3 Liverpool Luis Diaz’s celebration said it all. He knew how big a goal this was, and he was not about to miss an opportunity to enjoy it. His name had been booed when it was read out before kick off at Estadio da Luz, but he would have the last laugh on the night. The ex-Porto man did what Benfica feared he would; he came back to hit them where it hurts. Diaz’s late strike sealed a 3-1 win which means Liverpool, surely, have one foot in the semi-finals of the Champions League. It's only the halfway stage of the tie, of course, but on a night when any win would have done, a two-goal triumph represents a huge success for Jurgen Klopp and his side, who will surely finish the job at Anfield next week. That one would have felt good for Luis Diaz! 👊The former Porto man bags his first #UCL goal for Liverpool to regain their two-goal advantage ✌️Klopp's smile says it all! pic.twitter.com/VPpaz89Fot Luis Diaz comes back to haunt Benfica, he has never lost to them. 🌶Naby Keita with the run and assist, Liverpool are active! pic.twitter.com/RfAxk4BF8G They were made to work for their advantage here, mind. Having looked at one stage as if they would run away with the tie in the first half, when goals from Ibrahima Konate and Sadio Mane had them firmly in the ascendency, the Reds were given an almighty scare after the break, pegged back by Darwin Nunez’s goal and hanging on for a spell before steadying the ship in the closing stages. Diaz ensured the night ended on a high, the Colombia international running clear from Naby Keita’s superbly-weighted pass, three minutes from time, before rounding Odisseas Vlachodimos to finish into an empty net. Inside the stadium, it was as if a pin had been taken to a balloon, all of Benfica’s hope and belief taken away by the man who used to wear the blue-and-white of their bitter domestic rivals. Diaz rubbed it in, dancing with Fabinho and sticking his tongue out. His third Liverpool goal was his most enjoyable, and the perfect way to mark his first Champions League start for the club. Benfica could not argue too much about the result, in fairness. Liverpool deserved the win, and they deserved at least a two-goal cushion as well. They were breathtaking at times in the opening 45 minutes and had they been a little more clinical, things could have gotten really messy. Were it not for Vlachodimos, the home side would have been battered. Konate got Liverpool off and running, heading in his first goal for the club from an Andy Robertson corner, 16 minutes in. It was a goal of simplicity, and one which made the defender the first Frenchman to score for the Reds in the Champions League since David Ngog, all the way back in 2009. Diaz would play a big part in Liverpool’s second goal, heading the ball down unselfishly for Sadio Mane to convert from close range. The strike owed everything, though, to the vision and technique of Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose magnificent diagonal pass made it all possible. At that point we were wondering if the tie would be killed there and then. Diaz, cutting in with menace from the left, flashed a shot wide of the near post and was denied by the goalkeeper when clean through, while Mohamed Salah missed a great chance to make it 3-0 right on half time. It was not the Egyptian’s night, his game a blur of loose touches and misplaced passes, and by the time he was substituted, along with Mane and Thiago Alcantara, the game had started to swing Benfica’s way. Nunez, their impressive Uruguayan forward, got them back into it, finishing at the far post after Konate had missed his clearance from a Rafa Silva cross from the right. It came from nowhere, a bad error duly punished, and suddenly the tie was in the balance again. Liverpool needed Alisson Becker, their goalkeeper, to bail them out when Everton, Benfica’s Brazilian wide player, pulled the trigger soon after, and the composure and incision we had saw from the visitors before the break started to evaporate. Alisson had fans’ nerves on edge with a couple of risky plays outside his penalty area, while the noise from the home fans grew as they sensed a famous comeback. It did not arrive. Liverpool regained control thanks to their substitutions, with Roberto Firmino particularly influential. And when Keita grabbed hold of a loose ball and drove forward in the dying stages, he was able to find the right pass for Diaz, who was able to find the right finish. Benfica’s dismay was Liverpool’s delight. The semi-finals are well and truly in sight for Klopp’s men. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

336,https://www.goal.com/en/news/nightmare-end-ukraine-goalkeeper-trubin-praying-for-end-to/bltba71283668cda413,'I want this nightmare to end as soon as possible' - Ukraine goalkeeper Trubin praying for peace,"Imagine spending your entire career at one club yet never playing at its home stadium or even training at its state-of-art facilities. That is the story of Anatoliy Trubin, the 20-year-old Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper, nicknamed the ""Ukrainian Courtois"", and widely seen as one of the brightest talents in the country. In 2014, at the age of just 13, Trubin was forced to abandon his home and move to Kyiv in order to continue playing for Shakhtar. And now, he is a refugee in his country once again, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made life in the capital impossible. ""Our youth team was just about to move to Shakhtar's main training centre in 2014, because that's what happens starting from the Under-13 teams,"" Trubin explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""However, the military situation began, and things became unclear. For a long while, we didn't even know if there would still be a team at all. ""Then, in August, we were told to pack and move to the Kyiv region if we wanted to stay at the academy."" The kid's life had changed, totally and unexpectedly. ""Our family lived just a few minutes from the Shakhtar training ground, and it was supposed to be very comfortable. All of a sudden, I had to leave home,"" he says. ""It was very difficult for me and my parents, who at times didn't see me for about six months. They knew that I love football, and I guess they just couldn’t prevent me from going. ""I was just following my dream, but in very different circumstances."" 💙💛 Kyiv 🇺🇦🙏#FootballStandsTogether#StandWithUkraine#Україна #Ukraine #Київ #Kyiv pic.twitter.com/XY5n8QN2N3 It has been a long and painful story for Trubin. The world only started paying attention to the conflict this year but it all started eight years ago, when separatists, strongly supported by Russia, began military actions, aiming to achieve independence for the Donbass region. Many people in Donetsk speak Russian as their mother tongue, which is perfectly normal and logical, given its history in the Soviet Union, which united all of the republics in the same country. It is noteworthy that Russian is the default language at Shakhtar's official website. That doesn't mean, however, that they support Russia's aggression – quite the contrary. Trubin, who speaks Russian, claims: ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn't like Donetsk to stay part of Ukraine. Donetsk is Ukraine, and it can only flourish as an Ukrainian city. It was a magnificent prosperous town, the city of roses. ""I just want this war to be over as soon as possible, so that things can be as they were. How could anyone support this aggression, when peaceful people are dying? ""Such a situation helped me to grow mentally faster. Maybe that is the reason why my progress was quite fast."" Trubin made his Shakhtar debut in May 2019, aged just 17, and started playing regularly less than a year later. His Champions League debut was quite sensational, in a 3-2 win against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu, with Trubin beating the real Thibaut Courtois. ""Our Brazilian players gave me that nickname, because I am tall like him – 199cm,"" he says. ""He is not my role model, because I grew up admiring Iker Casillas, Petr Cech and Edwin van der Sar. ""But it was obviously great to play against him in the Champions League and win. We greeted each other after the final whistle, and wished each other luck."" Shakhtar played in the Champions League this season as well, but now that feels like a distant memory, following the Russian invasion that started on February 24. ""We didn't think it could really happen,"" he admits. Nobody expected Russia to be so barbaric and cruel. This really is a nightmare. I don’t understand how they are capable of it. ""They ruined so many beautiful towns and killed so many civilians. That is a catastrophe. ""Up until 2014, we just considered Russia to be a neighbour. There were no bad feelings between people in the two countries. It was unthinkable that war could start, first in Donetsk and then in all of Ukraine. ""But now, Russia doesn't exist for me as a country anymore. I think it would take a very long time for the wounds to heal."" The tragedy of Mariupol, besieged and almost totally destroyed by Russian aggressors, is very personal for Trubin. ""It is almost my second town,"" he says. ""As kids, we used to train and play there quite a lot. We also went there with my family for seaside vacations. ""My girlfriend is from Mariupol, and all her family lived there. Thankfully, they now managed to escape."" 🇺🇦 Mariupol 💔#StopRussianAggression#Україна #Ukraine#StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/n39Hve93dh He keeps in touch daily with his family in Donetsk. ""Only when I joined the first-team squad three years ago was there an opportunity to bring my mother and sister to live with me,"" he reveals. ""But my father, grandmother, uncle and aunt are still in Donetsk. ""They are relatively safe, even though there are severe problems with running water and electricity."" The keeper himself, together with his mother and sister, escaped to Lutsk in the west of the country. Ironically, it's the hometown of Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, once a legend of Ukrainian football, but now considered a traitor as he silently continues to work as assistant coach at Gazprom-owned Zenit. ""I would rather not talk about that man,"" Trubin says. ""We went to Lutsk because it was possible to find a place to live here. ""Some players went to other towns, like Uzhhorod and Lviv. There is a pitch here, and I am trying to train and keep myself in form, but that is not easy."" Whereas the foreign players were allowed to leave the country, the situation is different for Ukrainians. ""Men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave,"" he explains. ""There might have been interest from certain clubs, and I might have loved to join a foreign club temporarily. ""But that is impossible without getting permission from the Ministry of Sports of the Football Association. ""I could have been more useful for the country by playing abroad, rather than just sitting here and doing nothing."" The young keeper was part of Ukraine's Euro 2020 squad, even though he didn't play. Now, that national team must start thinking about the World Cup qualifying fixture against Scotland that was postponed until June because of the war. The winner will face Wales in the playoff for the place in Qatar. ""This is another important aspect. I wish I could at least find a team in order to train regularly. It is much better to train with a squad rather than do it all by myself,"" Trubin says. However, while the World Cup is important, peace is all that matters to Ukrainians right now. ""I want this nightmare to end as soon as possible, and for us to get our country back to normal,"" he says. ""Then, my biggest dream is to return to Donetsk and play at Donbass Arena. It was impossible for many years, but I believe that day will come.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

At 64 years of age, and with his day job requiring full focus on sporting matters, Petrakov offered to join the fight against Vladimir Putin’s forces as shells began to drop from the sky. His family urged him to reconsider but, with normal life put on hold for the foreseeable future, staying put was the only option that the fiercely patriotic figure was prepared to consider. Petrakov told The Guardian of his decision to stand firm: “My family told me to go to western Ukraine but I refused. I said: ‘I am from Kyiv, I can’t leave’. “I didn’t think it would be correct as people have to defend and I can’t run. I thought, if they come to Kyiv I will pick up a weapon and defend my city.” He added: “I am 64 but I felt it was normal to do this. I think I could take two or three enemies out.” Petrakov has seen competitive football in Ukraine suspended indefinitely, but a World Cup 2022 play-off clash with Scotland is still due to take place in June. Preparations for that contest are proving tricky, with it virtually impossible to plan training sessions while the constant threat of military action hangs over the region – with plans to hold camps in the west of Ukraine being shelved for now. Petrakov said: “There is also shelling in western Ukraine. And if someone says that the national team training camp has started, the enemies could start shelling us. “These people are without morals, or principles, and we couldn’t risk our players. The Russians are not our brothers, they are the horde.” If Ukraine were to make their way past Scotland, then a play-off final against Wales would be lined up. Petrakov is still hoping to guide his nation to Qatar 2022, but admits that the odds are being stacked against his team. He said of the need to get his players – particularly those tied to Ukrainian clubs – match sharp before taking in such important fixtures: “We could play at Wembley, for example, against a London club. “It could be a good exhibition game, a response for the Ukrainian army, as well as preparatory work for the Scotland game. “We have to play because without the [practice] games, it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland.” Petrakov added on the prospect of ever lining up against Russia again at some point in the future: “I wouldn’t want this to happen while I am still alive. “I don’t [want] to shake hands with these guys … We have to build a great wall and do what we can do to separate from them.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has gripped the world, with footballers impacted in the same way as the rest of society. Zinchenko is one of several Ukrainian players plying their trade abroad, and the Manchester City star says it is hard for him to look on as his country suffers. Zinchenko revealed how he found out about what was going on in his home country, admitting that he was, and still is, in shock. ""At midnight UK time, my wife woke me up and she was crying,"" Zinchenko told BBC. ""I was in shock. She showed me the videos, the pictures, what's going on now in Ukraine. ""Maybe the most closest feeling is when someone from your circle is dying. You know, this feeling like you feel so bad inside. But this is even much more worse."" He admitted that he is still shaken more than a week later as he struggles to come to grips with the world around him. ""I'm just crying,"" he said. ""So already a week, I'm not counting, but even I can drive the car from the training ground, or it doesn't matter where, I can just cry from nothing. ""It's everything in my head. Imagine the place where you was born, where you was growing up. And there is just empty ground."" Several footballers and coaches have taken up arms to fight, with Vitalii Sapylo, 21, and Dmytro Martynenko, 25, losing their lives in combat to become the first football casualties of the conflict this week. Yuriy Vernydub, who rose to fame for leading Moldovan side Sheriff past Real Madrid in the Champions League this season, has returned to Ukraine to join the army, while Shakhtar Donetsk CEO Sergey Palkin has called for an end to the “madness” while confirming that a youth coach employed by the club has been killed “by a fragment of a Russian shell”. Zinchenko, meanwhile, has stayed in Manchester, and was given the captain's armband in this week's FA Cup win over Peterborough, but he too wishes he could be back helping fight for his people. ""I'll be honest, if not for my daughter, my family, I would be there,"" he said. ""I'm just born like that. I know the people from my country, the mentality of them, and all of them, they think exactly the same. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian, and I will be forever for the rest of my life. And when you're watching the people, how they fight for their lives. ""I know the people, the mentality of my people from my country, they prefer to die, and they will die. But they're not going to give [up]."" Zinchenko also thanked those from around the world for their support as much of the world has sent their love to those from Ukraine. ""I'm so grateful,"" he said. ""I'm so grateful to all these people for the support I'm getting here. I didn't realise it's going to be like that in this way. So I would like to say all of them big thanks. I appreciate it. ""I'm getting a lot of messages from a lot of guys in Ukraine and they are asking me about the videos of support [from the UK]. ""So people are watching TV, the people are still watching football, and they can see all these things, and I guess it helps a lot for them ""It's like, the people who are supporting Ukraine, they are trying to push them - don't give up. And I know my people they won't."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Plans for the summer tour are still to be finalised, but GOAL understands the Premier League champions could play a friendly against Bayern Munich at Lambeau Field, the home of the Green Bay Packers. Matches and schedules are still to be confirmed but it will be in July, with Man City back in England ahead of the first weekend in August when the Premier League season will kick off early because of a mid-season break for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. A full schedule is still to be confirmed but GOAL has been told they will play at least one other game in the US. They last visited North America in 2018 when they played Bayern in Miami, after games against Borussia Dortmund in Chicago and Liverpool in New York. They also played in Houston, Los Angeles and Nashville the year before. Pep Guardiola's squad was also able to use their sister club New York City FC's facility in Orangeburg as a training base. City have not always been able to send a full squad on previous tours with players given time off after their involvement in major tournaments, but with the World Cup taking place in November, Guardiola should have the opportunity to assemble a full squad. European countries have Nations League fixtures in early June while the Community Shield curtain-raiser, which Man City would play if they win the league or FA Cup, is scheduled for August 6. Meanwhile, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a Man City fan and would surely not pass up the opportunity to see his side play in his hometown.

340,https://www.goal.com/en/news/dortmund-man-city-haaland-unmatchable-watzke/blt47c30db57e9526c2,Dortmund admit Man City offer for Haaland would be unmatchable as Watzke vows they'll find 'new talent',"Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accepts any offer Manchester City submit for Erling Haaland would be unmatchable, but has also vowed the club will find a ""new talent"" if he leaves. City are thought to be leading the race to sign Haaland ahead of the summer transfer window, with it reported the 21-year-old has been offered a contract at Etihad Stadium that would make him the highest-paid player in the Premier League. Watzke has denied those ""rumours"" but also admits Dortmund would be unable to ""keep up financially"" if Man City were to launch a formal bid for the Norwegian striker. City are reportedly willing to invest €355 million (£301m/$396m) in Haaland, including a final transfer fee and salary costs, but the Dortmund chief is paying little attention to ongoing speculation. ""I've given up judging media rumours. Otherwise, my day would have to have 36 hours,"" Watzke told Sport Bild. ""We don't currently know anything specific from the player side, nor has anyone approached us. However, we cannot keep up financially if Manchester City comes in [for Haaland]."" Haaland is under contract at Dortmund until 2024, but Watzke acknowledges he could move on to pastures new this summer. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United have also been linked with the forward, who reportedly has a €75m (£64m/$84m) release clause. Watzke is confident BVB would be able to replace Haaland, though, and said: ""We've seen it a few times: we lost [Robert] Lewandowski to Bayern in 2014 and [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang to Arsenal in 2018. ""We've always created a new star. If Haaland leaves, we will find another new talent and develop it into a star, and that will also do the Bundesliga good."" RB Leipzig's Karim Adeyemi has been mooted as the man most likely to fill Haaland's boots at Westfalenstadion, but Watzke has said of a potential move: ""The same applies here: I will not confirm any transfer rumours.""

341,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-abramovich-english-football-man-city-newcastle-next/bltc26632032a17da4e,Abramovich has been forced out of Chelsea - Are Man City and Newcastle's owners next?,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on international funding in the United Kingdom, with sport a particularly visible and prominent vehicle of investment. Oligarchs and wealthy Russians close to Vladimir Putin have been sanctioned by the UK government and the ownership of Chelsea made Roman Abramovich the highest-profile case. With assets frozen, the club's existence was under threat and only a special licence allowed the men's and women's teams to continue playing. However, we are now moving towards the final stages of a takeover, which is being overseen by Raine Group, and there are at least four bidders in the mix. Of course, Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, has been blocked from benefiting financially from the sale. The billionaire faced sporadic criticism about his links to the Kremlin during almost two decades at Stamford Bridge, but was still free to invest as much money as he pleased in Chelsea, who won five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues during his stewardship. However, the Premier League has now come under pressure to expand its criteria for assessing prospective owners, particularly in relation to human rights. “We’re looking to see if more tests need to be added, if we need to be more transparent and whether those decisions should be approved by an independent body,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said at the recent Financial Times Business of Sport Summit. Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League. While there has always been scepticism surrounding the motives and practices of several American investors, the biggest political and moral objections have been made in relation to Middle Eastern involvement. For example, Amnesty International renewed calls for a human rights-compliant owners' and directors' test following the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been accused of presiding over a regime that has led a coalition in the long-running armed conflict in Yemen, as well as instigating a major human rights crackdown. Other Gulf states have invested heavily in sport, including 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which have both been condemned for their human rights records. Manchester City owner and UAE deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour has spent more than £1 billion ($1.3bn) turning the club into one of the most successful in the world. However, Labour MP Chris Bryant, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, questioned if he was a ""fit and proper person to be owning a football club"". Despite criticism, the UAE has also fostered close ties with the UK, which makes any potential intervention difficult. Indeed, in September, the UAE announced a £10bn investment partnership with the UK government on technology, infrastructure, and energy transition. ""The British government actively encourages investment from the Middle East – it has done for a long time,"" Geopolitical Economy of Sport expert Professor Simon Chadwick tells GOAL. ""In terms of business and lucrative sources of revenue, we know that the likes of Saudi Arabia and others spend lots of money on, for instance, weapons. ""Post-Brexit, the British government has obviously had to plug some gaps in terms of trade relationships and inward investment. ""And, over the last two or three years in particular, the British government has really doubled down on its selling in the Gulf region. ""In the main, the relationship is reasonably good without being exceptionally good. There are some issues. ""One thinks particularlyof the scrutiny that the ruling family in Dubai have recently had in the treatment of some of their female family members. ""But there has also been some outcry from Britain regarding the war in Yemen."" A recent meeting between Sheikh Mansour and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad drew comment with a Foreign Office spokesperson saying such meetings ""undermine the prospect"" of peace in Syria, where a civil war has been fought for 11 years. The UAE has also so far remained neutral over Russia's invasion of Ukraine despite pressure from the United States and Europe. ""Whilst the UAE will not want to disaffect Europe and the West, it will equally not want to disaffect Russia either,"" Chadwick adds. ""They're going to hedge and wait and see before they make a decision. ""Whilst we're expecting Abu Dhabi to support Europe and the United States, they've also got to try to protect themselves as well. ""They are acutely aware that literally a matter of tens of miles across the Persian Gulf, they have Iran – a big ally of Russia and also a serial provocateur in the region. ""It's a dangerous part of the world and you can imagine the UAE trying to position themselves as intermediaries in the debate between Russia and the West."" Sport has helped promote UAE on the world stage. Abu Dhabi hosted last year's Cricket World Cup, as well as the engrossing final race of the 2021 Formula One season. Emirati citizens have also played a major role in transforming horse racing in the UK. Football, of course, has been the UAE's most visible marketing tool, with the Dubai government’s Investment Corporation-owned airline Emirates sponsoring Arsenal’s stadium, the FA Cup, Real Madrid and Chelsea amongst others. The City Football Group, in which Silver Lake and China Media Capital now have significant minor shareholdings, has Manchester City as its jewel and contains 10 clubs across the world including a foothold in potentially major markets in New York, China and India. Accusations of 'sportswashing' – the practice of using sport to clean a tarnished reputation or public image – has often been touted as one of the driving factors behind Middle Eastern investment. OFFICIAL: Newcastle United’s Saudi Arabia-backed takeover has been completed 💰 pic.twitter.com/epraQN17ue However, Professor Chadwick believes that financial benefits and an increase in soft power are bigger motivating factors. ""If you look at the national development strategies of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, the national development strategies of these countries are centred upon generating incomes from overseas investment projects,"" he says. ""They are about positioning themselves as important members of the global sporting community, diversifying their economies away from a dependence on oil and gas. ""It's about affecting societal change, for instance, by promoting gender equality through sport. ""It is also about projecting soft power and that's an attractive power because it's essentially about trying to engage overseas audiences with who you are and what you do, and trying to persuade other nations that you want the same things as they do. ""Many people in the Gulf region would see this as soft power projection, not as sportswashing. I think sportswashing is simply a lens through which some nations view what is happening in these countries. ""That lens is obviously one which casts the likes of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia as using sport negatively, for divisive and possibly even destructive reasons. ""I'm not discounting the possibility that this is the case. However, I do think there is more to what is happening in these countries than simply trying to convince the world that they're good guys."" Whatever the truth, one thing is clear: there is now greater scrutiny than ever before on where the money is coming from in English football. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A 32-year-old Saint Petersburg-born forward with 106 international caps to his name was granted a few days of compassionate leave by the Hammers as he struggled to come to terms with Russia’s invasion of his homeland. He played no part in a 1-0 Premier League win over Wolves at the weekend, but could come into contention for an FA Cup fifth-round outing against Southampton on Wednesday if he feels up to making an appearance. West Ham boss Moyes has told reporters when offering an update on Yarmolenko: “Obviously, he's really, really upset with the whole situation, which many people are, especially people from Ukraine, so we won't rush him. “I've asked him to come in today and see how he feels. If he feels fine and up to it, he'll travel with the team. If he doesn’t, we'll give him some more days off. “It's a daily ongoing thing. Things can change very quickly, but we'll give him the chance to go with his own feelings. “He's got lots of family members and friends in Ukraine, and he's worried for everybody. He realises the difficulty that's going on and he's a long way away and can't do a lot about it. He's upset, the boy, and quite rightly so. 💙💛 @Yarmolenko_7 pic.twitter.com/iqU2R3uZo8 “It's a really difficult situation for us as well, because we'd like to offer him more help or more support if we can. “I think it’s the same with the world. I think the world's trying to give Ukraine as much support as they can. All we can hope is that the sanctions, somewhere along the line, start to take their toll on Russia, because none of us want to go to war with any country. “Us personally, with Yarmolenko, we’re trying to deal with him. We’re speaking to him most days. “I have to say the players at the club were great with him yesterday. They were trying to get him back in and integrate him, and make sure he felt really welcome and that we were thinking about him and his family. We just have to try and support him the best we can. “Football is such a powerful tool all around the world. Every country and every continent watches the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, and because of that I think it's really important that we take action and make sure they [Russian teams] are isolated completely. I'm not a politician but that's how I feel about the football side.” We are Ukrainians. We are one. We are defending our land. 🇺🇦We ask your support 🙏🏻#StopWarInUkraine pic.twitter.com/rA0WmmLnZv UEFA and FIFA have started to take decisive action against Russia as political tension boils over in Eastern Europe. Saint Petersburg has been stripped of Champions League final hosting duties, as that fixture is handed to Stade de France in Paris, while Russian national and domestic teams have been suspended from continental and global competition until further notice. West Ham are doing all they can to support Yarmolenko through a testing time for all concerned, but are also aware of the need to avoid any distractions as they look to chase down FA Cup glory in 2022 and a potential top-four finish in the Premier League.

The experienced frontman was granted compassionate leave by the Hammers after political tension in Eastern Europe boiled over into military conflict. He has been eased back into the fold since returning to training at the London Stadium, but was introduced off the bench by David Moyes in a meeting with Villa and marked that appearance with the opening goal of the game. The 32-year-old is among those to have been left concerned for friends and family that have become caught up in the events that have rocked Ukraine. He has, however, made an impressive return to competitive action with the Hammers. In his first appearance since February 5, Yarmolenko was thrown on against Villa to make a telling contribution in the final third. He did just that when collecting a clipped pass from Said Benrahma, spinning inside the penalty area and poking into the bottom corner with his cultured left foot.

""It was so emotional for me because of the situation in my country,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It is so difficult for me right now in this moment thinking about football because every day, the Russian army is killing Ukrainian people. ""To be honest, I don't know what to say.

""I felt the support from the fans and I tried to give everything on the pitch because I know how important the game was for us today. I'm not ready for 100% because the last two weeks I train maybe three or four times. ""Since 26 February, I had to rest for four days because it was impossible to train, I was just thinking about my family and my people. I just tried to give everything on the pitch."" On the goal itself, he continued:""Said gave me the ball. In the box, you don’t have a lot of time and you need to do everything really quick and I was quick enough.

West Ham reached their first European quarter-final since 1981 after beating Sevilla 2-0 after extra-time at London Stadium on Thursday night. David Moyes' side advanced 2-1 on aggregate thanks to Yarmolenko's 112th-minute goal, which sparked emotional scenes of celebration amid his country's ongoing conflict with Russia. Ukraine international Yarmolenko was granted compassionate leave by West Ham following Russia's invasion, and netted his first goal since returning to action in a 2-1 win against Aston Villa on March 13. The Hammers faithful were right behind the 32-year-old once again after his decisive strike against Sevilla, and he was visibly moved as Rice and the rest of his team-mates embraced him. Rice expressed his admiration towards Yarmolenko post-match, telling BT Sport: “Yarmolenko was a little bit emotional away from the lads afterwards. For what he’s been through to perform like this – his desire, the way he chased players and scored. He deserves this. He stepped up. I’m delighted for him.” West Ham have joined Barca, Atalanta, RB Leipzig, Lyon, Braga, Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last eight of this season's Europa League. Barca are favourites to lift the trophy after coming through their round of 16 tie with Galatasaray, and Rice says the Hammers would love the chance to head to Camp Nou. “Me and the guys fancy the Nou Camp, we’ve heard they do some nice paella down there!” the midfielder said when quizzed on his preferred quarter-final opponents. “It would be special to go there and face Barcelona.""

346,https://www.goal.com/en/news/misfiring-man-utd-only-have-themselves-to-blame-after/bltc134cc1b2ee53f1e,Misfiring Man Utd only have themselves to blame after stunning FA Cup exit against Middlesbrough,"Manchester United will point to a ludicrous handball decision for their FA Cup exit but in truth, they only have themselves to blame. Ralf Rangnick’s side are right to feel hard done by. Even with the change to the handball rule in the summer it seemed farcical that Matt Crooks’ goal should have been able to stand after Duncan Watmore handled it in the build-up. It was deemed accidental according to the officials but anyone sitting in the stands at Old Trafford on Friday night could see the Middlesbrough substitute move his left hand towards the ball to control it before passing to Crooks to finish. But Rangnick’s side can only look at themselves as to why they are not in the hat for the fifth-round draw. They should have had the game dead and buried long before it went to extra-time and penalties with teenager Anthony Elanga missing the decisive spot-kick. He was consoled by Cristiano Ronaldo as he walked down the tunnel, with Boro players celebrating alongside their 9,000 travelling supporters. Had the Portugal international not missed his own penalty in the first half, though, it might have been a different story. His effort was wide of the post and for much of the game his presence was a hindrance rather than a help. Dean Henderson, making his first start under Rangnick, could have brought a flask and sleeping bag such was United’s dominance in the first half. They might have been playing against Championship opposition but the home side’s passing and intensity was improved from recent displays and in the first half alone they managed 14 shots, with six of those on target. Paul Pogba’s first appearance since the start of November was positive and Jadon Sancho produced his brightest performance in a United shirt. But it wasn’t enough. Chance after chance went begging. On another day they would have had the tie wrapped up by half-time with Sancho hitting the bar within two minutes, Ronaldo missing a penalty and Marcus Rashford having a goal ruled out by the offside flag – all that before the visitors had even managed a shot. Every chance missed was met with exasperation mainly from Ronaldo, who produced a poor performance. His return to United has sparked many a debate and his display on the eve of his 37th birthday will have done nothing to persuade doubters that it was the right decision. He wasn’t the only one who didn’t deliver. United are a team that needs leadership to get over the line and that was lacking on a rainy evening at Old Trafford. For all their dominance and control in the opening period they were poor in the second half. They were devoid of creativity and ideas, despite their 25 shots on target. The defence has improved under Rangnick but going forward they don’t seem to be gelling in the same way.  The biggest problem for United is that this now, barring a European miracle, they look set to end yet another season without silverware. They are in a top-four battle in the Premier League, out of the Carabao Cup and now out of the FA Cup. Their only chance for a trophy is in the Champions League, where they are drawn with Atletico Madrid in the last 16. A season that started with talk of mounting serious challenges on multiple fronts has reached a point where only one longshot chance of a trophy remains. They can only blame themselves.

""For me to deal with that, deal with stuff that was in the newspapers, deal with the manager at the time, deal with family at the time, was very difficult. ""In my early years at Manchester United, probably until we had my first son, Kai, I locked myself away really. I never went out. ""There were times you'd get a couple of days off from football and I would actually lock myself away and just drink, to try to take all that away from my mind. ""Locking myself away made me forget some of the issues I was dealing with. It was like a binge."" Rooney has said as he's gotten older, he's been able to control his anger and drinking better than in his younger days. 'I was always angry and aggressive when I was growing up. That was obvious when I came into football. It was obvious I had some issues which I had to try and deal with and now, thankfully, I have got them all under control,"" he said. ""My relationship with drink now is fine. No problems. I still have a drink now and again. Not like I used to. Not like when I was playing. It's well in control."" When Rafa Benitez was sacked as Everton head coach last month, Rooney was strongly linked with the job at his boyhood club. But when approached by the Toffees, Rooney rejected a chance to interview for the job. He says that loyalty to his players and staff kept him with the Championship side. ""I have been here now for over three years as player and manager, and you build relationships up with players, first of all as team-mates, then as manager, and with staff,"" Rooney said. ""Everything I am asking of those players in terms of hard work, honesty, trust, commitment … if I was just to turn round and say: 'I have had an offer, I'm off,' I honestly couldn't do that to the players and the staff. ""I could see once Benitez was sacked and my name was getting linked with Everton that the staff were down and they were scared that if I left, where did that leave the club? I know they have been looking to me to try and help rebuild this club. ""I spoke to the staff and said: 'I am stood in front of you and I am with you. Whatever is being said out there, I am with you.' I think that was big for them."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A home game against League One opposition looked like a favourable draw for the Blues, a straightforward assignment ahead of their departure for the Club World Cup. However, it proved anything but easy. Thomas Tuchel may have been missing after testing positive for Covid-19 but Chelsea fielded a full-strength side at Stamford Bridge, with record signing Romelu Lukaku leading the line after a much-needed winter break. However, the £98 million ($136m) man toiled against opposition many would have expected him to dominate. It was just the latest in a series of worryingly poor performances since Lukaku's unsanctioned and controversial interview with Sky Sport Italia. Ultimately, the Belgian was bailed out here by two of the Blues' full-backs, with Cesar Azpilicueta cancelling out Macaulay Gillesphey's shock opener before Marcos Alonso came off the bench to net a 105th-minute winner. Even then, Plymouth could have forced penalties but Kepa Arrizabalaga saved a spot-kick from Plymouth striker Ryan Hardie with just three minutes of extra time to play. Kepa saves a 118th minute penalty to send Chelsea through to the fifth round of the FA Cup 🧤 pic.twitter.com/s7oif9dl7a Both Alonso and Kepa will make headlines for their interventions but much of the post-match focus will undoubtedly fall on Lukaku, who was anonymous for the most part, failing miserably to display any of the attributes that convinced Chelsea to re-sign their former forward over the summer. He never truly threatened to score despite spending all 120 minutes on the field and his contribution was best summed up by a horribly overhit pass to Timo Werner in the final minute of normal time. He ended the match with just two shots to his name and, even more tellingly, having made only 13 touches in the box. This latest blank means that he has now gone five games without a goal and he has only netted against non-league Chesterfield in the third round of the FA Cup since being forced to apologise for the Sky interview. It must be said, though, that he wasn’t the only poor performer against Plymouth. The entire team struggled in the first half despite having had a week to prepare for the game after having the previous week off. Callum Hudson-Odoi was substituted early, Kai Havertz made little impact in his place and the likes of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Mason Mount all failed to truly impose themselves on the game. However, Lukaku remains the biggest issue to resolve in an attack that isn’t clicking. He has had regular minutes and been given a host of different formations to play in, but he continues to flatter to deceive. His poor performances are becoming a major problem for Tuchel. Having not found it easy to work with either Neymar or Kylian Mbappe in his last job at Paris Saint-Germain, the German desperately needs to find a way to get the very best out of Lukaku. Indeed, watching on from home, Tuchel will have felt the same sense of frustration that everyone else in the stadium was experiencing while watching Chelsea's misfiring forward. The Blues boss will know his team's hopes of success this season hinge upon him getting Lukaku scoring goals again because he can't keep relying on full-backs and goalkeepers to get his side out of jail.

With the coronavirus pandemic having led to an adjusted schedule for 2020-21, the FA hastaken the decision to scrap replays in order to ease the pressure on clubs. In a statement released on Thursday, the FA said the decision had been made ""to assist in easing pressure on the football schedule and to ensure that domestic competitions can still be delivered"". Qualificationfor England's major cup competition will begin on September 1, with the first round proper taking place in November. Premier League clubs will enter as usual in the third round, to be played in early January, with the final scheduled for May 15, 2021. Arsenal are the current holders after beating Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley earlier this month. The fourth round has been scheduled for January 23, the fifth on February 10, with the quarter finals set for March 20 and the semis on April 17. The FA also announced that, after record prize funds for the last two seasons, the reward money has gone back to the level it was in 2017-18, due to the financial impact of Covid-19.The winners will receive £1.8 million ($2.3m), down from £3.6m ($4.7m) last season. It has also been announced that the Carabao Cup semi-finals, which have always been two-legged affairs, will be played over a single match in 2020-21, again to ease pressure on clubs due to the compressed schedule. The first round of the League Cup will be played on September 5, with the final slated for February 28. Manchester City have won each of the last three finals. The Premier League will start again on September 12, as will the Championship, League One and League Two, with the final games of the campaign on May 23, 2021. Fixtures will be revealed by August 21 for the 2020-21 season. Players and managers are facing up to the likelihood of a frenetic and exhausting season with long periods of important matches being played in quick succession, and which will be compounded by the re-arranged European Championships next summer, which had to be rescheduled from summer 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It comes after the Ricketts Family Investment Group, which features backing from Citadel Founder Ken Griffin and one of America's richest men Dan Gilbert, has proven unpopular with the club's support. In fact, only three percent of Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) members said they would back the bid led by the owners of the historic Major League Baseball (MLB) team Chicago Cubs. Three other rival billionaire bidders are seeking to secure Chelsea after making their final bids on April 11. ""We have had a memorable few days in London, taking the opportunity to meet as many people as possible from a wide variety of backgrounds,"" Laura Ricketts, who is the face of the bid alongside her brother Tom, said in her first statement. ""Obviously, I can’t comment on talks we had with Chelsea officials because that has to remain confidential. But I can say we had very informative and enjoyable meetings with some passionate fan groups – in particular with Tracy Brown from Chelsea Pride and Kerrie Evans from Chelsea Women Supporters Group. ""We also met Sanjay Bhandari, the Chair of Kick It Out, and it was wonderful to hear about all the work he’s doing. We admire their approach and would like to introduce them to Major League Baseball. ""I was also thrilled to go to the Chelsea Women’s game at the weekend and I flew in early to make the match. It was a joy to see the incredible athletic talent of the Chelsea Women and to also experience the supporters’ amazing energy at Kingsmeadow. ""Much of my life’s work has been about empowering and supporting women, so to see these young women playing at this level was a real treat for me. It was also so great to see all the families who were at the game. ""Sport has such power to bring communities together and family is at the heart of the community. Some of the girls there reminded me of my 11-year-old daughter. For young girls to see the Chelsea Women on the pitch can be inspiring and empowering to them. ""In recent weeks, we’ve also had several valuable conversations with the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust. I appreciate their passion for Chelsea and the important questions they’ve raised. I look forward to continuing the good conversations we’ve begun. ""We all need to be listening and speaking up, and I feel a particular responsibility because of the position I’m in. We’re not going to be able to persuade all the fans right away that we will be good stewards of Chelsea – we’re going to have to show them with meaningful action if we are successful in our bid. ""F*** off the Ricketts, you're not wanted here."" #cfc #NoToRicketts pic.twitter.com/wyd0b04Huo ""But I can assure all Chelsea fans that it has been my life’s work to fight against discrimination and bigotry of any kind. ""Coming out as an LGBTQ+ woman has influenced my perspective and sensitivity about diversity and inclusion. I can’t know what it’s like to walk in another person’s shoes, but I can begin to understand and have an awareness of their different experience. And that’s a gift. In the position that I’m in, I feel a sense of responsibility to be an advocate. To me, being an advocate means speaking up, and also listening. ""When we assumed responsibility for the Chicago Cubs and its legacy, we immediately realised that teams like the Cubs don’t belong to one person or organisation. They belong to the fans. We’re stewards – and we’re answerable to the fans. That’s how we see it in Chicago – and it would be exactly the same at Chelsea. ""There is such power in sport for community building and to bring diverse people together. At Cubs Charities, we have developed our own sport-based youth development programming that engages young people and families in under-served communities. As the Chair of Cubs Charities, I am proud of our work and the impact it has on so many lives. ""Here, the Chelsea Foundation already makes a significant impact and I would hope we could help build on this. We strive to be champions both on and off the field. It’s what makes Chelsea great, and is a tradition we would honour if we were to become the club’s next stewards."" Those close to the process seem to believe that they are among two favourites of the four main options. The Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly is leading a bid that seems to be a strong competitor and it has backing from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and UK investor Jonathan Goldstein. Boehly was pictured at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 3-1 home defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday night. Boston Celtics and Atalanta owner Stephen Pagliuca is trying to buy Chelsea, along with JoshHarrisand DavidBlitzer who own the Philadelphia76ers and a small stake in Crystal Palace.

Kante was subsituted at half-time for the first time in his career on Wednesday night as Chelsea suffered a 3-1 loss against Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Tuchel insisted that the decision was a tactical one post-match, but Kante has struggled to reach his best level throughout the 2021-22 campaign while battling a string of niggling injuries and recovering from Covid-19. Tuchel also thinks a lack of food could be a reason for Kante's inconsistency, with the Frenchman having been observing the celebration of Eid since April 1. As a practising Muslim, Kante is not allowed to eat or drink during daylight hours until Ramadan ends on May 1. Asked whether the demands of top-flight football are catching up with Kante now that he is 31-years-old, Tuchel told a press conference: ""I can honestly not answer the question (whether football is catching up to him). One thing is very clear, N’Golo is a key player with outstanding qualities, unique qualities. For other teams, maybe it is some strikers or central defenders. ""For us it is N’Golo, a unique player who can give something to the team that nobody else can. He struggles this season with consistency due to injuries, due to illness. ""This is also a reason for our bit of inconsistency of course. We missed him for too many matches if you look at the minutes he is available he can play. ""At the moment he is fasting due to his religion, due to his belief. Maybe another reason. He is not doing it for the first time but if you don’t eat during the day for many days it can have an effect. ""He is used to it but yeah, maybe it is also part of the explanation why we had the feeling he is not on his highest level if you compare how much of an influence he was in the last campaign against Real Madrid. ""This is also nothing to be ashamed of or feel sorry for. We try to push him, try to help him because we know what we have when he is on the pitch.” Kante will be available for selection again when Chelsea take in a trip to Southampton on Saturday, but will play on an empty stomach if selected. Muslims are only to permitted to break their fast between 19:30 and 20:30 BST, and the Premier League made allowances for some of the players observing Ramadan last season. In a meeting between Leicester City and Crystal Palace at the King Power Stadium, a pause in play was granted so that Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyate could eat, with an unwritten rule having been put in place allowing team captains to call short breaks before goal kicks or throw-ins. This season, it has once again been agreed that captains can call for similar breaks in play during their pre-match meetings with referees, but only nine of the 52 Premier League matches taking place during Eid are scheduled to kick off after 19:30.

Jarrod Bowen (£6.9m), meanwhile, has returned to action with a bang. The West Ham winger, who missed two league games through injury, has continued his stunning form from the early part of the campaign by scoring in his last two matches in all competitions, delivering 13 FPL points against Everton. Elsewhere, Manchester United should welcome back Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.2m) for their clash with Everton on Saturday. The Portuguese missed the 1-1 draw with Leicester City through illness but has since returned to training. As for team news from the huge title showdown between Manchester City and Liverpool, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp has claimed he has a fully-fit squad to choose from, while it appears Pep Guardiola's only absentee is Ruben Dias (£6.1m). Thomas Tuchel, meanwhile, is likely to ring the changes for Chelsea's clash with Southampton following the Blues' dismal display in their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid. The likes of Timo Werner (£8.6m) and Romelu Lukaku (£11.4m) could come back in, with Kai Havertz (£7.9m) being the only one to make a significant positive impact at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, and he may well be rested with the second leg on the horizon. Return to top Player Return date Allan (Everton) April 9 (vs Man Utd) Michael Keane (Everton) April 9 (vs Man Utd) Raul Jimenez (Wolves) April 24 (vs Burnley) Return to top Mohamed Salah (£13.3m) blanked... again! In fact, Liverpool's star man has just one return, a goal against Brighton, from his last four Premier League matches, which may tempt FPL bosses to pick an alternative captain in Gameweek 32. In-form Tottenham forward Heung-Min Son (£11m) could be a better option this weekend, especially given the difficulty of Salah's fixture against Manchester City. The South Korea international will come up against Aston Villa (A) in Gameweek 32 and has produced 27 points from his last two matches, with three goals, an assist and a total of five bonus points. It would be fair to summarise Cornet's first season in England as 'up and down', with the Ivorian looking absolutely unplayable in some games and completely off it in others. That said, seven goals for a struggling Burnley side isn't a bad return and with Norwich up next, coming off the back of his goal and assist against Everton, it seems a sensible decision to bring him in. Eriksen's heroics against Chelsea proved, if there was any doubt, that he's capable of producing his best form at the highest level, with fixtures against West Ham (H) and Watford (A) having the potential to yield more points. At £5.5m, Eriksen is reasonably priced and has a better chance of a return than other midfielders priced at a similar level, including the likes of Demarai Gray and Rodri. It feels strange to single out De Bruyne as a differential pick but, at the time of writing, the Manchester City midfielder is still only owned by around 8% of all FPL managers. Bringing in the Belgian would be more of a long-term investment for the season run-in, and, if you're feeling particularly brave, he may even represent a better option than Salah, having returned 32 points across his last three league appearances.

The Red Devils are out of the Champions League and face an uphill battle to clinch qualification for next year's competition, having been forced to change their manager midway through the term. Their travails are in stark contrast to Shaw's experiences with England, who are gearing up for the World Cup this year after an almost flawless qualifying campaign. “It’s always important to feel like you’re wanted and I think especially here I always feel that,"" Shaw told Sky Sports after England's 2-1 victory over Switzerland on Saturday, where he netted just before half-time to equalise for the Three Lions. ""I’m not saying I don’t at United but here, the way things are, I feel wanted and I enjoy my football. And I think a big part of football is the enjoyment. “Of course it’s hard to enjoy when we’re losing and we’re not playing well at club level and we have to face that. ""This season it’s not been good enough at all so it’s hard to enjoy. We know we’ve got a lot to improve at the club but obviously right now we’re here with England so I’m focusing on that."" Shaw, 26, made his England debut back in 2014 and has gone on to make 20 appearances for the nation, scoring on two occasions. In spite of United's struggles the full-back has enjoyed a welcome return to form at Old Trafford recently, though he was forced to sit out their defeats to Manchester City and Atletico Madrid due to a bout of Covid-19.

Uncertainty reigns in west London following sanctions imposed on Blues owner Roman Abramovich by the UK government, with the Russian billionaire having his assets frozen and is prevented from investing any further funds in the Premier League club or benefiting financially from them. No new deals can be agreed at present, meaning that extension talks are off the table, but Euro 2020 winner Jorginho could enter into discussions if a takeover of the club goes through. The 30-year-old’s representative, Joao Santos, told Calciomercato: ""We have a contract with Chelsea until 2023 and it is a particular moment for the club, where there are no negotiations, also because the market is blocked both in entry and in exit. If the situation unfolds, the priority will be to deal with the renewal.” While there is willingness from Jorginho and his agent to discuss a new contract with Chelsea, an exit is not being disregarded entirely, and a return to Serie A for the former Napoli star has been speculated for some time. Jorginho moved to England in 2018, as he followed Maurizio Sarri to Stamford Bridge, and has claimed Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup honours. The plan is to enjoy more success with the Blues, but Santos has confirmed that an option to head for Turin remains. He said: “I haven't talked to Juve, but I know of their interest in Jorginho. Should Chelsea fail to renew their contract, then we will listen to all the teams involved.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues have brought the 26-year-old to Stamford Bridge after a turbulent and protracted day of talks that saw the deal described as 'dead' and then subsequently revived. In fact, Thomas Tuchel's side left it so late, they only completed the deal sheet for the Spain international with two minutes to go before the transfer deadline. The loan move comes after Tuchel requested that the Blues add another midfielder to compete with N'Golo Kante, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic. Saul has long been considered thebest solution, with the loan giving the Bluesa chance to 'try before they buy' as they did with Kovacic from Real Madrid. The moveis hoped to rekindle the Spain international's best form after an underwhelming season last year despite Atleti winning the league. It is understood that Tuchel allowed the club to send Ethan Ampadu out on loan to Venezia when herealised the Blueswould bring another player into their squad. That deal for the 21-year-old Wales international included a three-year contract renewal which shows just how much his parent club values him. ""The only negative was not playing in my position [at Atletico],"" Saul said after the move was announced in an interview with Ibai Llanos on Twitch. ""I could not show what I would like. I had a block in my head that did not allow me to play in another role. Chelsea's option was to leave my comfort zone. It won't be easy to get into that team.""At Chelsea I will train in my position. Then we will see if I play. That is the biggest cause of my decision.""I want to go to Chelsea, try the experience and then see what happens. I don't want to think further. I want to go, compete and help Chelsea. ""Personally, I want to go back to being the Saul that I want to see. I don't want to see the Saul that you've seen these last two years. I was very frustrated not being able to show people what I am capable of."" Sevilla's director of football Monchi explained that Chelsea's approach for Jules Kounde failed because the club did not meet Sevilla's valuation. The Blues had made an offer that fell short of theLiga club's asking price and they declined to come in with an improvedbid, missing Sevilla's deadline in the process. Chelsea sent Ampadu on loan to Venezia, Thierno Ballo to Rapid Vienna, Dujon Sterling to BlackpoolandTino Anjorin to Lokomotiv Moscow, but saw Malang Sarr's loan to Greuther Furth collapse. Furthermore, Tuchel told Callum Hudson-Odoi that he had to stay at Stamford Bridge despite a loan bid from Borussia Dortmund. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has opted to stay despite being on the fringes of the squad. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Kane went into the clash at Wembley with 48 international strikes, one behind the legendary World Cup winner and Manchester United idol. Now, only Wayne Rooney sits ahead of the striker in the Three Lions all-time rankings. Kane struck with 78 minutes on the clock to seal victory for England. The friendly at that point was poised at 1-1, with Luke Shaw hitting home just before half-time to cancel out Breel Embolo's early opener. The Spurs ace then made no mistake from the penalty spot to put England ahead, sealing the full-time scoreline of 2-1 in the hosts' favour. As well as earning his side a win as their World Cup preparations begin in earnest, Kane also tied with Charlton on 49 in England colours. Rooney sits at the top of the list with 53, just four goals ahead of the 28-year-old. Kane's goals have proved crucial for England in their last two encouraging performances at major finals. The forward netted six goals at the 2018 World Cup and won the tournament's Golden Boot as the Three Lions reached the semi-finals, while he added another four at Euro 2020 last year to fall just short in the decider against Italy - and he is aware that even more will be expected from the side at Qatar. “There’s definitely an expectation on us now. The final from the summer still hurts, it still leaves a bitter taste in the mouth so for sure it gives you more hunger andfirein the belly to go one step further in a major tournament,"" he explained in the build-up to Saturday's clash. “It feels like we are improving every year and this year is no different. We are really taking big strides into becoming one of the best teams in the history of the England national team. “There’s lots of great teams. From Europe you have France, Germany, Spain. In South America you have Brazil, Argentina, top nations who have been there or thereabouts in World Cups for many many years. “As we have learned over the last couple of campaigns there are no easy games. Every game for England is a tough one and we have to make sure we are ready for that.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

De Bruyne has lived up to his billing as one of the most talented players of his generation since moving to Etihad Stadium from Wolfsburg 2015, putting a disappointing early-career spell at Chelsea firmly behind him. The midfielder has also been a key player for Belgium at international level, most notably spearheading their run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, and Martinez doesn't think there is any other player that boasts the same skillset. De Bruyne has already won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and four League Cups with City at club level, and is on course to land even more silverware this season. Martinez, who has worked with the 30-year-old for the past six years at international level, believes he is now at his peak. ""Kevin De Bruyne is probably a very unusual player,"" The Belgium manager has told EFE. ""We are used to seeing the player who executes that final pass, who has the great vision of the game, we always think that these players need their time to execute the actions, but Kevin De Bruyne he does it the other way around, he accelerates the tempo of the game. ""He is a creative player very different from what we understand, with great technical capacity, but above all because of the vision he has for spaces and finding the time to give the ball. ""He is now in a team that fights for everything, is in the best moment of his sports career. It is very difficult to find another player who can give that role to another team."" Martinez also discussed another of Belgium's talismanic figures in Eden Hazard, who has endured a dramatic fall from grace since joining Real Madrid from Chelsea in 2009. The 31-year-old has only scored once in 22 games for Madrid in 2021-22 as he continues to struggle with niggling fitness problems, but his international head coach hasn't lost faith in him yet. ""We need Eden Hazard,"" said Martinez. ""We haven't lost him at international level. At club level he doesn't have the relevance or the important role that he has always given to clubs, but his goal is still to be important for the team and help the team. ""Eden is a person who is very clear and rational, he doesn't have an ego that blinds him to what he wants to do. But at the national team level, he is our captain and we fully trust him.""

358,https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-man-city-premier-league-champions-closing-star/blt338183272884c2bf,Haaland to Man City: Premier League champions closing in on the star striker Guardiola craves,"Erling Haaland can't do anything right now without it being interpreted as a sign of which club he will join next. A medical trip to Munich prompted reports of a meeting with Barcelona boss Xavi, while liking an Instagram post about the Santiago Bernabeu sparked talk of a move to Real Madrid. Even eating homemade caramel while watching Manchester City increased speculation of a summer switch to the Etihad Stadium. It's certainly not easy being one of the most sought-after strikers on the market, then – every tiny gesture comes under intense scrutiny. The interest is understandable, of course. It's not just because Haaland is one of the most prolific players on the planet. He's also going to become available for what looks like a bargain €75 million (£62m/$81m), with the release clause in his Borussiad Dortmund contract set to come into play this summer – even if agents fees and a signing-on bonus will make the final cost of acquiring Haaland far higher. Nearly every elite European club has joined the race for the 21-year-old's signature but City are emerging as the frontrunner. Madrid remain in the hunt, but they are also pursuing Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe, while Barcelona's delicate financial situation means that a move to Camp Nou remains unlikely, even if Blaugrana boss Xavi has not ruled it out just yet. Erling Haaland is FLYING ✈️ pic.twitter.com/MIHhKruol5 Opportunity knocks for City, then, and they have been pushing hard to make the Haaland transfer happen, with Pep Guardiola keen to add a striker with a killer instinct to his well-drilled team. Executives are believed to have met the Norwegian's representatives recently, although the club are remaining cautious, with high-profile transfers always complicated. A year ago, for example, they were confident that they could complete a deal for Harry Kane only for Tottenham to refuse to sell even though the England international wanted to move to Manchester. This time around, of course, the buyout clause means the selling club will not prove a stumbling block. The only challenge is convincing Haaland that the Etihad is the right destination for him. Although money is obviously relevant, personal preference is key, which is why the opportunity to work under a transformative coach like Guardiola is a major selling point. The City boss has a proven track record of improving already-great players, while the prospect of winning plenty of silverware should certainly appeal to Haaland, who has won just a single DFB-Pokal with Dortmund, who were also knocked out at the group stage of this season's Champions League. Guardiola's awkward relationship with Haaland's agent Mino Raiola is not thought to be a major issue, despite some harsh words exchanged in public between the pair in the past, particularly concerning Zlatan Ibrahimovic's time under the Catalan coach at Camp Nou. Meanwhile, Haaland's father Alfie spent three seasons at City during his playing days, and he and Yorkshire-born Erling often attended matches throughout his childhood. Manchester City have 'a deal in place' to sign Erling Haaland this summer, The Daily Mail reports 👀 pic.twitter.com/2RXdXnnm7i With salary demands expected to be similar to some of City's highest earners, everything would appear to be in place for a move to go through. Signing Haaland would be a major coup and despite being very successful without a striker, the club are desperate for a natural predator to lead their attack. Last season's Premier League title success and run to the Champions League final was achieved largely without Sergio Aguero, who was plagued by injury and illness issues, and the Argentine's subsequent exit has hardly affected them at all this term. However, it was not Guardiola's intention to go through another season without being able to regularly call upon an orthodox centre forward. Even after the Kane move fell through, there was interest in Cristiano Ronaldo before his return to Manchester United but it came to nothing. Ultimately, City decided against buying an inferior striker for the sake of it, but it has left Guardiola having to come up with workarounds, even if they are proving highly effective. “The club needs a striker, definitely. I don’t agree with [people] saying we play fantastically well without a striker just because we are winning,” Guardiola said ahead of last week's Manchester derby. “When we are not winning, you say we need a striker, that I’m naive. 'How do these guys play without a striker?' The sound of Erling Haaland hitting a volley 😱pic.twitter.com/ZijtADcDtd ""The club is going to try, it hasn’t happened yet but, in the end, we adapt and never complain. “With a striker, we play in a different way but if you don’t have one, you have to adapt with the quality that we have. ""If you don’t have one you have to play in a completely different way to United, Southampton, Liverpool, because they play another philosophy. In England, we are a little bit like an exception in that.” City have already moved to ensure the situation won't happen again by signing Argentina international Julian Alvarez from River Plate in January, and he will join up with the squad in the summer, although he could yet go out on loan. However, after 80 goals in 79 appearances for Dortmund, Haaland remains the priority target and it is hoped that a decision will be made soon, with sources telling GOAL that his next move could be confirmed in the next few weeks. After the summer-long saga involving Kane ultimately ended in frustration, an early agreement for Haaland would be such a pleasing contrast. Even more importantly though, this slick City side with Haaland up front would be an even more intimidating force than they already are. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues welcome the Magpies amid increased scrutiny over their ownership, with the former's sale by long-term owner Roman Abramovich currently frozen by the UK government amid sanctions relating to the Ukraine-Russia crisis., and the latter bought by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund earlier this season. Those off-field issues have given rise to the suggestion that neither side will be the pick for punters watching this weekend - but speaking ahead of the game, Tuchel says that he is more driven to delivering the result than mulling over what others think. ""Maybe [neutrals want no one to win] but I don't care, I want us to win,"" Tuchel stated. ""I tell you it will be a difficult one because Newcastle is strong, very, very strong. It's a different Newcastle and they produce a lot of results. So I'm expecting a very, very tough game. ""Sorry, but I don't care so much what the neutral spectators think about who should win. I think in the end, everybody wants to be excited to watch games and want to be entertained and this is what we're up to. ""In the moment we try to have the focus right and tried to have the attitude right and the guys do this in a very impressive way and we need it on Sunday."" The latest round of sanctions against Abramovich has left Chelsea in an unprecedented bind, though a sale of the club looks likely to be allowed to progress if a buyer can be found. Billionaire Nick Candy remains interested in the Blues, who shrugged off their off-pitch woes with an easy win over Norwich on Thursday. Newcastle likewise continued their rise from the relegation battle under Eddie Howe with a win against Southampton. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

360,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-fans-warned-stop-chanting-roman-abramovich-putin/blt53d3d06ada9afc12,Chelsea fans warned by MP to stop chanting for Roman Abramovich due to 'Putin's barbaric acts',"Chelsea supporters once again showed their support to sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich during a 3-1 win at Norwich, with technology minister Chris Philp urging Blues followers to reconsider their actions given the “barbaric acts” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The UK government is taking decisive action against those that boast ties to a regime in Eastern Europe that has invaded neighbouring Ukraine and generated widespread condemnation. Abramovich is being prevented from making any money out of his British enterprises as a result of the restrictions being imposed – with talk of a sale at Stamford Bridge being put on hold – but those that have seen their club win 21 trophies during his reign in west London continue to back the billionaire’s cause. Chelsea fans have taken to chanting Abramovich’s name before Premier League fixtures, despite the 55-year-old being linked to Putin while also trying to find a buyer, and those indulging in such actions are being asked to reassess their behaviour. Philp told BBC Radio Four’s Today Programme: “I’m a football fan myself, I’m a [Crystal] Palace fan, in south London. So I understand why fans are very attached to their football clubs. “But Roman Abramovich is someone who has been sanctioned now, yesterday morning, for his very close links to Vladimir Putin and the Putin regime. “And I just say respectfully to the Chelsea fans, I know he’s done a lot for the club, but the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and what the Russian regime are doing to civilians - shelling maternity hospitals and shooting civilians who are fleeing down humanitarian corridors - and that is more important than football. “And I say that as a football fan myself, and I would just ask them to keep that in mind.” He added when pressed further on the Abramovich saga, which has led to Chelsea being unable to sell match tickets while also closing their club shop and losing a deal with shirt sponsors Three: “I understand why Chelsea fans have some affection for him but, when the regime he is associated with is committing atrocities, that is more important than football. “So I would ask them to think very carefully before doing that [chanting] again because the barbaric acts of the Putin regime which Abramovich has supported is far more important than football.” Chelsea can be sold, as long as Roman Abramovich or the Russian Federation doesn't benefit from the sale.Chelsea are in dialogue with the UK government discussing what to do next. pic.twitter.com/3upNw3pQeS Chelsea, who remain in the hunt for a top-four finish alongside bids for Champions League and FA Cup glory this season, are due to be back in Premier League action on Sunday. Newcastle are next on the agenda for the Blues, in what will be a first home outing for the club since Abramovich saw his assets frozen. Chelsea have at least four more outings at Stamford Bridge to come after that, with the club being informed that there are ways in which ticketing restrictions can be lifted if they apply for the right licences and can prove that Abramovich stands to benefit in no way.

361,https://www.goal.com/en/news/reyna-lost-something-usmnt-wonderkid-injury-nightmare/blt3d8c4d7d5cca908e,‘Reyna has lost something’ - USMNT wonderkid facing fight to rediscover best form after injury nightmare,"In a parallel universe, this would have been the season that Gio Reyna became a true star. This could have been the year that Reyna truly made the leap from promising talent to superstar, joining Erling Haaland as a second glistening diamond in the Borussia Dortmund attack. This could also have been the year that he solidified the title of being indispensable for the U.S. men's national team as they march towards the 2022 World Cup. But there is no other world. This is not Spider-Man or Doctor Strange in some fancy multiverse. Unfortunately for Reyna, the world that exists is one that has seen him forced to watch his way through what has essentially been a lost season so far. But that is the key part of all of this: so far. This season is not over, and Reyna could yet come up big for Dortmund in the final months of the campaign, starting on Thursday. Having recently made his return from a five-month injury lay off, Reyna could find himself in the line up when Dortmund face Rangers in the first leg of their Europa League play-off at Signal-Iduna Park. Though the 19-year-old missed Sunday's win over Union Berlin through illness, he has shown no signs of the hamstring injury he picked up in early September returning, and as such should be in Marco Rose's thinking for the tie. Playing against the Scottish champions would be a special for Reyna, too, as Rangers are managed by a man very close to him: Giovani van Bronckhorst, the former Netherlands star. Van Bronckhorst, perhaps best remembered for his stunning goal against Uruguay in the 2010 World Cup semi-finals, is a former team-mate of Reyna's father, Claudio. And it is Van Bronckhorst after whom Reyna is named, such is the bond between his father and the man who has replaced Steven Gerrard in the Ibrox dugout. Playing this game is certainly not where Dortmund expected to be. The German giants are not accustomed to playing on Thursdays or featuring in the Europa League, but after a frustrating Champions League exit, both Reyna and BVB have the opportunity to make the best of a bad situation. Dortmund's problems this season can be traced all the way back to Reyna's injury, which came about during the USMNT's first World Cup qualifiers of the 2021-22 season. It has ruled him out for the rest of the USMNT's CONCACAF run so far, although Gregg Berhalter's side has managed well with the likes of Christian Pulisic, Brendan Aaronson and Tim Weah on the wing. Dortmund have not been so lucky, though. Without Reyna, Dortmund bungled their Champions League group-stage campaign, finishing third behind Ajax and Sporting C.P.. In the league, they sit second behind Bayern Munich, but are six points back from the nine-time defending champions and recently lost 5-2 at home to third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. If they are to compete with Bayern or make a run deep into the Europa League, Dortmund will need Haaland to continue to play at an otherworldly level. But they will also need Reyna to step up to become Haaland's chief attacking partner, the creator needed to help take the forward line to another level. Before his injury, Reyna was starting to show glimpses. Given Dortmund's No.7 jersey that was previously worn by Jadon Sancho, this was the year that Reyna was expected to replace the now-Manchester United star. In just five appearances, he provided two goals and an assist to start the season, showing that he was more than ready for a prominent role and more responsibility going forward. But that hope was short-lived, as Reyna was struck down so early in what could have been his breakout campaign. And so, in the words of Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc told, the return of Reyna is a major lift to the Dortmund team, the best midseason present the club could ask for. He told Ruhr Nachrichten in January: “Gio is almost like a new signing for the second half of the season. “He had an excellent start to the season in the summer and unfortunately we missed him for a long time. “In a 4-3-3, he has already played very well. He can help us in midfield as a No.8, and also on the wing, although he's not a classic winger and tends to move into the centre from there. “He is characterised by his very fine sense of which spaces he has to move into and where he can turn up between the opposing lines. The further up the field he plays, the more dangerous he becomes.” Still, it is not all good news. Having missed several months of action, Reyna is still nowhere near full fitness. Heading into Thursday's game, he has made just one appearance, coming off the bench the final 30 minutes of that Leverkusen loss. Even before his comeback, Dortmund coach Rose admitted that Reyna will need time to rediscover what he once was before focusing on what he could be. ""Gio Reyna is on the right track overall, but of course, he has lost something over time,"" he told reporters in January. ""We have to get him playable and fit to play."" That, potentially, could truly begin on Thursday. With Haaland likely to miss out through an injury of his own, this could be Reyna's chance to assert himself, to show that he is truly back. And this could be Dortmund's chance to show that they still have plenty to play for this season, both in the Europa League and in the Bundesliga. This does not have to be a lost season for Dortmund or Reyna. If the youngster can stay fit, and if Haaland gets back to his best, the German giants can still turn this into a campaign to remember.

362,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-worlds-best-nxgn-wonderkids-flocking-bundesliga/blt00f900015584223f,Why are the world's best NXGN wonderkids flocking to the Bundesliga?,"There is an old adage that says once is a fluke, twice is a coincidence and three times is a trend. Well, what happens when that trend goes way beyond three? What happens when something happens dozens and dozens of times with no sign of stopping? The continued rise of young stars in the Bundesliga is way beyond trend or coincidence. Rather, this rise is based on a mindset, one that has made Germany the home of the world's top footballing talents for the better part a decade. Players from all over the world continue to flock to the country, and it shows no sign of stopping, as new starlets arive every year, hoping to become football's next big name. Gone are some stars of yesteryear, players like Jadon Sancho, Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz. Soon, we will likely see some, like Erling Haaland, make their own megamoves too. But talent development has become a key part of Germany's football culture, a pillar for a league that continues to do things its own way. One look at the NXGN 2022 list of football's best wonderkids shows Germany's influence on the wonderkid front. Just @BellinghamJude and the NXGN trophy 🏆 pic.twitter.com/EIeaNmTeya This year's award winner, Jude Bellingham, was a player that opted for Borussia Dortmund over Premier League suitors, knowing that a stint in Germany would allow him to reach a different level. Fourth-placed Jamal Musiala made a similar choice, leaving Chelsea, and England, for Germany, joining giants Bayern Munich with hopes of becoming a world-class player. And then there is second-placed Florian Wirtz, a homegrown star of the future whose ranking means that the Bundesliga is currently home to three of the top four teenagers in world football. In total, the Bundesliga is home to five of this year's top 10 NXGN stars, with a further four of the top 50 scattered across German clubs. Of players to have appeared in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues this season, five of the six youngest play in the Bundesliga. Of the eight youngest, only Mathys Tel of Rennes and Luka Romero of Lazio are not plying their trade in Germany. The average age of Bundesliga players this season is just under 26, with France's Ligue 1 the only other league hitting that mark. Seria A's average age is just under 27, with the Premier League and La Liga just over the same number. Once again, this is not a coincidence or a trend. It is the result of a carefully-crafted effort from German clubs, from the top of the league right down to the bottom. Right now, the best example of that effort is Dortmund. Over the last decade, no club has developed talent quite like the Westfalenstadion outfit, allowing them to become the true launching pad of the game's next top stars. ⭐️ JB x JS ⭐️#NXGN pic.twitter.com/3HabGNyeWZ Bellingham, Haaland, Pulisic, Sancho, Ousmane Dembele, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Gio Reyna, Robert Lewandowski... the list goes on and on. All were players brought in from outside of Germany's borders, and all have emerged as stars of the future and, ultimately, the present. That is not an accident, but rather a key part of the club's philosophy. Dortmund are not bank-rolled by a mega-rich owner like Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain, and nor do they have the money or legacy of clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid or domestic rivals Bayern. And so their pivot to youth over a decade ago was made partly out of necessity, as they needed to adapt to the ever-changing landscape at the top of the European game. But it was not just about a need, but also a culture. as Dortmund prides itself on being a club that does right by everyone who comes through the door. ""It's part of our DNA that we definitely won't be able to hire the big stars, but that we will educate the young stars, that we will build stars,"" says Dortmund managing director, Carsten Cramer, tells GOAL. ""And if you do this in such a sustainable and credible way for 10-15 years, and if everyone knows that's the only alternative in order to be competitive, I'm very sure that the players think that Dortmund is the right place. ""Another reason for it could be that we are not in a capital city like London or Paris. Dortmund is a calm place. You can take your time. We have an Under-23s team and we have perfect youth coaching as well. ""So even if the players won't make the step into the first team, they know that they will be watched and observed in the second team and then the youth team."" He adds: ""It is still one of our reputations: that Dortmund is one club where young players can make a career, where the club is really concerned and care about the players, but, which is I guess most important, where the players have with, a kind of high probability, a real chance to become part of the squad."" It's not just Dortmund, though, even if they are leading the charge. Top young talent is spread throughout the league, from Musiala at Bayern right to the bottom of the table. Bundesliga representing in the NXGN 2022 list:8. Youssoufa Moukoko4. @JamalMusiala 2. Florian Wirtz1. @BellinghamJude That's 4 ballers in the top 8. Levels 🏆 pic.twitter.com/sF2rfoonkk Just this winter, Augsburg, a team battling relegation, spent €18 million (£15m/$20m) to make Ricardo Pepi the club's record signing. Pepi, who ranks 10th on the NXGN 2022 list, was brought in not just for the future, but for the present as the club battles relegation. It is a lot to pin on a teenager's shoulders, but that sort of thing is routine in a league filled with clubs that have learned how to balance big tests with the right amount of leeway. Like most young stars, Pepi faced a choice. He was wanted by clubs all over the world, but he chose the Bundesliga and, ultimately, a struggling club like Augsburg, because he believed it gave him the best chance to take his game as far as he can in the next few years. Some see it as a move before the move, much like Bellingham's decision to play at Dortmund before likely returning to a top Premier League side, but Pepi believes he can find a home in Germany for the foreseeable future. ""I want to be able to succeed in this league,"" Pepi said in February, ""and it's where everyone wants to come and play. In America, every single player wants to come play in the Bundesliga. ""I wouldn't say it's a stepping stone, but it's a great league to be in. If I stay here for five years, I wouldn't mind playing at this high level."" His point was echoed by another American, Joe Scally, who made the move from NYCFC to Borussia Monchengladbach in 2020, before earning a more regular role in the first team this season. ""They give young players a chance,"" Scally said, reflecting on his own decision to head to Germany. ""If they see them make a mistake, it's not going to wreck your career, you'll get another chance. ""I think that's been shown, that's been proven and, for American players, every single player that has come here as basically has done well for themselves."" For players, the allure of the Bundesliga is obvious. For English speakers like Bellingham, Sancho, Pepi and Scally, it is a country that is very culturally friendly. Most players do learn German, but there is plenty of English spoken around the clubs, making adaptation easier. Like Scally said, the Bundesliga is not a league that is as unforgiving as, say, the Premier League, where the combination of internal and external pressures have ruined many talented players. But it's also no cakewalk, as players will regularly face off with several of the world's top teams. It is just that the league is a bit more welcoming than others at its level. Players are nurtured and not discarded. They are treated like projects that will have ups and downs, not like replaceable pieces on a neverending conveyor belt of transfers. But this approach is also great for the clubs themselves. Players like Dembele, Pulisic and Sancho got their starts in Germany and left Dortmund for massive fees. So too have Premier League stars like Roberto Firmino, Heung-min Son Ibrahima Konate, Naby Keita and Granit Xhaka, all of whom moved to the Bundesliga at a young age before being sold for a massive profit. For many clubs - basically all aside from Bayern - this is the only way of doing business and staying sustainable. Find talent, develop talent, sell talent: that's the easiest way to keep afloat in a sport that constantly pushes the envelope when it comes to spending. The Bundesliga is at a higher level than, say, the Eredivisie, a league that has long been famous for developing attacking talent, in particular. And the Bundesliga has money to spend, just not Premier League money. With that, the league can find a happy medium, bringing in the best young players just before they are actually ready to become stars. ""We have to be a bit more creative. We have to look for other solutions,"" says Cramer. ""We don't have that much money. We are not owned by any investor or owned by any government like some of the Premier League clubs. We have to earn our money by ourselves, which means we don't have that much more money than others, and then you have to be creative. ""It's sometimes easier and, of course, also cheaper to develop young players to stars than to buy stars for a high fee and high salary when they are almost at the end of their career. That's the reason why we decided to choose a different approach. ""We collected the experiences over the last 10 to 15 years that this approach is successful, talking about the sporting targets and not only the business targets. That's the reason that we think it will be the right approach."" There is a third piece to this puzzle aside from the players and the clubs: the coaches. It is the coaches who are truly in charge of a player's development. They pick the line up, design the training sessions and choose who to trust with what and when. If coaches are not on board, if they are constantly fearing for their job or if they decide to put the present over the future, the whole plan crumbles. But German football is littered with coaches that find themselves in a similar scenario to the players they manage. They are often plucked from obscurity and nurtured themselves, with several going on to manage at the top level. It was not so long ago that Jurgen Klopp rose from unknown to one of the top managers in the world in his home country. Thomas Tuchel was once a youth coach charged with developing Mario Gomez and Holger Badstuber. Ralf Rangnick built RB Leipzig and its sister clubs around a system designed to make the most out of young stars. ""I think that the Bundesliga is a very, very competitive league,"" said Stuttgart boss Pellegrino Matarazzo, who manages Wahid Faghir, the 18-year old starlet hailed as the next Zlatan Ibrahimovic who also appears on the NXGN 2022 list. ""There's a good balance between technicality, tactics and physicalness. I think it's a good stage for young players to develop. ""I think it's also important that coaches are bold enough to play young players if they're ready. And I think we see a lot of young coaches as well developing in the Bundesliga who are bold enough to play young players."" Germany's focus on tomorrow's stars is not going anywhere. It is ingrained in the country's football culture, much like cheap tickets, the 50+1 rule, hometown fan culture and beer in the stands. Clubs like Dortmund will continue to set the tone, and players like Bellingham will continue to prove that the Bundesliga is a league where future stars can reach unimagined heights. ""If you see Jude Bellingham representing Dortmund, I would say, not only talking about his abilities in football, I’d say he's a perfect fit for what Dortmund is representing and looking for,"" Cramer concludes. ""That's the reason that I'm convinced that there is no real serious alternative to this approach."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

363,https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-pepi-big-boys-transfer-friedel-january/blt5a96ee208f7a2c10,USMNT star Pepi told what he needs from 'big boys' transfer as Friedel backs January switch,"Ricardo Pepi has become one of the hottest prospects in world football and a much sought-after talent that teams across Europe have their eye on heading towards the January transfer window. At just 18 years of age, the United States international has already made quite the name for himself, with it looking increasingly likely that MLS side FC Dallas will have to sanction a sale in the new year. USMNT legend Brad Friedel is among those to have watched Pepi’s development to this point with excitement and believes it is only a matter of time before he graces a bigger club stage. Friedel, speaking to GOAL in association with sports betting site Betway US, said of Pepi: “He burst onto the scene and he has the ability to play in most countries in Europe because of his style. “He is big, he’s strong, he has got some pace, good feet, good finisher, so you could see him in the Premier League, in the Bundesliga, you could see him playing in Holland, in Spain and Italy. It seems like he could adapt to any league. “Watching him, it seems like he has got just about everything and now needs all the experiences and games, needs to play with and against the best in the world to really see where the ceiling is.” Pressed further on whether the winter window presents Pepi with a perfect opportunity in which to take a next step, Friedel added: “It’s the right time for MLS, whether it’s the right time for a European club, I don’t know. “That’s one of the down sides to the MLS windows, that the better transfer market is coming up now in the winter because the season finishes. In the summer, teams don’t like to sell their best players. “For MLS, yes, it’s best to do the deal now. For European clubs, do they have budgets and do they want to have somebody now because it’s in January? Perhaps a country like Germany might be best suited that has more of an extended winter break and are used to having changes in the middle of winter and it’s easier to bring in new players. “If MLS ended their season in the summer, then I would say that he will be going in the summer window. I would assume that he is going to go in the January window, but we will have to wait and see what European club will take him in January.” There has been plenty of speculation regarding Pepi’s next move, with the youngster making it clear that he sees himself gracing the very highest level at Chelsea or Real Madrid at some stage. Friedel would not be against such a leap being made, but would want loan guarantees to be included in any deal for a player that needs to be getting regular game time. The former Liverpool, Blackburn and Tottenham goalkeeper said: “He needs to go somewhere he is going to play. He could sign for one of the big boys as long as he goes on loan to ensure that he is going to play. Playing is where you are going to learn the most. “There are a lot of good landing spots for him. It doesn’t have to be Germany but there have been a lot of successful, especially young players, that have gone to Germany. “It’s all about what the deal is and where the kid wants to go. I don’t know what his mentality is but there are some wonderful clubs in Germany that would be fantastic stepping stones for him.” On Pepi’s comments regarding European superpowers and whether he will scale those heights in time, Friedel added: “As long as he’s managed properly. “I would probably steer him away from those kind of comments until he is actually there and training every day with these players, because it is different when you’re over there and you get to see exactly how good a lot of players are. You get to see how good a lot of players that are unknown to you are. There is a long conveyor belt of talent in Europe.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

364,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pepi-not-feeling-pressure-despite-difficult-start-augsburg/blt4c3479d9c2633c60,"'If it were easy, everyone would do it' - USMNT ace Pepi dealing with difficult start to life at Augsburg","Throughout the course of a 30-minute roundtable with media, Ricardo Pepi keeps repeating one word: risk. He brings it up when talking about his decision to move to relegation-threatened Augsburg – despite offers from teams higher up in the European ladder. He uses it to describe the Bavarians' club-record €18 million (£15m/$20m)investment in his services. And he says it's a part of his outlook on life. No risk, no reward, he says, adding that the only way to truly win big is to go out on a limb. It's early days but, nearly two months into his Bundesliga career, we've seen the downsides of that risk. Both Augsburg and Pepi are struggling. The striker has yet to find the back of the net for a side sitting 16th in the standings. In fact, Pepi hasn't scored a goal for club or country since October, with the teenager experiencing the first real dry spell of his fledgling career. ""I feel like there's some pressure,"" Pepi acknowledges. ""I came to this team for a reason and that's to develop. ""Obviously, it was a big transfer but now, being in the team, I feel more comfortable every week that passes by. ""I’m patient but also really, really anxious to score my first goal for sure. It's a big investment, for sure, but I think, if it were easy, everyone would do it. ""I'm a young player moving from MLS to this league, so that's a big step. I feel like I have to be patient with myself and I have to work every day to become a better player and be able to succeed in this league. ""Every day I'm preparing well. I'm feeling better. I'm feeling more confident day by day."" Despite the tough start, it's important to remember why the marriage between Pepi and Augsburg happened in the first place. In Pepi, Augsburg saw a potential star, one that had been linked to clubs much bigger than they are, a player who could someday be sold for an enormous profit. And, in Augsburg, Pepi saw a club that would give him a chance to grow, both in the short and long term. He would get his chance to prove himself from the get-go, but he also wouldn't be immediately cast aside if things weren't going well. He's featured in five games to date and while he has yet to get off the mark, that's partly down to a lack of game time, as Pepi has played just over 200 minutes. He hasn't started since a January 5-1 battering at the hands of Bayer Leverkusen, with his last three appearances all coming off the bench. However, because of that transfer fee and the club's current position, the hope was that Pepi would hit the ground running. Basement battlers clubs don't break transfer records to sign 'projects'; they do it to bring in players capable of helping them survive. As it turns out, though, the 19-year-old striker has needed some time to adjust to everything going on for him on and off the field. During his time in MLS, Pepi made most things look effortless, but a move to the Bundesliga is a whole different test. ""I feel like the biggest adjustment has been the general lifestyle over here,"" he said. ""It's a little bit different than it is in the U.S. and, obviously, the style of play here in the club is different. ""With FC Dallas, we're more used to a slower pace, keeping the ball and here it's a little faster. ""In Germany, everything's faster, everything's just more intense. But it's coming day by day and it's coming slowly, for sure."" Crucially, Pepi says he feels comfortable off the field. He's taking German classes to better acclimate himself to his new country. His living situation, he says, has been taken care of by the club, who have made sure he wants for nothing. Adjusting on the field won't be easy, of course. As well as the quicker pace of the player, it's worth remembering that at FC Dallas, and with the U.S., Pepi was a focal point, the lone striker whose biggest responsibility is getting goals. With Augbsurg, he's just another player in the team, one that is sometimes thrust into unfamiliar roles. ""I feel like there are major differences from playing at FC Dallas,"" he admits. ""Here, we play more with two strikers, or sometimes I find myself playing more like a right striker, so these are the things that are a little bit different because I was our central striker at FC Dallas. ""There's a lot more running, there's a lot more intensity, defenders are a lot more intense or a lot more aggressive. So, you have to get used to that."" The U.S. men's national team will obviously hope he starts firing again sooner rather than later. There are three crucial World Cup qualifying games around the corner, and Gregg Berhalter will need Pepi back at his best. The U.S. will face Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica in March in three games that will determine whether or not they head to Qatar this winter. Those are three difficult matches and they'll likely need a goal or two from Pepi or whomever starts at striker. Sergino Dest sets up Ricardo Pepi for the opener against Jamaica 👏pic.twitter.com/GZNr0jaR0r Pepi scored three goals in his first two games for the U.S., bursting on the scene in emphatic fashion while establishing himself as American soccer's next star, but he has yet to score in his seven caps since. Still, despite his goalless streak, Pepi insists his self-belief isn't shaken by the last few months. ""It’s about confidence,"" he says. ""Augsburg, they made the big transfer because they had confidence in me and they wanted me to come to the team. ""If someone has confidence in you, then there's no better feeling as a striker, as a player. I want to go and represent that club well because they gave me that confidence and they paid the big transfer fee. ""I'm here to give back to the team."" The best way to do that would obviously be by helping them avoid relegation. Augsburg face Borussia Dortmund this weekend in what will certainly be a tough match, but their next two matches are against Arminia Bielefeld and Stuttgart, two clubs that also find themselves near the foot of the table. Maybe those will be the magic games for Pepi. Maybe they won't. But he says that goal is coming sooner rather than later and he's willing to stick it out until it does. ""You have to take risks in life because sometimes you win,"" he says. ""When you take the risk, you're growing as a person. ""I knew it was going to be a big risk for my playing time and just being comfortable ahead of the World Cup, but I was willing to take the risk and now I'm here and I'm ready to work and do whatever I can to help the team.""

For now, the highly-rated 18-year-old is very much focused on the present, with another injury needing to be shaken off in Germany while the USMNT star takes aim at the 2022 World Cup. It is, however, expected that there will come a time when big career calls need to be made, with Reyna’s obvious potential already being noted by leading sides across Europe. Former U.S. goalkeeper Friedel, who spoke to GOAL in association with sports betting site Betway US, said of Reyna’s promise: “He can be whatever he wants to be. His dad [Claudio] was one helluva player. “He needs to stay fit also. He has had some issues. But he has done remarkably well. Basically from the first moment that he went over he has done well and gone from strength to strength.” Pressed further on whether Reyna could star in English football at some stage, as his dad once did, Friedel added: “He could play in the Premier League. “When you come over to the Premier League, there is a learning curve because of the physicality of it. Could he get used to it, adapt and thrive? Absolutely. “He can graft and do the defensive work, do the pressing, if that is what the system of play calls for. He has the tools to be all of that. “Also, being at Dortmund, that is one of the big boys in Germany. He is used to a big club, so that won’t be an issue if he were to go. “I imagine that if he were to ever leave Dortmund, he would go to another very big club. That will just seem normal to him and won’t be daunting.” Lewandowski 7️⃣Kagawa 7️⃣Dembele 7️⃣Sancho 7️⃣Reyna 7️⃣Gio Reyna has a lot to live up to in the Dortmund No.7 🤩 pic.twitter.com/HmddK4i73Z Along with the inevitable links to ambitious sides in the Premier League, Reyna has also sparked talk of interest from La Liga giants Real Madrid. It has been suggested that he could be targeted by the Blancos as a long-term successor to Luka Modric, a player that Friedel once played alongside at Tottenham. He said of that big billing: “They are different. Gio would need to play a lot more games to control the tempo of a game like Luka Modric. “They are different players. Luka is one of the special midfielders that can play six, eight or 10. He can control a whole game with his passing – speed it up, slow it down and it doesn’t even look like he’s running. That is something not taught, not coached, it’s just in his footballing brain. “There are many more games that Gio will need to play in order to be there, but could he play at one of the big clubs? Could he play at Real Madrid one day? Yes. I think he has that quality.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Reyna is set to return for Dortmund this weekend after missing five months with a hamstring injury. Ahead of Sunday's match against Bayer Leverkusen, Reus has spoken about Reyna's nickname and what he could potentially bring to Dortmund as they look to chase down Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title. ""Mr. Bean. That’s what we call him because he – how can I put this – likes to waddle about,"" Reus told the Bundesliga website about Reyna. ""I hope he will have a lot more to offer us. He has been out for a really long time. It will still take a couple of weeks until he is back to his best but he offers more opportunities in deep, variation in terms of tactics. ""We hope he stays healthy and can get fit quickly. With the run of midweek games coming up, we hope he can help us move forward.” Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Dortmund coach Marco Rose confirmed Reyna's return, saying: “Gio is back! Very cool! ""He really wants to be there, had another two good weeks of training. To see him back and to have his quality again is nice and important for us.” The 19-year-old's most recent match was back in September, when he suffered the injury while on international duty with the United States. He returns looking to help Dortmund to an unlikely late title charge, with Bayern looking to secure a 10th straight Bundesliga title. After defeating RB Leipzig on Saturday, Bayern have a nine-point lead over second-place Dortmund, who have a game in hand ahead of Sunday's clash with Leverkusen.

At just 18 years of age, the hottest of prospects is already an established performer in the Bundesliga and a senior United States international with nine caps to his name. The sky would appear to be the limit for Reyna as his stock continues to soar and Raphael Wicky, who worked with the youngster in the U.S. U17 ranks, believes a big-money transfer could be on the cards at some stage. Wicky, who spent time in Germany during his playing days and is now coach of MLS side the Chicago Fire, has told Sport Bild: ""Gio Reyna has star potential. ""Even as his coach with the U17s, I was blown away by his unbelievable game intelligence and technical abilities, combined with his superb physical conditioning. ""He struck gold with his transfer to Germany. Training at BVB, he's improved his game against the ball and defensive game. He fights for the good of the team and has internalised a winning mentality. ""If Gio continues to develop like this, he can go up another level and play for one of the best five teams in the world, including Bayern Munich."" The talented teenager will not be going anywhere any time soon as he signed a long-term contract with Dortmund in November 2020. That deal is due to take him through to 2025 and he is feeling settled in his current surroundings. Reyna has taken in 69 appearances for BVB, scoring 10 goals across those outings. He is the kind of player that Bayern and several other European heavyweights will have on their radar, but he will not be easy - or cheap - to pry from Signal Iduna Park.

Reyna has enjoyed a meteoric rise to stardom since joining his hometown club New York City FC back in 2015. The 17-year-old spent four years in the MLS side's youth set-up before being snapped up by Dortmund, where he has quickly established himself as a regular in Lucien Favre's senior team. Reyna took in 17 appearances in all competitions during his debut season at Westfalenstadion, and has been trusted with a more prominent role at the start of the 2020-21 campaign. The midfielder has contributed two goals and five assists to Dortmund's cause across 10 outings, making an impressive impact in both the Bundesliga and Champions League. Cramer thinks Dortmund hit the jackpot when they signedReyna, whose career trajectory is currently mirroring that of fellow countryman Pulisic. Pulisic also moved from MLS to Germany at the age of 16, and went on to appear in 127 games for BVB before being sold to Chelsea for £54 million ($70m) in 2019. Cramer told Goal and SPOXof the impact Reyna has had on and off the pitch at Signal Iduna Park: ""His potential is huge. Just like Christian (Pulisic), he is not only an outstanding footballer, but also a really good guy. For us, it is a six in the lottery in terms of sport and marketing. ""But the latter component was not decisive for us bringing in the boy. We do not commit to deals according to nationality or marketing value, but according to sporting criteria. ""But it is a nice coincidence that someone from marketing can use [the signing] meaningfully."" Reyna will be back in contention for a place in Favre's starting XI when Dortmund take in a trip to Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The German giants are currently sitting third in Group F on three points, having bounced back from a 3-1 defeat away at Lazio by beating Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 on matchday two. After their latest European outing, Dortmund will look ahead to the first Klassiker clash of the season against Bayern Munich on Saturday, with only goal difference separating the two clubs at the top of the Bundesliga standings after six fixtures.

Everything you need to know about Manchester United's new £73m signing,"Jadon Sancho has become Manchester United's first major signing of the summer transfer window, but what qualities will he bring to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad?  Goal  is on hand to tell you everything you need to know about the talented young attacker. Sancho has been officially unveiled at Old Trafford, having committed to a five-year deal  that will see him remain on the Red Devils' books through to 2026. In case you are unfamiliar with the 21-year-old and his style of play,  Goal  has come up with an extensive profile of a man who will be expected to make a big impact on the Premier League stage in 2021-22. Sancho is a professional footballer who has just completed a switch to United from Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund. The winger initially rose through the youth ranks at Watford before joining the Red Devils' arch-rivals Manchester City in 2015. He spent two years in City's academy set-up but was ultimately unable to break into Pep Guardiola's first-team squad, and chose to up sticks and join Dortmund with a view to taking in regular first-team minutes. Sancho quickly became one of BVB's most influential players, and finished his spell at Westfalenstadion with 50 goals and 57 assists to his name through 137 appearances across all competitions. The Englishman departed on a high note by helping the club win the DFB Pokal and finishfourth in the Bundesliga, ensuring their participation in the Champions League for an 11th successive year. United agreed to pay an initial fee of £73 million ($101m)for Sancho, which makes him the fourth most expensive signing in the club's history. Goal's Manchester United correspondent Charlotte Duncker  : ""United have been lacking a natural right-sided winger for years, which is why Solskjaer has always been so keen on signing Sancho,who has racked up 50 goals and 57 assists in 137 appearances in all competitions for Dortmund. ""In the past, the Norwegian has been forced to play the two-footed and incredibly versatile Mason Greenwood out wide, leavingAnthony Martial and Edinson Cavani to battlefor the centre-forward role. ""However, Greenwood prefers to play through the middle, so the acquisition of Sancho will mean his fellow England international will now be free to stake a claim for a starting spot in his bestposition. ""The increase in competition for places will also ensure that Solskjaer will always have a couple of potential game-changers on the bench."" Sancho is primarily viewed as a natural right-winger, with his lightning pace, superb dribbling skills andeye for goal making him a nightmare for defenders. However, the former Dortmund star is also capable of operating on the left or in a number 10 role due to his ability to play with both feet and create openings in the final third with his impressive passing range. Sancho will likely slot straight in on the right-hand side of Solskjaer's attack to begin with, but will have to prove his worth quickly amid strong competition for places in the final third. The presence of fellow countrymen Marcus Rashford, Greenwood, Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire will likely help him settle in at Old Trafford as United look to bring their five-year trophy drought to an end in the upcoming campaign. Sancho became a full senior England international in 2018, having previously represented his country at Under-16, 17 and 19 levels. United's latest acquisition has since racked up 22 appearances for the Three Lions, including three at this summer's European Championship. Sancho was unable to add to his haul of three international goals at the tournament, though, and missed a decisive penalty in England's final shootout defeat to Italyat Wembley. Jadon Sancho's overall rating in FIFA 21 is 87,with a potential of 92. He has got a five-star skill moves rating. He prefers to shoot with his rightfoot and his workrates are High/Medium. Sancho's best stats areDribbling(92), Agility (91), Ball Control (90), Balance (90) andVision (87). Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Malen, 22, fits the profile of a rising star the Bundesliga club so often seeks out. He scored 19 goals and supplied eight assists in the Eredivisie last season before assisting twice for the Netherlands at Euro 2020. Once a member of Arsenal's academy, he has experience playing outside of his home nation that could serve him well in Germany.

Plus, striker Erling Haaland is rumoured to be a transfer target of several Premier League clubs and may eventually move elsewhere, although perhaps not this summer. The Gunnerswill reportedly receive around £250,000 - or 1.5 per cent of the final transfer fee - because of a clause in the agreement that sent Malen from their academy to PSV in 2017, according to  football.london.

Dortmund haven't won the league title in Germany since their 2011-12 success under Jurgen Klopp, finishing runners' up on five occasions to Bayern Munich who have clinched the crown in each of the last nine seasons. Dortmund had to make do with a fourth-place finish last term, but did manage to go all the way in the DFB-Pokaland Reus is optimistic that they can pick up even more silverware in the upcoming campaign. Reus told a press conference at Dortmund's pre-season training camp in Switzerland: ""We have the squad to become German champions, to win the cup and to advance in the Champions League. ""Alot has to come together, but the potential is there. We have to show it over the course of a season. You also need luck in certain games, you work for that with passion, with heart - what the fans want to see."" Former Borussia Monchengladbach boss Marco Rose replaced Edin Terzic in the Westfalenstadion hot seat earlier this summer, and Reus is confident that he is the right man to usher in a new era of success. The 32-year-old has been impressed by Rose's approach on the training ground, saying: ""It's great fun with him and his team. We hope that we can soon show the things he teaches us on the pitch.We areon the right track, because the training is very good. This is how preparation should be: very exhausting, we learn a lot of new things."" Reus also spoke about thestyle choices star striker Erling Haaland makes away from the pitch, with Dortmund posting a picture of the Norwegian in an eye-catching flamingo-themed tracksuit on social media over the weekend. ""You have to address that, I think, but somehow it also suits him. He's just a good guy,"" Reus said of his team-mate. ""If he continues to perform like this, he can wear whatever he wants - or nothing at all. I don't care either way.""

372,https://www.goal.com/en/news/a-moment-years-in-the-making-usmnt-golden-generation-emerges/blt6ee5adbfef66bfd9,USMNT golden generation emerges from ashes of 2018 failure to write their own World Cup story,"When all was said and done, the U.S. men's national team's World Cup qualifying campaign ended with a relative thud. A months-long sprint through CONCACAF concluded with a 2-0 loss in Costa Rica, a relative letdown for a team that had ambitions of ending this run on a high. But make no mistake: Wednesday night was worthy of celebration, even if the performance wasn't. It was a long-awaited, much-needed and life-altering night for a team that has worked so hard for this moment. The U.S. has had plenty of celebrations over the last year. The Nations League, the Gold Cup, wins over Mexico, Panama, Jamaica and Honduras. There had been reasons to celebrate, to embrace an accomplishment for a young team that has taken several big steps over the last few years. But this was different. This was a night 1,632 days in the making, one that American soccer has looked forward to, craved, since that night in Trinidad & Tobago. Wednesday was when the nightmare finally died, and the night that the USMNT truly began to dream again. And this is just the beginning. Sure, it was the night that the U.S. finally put to rest any talk of the 2018 World Cup cycle. It was, effectively, the end of a four-year run that had one singular goal in mind. But, for a golden generation that dreams of much, much more, this was, in theory, just the start. For the first time in eight years, the U.S. men's national team is going back to the World Cup. After all of this time, the U.S. is back where they belong. ""It was a full-on party,"" Gregg Berhalter told CBS of the celebrations. ""These guys earned it, they deserve it, and although we're disappointed in the result tonight, we can still put it past us because we're in the World Cup."" How sweet that must feel for Christian Pulisic, Kellyn Acosta and DeAndre Yedlin, all players who were on the field on that fateful night in Couva in 2017. What a moment this is for Tyler Adams, a player that remembers watching on from afar as the 2018 World Cup cycle went up in flames. And what could be said about Berhalter, the man tasked with turning the youngest team in U.S. history into the one that sealed its place back among the world's elite? ""I spoke to the guys before the game,"" Yedlin told CBS, ""and I just thanked them for giving me a chance to redeem myself and giving the country a chance to redeem itself."" Whether you were there in 2017 or not, whether you played one qualifier or 14, this was what the past four years was all for. The mission was to get back to a World Cup. And, in San Jose, the USMNT were finally able to say it: Mission Accomplished. pic.twitter.com/PKw8e0ykLp ""To an extent it is personal,"" Paul Arriola said during the home stretch of World Cup qualifying. ""It's something that I've experienced that maybe some others haven't. At the end of the day, it's a team sport and I think the mentality of this group is completely different from the past."" This group, this golden generation, grew from the ashes of the past after that 2018 qualifying cycle. It seems so long ago now, having seen many of these players grow up over the years, but their journey wasn't always one filled with optimism. It began with a friendly against Portugal under an interim boss, Dave Sarachan, who was handed a USMNT program on life support in late 2017. He took charge for what was called ""a lost year"", one where the U.S. treaded water without a full-time head coach. Under Sarachan, several key pillars of this USMNT were introduced, players like Adams, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Zack Steffen. Those four would go on to be mainstays of this qualifying cycle. Over the years, other players were added. We've watched Gio Reyna grow from youngster to Borussia Dortmund star. We've seen the rise of Ricardo Pepi and Yunus Musah. We've learned the story of Matt Turner, who took an unthinkable path to the national team. In between all of that, Berhalter was brought in and handed an almost impossible task. He was charged with nurturing the youngest USMNT ever, even if they were arguably the most talented. He was tasked with implementing a style of play, an identity, to a team and a program that had lost its way. And he had been tasked, most importantly, with giving the American public a reason to care again and, most importantly, a reason to dream again. That's a weight that this entire team felt over the last four years. The pressure on this team has been different than the ones of years past. Not only was this team charged with sealing their own spot in the World Cup, but they were also supposed to rectify the mistakes of those that came before them. THE USMNT'S GOLDEN GENERATION ARE GOING TO THE 2022 WORLD CUP 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/LS3d069QUN ""I think about the responsibility that I have and the responsibility that some of my teammates have,"" Adams said last week. ""We have to qualify, there's just no other option. ""When you're in big games and important games, you always have to remember what motivates you and what you're doing it for. For us, we're doing it for all of the U.S. fans. We don't want to let down our nation. ""When you're battling it out, you're remembering every single moment, what you're playing for and the importance that it holds."" For years, every single thing the USMNT did was done with that dark cloud hanging over them. It came up each and every time they gathered. It was unavoidable. From the moment the whistle blew in Couva in 2017, that would be a defining moment of this team's story. It may have been a defining moment, but they didn't let it define them. They may have felt the pressure, but they never broke under it. It may be a part of their story, but it certainly wasn't a story they had any intention of continuing. For years, the hope was that this team would be different than the ones that came before, even the successful ones. There was a belief that this generation could change the perception of American soccer forever. The optimist would look at this team and believe that it has the talent, the belief, the energy and the attitude to reach a level unmatched by any USMNT before them. But to reach those levels, they had to start with this one massive step. Q U A L I F I E D. pic.twitter.com/nyHN0K1dcC “I wasn't a part of that [2018] group,"" Tim Weah said this week, ""but the media has classified us as the golden generation and the generation that's going to qualify for the next World Cup. So I think we do carry a lot of that weight on our shoulders. “This qualifying for the World Cup is not only for us, it's for the group before. It's for the Clints [Dempsey], it's for DeAndre, it’s for Jozy [Altidore], all the guys that didn't get to do it again. We've now taken up that role to get the job done.” That they did. They got the job done. This golden generation will now get their moment in the spotlight, and they've earned it. They're a team that has grown up before our very eyes, going from a group of teenagers and 20-somethings to a team that will hope to truly compete with the best in the world at the World Cup next year. That World Cup may still be too much for this group, who will be among the youngest in the field. The 2026 tournament, set to be held on home soil, may be the USMNT's true coming out party. But, at this point, that won't matter. What matters is that they're there, that the USMNT are back where they belong: on the world's stage. It's come after a years-long journey with two coaches, dozens of players, two trophies and, most importantly, one successful World Cup qualifying campaign. The first step of this journey is over. The first job is done. They'll find out on Friday what the next step will be, what the road through Qatar will truly look like. Now, the fun truly begins.

373,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-usmnt-goalkeeper-turner-summer/blt14889422dbef5bf2,Arsenal agree summer transfer for USMNT goalkeeper Turner,"Arsenal have reached an agreement with the New England Revolution to sign United States men's national team goalkeeper Matt Turner this summer, GOAL can confirm. The 27-year-old enjoyed a stellar 2021 for club and country and will now look to compete against Gunners starter Aaron Ramsdale with Bernd Leno's future in doubt. Turner was the 2021 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year after leading the Revolution to the Supporters' Shield last season, which has captured the attention of clubs in Europe. Turner starred at the Gold Cup last summer in his first major opportunity to stake his claim to the No. 1 goalkeeper role for the USMNT. His strong play between the posts helped his side win the tournament - and beat Mexico in a final for the second time in three months. He has made 13 international appearances since earning his first USMNT cap in January 2021. His main competition for the starting role is Manchester City goalkeeper Zack Steffen, who suffered an injury over the summer but has since recovered to take back his place in the team. Aside from the Revolution, Turner spent time developing earlier in his career with the Jersey Express and Richmond Kickers. USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter spoke about the switch to Arsenal in a post-match press conference on Thursday after his side's 1-0 win over El Salvador. ""It's just a great story and I hope the public is aware,"" he said. ""He went to Fairfield, undrafted out of college and now he's playing with the USMNT and he's headed to Arsenal. ""It's an amazing story. His work ethic, his belief in himself and his never-give-up atittude, it's a great story and Matt is a great guy, a great team-mate. We're lucky to have him. ""Tonight was an example where he did everything he had to do. He was calm in all situations, wasn't tested much, but he was there when we needed him and he looked like a guy that's going to Arsenal for sure."" Leno, the first-choice Arsenal goalkeeper before the arrival of Ramsdale, has his heart set on making Germany's 2022 World Cup squad and therefore desires first-team football. With his future as a Gunner increasingly in doubt, he has been linked with Newcastle among other clubs. The arrival of Turner this summer would suggest his exit is imminent.

374,https://www.goal.com/en/news/buffon-neuer-level-nxgn-star-slonina-worlds-best-goalkeeper/blt6d5735c459508a83,'Why can't I be at Buffon and Neuer's level?!' - NXGN star Slonina out to become the world's best goalkeeper,"It would be understandable for Gabriel Slonina to feel the pressure of comparisons. And who could blame him? At just 17-years-old, Slonina is already being labeled as the game's next great goalkeeper. He has already been earmarked as a U.S. men's national team star of the future, the heir apparent in American soccer's legacy position. He is a part of Chicago soccer's ongoing revival, a hometown kid helping to reenergize a dormant soccer city as the team's unquestioned No.1 in goal. He has been linked with some of Europe's top clubs, too, with Juventus and Manchester United rumored to be interested in signing the teenage goalkeeper after seeing him break out in a big way in 2021. And then there are those comparisons, the ones that have already seen him called the next Gianluigi Buffon or Manuel Neuer. For most, all of that coming into your life would be difficult to deal with. But, surprisingly, Slonina is somewhat eager to address those comparisons. He does so with excitement, but also a certain calmness. He is not afraid to talk about them or worried about the idea of putting additional pressure on his shoulders. Because, if he wants to be the next Buffon or Neuer, Slonina understands that you have to handle things a certain way. And, make no mistake, Slonina really does want to be the next Buffon or Neuer. ""I use it as motivation,"" Slonina tells GOAL when asked about how he handles seeing his name next to the two men he grew up idolizing. ""I'm already getting compared to them so why can't I be at that level? ""What work can I do now to be at that level? What extra can I add to my game to start to play like them and be where they're at right now? ""Being compared to them is an incredible honor. It's insane to see my name next to theirs because they're the top goalkeepers in the world. ""They’ve accomplished so many big things that I hope to accomplish in my career."" Like many goalkeepers, Slonina's initial experiences between the posts came out of necessity. Growing up in a Polish-American family, Slonina, who is affectionately known as Gaga, fell for the game at an early age. Even then, Slonina was a big kid. Not quite the 6'4 monster that is domianting MLS these days, but still big enough to be a commanding presence. And so, naturally, he was thrown in goal, and it did not take long for him to fall in love. ""I don't remember the first time I played in goal,"" he says, ""but I always remember, when you play when you're younger, the goals are so small, so I was basically covering the whole goal. Penalties for me came so easy because the kids had nowhere to shoot! ""I think just falling in love with making a save and having people run up to me and congratulate me on the save, that's kind of what made me fall in love [with goalkeeping]. Just constantly making those saves and just being the best I can be on the field was what I fell in love with."" Gabriel Slonina.That's it. That's the tweet. pic.twitter.com/4Hd4ol4a9r At age 14, Slonina signed his first professional deal, making him, at the time, the second-youngest signing in MLS history behind only Freddy Adu. And then, this past August, at just 17, Slonina became the youngest goalkeeper to start a game in MLS history. That game, a 0-0 draw with NYCFC, proved a sign of things to come, as Slonina knew he could not be overwhelmed by anything thrown at him. ""I felt completely ready for it,"" he says. ""I was doing all the work that I needed to do from January, from the first day of pre-season. I was constantly putting in the work to make sure that I was prepared for any moment and I was prepared from the first game in April. ""I was constantly working my hardest before and after training, watching film, making sure that if I need to get called on at any time during that timeframe, that I was ready for it. ""So August 4 was a normal day for me. Obviously I was making my debut, but I needed to keep a cool head, stay humble, stay in the moment, stay focused and trust the work that I put in was gonna make me prepared for the game."" That day may have been normal, but Slonina's life has been anything but in the months since. He has become the Fire's No.1, making 14 more appearances to date, with more to come before his 18th birthday in June. He has also been called-up to camp with the U.S. men's national team, though he has not yet earned his first cap and is still eligible to represent Poland down the line. He is also the only goalkeeper to have been named on the NXGN 2022 list, meaning he is recognized as one of the 50 best teenage players in the world game. When @ChicagoFire's  @GabrielSlonina  saw his NXGN award 🏆😍 pic.twitter.com/IvSlq9CFyy And then there are those comparisons and those transfer rumors. Even before he completed his first MLS season, Slonina was linked with some of the biggest clubs in the world. What those clubs see is a goalkeeper that has all the tools to play at the highest level. He has ridiculous size but is quick on his feet. He has already proven himself to be a very good shot-stopper, and he never seems overwhelmed by the moment, despite facing off against players nearly twice his age in MLS. “He reminds me very much of a young Gigi Buffon,” USMNT legend Tony Meola said on Sirius XM ahead of the 2022 season. “You look at his body, you look at his movements. ""I had the chance to be in Parma when Gigi Buffon was there and I was there for four months training and trained with Gigi and stayed friends with him over the years. ""He is a guy that you could tell was going to work his way through anything, and that’s kind of what I see from [Slonina] and what I hear from everyone in and around the Chicago Fire. ""I look at the pathway, and I think the pathway for him is that within the next 24 months he’s going to be in Europe and needs to be in Europe"" Slonina's words echo Meola's, at least on that work ethic perspective. It is a topic that Slonina references several times: his desire to outwork everyone. ""I want to win MLS Cup this year,"" he says, pointing to signings like Xherdan Shaqiri and Kacper Przybyłko as reasons why he believes it is possible. ""I want to take it all the way with the Chicago Fire and lift that trophy at the end of the year. ""I want to have at least 16 clean sheets this year. It's a big ask. It's a big ask for my defenders, for my whole team and for myself, but I believe that I can do it this year. ""I think the MLS record is about 14-15, so I'm going to work every day and make sure that I'm doing everything I can to continue to grow and help my team out because, if you don't concede, you can’t lose a game. ""I think it's important to have those goals for yourself and have something that pushes you to work harder every single day."" Through just four games, Slonina already has three of those clean sheets under his belt. Getting to 16 may be a bridge too far, but you have to say that the teenager is off to a pretty good start. And that's what is most important to keep in mind when it comes to the 17-year-old goalkeeper: that this is just the start. In a position where players often do not reach their peak until after age 30, Slonina's career is just beginning. The save that secured the point.#cf97 | @Allstate pic.twitter.com/Dj7BwU7b7u He has lofty goals: clean sheets, trophies, being one of the best of all time. Some of those goals will take longer to accomplish than others, obviously. But Slonina has got both time and desire to spare as he looks to prove worthy of being compared to those that he is so often linked to. ""It's an incredible goal to set for yourself,"" he says, ""but, like just trusting yourself that you will make it there one day and constantly adding things to your locker, asking for information from everyone, using everyone, treating everyone as a teacher, learning every little thing from every little person that you can use to improve in your daily life, your performances. ""It’s a big range of things you can do to get to that level, but obviously the most important is performing on game day because that's what everyone is seeing. ""So it's just constantly working and giving your all every single day because you know at the end of the day that that work is what is going to separate you from the rest. ""Constantly separating yourself and building that gap in between you and others is what's gonna push you to the top and towards greatness."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The forwards are the two hottest properties in world football at the moment, with Europe's top teams battling to sign them this summer. Barca are said to be courting both players, with Manchester City and Real Madrid also in the frame to land them. But Alves has picked Mbappe as his favourite of the two, telling Sport: ""Mbappe is a more complete player than Haaland in all aspects of the game. ""I wouldn't do crazy things for Haaland. Honestly, I wouldn't spend a lot of money on him. ""I would spend a lot of money on Mbappe, but not on Haaland. ""If you are going to make a giant investment, you have to do it in the best way. If it depended on me, I would bet on Mbappe."" Mbappe and Haaland have been in great form for their respective sides again this season. The France international has scored 23 goals and assisted 17 in 35 appearances across Ligue 1 and the Champions League. Haaland, meanwhile, has 19 goals to his name from 21 matches in the Bundesliga and Europe's premier club competition. Mbappe has suggested that he could opt to remain at PSG for the time being despite constant reports that a move to Madrid is set to to through this summer. Haaland's future also remains up in the air, with reports claiming Manchester City are the favourites to land him. Despite claims in the media, GOAL understands that the Norway star does not have a €75 million (£63m/$83m) release clause in his Dortmund contract.

Haaland's future is the subject of much discussion at present, as the Norwegian appears likely to move elsewhere in the summer transfer window. Klopp, however, has made it clear that the cost of buying the free-scoring striker, which could eventually total in the region of €350 million (£292m/$381m) is out of the Reds' price range. “We won't be going there,” the former Dortmund boss told SportBild. “The numbers involved are just crazy – we'll be having nothing to do with it. No chance! “To be honest, I don't want anything to do with it. It's not fun.” GOAL has learned that there is no €75 million (£63m/$83m) release clause in Haaland's contract, but the player does have a gentlemen's agreement with BVB. Should Dortmund live up to their word, a minimum bid of €75m would see them enter talks with interested parties. Manchester City are thought to be leading the race to sign the 21-year-old, but interest from Real Madrid could result in a bidding war, driving up the price. Haaland himself wants around €25m (£21m/$28m) per year after tax - which equates to around €50m (£42m/$55m) gross. Indeed, should Haaland sign a five-year deal with a new club, it would cost them €250m (£209m/$275m) on wages alone. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Reyna came on as a second-half substitute in the USMNT's 0-0 draw with Mexico, nearly helping the U.S. seal the win if not for a 72nd-minute miss from Jordan Pefok. Moments later, Reyna went on a mazy run through several Mexico defenders, with his coach pointing out that the forward drive looked very familiar to one of the most famous in the game's history. After receiving the ball in his own half, Reyna darted past several Mexico defenders as he broke towards goal. Every time the sequence seemingly neared its conclusion, Reyna would ease past yet another defender before, ultimately, being tackled after leaving several El Tri stars in his wake. We see you Gio Reyna 🔥 pic.twitter.com/F49wJUzd07 😳😳😳😳 pic.twitter.com/Gt9btEjihO ""It's exciting,"" Berhalter said after the match. ""When you looked at our young group of players, it's an exciting group of players and thinking about the prospect of these guys getting even better is really exciting. ""Mexico was the host of the 86 World Cup, where Maradona scored his wonderful goal and I had visions of that while Gio was dribbling. ""Unfortunately, he didn't finish it off or get an opportunity to finish off but again, I think he made a solid impact and he showed what type of playmaking and attacking quality he has."" The goal Berhalter alluded was, of course, Maradona's famous finish against England in 1986, a goal recognized as one of the most magical moments in the sport's history. Coming shortly after the infamous Hand of God goal, Maradona darted past numerous England defenders to score what is known as the Goal of the Century, solidifying the Argentine's place in the game's lore. Thursday's match was Reyna's first since suffering an injury in September, with that injury keeping him out for nearly the entirety of World Cup qualifying. After suffering a setback in February, Reyna only recently returned for Borussia Dortmund, playing 90 minutes last Sunday before joining the USMNT. He came off the bench on Thursday, replacing Tim Weah in the second half. Further reading Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Reyna missed months with a hamstring injury suffered during the initial round of World Cup qualifiers, only to pick up another knock on returning in February. He has since returned and featured for 90 minutes in Borussia Dortmund's 1-1 draw with Cologne over the weekend but, heading into a week with three games in quick succession, Reyna admits he is likely to have his minutes managed by USMNT boss Gregg Berhalter. ""I just want to help the group,"" Reyna said. ""I know I can help the group, just with my playing and just being here. Obviously, I've been in the group in the past many times. ""We have really important games and our main goal is to go the World Cup and that's what I'm here to help us do. ""I guess over the three games, obviously, I'm coming off a long injury, we're going to see. I'm definitely going to be managed in some sort of way, but we'll see. We're figuring it out now. ""The main goal is obviously to qualify and then obviously to leave the camp healthy. So yeah, we're going to be smart with it."" Asked about his fitness, Reyna said he feels sound but still needs more time to feel totally back to where he once was. ""It's going to take some time,"" he said. ""I was off for a long time so I understand that. I've got to take it one day at a time and just try to try to improve."" Reyna has missed all but one camp for the USMNT since the start of qualifying, with injury in the initial round costing him months of games. As a result, he has been forced to watch on as the U.S. has navigated World Cup qualifying towards this final round. The U.S. sit second in the table, knowing that results against Mexico and Panama would ensure them of a World Cup spot, and Reyna is glad to be back and glad to have a chance to contribute to that goal after missing so much time. ""It was really hard,"" he admitted. ""It was really hard being out, just not playing for that amount of time in general. Not necessarily the national team but just in general, not playing. ""Of course, these are important qualifier games. It was tough staying up late until 3 or 4am watching the games in Germany. It definitely motivated me to try to be back as soon as possible.""

On Thursday, the Gunners revealed the Ghanaian suffered damage to a muscle in his right thigh during their game against Crystal Palace on Monday. ""It is a little bit ambiguous,"" Arteta saidin a presser on Friday. ""But he has a significant injury and we’ll have to keep assessing him, but he will be out for some weeks. ""It could be [an issue], but it could also not be because it’s an area where he had a previous injury as well, and he felt it straight away. It’s not quick."" The Spaniard also spoke about Kieran Tierney’s injury, stating the responsibility is shared between the club and Scottish national team. ""Our responsibility is to look after them when we have them here, but once they go to the national team,"" he continued. ""In this case, it’s their job and responsibility to decide which team that they believe is the best to win the games, and we have to try to have quick communication with the national teams, which we have, but these things happen. Arteta also assessed their Saturday opponents, giving their areas of strength. ""They're a team with a lot of personalities, a coach that is very willing to play, that is very aggressive in the way they press, that wants to dominate the game and they have good players to do that,"" the manager added. ""But they are very difficult to beat. They don't concede a lot of chances and opportunities in open play and also set pieces and they're a threat. The tactician was cautious about whether he thinks Arsenal will enjoy a goal-fest against Brighton. ""You never know in football,"" Arteta concluded. ""Let’s see what happens tomorrow, but obviously, we’re going to try score more goals and we’re certainly creating the chances to do so."" ""We have struggled in recent matches to put the ball in the net and we need to be more efficient in the opponent’s box and tomorrow it’s something we have to do because Brighton is a team that doesn’t concede much.""

380,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramsdale-arsenal-captaincy-strong-message-arteta/bltd18cba163e03d4c8,Ramsdale puts himself forward to take Arsenal captaincy as he delivers strong message to Arteta,"Aaron Ramsdale has put himself forward to take on captaincy duties at Arsenal from 2022-23, with the confident goalkeeper informing Mikel Arteta that he would “excel” if asked to fill the armband at Emirates Stadium. The 23-year-old only joined the Gunners from Sheffield United in the summer of 2021 and is yet to complete a full season in north London. A man that has ousted Bernd Leno from Arsenal’s number one spot, while earning senior international recognition with England, is of the opinion, though, that he is ready to take on a leadership role. With former skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang departing for Barcelona in January and Alexandre Lacazette heading towards free agency, Ramsdale told FourFourTwo of the battle to become Arsenal’s next captain: “Listen, I’d take the responsibility but that’s down to the manager. “We’ve got a lot of strong characters, though, and a lot of people who I think would be good captains. “Just to be told 'you’re in a leadership role' – I’d relish whatever. You never turn down a captaincy and I think I’d excel if I was given the armband, but that’s down to the boss.” For now, with a captaincy call yet to be made, Ramsdale is fully focused on ensuring that he retains his starting berth in Arteta’s plans. He was fast-tracked into the Gunners team following a £24 million ($31m) transfer, with a debut made in a 1-0 Premier League win over Norwich on September 11. Ramsdale has not looked back from there, helping to keep the Gunners in contention for a top-four finish, but is aware that high standards must be maintained in order to retain a prominent role. He added on settling in quickly at the Emirates: “With Bernd Leno pushing me every day, I know I can’t sit back and take it easy, because he’ll take the number one spot off me just as quickly as I took it off him. “He’s been good with me – we fight for the same spot, but we have each other’s backs too. For me, it’s not about what happens months into the first season – I’d prefer to be judged four or five years down the line. “I thought [that becoming the number one] would be a process of four months, maybe a year, but I was ready. I felt settled straight away, knowing some of the lads, and the manager made it so easy for me by saying, 'Just go and play your game.' Once I’d got in, it was so comfortable for me to do my stuff. “The fans have been absolutely amazing with me, too. There was obviously a bit of unrest when I signed – people were talking about me being a second-choice goalkeeper, costing a lot of money and the relegations – but that just gave me added motivation to win them over.” Arsenal will be back in action on April 4 when taking in a short trip to London rivals Crystal Palace.

How £24m Ramsdale impressed Arteta and edged ahead of Leno,"Three games! That is all it took Aaron Ramsdale to edge past Bernd Leno in the pecking order at Arsenal. When the 23-year-old arrived from Sheffield United earlier in the summer there was always an expectation that he would soon go on to become No.1, but few would have imagined he would have pushed Leno aside quite so quickly. Whether he remains first-choice for the long-term remains to be seenbut, for now, the goalkeeping berth appears Ramsdale’s tolose. “We had to change something and Aaron has come here to try to make us better,” Arteta said of the new arrival's inclusion in the starting line-up for last weekend's 1-0 win over Norwich.“We needed a resultand I decided to play him. That’s all.” It was a decision that paid off, with Ramsdale helping Arsenal to their first clean sheet of the new Premier League season. In truth, he was hardly troubled, with the visitors mustering just one shot on target all afternoon.But the way he commanded his penalty area was impressive, as was the way he handled himself in tight spaces when he had the ball at his feet. It was a performance that followed on from an impressive showing against West Brom in the Carabao Cup second round, when the summer signing made several fine stops during Arsenal’s 6-0 win at the Hawthorns.  Ramsdale may have only been with the Gunners a short time, but he’s made a significant impact on and off the pitch. “It is not only what he did on the technical side, it is what he transmits, his energy, his chemistry with the backline, how he reacts, his body language,” Arteta said of Ramsdale’s outingagainst Norwich. ""I think it was top.” Ramsdale is expected to keep his place in goal for Arsenal on Saturday when they take on Burnley looking to make it back-to-back wins in the Premier League. And he will expect to be in for a far busier afternoon than the one he enjoyed against Norwich last weekend. Burnley may have endured a difficult start to the season, with just one win from their opening four games, but they have shown in the past that they can cause Arsenal problems with their direct style of play. They will look to get balls into the box quickly and Ramsdale will need to show he can command his area under real pressure from one of the league’s most physical teams. He will know his performance will come under intense scrutiny, given the Leno situation, but the confident way he has approached his move to Arsenal bodes well for his ability to handle the pressure. Ramsdale has already made himself a popular figure behind the scenes.He is known as a likeable guy and has made a big impression in a short space of time in north London.   There had been some suggestions that Leno had taken Arteta’s decision to leave him out against Norwich badly, but that is something that has been adamantly denied by club sources. And Arteta himself hit out at the reports ahead of Saturday’s game, insisting that was not the case. “That's not true,” said the Arsenal boss. “He responded and you can be frustrated, but he was top with his team-mates in training and with everything. So that is not true.” The decision to bring Ramsdale in so early was a big call by Arteta, who would have been well aware of the story it would generate. He is now left with a similar situation to the one he faced after Emiliano Martinez’s form during the final months of the 2019-20 season when he stepped in to replace the injured Leno. Martinez’s fine form made it difficult to keep both keepers once Leno had returned to fitness and it was the Argentine who eventually moved on, joining Aston Villa last year. However,Leno is now facing the prospect of having to go through an entire season as understudy, something that will not do his international chances any good at all.   So, keeping both shot-stoppershappy could prove to be a difficult balancing act for Arteta, who says he will not be giving either any assurances over playing time going forward. “I’ve said to the goalkeepers during the last two or three years that we don't want to do that,” claimed the Arsenal boss. “What we want to do is empower performance and ask them to train, behave and play the best possible way. So, how can I guarantee somebody something?It wouldn't make sense with what we are demanding them to do. “It is on a daily basis;what you did three months ago in football doesn't count. It is what you're going to do today and tomorrow, and that's it.” Arteta wants to build a squad that has healthy competition running through it and Ramsdale’s solid start to life at Arsenal has certainly added a competitive edge to the goalkeeper department. The young Englishman has made his mark quicker than most expected and Leno is now on the outside looking in. He won his battle to be No.1 with Martinez just over a year ago, but now he has another fight on his hands and it's Ramsdale who has landed the first blow.

382,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-the-premier-leagues-longest-unbeaten-record/llbau5ob6ggz1wbtn9f4f408l,What is the Premier League's longest unbeaten record?,"When you think of ""unbeaten"" and ""Premier League"", your thoughts might immediately be drawn to Arsenal's incredible title-winning campaign in 2003-04. The Gunners went an entire season without falling to defeat that year as the Premier League title was secured in style. They are the only side to have won the English top-flight crown without suffering a single setback – hence the 'Invincibles' tag – and though their streak remains the longest on record, others have come close to matching it. Under Arsene Wenger, Arsenal currently hold the record for the longest unbeaten Premier League run with 49 games in 2003-04. Other managers have tried to piece together an Invincibles season of their own, but all have ultimately failed. The best ever Premier League team is ____________#OnThisDay in 2004 Arsenal became invincible 🤩💯 pic.twitter.com/EWd72DGe3Y Expectations were high for Pep Guardiola's 2017-18 Manchester City side, who appeared to steamroll over just about everyone until they paid a visit to Liverpool in January and lost 4-3, ending their dreams of an unbeaten run (they had a streak of 30 games). City ended up winning the league that season with 100 points, but not without two defeats (to Liverpool and Manchester United) blotting their copybook. Chelsea, under Jose Mourinho, managed a 40-game unbeaten run through October 2005, followed by Arsenal's 30 matches through October 2002. Liverpool became just the fourth team to record 30 straight unbeaten games in the Premier League following their victory over Crystal Palace in November 2019, in a run that started after their loss against Manchester City in January 2019. But Jurgen Klopp's side's streak ended on February 29, 2020 after a shock 3-0 loss against relegation battlers Watford. It should come as no surprise to find that Jose Mourinho figures prominently at the top of the Premier League charts when it comes to making a fortress out of a home. The Portuguese built his reputation on the sturdiest of foundations, with solidity at the back allowing those further up the field to flourish. Few visitors to Stamford Bridge during his time as Chelsea manager found a solution to the many challenges that the Blues posed. Between March 2004 and October 2008, an 86-game unbeaten run was enjoyed by the west London heavyweights in their own backyard. That remarkable sequence took in reigns from four managers – Claudio Ranieri, Mourinho, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari – with Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ the last team to beat Chelsea before a Xabi Alonso winner for Liverpool finally brought the Blues back down to earth. Liverpool enjoyed a similar run of their own that also included a Premier League title triumph as they went 68 games without coming unstuck on Merseyside between April 2017 and January 2021. A title-winning era for Manchester City also makes the top five of longest unbeaten home runs, while Sir Alex Ferguson boasts two entries from his legendary stint as Manchester United manager. Date of run Team Matches unbeaten February 2004 - October 2008 Chelsea 86 April 2017 - January 2021 Liverpool 68 December 2010 - December 2012 Manchester City 37 December 1998 - December 2000 Manchester United 36 December 1994 - November 1996 Manchester United 35 Given how inconsistent Manchester United have been in more recent times, since Sir Alex Ferguson headed off into retirement back in 2013, they can take heart from boasting the Premier League’s longest unbeaten away run. They would, of course, swap that record in a heartbeat for a long-awaited piece of silverware, but positives need to be taken at Old Trafford in any form. Man Utd set the record for longest unbeaten away run in English Football League history 🙌28 away games unbeaten. pic.twitter.com/BPTgePGJPO Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was the man to oversee another entry in the history books for the Red Devils, with the 1999 Treble winner guiding his side through 29 games on the road without coming unstuck between February 2020 and October 2021. That run was ended by a disappointing 4-2 reversal at Leicester and Solskjaer was out of a job by the end of November. Arsenal’s fabled ‘Invincibles’ went 27 matches without suffering any kind of travel sickness between April 2003 and October 2004 – when Wayne Rooney ended their 49-game unbeaten run in the top flight. The Gunners also completed the entire 2001-02 season without suffering an away defeat, while Liverpool went 13 months without losing on the road when chasing down a first Premier League title and Chelsea made it through 20 games in the first of their post-Mourinho eras.

383,https://www.goal.com/en/news/martinelli-saka-smith-rowe-arsenal-petit-best-in-world/blt109bdc793962e3fb,"Saka can become 'one of the best in the world', says Petit as former Arsenal midfielder also impressed by Martinelli and Smith Rowe","Arsenal have a lot of exciting young talent at their disposal right now, with Emmanuel Petit of the opinion that Bukayo Saka boasts the potential to become “one of the best players in the world”. The Gunners have always been prepared to show faith in academy graduates, while also investing heavily in potential stars of the present and future, with the likes of Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli also gracing their books. Petit, who won a Premier League and FA Cup double in 1997-98 during a three-year stint in north London, is among those expecting big things from a promising squad that continues to head in the right direction under Mikel Arteta. Asked by GOAL to pick out the hottest prospect in Arsenal’s squad, Petit – speaking in association with Lord Ping – said: “Saka. Since he came into the first team, he has been a hit. I love this guy. I love his mentality, I love his behaviour, I love his sweetness. “I love as well his skills on the pitch because he looks like a baby but he plays like an experienced player. He has got so much responsibility on his shoulders, especially after what happened at the Euros and the criticism he received, the stuff on social networks. He is still young this guy and he has managed this situation with so much maturity. It’s the same on the pitch. Bukayo Saka. Arsenal's starboy 🌟 pic.twitter.com/lPtUDNJdeA “For me, he could become one of the best players in the world in the next few years if he is still improving the way he is. Because of his mentality and professional approach, while his ambition is so high as well, I can see him improving a lot again. He is young and one of the most important players at Arsenal. “When you look at the other young players, the young guns have been so impressive in terms of taking responsibility on the pitch and taking the keys of the team – instead of the experienced players. “I can see Saka improving a lot in the next few years, but also you look at Martinelli, you look at Smith Rowe, these young players can be the future of Arsenal. I have also been very impressed with Martinelli. He has got so much speed in his game and is technically good as well after so many months of injuries. He is becoming a proper player for Arsenal.” Arteta always said that it was going to take a while for him to turn Arsenal’s fortunes around, with the emphasis being placed on youth requiring experience to be acquired before consistency was added to collective efforts. The same is true for those that have been drafted in from elsewhere, with the likes of Thomas Partey taking a while to find their feet in English football before coming good in a 2021-22 campaign that has a top-four finish and Champions League qualification very much on the cards. Petit feels the Gunners have found the right formula, particularly in the engine room that he once dominated alongside fellow countryman Patrick Vieira. The 1998 World Cup winner said when asked if he is happy with Arsenal’s midfield and the development of Ghana star Partey: “Yes, very happy. Even with [Albert Sambi] Lokonga when he started at the beginning of the season, he looked good as well. “If you look at Thomas Partey, he is not the same rock that he was at Atletico in midfield. It is not a surprise that his partner in midfield, [Granit] Xhaka, is now back at his best level as well. We don’t talk about that guy anymore with red cards and stupid fouls or silly behaviour, this is not the case now for weeks. It is no surprise either that Partey has become a hit for Arsenal. “Arteta has made a huge impression with this team because individuals have been very impressive. You talk about Saka on the right wing, but also about Partey as a holding midfielder who can play box-to-box. “The defence as well – [Aaron] Ramsdale, [Ben] White, even [Takehiro] Tomiyasu at right-back has made a big impression as well. It’s not a surprise that Arsenal are getting better and better because individuals are getting better and better. “Thomas Partey has been a rock. When he came back from the Africa Cup [of Nations] he got sent off straight away at the Emirates [against Liverpool], but he worked a lot in training and with the right attitude and the right mentality. Now, when you look at his displays against Manchester City and Liverpool, he is a proper international player. This is exactly what Arsenal have needed for ages.” The Gunners, who sit fifth in the Premier League table at present while boasting games in hand on all of those directly around them in the quest to finish fourth, will be back in action on April 4 when taking in a short trip to London rivals Crystal Palace.

A move away from Molineux could still be on the cards for the 24-year-old, with the next deadline not due to pass until August 31. Mikel Arteta and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remain in the market for added creativity, with Neves said to be an option that both are considering due to his ability and Premier League experience. Neves is aware of the rumours he is generating but, after a 2-1 pre-season win over Coventry, claims to be turning a deaf ear. He told reporters: ""When you want to play at the highest level of football you have to be ready. ""You need to be ready to have 30 days of holiday each season, that’s not a problem. It’s my job and I need to work hard. I had a great time with family and now I’m completely focused here, to be fit for the start of the Premier League. It’s about pre-season and hard work – getting fit for the Premier League. That’s the main thing. ""We are getting the ideas of the new coach and I think we are doing well. We have a lot to improve but I think we are doing a great job. We still have two weeks – it’s a good time to train and improve. Let’s go for it! ""We are working all together. The players from the national teams came back one week ago and you can see already the results on the pitch. ""We’ll improve a lot in the two weeks in front of us and that’s the main target, improve as much as we can for the first game. It’s the Premier League and everyone knows every team is a hard game. Leicester will be a really good test for us. ""The main thing is to work hard in these two weeks to get completely concentrated on what we have to do, and fit to try and get the first three points of the season."" Neves has been with Wolves since the summer of 2017, having been  lured away from Porto. He starred as promotion out of the Championship was secured in his debut campaign, with a reputation established for scoring spectacular goals. Neves is now up to 176 appearances for the West Midlands outfitwhile earning 22 caps for his country, and is considered to  still have plenty of potential to be unlocked.

Midfielder Rice, who saw his stock hit new heights last summer after guiding the Hammers into Europe and then England to the final of Euro 2020, has only seen his reputation soar further this term, as his club make serious inroads into the Europa League. He is expected to be a key figure to the Three Lions' World Cup hopes at Qatar 2022 later this year too, but despite the interest of Chelsea and Manchester United among other big suitors, Moyes insists that West Ham will not sell, even at an eye-watering price. ""The first thing to say is that he is not for sale,"" Moyes told his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's clash with Everton. ""But if you are interested, it will be north of that, because £100m ($131m) was cheap last summer and £150m just now would be minimum - but he is not for sale."" ""I look at what Tottenham did with Harry Kane, albeit it in a different way. They said, 'no, there is a price and if someone wants to pay the price, then we'd probably do it. If they don't then he's not going anywhere'. That's it, they have kept him. ""There will be times when players have got the power, but at the moment we have got Declan on the best part of a three-and-a-half-year contract - just like Tottenham have got Harry Kane on a contract and they control what happens."" If West Ham intend to echo Tottenham's stance from last year, then the Hammers could be in for a protracted stand-off with their star man, particularly if Rice desires a move to find Champions League football. Spurs striker Kane famously wanted to move to Manchester City, only for a succession of big-money offers to be knocked back in north London. Rice however is likely to be more immediately focused on securing long-awaited silverware with West Ham, who face Lyon on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.

Said tweak to the rules and regulations of elite competition was trialled during a return to competitive action after a coronavirus-enforced lockdown in 2020. Many managers have pushed for it to be reintroduced since then, with those calls being heeded at a shareholders meeting on Thursday. A statement from the Premier League on the organisation's official website reads: “Clubs agreed to change the rules relating to substitute players. “From next season, clubs will be permitted to use five substitutions, to be made on three occasions during a match, with an additional opportunity at half-time. “A total of nine substitutes can be named on the team sheet."" OFFICIAL: Premier League teams will be able to make five substitutions per match from next season 🔄 pic.twitter.com/9F0tTXe3N2 Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers is among the first to have been quizzed on the changes, with the Foxes boss saying: “Certainly having experienced it, I’m very much in favour of it. “At the beginning I was in favour of three, but having had a look at it, primarily for the health of the players, five works much better.” Previously, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel had been strong advocates of a return to five substitutes, while Burnley boss Sean Dyche was an opponent to the idea, insisting that it would be a move to favour the elite clubs. The dates for the summer transfer window have also been confirmed by the Premier League. That market will open for business on June 10, before closing again at 11pm BST on September 1 in line with other European leagues.

387,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lionel-messi-net-worth-salary-contract-sponsors-charity/oo0qu9cail971no5jkcii7x3h,What is Lionel Messi's net worth and how much does the Barcelona legend & PSG star earn?,"Lionel Messi became the best-paid player in La Liga in November 2017 by agreeing a new Barcelona deal to extend his stay at Camp Nou until 2021. The Argentina international is one of the most recognisable faces and lucrative earners in football, and is now undertaking a new challenge at Paris Saint-Germain after agreeing a two-year deal with the Ligue 1 giants. But exactly how much is Messi worth? While it's difficult to get an exact figure, we can accumulate plenty of information from what has been reported and compare his earnings to his rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi's net worth is estimated to be around  £309m ($400m) as of 2021. These figures are speculative, though, especially as his business interests tend not to be widely publicised. Forbes ranked Messi first among athletes on their list of the 100 highest-earning athletes of 2019, putting his income for the year at $127 million (£98m), and fourth overall, making him the best-earning footballer and athlete in the world. His position dropped to third in Forbes' 2020 list, behind Ronaldo and tennis star Roger Federer, in a year that saw many industries take a hit as a consequence of the global Covid-19 pandemic. However, Ronaldo was back up in Forbes' 2021 list, with total earnings of $120 million. Former UFC Featherweight and Lightweight champion Conor McGregor was first on the list with $180 million earned.  After agreeing a deal with PSG, it is expected that Messi will receive in the region of €30 million-35 million (£25m-30m/$35m-$41m) per season during his time at the Ligue 1 side, while there will also be team and individual bonuses. His last contract at Barcelona was reportedly worth a net £500,000 ($610k/€565k) a week and before signing that deal, Messi was estimated to be on around £336,000 ($410k/€397k) a week.   Much like Ronaldo, Messi's many sponsorship deals are too numerous to list in their entirety but the most significant is with the makers of his boots. Their rivalry continues in the battle between Nike (Ronaldo) and Adidas (Messi) off the pitch. A couple of months or so after Ronaldo signed a ""long-term"" deal with Nike in 2016 that is rumoured to be similar to the lifetime agreement penned by basketball star LeBron James - and potentially worth $1 billion - Messi, lo and behold, did similar with Adidas. The exact terms were not disclosed, but reports in Spain suggest it will take him through at least until the end of his playing career. Messi has also been part of prominent campaigns with Pepsi, Gillette and Turkish Airlines. As part of their 2019 celebrity rich list, Forbes valued his endorsements at $35m(£27m) for that year in total. It has stayed around the same, with the 2021 list stating his off-field earnings stood at $33m. More recent sponsorship partnerships include brands such as Lays, SikSilk, Leafty, Jacob & Co. and Gatorade.   Part of Messi's appeal, of course, is his image as a pure footballer who takes little interest in the lavish lifestyle available to him off the field. His apparent lack of desire to branch out into other ventures and create a personal brand has in some ways become a brand in itself, and is attractive to sponsors. But while Messi is not known to push lines of underwear, shoes and fragrances like Ronaldo, he has invested in property. Around his birthplace of Rosario in Argentina, for example, he has put money into the Azahares del Parana project (a set of gated communities out of the city) as well as an apartment building in the city centre. With his playing days approaching their conclusion, Messi has expanded his interest intot the lifestyle and fashion industry, with The Messi Store flogging clothing. Like many footballers, Messi has also dipped his toe into the investment worlds of cryptocurrency and NFTs, working in partnership with Ethernity, a company which also works with Pele and Luka Modric among others. There's almost certainly much more than that, but - as tends to be the case with Messi - it is kept pretty private.    As is the case with his business interests, Messi's charity work is considerable but tends to be focused through sources and ventures he trusts. He has his own organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which he asked for donations to instead of wedding gifts when he married long-term partner Antonella Roccuzzo. The initiatives Messi backs are generally related to vulnerable children and their healthcare, and he was appointed an ambassador for Unicef in 2010 having worked with them since 2004.   Messi boasts extremely popular Facebook and Instagram pages  but is not on Twitter, save for a 'Team Messi' account created by sponsors Adidas. He does, however, play second fiddle to Ronaldo when it comes to social media presence. Messi has the second-most popular Facebook page among athletes of any sport, with 105 million likes. Interestingly, he moved ahead of Dwayne Johnson on  Instagram to become the second most-followed male celebrity, with 304 million followers - after Ronaldo.

His £13 million(€15m/$18m) move back to the Premier League means that he must re-adjust to the English game, but it hasn't altered his appetite for business. The Portugal star has more than his fair share of sponsorship deals and enterprises across a variety of industries. But exactly how much is Cristiano Ronaldo now worth? It's difficult to say exactly but what is clear is that he will be firmly among the highest-paid athletes in the world for a while yet. Ronaldo is reported to have a net worth of around $500 million (£363m), but no one can really claim to have a bulletproof idea of what Ronaldo is worth except his management company. The estimated net worth of Ronaldo is slightly higher than that of his long-time rival Lionel Messi, though the Argentine has won more lucrative contracts in recent years. Ronaldo was ranked third on Forbes' 2021 list of the highest paid athletes in the world, with earnings of $120 million (£87m) - $50 million (£36m) of that was accrued through off-field ventures. On that occasion, the Portugal captain was behind UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who topped the list, and Messi, who was second. He was, however, ahead of the likes of Dak Prescott, LeBron James and Neymar, among others.   Ronaldo was initially expected to earn roughly£480,000 per week at Manchester United, but subsequent reports suggest that the salary is closer to £385,000 a week, or £20 million ($27m) a year. That figure represents a significant pay cut from his€30m ($34m/£26m) a year salary at Juventus. Prior to his switch to Juve, Ronaldo had signed a contract with Real Madrid in November of 2016, which was reported to be around £365,000 a week before bonuses. The Portugal captain's contract earnings mean that he is among the most lucratively rewarded footballers in the world. £0.63 £38 £2,291 £55,000 £385,000 £1.68 million £20 million *Based on reported Manchester United salary   Ronaldo's most significant sponsorship deal is with Nike, which was renewed around the same time he extended his last Madrid contract. The agreement with Nike is said to be the second lifetimecontract the sportswear giant has handed out after it offered similar terms to three-time NBA champion LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakersicon's deal has been speculated to be worth in excess of $1 billion in total, though exactly how that breaks down year-by-year is kept under wraps. Naturally, many have assumed that Ronaldo has signed on a comparable basis. Though the $1bn figure seems extraordinary, it is worth noting that sponsorship analysts Hookit estimated that Ronaldo's social-media presence alone was worth an incredible $474m to Nike in 2016. Prior to the new agreement, most sources had Ronaldo's annual earnings from Nike at a few million less than his old Madrid salary. Beyond Nike, Ronaldo has had endorsement deals with the likes of Armani, Tag Heuer, Egyptian Steel, Herbalife, Italia Independent, Clear,PokerStars and Castrol. More recent partnerships include LiveScore, MEO, ZujuGP, Uniecampus, Therabody and Clear.   As well as representing a number of major international brands, Ronaldo has created his own around the CR7 image. It is mostly centred on his underwear line but has also evolved to include various other clothing, leisure and home products. In addition, Ronaldo has a number of hotels - named Pestana CR7- in Portugal: one in the capital, Lisbon, and another in Funchal, his hometown on the island of Madeira. In late 2016, he expanded into gyms in a partnership with US health company Crunch,with the first outlet under the 'CR7 Fitness' name opened in Madrid. In March 2019, Ronaldo launched a hair transplant clinicin Spain called Insparya. ""This project is going to be a success, as we want to help the Spaniards and the Spanish economy,"" Ronaldo said at the opening. Expect to see the 36-year-old expand further into these area as his playing days draw to a close, with Michael Jordan proving that the names of the greatest players retain their value even after retirement.   It would be unfair to say Ronaldo does not strive to put some of his fortune towards the greater good - in fact, in 2015 he was recognised by Dosomething.org as the most charitable sports star in the world. The website acclaimed Ronaldo for using his fame to promote a variety of causes including childhood hunger, obesity and biodiversity and highlighted an $83,000 donation to a 10-year-old fan in need of brain surgery as well as a $165,000 contribution to a cancer centre in Portugal that treated his mother. After the 2016 Champions League final, it was reported that the ex-Manchester United man instructed his agent Jorge Mendes to donate his €600,000 win bonus to a non-governmental organisation. Ronaldo has supported the likes of UNICEF, World Vision and Save the Children in the past. A message of hope to the children affected by the conflict in Syria. @SavetheChildren pic.twitter.com/Zsdvu2nuXd — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) In 2016, Ronaldo recorded a message for the children affected by the conflict in Syria and made what Save the Children described as a ""generous"" donation to their cause. In 2021, in partnership with Nike, Ronaldo helped restore an old football pitch in his hometown of Funchal in order to allow a new generation of young footballers to hone their skills. In the same year, the Portuguese funded 24 scholarships to the eCampus Universita.    According to Hookit, Ronaldo became the first athlete to reach a combined 200 million followers on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. As of January 2022, his overall following across those platformswas 641 million. His Facebook page, in particular, is by far the most popular of any athlete on the platform. Ronaldo has over 150 million followers - far more than Messi's 105million and even further ahead of the top non-footballer, Dwayne Johnson, also known as The Rock, who is back on 59million. On Instagram, meanwhile, Ronaldo also leads the way as the most-followed person with 395 million followers. That places him second overall, behind only the official Instagram account, having gone ahead of Selena Gomez, The Rockand Ariana Grande. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

389,https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-net-worth-salary-contract-psg/1kvfsexg0npxf15gn60ol0zknl,What is Neymar's net worth and how much does the PSG star earn?,"Neymar  had not even touched the halfway point in his footballing career when he found himself among the best-paid and most marketable athletes on the planet. The PSG star has already scored over 300 goals at club level and hit over a half-century for his country, with his decision to leave Barcelona for Paris making him the highest earner in European football. The former Santos starlet is well on his way to becoming one of the wealthiest sportsmen of his era, but how do his earnings stack up when compared to the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo today? Neymar's net worth stood at $95 million in 2020 according to   Forbes   - a considerable figure, butstill considerably less than Ronaldo and Messi. It is still an impressive figure for his age and, considering hisearning power, should continue to rise between his PSG salary and various endorsements. His status on the pitch and enduring popularity, particularly in Brazil, off it should ensure that the former Santos prodigy follows in the footsteps of his rivals and goes on to become one of the richest players of his generation.  According to information uncovered by Football Leaks  , Neymar initially earnedan astonishing €36.8 million (£32m/$41m) a year at Parc des Princes- over €700,000 a week - when he joined in 2017. That dwarfedthe €300,000-a-week deal he signed with Barca in 2016 and movedhim comfortably ahead of Ronaldo and Messi. However, by 2020, Neymar had dropped below Messi in terms of earnings according to   Forbes  ,  though his reported $78 million a year salary was still higher than Ronaldo's at Juventus. Neymar's PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe is some way behind those three, but the World Cup winner's earning power is now on par with that of players such as Paul Pogba andMohamed Salah.   In 2016,  Forbes  estimated Neymar's earnings from endorsements at $21 million (€18m) annually, making him - based on his Barca salary at the time - the only active footballer earning more money off the pitch than on it. Whereas Ronaldo and Messi's endorsements at that point accounted for 36% and 34% of their income respectively, Neymar's accounted for 61% of his pay. That has changed now he has joined PSGbut still speaks to his status as a marketing heavyweight - largely because of his huge presence in Brazil, where he appears on just about every product you can think of. Whereas Messi has not always been as popular as you might expect in Argentina and Ronaldo comes from Portugal, a much smaller country, Neymar is an idol to 200 million. For many years, Neymar was a Nike athlete, featuring prominently in their advertisement campaigns across the world, but, in 2020 he made the decision to end his partnership in order to work with Puma instead. The King is back !  @pumafootball   @PUMA   pic.twitter.com/E6rbvWrltM In teaming up with Puma, Neymar joins a roster which includes Antoine Griezmann and Sergio Aguero, and he follows in the footsteps of icons such as Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff and Pele. Some of his other many sponsorship deals include partnerships withGillette, Beats Electronics and Red Bull.   Neymar has turned his hand to a few endeavours other than playing football, including appearing in the new 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' movie and releasing his own emojis for download.   Neymar opened the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr in a neighbourhood he spent part of his childhood in, Jardim Gloria, in the city of Praia Grande. It is a facility that aims to help transform the lives of poorer children in the region through educational, artistic and sporting initiatives that aid their development and give them a chance to reach their full potential. The complex serves over 2,000 such kids and their families. ""I could not come to Brazil and not visit [the institute],"" Neymar said in 2017 during a trip home to attend his sister's birthday party. ""It is my family's dream and I am always happy every time I visit. It makes me want to keep growing this and doing this the right way."" In 2020, Neymar  donated 5 million Brazilian real to charity in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.  The money was split between UNICEF and a benefit fund in Brazil. He has also contributed to causes devoted to the procurement of clean water sources. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He has won over 30 trophies during his playing career and is also Sweden's record international goalscorer. As a result of his immense ability, he has earned millions in wages from his various clubs and signing-on fees, but he is also a shrewd businessman with numerous interests. Goal  investigates how much Ibrahimovic earns, his sponsorship deals and net worth. Ibrahimovic's net worth is reported to be in the region of £110 million, which has been acquired during a career spanning two decades. In 2014, Forbes named Ibrahimovic as the 12th highest paid athlete in the world, and his business endeavours since then have helped keep him among the top earners. However, his earning power has decreased dramatically as he contends with the advance of time, dropping to 30th in Forbes' 2017 list of highest earning athletes and he has dropped out of the top 100 as of 2019. Ibrahimovic is one of the highest earners in Major League Soccer, pulling in a sum of $7.2 million (£6m) a season with LA Galaxy. That works out at around $138,000 a week or $600,000 a month and while it is a reduction on his salary at Manchester United, it is still a nice amount. Of course, his earnings are not solely acquired through his football contracts and he has other revenue streams such as endorsement deals. Between 2004 and 2014, Ibrahimovic was an official Nike Mercurial Athlete, meaning he was heavily involved in the promotion of the brand - and well paid for doing so. However, since the launch of his own brand A-Z Sportswear in 2016, he has not been an official ambassador for any clothing company. Ibrahimovic had a boot sponsorship deal with Adidas in 2016-17, but returned to Nike in 2017 and currently wears Nike Mercurial football boots. As he does not have an ambassadorial role with Nike, he does not post photos of their products on Instagram or Twitter, like many of their other athletes. For the past few years, Ibrahimovic has promoted Volvo cars, appearing in some of their television adverts, and even made a public appearance in his homeland at their factory in Sweden in September 2017. He also advertises numerous other products including Vitamin Well sports drinks, Microsoft Xboxand Nivea. Want to be in my shoes? I’ll do you one better, you can wear my underwear.

Their desire is ""to make sports accessible to everyone"", and is a collaboration between the footballer andPetter Varner, head of the Norwegian clothinggiant Varner. When he was at PSG, he also launched Ibrahimovic Parfums, with the Swede working together withOlivier Pescheux, a world-leading perfume maker from Givaudan in Paris, to create his own signature scents for men and women. He even had his own Android game, Zlatan Legends, a free-to-download game that offered in-app purchases. It is a quasi-sports game that involves a strange blend of football and racing where you can compete online with other players.

A post shared by  IAmZlatan  (@iamzlatanibrahimovic) on  Oct 16, 2015 at 3:01am PDT Ibrahimovic has worked with the UN World Food Programme (WFP)for many years, helping promote campaigns to help increase awareness of the suffering of people across the world. One of their campaigns was called 805 Million Names and involved the footballer tattooing the names of 50starving individuals onto his skin ahead of a game forPSG. “Wherever I go people recognize me, call my name, cheer for me,” he said at a press conference in February 2015. “But there are names no one cares to remember, that no one cheers for: the 805 million people suffering from hunger in the world today."" “I have supporters all over the world. From now on I want this support to go to the people who suffer from hunger, they are the real champions. So whenever you hear my name, you will think of their names."" In 2014, he also paidfor a team of disabled footballers from Sweden to go to the INAS World Football Championships. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Branded a 'Chelsea reject' andscoffed at for his £35 million ($47m) move from Roma in 2017, the Egyptian has proved any doubters wrong with his electrifying and record-setting form for Liverpool. A man of humble nature and beginnings – growing up in small village Nagrig in Egypt – he is both a club and international hero, having sent his country to their first World Cup in almost three decades back in 2018. His monetary value has risen alongside his global standing on the field, with another lucrative contract being mooted in the present, and he now forms part of an elite group at the very top of a world game. How, though, do Salah's earnings stack up? Net worth: £66 million ($90m) Date of birth: June 15, 1992 Place of birth: Nagrig, Egypt Source of wealth: Football contracts, endorsement deals, investments  Estimates of Salah's net worth vary wildly, but the general consensus is that he now stands somewhere around the £66 million ($90m) mark. That figures still pales in comparison to the likes of Lionel Messi (£440m/$600m) and Cristiano Ronaldo (£367m/$500m), but he has shot up a sporting chart on the back of some stunning exploits at Anfield. Time is also on his side when it comes to future earning power, with his profile and marketing appeal allowing him to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some illustrious contemporaries. Upon signing for Liverpool, Salah put pen-to-paper on a £90,000-per-week deal at Anfield – with those terms doubling the wages he had been earning at Roma, but seeing him sit some way down a Premier League salary list. It did not take him long to make a mark in England, with a 44-goal debut campaign earning him the PFA Player of the Year award a new five-year contract in the summer of 2018 worth £200,000-a-week. He is said to pull in a further £18m ($25m) through bonuses, £12m ($16m) in endorsements and is the fifth-highest paid player on the planet. There is also plenty of talk to be found regarding another pay increase for Salah, with his current deal due to expire in 2023. He has played down reports suggesting that ""crazy"" demands are being made, but speculation suggests that any extension on Merseyside could be worth between £400,000 and £500,000-a-week. Salahhas a number of personal sponsorship deals with major brands including Vodafone for his image rights, Pepsi, Uber and electronics company Oppo. He wears Adidas football boots and has been used in promotional imagery by the sportswear giant. Salah is known for giving back to several communities in Egypt, and especially that of his hometown Nagrig. The forwardis still wholly committed to giving back to his village away from the pitch, going to remarkable lengths when constructing a hospital and giving back to his native country. “Salah is a refined person who, despite his popularity, has never forgotten about his town,"" Maher Shatiyah, manager of Mohamed Salah Charity Foundation and Mayor of Nagrig, has told SunSport. I just visited @MoSalah hometown and am amazed about the amount of fake information circulating about his generosity. According mayor&his friends he didn't build any mosq, hospital nor football court. The school he paid for is under construction pic.twitter.com/2dQiBOUaF1 — Ariane Lavrilleux (@AriaLavrilleux) ""[He has provided] many forms of assistance, the first of which was a series of foodstuff outlets under the municipality’s management, as well as the town’s first ambulance unit. ""Salah had always subsisted unable fellow villagers but wanted to [formalise] that assistance. ""The establishment of the charity caters for a larger number of families, [he spends between] £2,000 and £3,500 monthly."" Though there has been some misinformation about what Salah has or hasn't actually done in Egypt, he is dedicated to improving Nagrig. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Nearly two decades in the Premier League, including a trophy-laden 13 years at Old Trafford, combined with a stint in Major League Soccer have ensured a rewarding lifestyle for the striker. His status as one of England's greatest ever players was sufficient to attract sponsors from across the planet and he has collaborated with a variety of industry brands. Now on the other side of his playing career and navigating the world of coaching, GOAL takes a look at Rooney's net worth, salary, sponsorships and more. Net worth: £100m - £120m Source of wealth Football contracts, endorsement deals, business investments Date of birth: October 24, 1985 Country of birth: England Rooney's net worth is estimated at around the £100 million ($136m) to £120 million ($163m) mark based on his career earnings so far. The Englishman had the chance to bolster his fortune massively by moving to the Chinese Super League a number of years ago, but chose to turn down that gold rush opportunity. Instead, a brief return to Everton transpired, which was followed by lucrative move to D.C. United in North America's MLS, where he was one of the best paid players. He then moved to Derby County in 2020, where he was interim player-manager before taking the managerial reins on a permanent basis. Rooney was reportedly paid a basic wage of £250,000 a week at Manchester United that rose to £300,000 when the value of his commercial rights was accounted for. It was due to run until the summer of 2019, meaning Rooney could have continued to bank it to the tune of over £30 million in total, but instead he chose to take a pay cut to rejoin Everton in search of first-team football. At Everton,Rooney earned around £150,000 a week, though that is still a considerable outlay for the Toffees. His contract was so big, in fact, that United allowed him to leave on a free transfer rather than demanding a fee. It was widely agreed that Rooney was the highest-paid player in the Premier League untilPaul Pogba bagged a contract said to be worth £290,000 a week in base salary. The MLS Player Association website indicates thatRooney earned $3.5m (£2.6m) a year as a Designated Player at D.C. United, which means he was earning in the region of $70,000 a week. And, according to the Sun, he wason a similar figure at Derby County, with the Championship club content to match the star's wages in order to secure his services. If we take the figure of £2.6m to be Rooney's annual salary at Derby, he will be earning approximately £50,000 a week andover £200,000 a month. His earnings work out at around£300 an hour, or £7,120 a day. Rooney's boot sponsorship deal during his playing days was with Nike and it was reportedly worth £1 million a year. Late in 2015, it was reported that Adidas were trying to snap Rooney up months after taking over the production of Manchester United's kit, but that switch did not materialise. When Rooney was facing scrutiny for alleged infidelity in British newspapers in 2010, the Daily Mail estimated the value of his four main endorsement deals - with Nike, Harper Collins, EA Sports and Coca-Cola - was worth over £2.5m. Coca-Cola, however, ended its £600,000-a-year relationship with him amid the allegations. Slightly bizarrely, United also started to push players into spin-off movie trailers for a brief period in the late 2010s - and none more so than Rooney while he was at the club. He was front and centre of an 'Independence Day: Resurgence' promo and saw his ageing and downturn in form used to push the new Wolverine film in February 2017. While it is not a sponsorship, Rooney teamed up with Amazon Prime for the 2022 documentary 'ROONEY', directed by Matt Smith, who has also worked on programmes involving David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Gordon Ramsey.  Wayne Rooney has a combined social media following of 62 million across a number of platforms. Clearly, Rooney's fanbase have been keen to follow his adventures, as he boasts just under 15millionfollowers on Instagram. He also shares old throwback photos of himself and the old England team, as well as pictures of his wife Coleen and his children. 💭 Playoffs it is! Thanks to all the fans for your continued support 👏🏼👍🏼 #DCU  A post shared by (@waynerooney) on  He boasts a further 31m likes on his official Facebook account, making him one of the most well-supported footballers on the platform, and over 17m on Twitter. Beyond his personal property investment and spending on things like cars and racehorses, Rooney seems to keep his business decisions pretty low key. In 2013, he was reported as being part of a partnership, along with cricketer Kevin Pietersen and businessman-turned-TV-personality Theo Paphitis, that invested in small businesses. As far as Rooney's overall worth goes the sums were pretty low, with each party putting in around £200,000. Occasionally other interests pop up here and there. One that emerged in recent years was the backing of a hotel in Newcastle, which has been supported by a number of Newcastle United players past and present as well as a few other recognisable Premier League names. Like a number of other footballers, Rooney has also invested money into NFTs, notably teaming up with DOSBRAK and 'Block Asset'.  Rooney works with a number of charities close to him and his wife, Coleen, in the north-west of England and they benefited hugely from the veteran's Manchester United testimonial match in 2016. The Rooneys donated all of the £1.2m proceeds from the match against Everton to four organisations - the NSPCC, for whom Wayne is an ambassador, Claire House Children's Hospice, Alder Hey Children's Charity and the Manchester United Foundation. According to the Manchester Evening News , the Manchester United Foundation used the cash to set up a Wayne Rooney scholarship to help children from deprived areas go into further education. Through his own Wayne Rooney Foundation, Rooney hoped to raise £5m for various causes in 2017. On November 4 201, Rooney announced that he would be returning to the England team following his retirement from the side in 2017 for a one-off appearance to raise money for the Wayne Rooney Foundation. He put on the Three Lions shirt one last time for the charity friendly fixture against the U.S. National Team on November 15 of that year. ""I am truly humbled and hugely excited to play for England at Wembley again,""Rooneysaid in a statement to the FA. ""I would like to thank Gareth Southgate and The FA for inviting me back and helping to support my Foundation in the process. ""Playing for England was the greatest honour of my career – so winning my 120th, and final, cap will be a particularly special moment for me. It’s fitting that the match will be against the USA and I hope that both sets of fans enjoy the game."" table.tableizer-table { font-size: 14px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #00a9ce; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; } Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Still only in his early 20s, the England international has earned plaudits for his performances on the pitch and he is slowly but surely collecting trophies under Pep Guardiola. His continued success, despite still being in the early stages of his career, has helped him acquire wealth, either through rewarding contracts or lucrative endorsement deals. It can be difficult to establish exactly how much a player is worth, given the private nature of financial details, but things such as salary and so on give an idea. Goal  takes a look at Sterling's net worth, how much he earns, endorsement deals and more. Sterling's net worth is around £28 million ($36m) according to the Sunday TImes Rich List 2020. As you would expect, the player's wealth has chiefly been earned through his football contracts at Liverpool and Manchester City, but he has also secured lucrative endorsement deals. Sterling is some way behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in terms of net worth - both players are believed to be worth in the region of £200 million ($260m) - but he still has plenty of years ahead of him to make up ground.  Sterling put  pen to paper on a three-year contract extension with Man City in 2018which will see him earn roughly £15 million a year. The deal sees the forward commit to the club until 2025. The forward earns £300,000 ($390k)a week from the new contract, a figure which places him among the Premier League's highest earners. Sterling's salary is around the same level of Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba. To put Sterling's earning into perspective, he gets around £42,740 per day or £1,780 an hour. A breakdown can be seen below. Sterling is sponsored by Nike and regularly appears in promotional photos and videos for the sportswear giant.

As well as sportswear and fashion, Sterling has also partnered with video game company Electronic Arts (EA). In 2014, for example, he was prominent in the promotion of the game 'The Sims 4', taking part in video and photo shoots. Raheem Sterling arrived at training today in a £12,000 Smart Car.  pic.twitter.com/YZ1NZvTirv Sterling has been pictured driving a variety of cars, with the  Daily Starsuggesting that he had one for every day of the week. Among the vehicles in his garage over the years are: a number of different coloured Range Rovers, an Audi S6, an Audi Q7, a Mercedes C63, a smart car and a Bentley said to be worth £500k.   Sterling devotes a lot of his spare time to charity work and social activism, particularly concerning issues of discrimination and race. He has worked with anti-discrimination bodies such as Kick It Out and groups which endeavour to break down barriers to integration, such as Football Beyond Borders. As well as that, he has helped to raise awareness of blood cancer, working closely with the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust after taking a personal interest in the struggle of Damary Dawkins. In June 2017 he was one of a number of footballers to make a donation towards those affected by the tragic Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed the lives of 71 people. Sterling boasts a considerable following on a variety of social media platforms and regularly shares updates on his pages. The 25-year-old has 2.5 million followers on Twitter,over 7.3 million  on Instagramand  2.3million on Facebook,which is a combined following of over 10 million. A post shared by Raheem Sterling x 😇 (@sterling7)  on  Apr 16, 2017 at 2:08pm PDT Sterling's main focus on social media, unsurprisingly, centres on match action, but he also provides a glimpse into his commercial work, activism and social life. His family features prominently too and he often posts photos of his partner  Paige Milianand his children. While Sterling's social media following is certainly substantial, it pales in comparison to superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, as well as his City team-mate Sergio Aguero.

394,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-gareth-bale-net-worth-and-how-much-does-the-real/1tjmcmypn6hgyzx3cb61ugmrw,What is Gareth Bale's net worth and how much does the Real Madrid star earn?,"Gareth Bale was thought by many to be Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid successor on the pitch, and he is beginning to rival him off it as well. The Welshman may not put himself as regularly in the public eye as his most famous team-mate but he has nevertheless curried favour with plenty of sponsors and earns a huge weekly wage at the Santiago Bernabeu. But exactly how does Bale stack up financially when compared to Ronaldo and the other top players in the world? Bale's net worth is £74 million ($90m), according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, which was a rise of £20m ($24m). Including endorsement deals and Real Madrid salary, the Wales international earned $34.5m (£27m) in 2018 according to Forbes, which made him the fourth highest-earning footballer in the world, behind Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. Bale is said to pocket around £350,000 a week after tax, with the  Guardian  claiming that once bonuses are accounted for he will earn £150 million over the duration of the deal. The rumour was, when Gareth Bale signed a new six-year deal at Real Madrid in October 2016, that Los Blancos had made him the best-paid player in the world. His reign, however, lasted only a week. Madrid were never going to be able to give Bale a pay rise without ensuring Ronaldo was kept happy by remaining the top dog in the Spanish capitaland, sure enough, the veteran signed his own six-year extension with just slightly better terms soon after.  Along with Lionel Messi, Bale has become the face of Adidas' football arm and reportedly signed a new deal with the company in 2014 worth £20m over six years. He has also featured prominently for Nissan in their Champions League campaigns and had a 12-month deal with Foot Locker in 2016. Bale is only scratching the surface when it comes to the personal businesses the likes of Ronaldo have set up to exploit their brand and prepare for a career away from football. A company called Primesure Limited has been established, however, to manage his own affairs. It has three shareholders; Bale himself owns 60 per cent of the company and his parents have 20 per cent each. Touchingly, according to the addresses listed on the company's accounts, Bale's parents appear to still live in the modest Cardiff home Gareth grew up in.   Again, it should be noted here that Bale's rise to stardom is more recent than that of Ronaldo, Messi and some of the players he now finds himself alongside in terms of salary. As such, most of his charitable endeavours thus far have focused on local issues close to him and his family. He supported the 'For Luca' campaign that aimed to raise £1.5m for a young boy who had suffered from severe meningitis to pay for prosthetic legs, and donated a signed Real Madrid shirt to help save a Cardiff scout group needing £250,000 to buy its headquarters.

With his his larger-than-life personality, his incredible social media draw and, of course, his talents on the field, Pogba is one of the most marketable players on the planet. It follows, therefore, that the Manchester United and World Cup winnerace commands a formidable wage - but just how does it stack up? Goal  takes a look at what Pogba earns and what is net worth is. Pogba's net worth has been estimated from £42.5m ($60m) up to £177m ($250m). Forbes  magazine reported in 2018 that Pogba was the fifth highest-earning footballer on the planet, netting in excess of $29 million (£23m) when earnings, sponsorship and bonuses were combined. That earning power put him behind only Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Gareth Bale when it comes to football. Estimates of his net worth, however, vary wildly. Unsurprisingly, given his status as one of the most expensive players in the history of football, Pogba commands one of the largest wages at Manchester United, with his basic salary coming in at £290,000 per week. He is contracted with the Red Devils until 2021, although his future at Old Trafford has now been rendered uncertain. When Alexis Sanchez arrived in 2018, he was presented with the most lavish contract of anyone at Old Trafford, with £350,000 flowing into his bank account each week before bonuses. Pogba does not have the opportunity to top up his income with image rights in the same way his team-mate does, as Manchester United have control of the majority of these. Nevertheless, over the course of his five-year deal, he stands to make over £75 million. Pogba’s only major sponsorship deal is with sportswear manufacturer  adidas  , with whom he signed a 10-year deal in 2016 worth a staggering £31 million ($40m). Pogba celebrated his 25th birthday by asking his Facebook followers to give money to the charity Save the Children, with the aim of raising £25,000. He has also been very active for charities previously, donating €100,000 to the International Red Cross while a Juventus player. In 2016, meanwhile, he took part in the BigShoe11 campaign along with Arsenal star Mesut Ozil and paid for surgeries for 11 Tanzanian children. Upon moving to Manchester United, his charity work has not stopped, helping out the club’s own Foundation as well as teaming up with the Red Devils to support Unicef. In November of 2017 he raised the issue of slavery in Libya by celebrating a goal by mimicking a man in chains. “While very happy to be back, my prayers go to those suffering slavery in Libya. May Allah be by your side and may this cruelty come to an end!” he told his followers. It was an action that prompted a “100-fold increase” in interest in the issue, according to Itayi Viriri of the International Organisation for Migration. He also has his own charity. The Pogba Foundation was launched in 2017 during a charity match in Colombia, which was organised by Juan Cuadrado. Brothers Florentin and Mathias are also involved in this. The aims of the foundation are “to make the world better and inspire others to do the same”. Pogba’s love of cars is well known. He has a fleet of luxury sports cars, the latest of which is a Rolls Royce Black Badge worth around £250,000. In November 2016, he bought a Mercedes GLS 4x4 worth £120,000. Additionally, he reportedly owns a Rolls Royce Dawn, a Maserati Quattroporte, an Audi RS6-R, a Lamborghini Aventador, a Chevrolet Camaro and a Bentley Continental GTC. In total, his collection is worth well in excess of £1.25 million ($1.6m). Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

396,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-diego-maradona-net-worth-how-much-former-argentina/mxtux7ln2ylq1okkrwpx2swyf,What is Diego Maradona's net worth and how much does the former Argentina star earn?,"Diego Maradona is without doubt one of the greatest footballers of all time, revered the world over for his phenomenal skills and feisty personality. His wondrous talent inspired Argentina to a World Cup triumph andbrought him across the world to clubs such Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Sevilla and Napoli. After hanging up his boots in the mid 1990s, Maradona transitioned into the world of coaching and has steered the fortunes of his country as well as clubs in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico. Such a glittering career would have brought all sorts of financial rewards, but how much exactly is  El Pibe de Oroworth?  Goal  takes a look. Maradona's net worth is estimated at $100,000 (£75,000), despite enjoying a playing career which spanned two decades and saw him ply his trade with the likes of Barcelona, Napoli and Boca Juniors. The World Cup winner may have inspired Napoli to two Serie A titles and a UEFA Cup in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he has been in a long-running dispute with the Italian government over taxes. Maradona told  Corriere della Serra  in 2016 that the outstanding tax bill had been paid, a claim that is at odds with the comments of Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis, who said in 2017 that the Argentine would be a club ambassador as soon as the dispute issettled. With a reported €37 million (£33m/$42m)left to pay the Italian authorities, Maradona's net worth has been estimated at $100,000 (£75,000) by the website  Celebrity Net Worth.  It is unclear how much Maradona is earning in his role as manager of Gimnasia de La Plata, which is a short-term deal until the end of the 2019-20 season. However, it is likely that he is being handsomely remunerated for his services. In his previous job as head coach of Dorados, Record reported that the former Argentina boss was paid $150,000(£118k) a month, which would have worked out at $1.6m (£1.25m) for the duration of the 11-month contract. Taking that figure as a Maradona's going rate, you can see a breakdown of that wage per week, day and so on in the table below. Prior to becoming Dorados boss he worked as a FIFA ambassador at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and had put pen to paper on a three-year contract to serve as chairman of Belarusian side Dinamo Brest. However, his venture in Belarus was brief as he made the switch to Mexico. As well as his coach's salary, Maradona also earns income through endorsement deals with different brands. A post shared by Diego Maradona Oficial (@maradona)  on  May 15, 2018 at 4:14am PDT Maradona has long been a partner of German sportswear giant Puma, who first began working with him during his playing days in the 1980s. He famously wore Puma football boots at three World Cup tournaments, including Argentina's 1986 triumph in Mexico, andhe wore blackout boots at the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Maradona had a dalliance with Japanese brand Mizuno in the mid 90s, but returned to Puma shortly afterwards and has been with them since, with Puma even releasing a range of boots in tribute to the star. As well as Puma, Maradona has had endorsement deals with Coca Cola, Hublot andKonami (as part of their Pro Evolution Soccer series).   Though it may be difficult to picture Maradona checking out social media on his phone, the 58-year-old is quite active on two platforms, namely Facebook and Instagram. Of the two, he seems to be a bit more active on his  Facebookpage, whichboasts - at the time of writing - 8.8million followers.Maradona's  Instagrampage lags behind, but with 5.6 million followers on that platform, he still has a considerable cyber fan-base. A post shared by Diego Maradona Oficial (@maradona)  on  Oct 30, 2018 at 5:27am PDT Despite being one of the best footballers of all time, Maradona's online appeal pales in comparison to his modern-day counterparts. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, for example,have hundreds of millions of followers on Instagram alone. Maradona's following iscomparable to that of Brazil great Pele, whose numbers are in the low millions. He generally uses his social media pages to share photos from the training ground, but it is also a platform he uses to pay tribute to footballers past and present, as well as indulging in the occasional bout of nostalgia for his own playing days. As well as that he sometimes shares advertisements for the products he endorses.   Maradona is not particularly known for his charity work, but he has participated in a number of charity football matches in aid of causes such as UNICEF. In 2010, he  helped raise $500,000for a children's charity at an event organised by one of his sponsorship partners, Hublot, doing so by taking part in a penalty shootout game.

397,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-david-beckhams-net-worth-and-what-endorsements-does/rn0i9g1tuc9k1us86m07nh20n,What is David Beckham's net worth and what endorsements does he have?,"Retirement from football has done nothing to weaken David Beckham's brand.If anything, the former England captain has grown even more popular since he hung up his boots and began to focus solely on his life off the pitch. Always a popular face with advertisers, Beckham's appeal has become an empire over the past few years. He has turned his hand to fashion, food and drink,  television, entertainment and more,and he continues to reap the rewards. He has shown little sign of slowing down and recently launched another new project -  Inter Miami, the Miami-based Major League Soccer franchise  - signalling his intention to make it one of the best teams in North America. But how fruitful have his numerous financial ventures been?  Goal  takes a look. David Beckham's net worth is usually estimated at around £300 million (or $450m), though figures often vary. That is partially a consequence of the fact that 'Brand Beckham' can also include his wife, Victoria, who runs her own fashion label. Interestingly, even the pair's children are already lucrative earners. For example, in 2014, the  Mail on Sunday  reported that David's then-12-year-old son Romeo was paid £45,000 for one day's work for Burberry.  According to the  Sun  , Beckham earned around £29 million in dividends from his company DB Ventures Limited over the course of 2016 and 2017, meaning he earned roughly £40,000 a day during that period. Documents filed at Companies House showed that Beckham was paid a dividend of £18.75m in 2017 from his company DB Ventures Limited, having previously received a £10.2m dividend in 2016. Taking the aforementioned £29m figure as a basis for analysis, the table below shows how much Beckham roughly earns, through DB Ventures, per year, month, week and day. As you can see, the retired footballer still earns well more than many of the top stars currently playing the game. * Note that the above figures are subject to change.   Beckham endorses a number of products, as is common practice among current and former footballers. One of his most successful recent campaigns was with clothing retailer H&M, for whom he appeared in a number of ads with comedian Kevin Hart. Also prominent are Beckham's deals with Tudor watches and Haig Club whisky, the latter of which he has promoted heavily on his social media accounts. There are numerous others past and present, including Breitling, Sainsbury's, Armani, Gillette, AIA Group and Pepsi Co. Of course,the man who made the Adidas Predator boots famous continues to work with the sporting apparel brand he was most associated with during his playing days and has helped launch a number of reboots.   Seven Global LLP seems to have been created around Beckham's lifestyle productsin partnership with the Global Brands Group, who work with a number of celebritieson their own lines. Footwork Productions, meanwhile, takes care of his name andimage rights. They come under the umbrella of DB Ventures, which is the overarching company responsible, as recent accounts put it, for the ""licensing and other forms of commercialisation of the 'David Beckham' brand"". Its parent company, in turn,is Beckham Brand Holdings Ltd, which is split equally between David, Victoria and the family'smanagement group headed by Simon Fuller. In January 2018, Beckham, along with his business partners,  launched a Miami MLS team- Inter Miami -that entered the North American league as an expansion team in 2020.   Beckham had been given the option to own a franchise team as part of the contract he signed with MLS when he joined the LA Galaxy in 2007 and he exercised that option in 2014. However, heis not the sole owner of the team and heads up an ownership group known as Miami Beckham United. As well as Beckham, the group consists of Simon Fuller, Marcelo Claure, Todd Boehly, Masayoshi Son and the Mas brothers, Jorge and Jose. You can read more about Beckham's Miami MLS team in  Goal  's explainer  here.   Beckham married Victoria Adams, who was then a member of the world-famous girl band Spice Girls and known by the moniker 'Posh Spice', in the summer of 1999 and the pair have been together since. The wedding took place on July 4 at Luttrellstown Castle, which is located in Clonsilla, a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. Thecouple's son Brooklyn was the ring-bearer and Beckham's former Manchester United team-mate Gary Neville served as best man. Shortly after getting married to Beckham, Victoria - like the other Spice Girls -launched a solo singing career as well as branching out into fashion and other business ventures.   Beckham has worked on a number of health initiatives in impoverished areas of the world, most prominently in his role as a UNICEF ambassador. He created his own fund for the organisation named '7', which raises money to support its work. He came under scrutiny in early 2017when a cache of emails was released in which Beckham appeared to be expecting a knighthood for his charity work, though UNICEF supported him by stating it was ""extremely proud"" of their partnership and grateful for his personal donations.   A big part of Brand Beckham in the 21st century, of course, has been the social-media following he has been quickly able to build since Facebook, Twitter and Instagram gained popularity. Beckham has 52 million likes on Facebook, good for fifth among all current and former athletes, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. His 63 million followers on Instagram place him in the top 40 accounts in the world on the platform, ahead of the likes of Justin Timberlake, Ronaldinho, Gareth Bale and Lady Gaga. Beckham is not on Twitter, but his wife Victoria has 12million followers and his son Cruz signed up for an account in late 2016. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

She currently captains her club Reign along with the current iteration of the USWNT, who claimeda historic fourth world title in France. She was a standout performer of that summer, winning the Golden Boot, Golden Ball and named Player of the Match for the final against the Netherlands. The winger isn't just an influence on the pitch, however, being an openly gay female footballer and consistently speaking out on topics such as LGBTQ+ rights and gender discrimination within sport. But how much is Rapinoe worth, and how much does she earn?  Goal  takes a look. Rapinoe's net worth is placed at $2 million (£1.58m) according to  Celebrity Net Worth. Though Rapinoe is one of her country's veteran players, she doesn't earn anywhere near as much as the likes of her team-mates in Alex Morgan or Julie Ertz, who are some of the highest-earning female soccer players, mainly due to their various endorsement deals. With the maximum salary in theNWSL (National Women's Soccer League) being $46,200 (£36K) per year, and with Rapinoe not having as many commercial or sponsorship deals as other USWNT members, it is safe to say that she earns a great deal less than  Morgan's reported $3.5m a year. According to  Players Wiki, they estimate that she earns around$168,000 (£133,000) a year. Rapinoe has a number of endorsement deals with various brands and companies, such as Nike, and has appeared in multiple commercials. She has also signed deals with Samsuing, as well as having appeared in advertisements for clothing company Wildfang, and has begun a partnership with medical device company DJO Global. The USWNT starappeared in television spots and print advertisements for Vitamin Water in 2016, and also featured in a Nike commercial that same year with Cristiano Ronaldo. Dear Lil’ Pinoe. Always believe in your game... I partnered with @ReignFC and @Microsoft to imagine what I’d say to my younger self if I could go back in time and give her some advice. Here’s to empowering today for tomorrow. https://bit.ly/2WuYwUp A post shared by  Megan Rapinoe  (@mrapinoe) on  Jun 9, 2019 at 12:41pm PDT She also has partnerships with Microsoft and uses her sponsorship deals to raise awareness about women's sport, as well as being an LGBT-identifying athlete. In total, at the time of writing, the midfielder had a following of 2.2 million on her  Instagram, followed by around 900,000 on her  Twitter. LFG and get some dome smooches! A post shared by  Megan Rapinoe  (@mrapinoe) on  Jun 20, 2019 at 7:50am PDT Her  Facebook page's reach expands to approximately 458,000. Rapinoe is a vocal advocate of women's football and is an outspoken activist on issues such as the gender pay gap, LGBTQ+ awareness and gender discrimination within the sport. The winger came out as a lesbian in 2012 and has done philanthropic work for theGLSEN (Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network)as well astheUnited States Olympic Committee. She became an ambassador forAthlete Ally, a non-profit organisation that centres on ending homophobia and transphobia in sports, in 2016. In 2016, she became the first white athlete to kneel during the national anthem in solidarity withColin Kaepernick, in order to draw awareness to social inequality in the United States. Rapinoe, in 2019, along with 27 of herUSWNT teammates, filed a lawsuit against theUnited States Soccer Federationaccusing it of gender discrimination, and has led the fight for equal pay between the men's and women's teams. She, along with teammate Morgan, were the first female footballers to join Juan Mata's  Common Goal initiative in which they are to donate 1 per cent of their salary to soccer-related charity. In 2019, Rapinoe  stated that she would reject an invitation to visit the White House if her team were to win the World Cup, embroiling her in a spat with the United States president on Twitter.

Having grown up a Tottenham fan and featuring in their youth side before eventually graduating to the first team in 2009, Kane had spells at the likes of Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester and Norwich before returning to north London and becoming his side's talisman. So how much has his career been worth so far?  Goal  takes a look at how lucrative Kane'sfootball journeyhas been. In June 2018, Kanesigned a new dealwith Tottenham that could see the striker’s net worth add up to £90 million by 2024. Kane a signed a fresh six-year dear at Tottenham in June of 2018 to ward off the prying handsof Real Madrid. The new contract makes him one of the club's highest-paid earners, which sees him earn £200,000 a week, which is almost double his previous salary. It's a stark contrast to his wages of £20,000 a week just four short years ago. In addition to the Golden Boot trophy, winners are awarded £1,000 per goal scored to be donated to a charity of their choice. Kane earned £25,000 in 2016 and £29,000 in 2017. Kane, like a number of top-class athletes, has a sponsorship deal with Nike. He wears Nike Hypervenom football boots and, following his 100th Premier League goal scored in February 2018, had the Hypervenom 3 boots launched in his honour. Earlier this year he featured in Nike's 'Nothing Beats a Londoner' commercial alongside other athletes based in the city, including Belgian international Eden Hazard and Olympic champion Mo Farah that aimed to highlight the diversity in the capital. Before the 2016 Euros, Kane was featured in adverts for Mars Bars and Beats by Dr. Dre headphones – the latter with Antoine Griezmann, Mario Gotze and Cesc Fabregas. He also features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series and was named as part of the Team of the Year in FIFA 18, joining the ranks of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He also, alongside ex-Fifth Harmony singer Camila Cabello, announced the winner of the 'Best International Male Solo Artist' at the 2018 Brit Awards held at the O2 Arena on February 21 (which went to Kendrick Lamar). A great night at the #Brits and an honour to present an award - @camila_cabello. #BritAwards A post shared by  Harry Kane  (@harrykane) on  Feb 21, 2018 at 2:58pm PST At the time of writing, the England international has 9m followers on  Instagram  , a platform that he updates regularly, giving an insight into his lifestyle;which appears to include plenty of social time with Spurs team-mate Dele Alli.

The forward's Twitter was propelled to status of internet sensation when he took to the social media platform to declare that he would be claiming a Premier League goal that was initially thought to have been scored by teammate Christian Eriksen. His declaration was the subject of much teasing and mockery by rival teammates and opposition supporters, however, as they saw it as an attempt to close the gap in the race to the Golden Boot award, which eventually went to Liverpool star Mohamed Salah. Another great away win.

400,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-kylian-mbappes-net-worth-and-how-much-does-the-psg/hlu8dohtt8uv14ick1270c517,What is Kylian Mbappe's net worth and how much does the PSG star earn?,"Kylian Mbappe may only be 23, but the Paris Saint-Germain attacker has already emerged as one of the game’s leading players, and a recent study by CIES Observatory suggests Mbappe is currently the most valuable player in the game. With his ability already world class and his potential still seemingly limitless, he commands a formidable fortune – but how does it stack up? Mbappe's net worth is reported to be just below €100 million (£90m/$110m), but it is difficult to arrive at a reliable estimate given his value continues to grow at an extraordinary rate. A recent estimate by FinApp suggests that he is worth around €71m(£60m/$80m), though that figure is liable to spiral in the months and years ahead. Indeed, according to Forbes, Mbappe earned over $30m (£25m) in 2019 alone, making him one of the highest earning athletes in the world. Paris Saint-Germain are paying Kylian Mbappe €20.7m (£17.6m/$23.2m) per year before tax, according to a biography published in May 2019. He earns just under €10m after tax asof the endof the2018-19 season and bythe time his contract, which runs until 2022, is up, it is believed that he will be earning over €18m per annum from his salary alone. It represents a massive leap from the €1m per year that he earned while with Monaco - and that's before sponsorship deals are taken into account. He is the third-best paid player in Ligue 1 behind club-mates Neymar and Edinson Cavani and, over the course of a deal that began in 2017, he will have made around €87.5m. Kylian Mbappe has a major sponsorship deal with Nike, which he extended in the summer of 2017 before he moved to PSG. Adidas were also interested in swooping for the starlet at that time and were reportedly willing to put €5m on the table. More recent estimates from L’Equipe, however, suggest that Mbappe’s Nike deal is actually worth between €2-3m, although it notes that sponsorship contracts are frequently determined by the performance of the player and the team he is involved in. It is estimated that he is on a similar deal to team-mate Marco Verratti. Kylian Mbappe is a fan of top-end cars and reportedly has a collection of five worth around €780,000. He has a Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW and a Range Rover. Kylian Mbappe does a great deal of charity work around Bondy, the area of Paris in which he was born and brought up. Prior to World Cup 2018, he announced that he would give his bonuses for the competition to the Premiers de Cordees charity, which aims to organise sports for children with disabilities. Winning the World Cup meant that he was able to provide them with what was estimated by L’Equipe to be around €300,000, though reported elsewhere to be up to €550,000. Speaking to Time, he said: “I earn enough money - a lot of money. So, I think it is important to help those who are in need. A lot of people are suffering, a lot of people have diseases. For people like us, giving a helping hand to people is not a big thing. “It doesn't change my life, but it changes theirs. And if it can change theirs, it is a great pleasure. I gave the money to the charity where I am a sponsor because being handicapped is something difficult. Showing them that they can do sports like everyone it is something close to my heart.” Meanwhile, Mbappe gives his fee for each France match he plays – around €20,000 for each game – to a different charity. Additionally, he paid for 25 students from the Jean-Renoir College in Bondy to have an educational trip to Russia during the World Cup. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

401,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-thierry-henrys-net-worth-how-much-monaco-manager/10s3skrbwuo341n72exv26w5dl,What is Thierry Henry's net worth and how much does the former France star earn?,"Thierry Henry is one of the most recognisable faces in world football having won the highest honours in the game during a career with Arsenal, Barcelona and France. The former striker lifted a World Cup andEuropean Championship with Les Bleus, Premier League titles with the Gunners and the Champions League with Barca, becoming one of the most marketable players in the game in the process. His playing ability ensured that he became one of the highest earners in the Premier League, while his off-field appeal allowed him to front numerous advertisement campaigns as he secured plenty of lucrative endorsement deals. Henry's playing days are over, but the Frenchman's appeal endures as he embarks on a coaching career. Goal takes a look at how much he is worth. The Richest estimates that Thierry Henry's net worth stands at around $60 million. During the peak of his playing career, Henrywas the ninth most commercially valuable footballer in the world, with the likes of Ronaldinho and David Beckham at the top end of the spectrum. His status as one of the most marketable stars meant that he earned a significant sum during his playing days, which he would have invested, but he continues to draw in lucrative contracts since hanging up his boots. Henry's contract with Monaco prior to his departure from the club was reported to be worth anywhere between €4m (£3.5m/$4.1m) and €7m (£6.2m/$8m) a year. According toNice-Matin, the former Arsenal star's salary with Monaco worked out at €350,000 (£310k/$400k) a month, which would mean that he would have been earning roughly the same as Leonardo Jardim. Given Henry's relative inexperience in management, that figure seems more likely than the higher fees reported. Prior to becoming Monaco boss, Henry had served as Roberto Martinez's assistant, but he did not take home a salary, opting to donate it to charity instead. He also worked as a pundit and analyst for Sky Sports and was earning a reported £4 million ($5.1m) a year in his role with the broadcaster before taking up the full-time coaching role at Stade Louis II. Henry had a number of sponsorship deals with different sportswear manufacturersduring his playing career. He was a prominent member of Nike's roster during the early stages of his career and appeared in a number of commercials, including the famous 'Secret Tournament'productionalongside the likes of Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho.  That deal came to an end following the 2006 World Cup and Henry subsequently came to an agreement with Reebok, for whom he appeared in their""I Am What I Am"" advertisement campaign along with figures such as rapper 50 Cent, skateboarder Steve Williams andactor Lucy Liu. Towards the end of his playing career, Henry linked up with German sportswear giants Puma. The passion of football fans is an amazing part of our game.It’s great to be back with @Renault_UK as they bring you the #PremierLeague season in partnership with Sky Sports.We are #withyoualltheway through every moment, bring on the season! #VaVaVoom is back! pic.twitter.com/wywqA4sdLS As well as sportswear brands, Henry also found himself working with French automobile manufacturer Renault during his career and was the face of their advertisement campaigns for the Renault Clio in the early 2000s, in which he uttered the memorable phrase, ""Hey Bobby! What's the French for 'Va va voom'?"" He recently began working with Renault again in 2018, helping to promote their partnership with Sky Sports for the network's Premier League coverage. During his playing days, Henry also had endorsement deals with Pepsi, Gillette, Gatorade, EA Sports (as part of their FIFA video game series) and Konami (for Pro Evolution Soccer). In the lead up to the 2014 World Cup, he was a part of a glittering ensemble of football stars used to promote Beats By Dre in their 'The Game Before the Game' commercial, which featured Neymar and Luis Suarez. The former Arsenal star has been a regular partner of the Prince's Trust, appearing at a number of award ceremonies over the years to present awards. Henry is also a keen supporter of the Special Olympics, providing funding for projects through the One4All Foundation. In addition, he has helped to arrange and played in a number of charity football games, with the likes of the Mecenet Cardiac Charity and the Children of the World among the beneficiaries.   He has been an ambassador for UNICEF and the anti-racism campaign 'Stand Up, Speak Up'. Interestingly, the Frenchman also donated his salary for his former role as Belgium assistant manager - reported to be worth €50,000 (£44k/$57k) a year - to charity. Henry is active on social media, particularly through the channels of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. At the time of writing, he had over 8 million followers on Facebook, which is by far his most popular platform in terms offollowing. His Twitter and Instagram pages each have around 2 million followers. As well as using the pages to promote his sponsorship partners, Henry uses them to provide a glimpse into what things are like behind the scenes in his life. Awesome game @NYKnicks at MSG, and great game @JoakimNoah – always fantastic to see you - thank you @NBA pic.twitter.com/wJjEf3hKyN He is an avid traveller and regularly makes trips to see NFL and NBA matches.

402,https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-best-ever-squad-southgate-settled-side-win-world-cup/blt02fa2fb403c4e5b0,England's best-ever squad? Why Southgate's settled side can win the 2022 World Cup,"It speaks volumes about the health of the England national team that during this international break so much time has been spent fretting over trivial matters. A conversation about centre-back options when England have a settled defensive setup performing perfectly well; a debate over Trent Alexander-Arnold when England possess three of the best right-backs in Europe; and question marks over the midfield selection that centre on how to fit in so much talent. England have never looked so good, have never been so prepared for a major tournament. A semi-final appearance in 2018 and a final shootout defeat in 2021 already makes this the best period of form in the nation’s history, and scrolling through the list of names hoping to make the plane to Qatar, there is an argument to be made that this is the best-ever England squad. Granted, the ‘Golden Generation’ of the 2000s had more individual talent, and although younger readers are probably sick of hearing about that lot, the reason we keep banging on about it is because it’s hard to believe how far England have come since those toxic days of tabloid vitriol and inter-club rivalry. Gareth Southgate’s camp is happy, motivated, and together. They are even cultural ambassadors, a progressive group of young men who have brought a sense of national pride to the England football team. That, alone, is an incredible achievement. Anyone wondering whether the good vibes are simply a product of frictionless tournament progress against weaker nations (and England have enjoyed very kind draws under Southgate) should take note of how Harry Maguire and Jack Grealish performed in the 3-0 defeat of Ivory Coast. Both players have endured difficult seasons at club level, but both looked as self-assured as ever in an England shirt. That is the power of a united dressing room and an encouraging manager. The shirt hangs light. Playing for England is a breath of fresh air for the players, a chance to restore themselves. Good vibes don’t win World Cups, but for all the hand-wringing over Southgate’s tactical acumen he has shown a keen eye for the style best suited to international level – even though that means sacrificing some of his more talented attacking players. All debates around England’s tactical preparations for Qatar must understand that central point. Southgate has studied the winners of major tournaments throughout the 21st century and correctly identified that international football is all about quiet control and compact, reactive football. From the naked caution of Italy (2006) to the counterattacking Germany (2014) and France (2018), winning requires a relatively deep line of engagement, compressing space by sitting off, and then making use of the transitions. The hard pressing and possession football fashionable at club level (and therefore often demanded by supporters) requires lots of time to coach the structures. One thing you don’t have at international level is time. Consequently, no matter how much you might want to see Trent Alexander-Arnold bombing down the wings and Grealish and Jadon Sancho sweeping through opponents from either flank, Southgate will never embrace this kind of football. In fact, assessing what England want to do and where they need to improve only requires analysis of one game: the Euro 2020 final. England began in a conservative 3-4-3, happy to concede possession and to control the match calmly from within a midblock that tentatively expected Mason Mount, Raheem Sterling, and Harry Kane to do all the attacking. But as the match wore on, England began to fall deeper and play within themselves, losing their grip just as they did in the World Cup semi-final defeat to Croatia. Even switching to a more attacking 4-2-3-1 could not swing the momentum back. England’s World Cup will follow the same basic idea: 4-2-3-1 against the smaller nations and 3-4-3 against the bigger, with the option of a formation switch should they lose control. When that is understood, many of the so-called problems disappear. Kyle Walker is the first-choice right-back in the 4-2-3-1 because he develops a relationship with Maguire and John Stones that allows them all to shuffle across seamlessly when the back three comes out. Conversations around Conor Gallagher or Phil Foden become irrelevant when considering that in the games that matter England are settled on a midfield two of Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips. Having said that, the midfield configuration has been the biggest development over the March international break. The 2-1 victory Switzerland was ultimately controlled by England but the first half was too open for Southgate’s liking, a game far too entertaining if England are to emulate their Euro 2020 record of two goals conceded in five knockout matches. In short, starting Gallagher and Mount as eights did not work, leaving a large midfield gap that the Swiss used to counter. Gallagher is brilliant at charging around midfield but that is not what is required. England were much better after Rice came on, and Southgate will see that as the last time he experiments with opening up a bit more. However, Jude Bellingham’s superb and assured display against Ivory Coast is important. What the Euro 2020 final defeat showed was that the one area England need to improve is how to wrestle control of a game that is slowly turning against them. In the imperious, supremely talented Bellingham, they have that player. He won’t start often. But should England find themselves waning in a knockout game and in need of a third central midfielder to grab the ball and push back, then Bellingham is undoubtedly England’s best option. His elegance under pressure, constant forward momentum, and strength in possession is exactly what is needed. That, alone, was worth learning this month. England have a settled camp, a settled couple of formations, and a settled playing style – with the tournament record to back it up. Any concerns over who should play – any booing of stalwarts who deserve better – have been manufactured simply because the nation isn’t used to this level of harmony. The only valid concern is how to regain territory and composure when matches start drifting away from them. But, with Bellingham on board, there is now a solution even to this. England are third favourites to win the 2022 World Cup, behind France and Brazil. Judging by the talent, the experience, and the tactical strategy, even the bookies might be slightly underestimating Southgate’s team. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Premier League side approached the winger on two occasions in January to discuss extending his stay. But the 25-year-old did not respond to the Elland Road club and could opt to leave. Leeds are hopeful of holding on to the Brazil international beyond his current contract, which expires in 2024. Raphinha wants to explore his options, though, and is looking to hear what other clubs have to offer. Raphinha's preference is to stay in the Premier League, but he would rather join a team that can regularly compete for silverware. The country's top teams are already eyeing his signing in the summer transfer window. But Leeds are not ready to give up on their hopes of convincing him to sign a new deal as they believe offering him a significant pay rise will be enough to keep him happy. The former Rennes star has been Leeds top performer this season. He has scored eight goals in the Premier League - twice as many as next top scorer Daniel James. He also has two assists to his name from 21 games in the English top-flight. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

404,https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-transfer-leeds-phillips-raphinha/blt857f7930bba237de,West Ham prepare double transfer swoop for Leeds stars Phillips and Raphinha,"West Ham United are looking to stage a transfer raid of Leeds United for midfielder Kalvin Phillips and winger Raphinha, GOAL understands. The Hammers are keen to strengthen their squad mid-season, and have turned their gaze towards Elland Road. Both players could attract fees of up to £50 million as West Ham are willing to spend big in their pursuit of the top four. GOAL understands that West Ham have made bids for both Phillips and Raphinha in the final days of the January transfer window. David Moyes would jump at the chance to welcome Phillips to east London, where he could team up with England colleague Declan Rice at the heart of the Hammers midfield. Raphinha, meanwhile, is also a target for the club, although he has not ruled out staying at Leeds. While Leeds have struggled to repeat their fine 2020-21 season this time round, their midfield pair both enjoy burgeoning reputations. Phillips, who has been with the Whites since he was 14, was one of the heroes of their promotion campaign two years ago and is now considered one of the Premier League's finest midfielders. He was rewarded for his consistently impressive displays under Marcelo Bielsa with a berth in the England team, making his debut in August 2020 and starting every game in the Three Lions' trip to the Euro 2020 final last summer. Raphinha too has proved a big hit at Elland Road since joining the club from Rennes in 2020. Last year the winger broke into the Brazil side with a flourish, and with eight goals in 19 Premier League games to date this term he is Leeds' top scorer. Phillips and Raphinha have also been linked with a number of other top-half Premier League clubs over the past year. West Ham currently sit in fifth place in the Premier League and are eager to add firepower for a late-season run at a Champions League place. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Mahrez attempted to chip Reds keeper Alisson with effectively the final attack of the game from the hosts at the Etihad Stadium, only to miscue his shot and put it well over the target, ensuring that the spoils were shared in a 2-2 draw. The opportunity to win and put four points between City and their title rivals was not lost on De Bruyne, but the Belgium international was quick to praise his side's combined effort in taking another step towards a potential title defence. De Bruyne, who earlier scored his side's opener, was the one who provided the through ball to Mahrez in the late stages of the game. It was a difficult opportunity to be sure, but one Mahrez has converted in the past. ""It's a great chance,"" De Bruyne told Sky Sports in his post-match comments. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in, it's a wonder goal. ""[But] today we played very well, I think we had the upper hand. This is the way we need to play the rest of the season. Mahrez had a great chance to win the match for City in stoppage time but his effort goes high over the bar. #MCILIV | #MyPLMorning pic.twitter.com/p8gLr0C6y3 Asked on whether the points benefit City or Liverpool more, the Belgian added: ""It's similar. I know people said whoever wins gets the title. But it's too hard. The schedule is too tough for both teams to win every game, but we will try."" Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, told BBC: ""I don't have any regrets. They can miss whatever they want. It was positive. It is football and it happens. ""I'm in love with Riyad [Mahrez]; he is an incredible player and person."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

406,https://www.goal.com/en/news/wherewrong-bielsa-leeds-marsch-premier-league-safety/blt9a3de96a7398a639,"Where did it all go wrong for Bielsa at Leeds, and how can Marsch secure Premier League survival?","The sacking of Marcelo Bielsa has proven, once again, that the great wealth divide between the Premier League and Championship leaves no room for sentimentality. Leeds United will stand to lose at least £50 million if they are relegated this season, and no matter what anybody says about the team’s recent performances, that is the sole reason chairman Andrea Radrizzani made “the toughest decision I have had to make” in sacking Bielsa. Bielsa is rightly a Leeds legend. He is not the first to have revived a sleeping giant or taken a Championship club into Premier League mid-table, but few have made such powerful emotional ties in the process. In the end, fear of relegation has taken precedence over emotion; over the bond that had made this such a special project. It is a damning indictment of the modern game that relationships like this are no longer considered the most important part of football. It has been suggested that Bielsa was likely to leave at the end of the season anyway, and therefore to bring his departure forward by a few months is pragmatic rather than callous. But even if that was true, Bielsa deserved a chance to fight against the drop and leave, on his own terms, to a standing ovation at Elland Road. There is reason to believe that fight could have been successful, despite the bottom having completely fallen out of Leeds over the last few weeks. Yes, this has all the hallmarks of a typical Bielsa collapse, but it should be noted that prior to this six-game winless run – which included games against three of the ‘Big Six’, by the way – they had won back to back Premier League games. Leeds are still not in the bottom three and, with Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper returning in a fortnight, a revival was possible. Bielsa deserved that chance, not least because he should not be a victim of his own success. Most of the Leeds squad is still Championship standard. He ought not to be punished for failing to repeat a miracle. Radrizzani will feel justified, however, given the noteworthy decline, although the underlying numbers point to a simple story of injuries disrupting Bielsa’s season. Their expected goals (xG) and expected goals against (xGA) are significantly worse than last year. At the current rate, by the end of the campaign their xG will be down by 12 and their xGA up by 13, a 25-goal swing that neatly captures how Leeds’ problems have come in the two penalty boxes. If that sounds obvious, the point here is that Leeds continued to play with the same tactical dexterity, desire, and skill in the overall construction of their attacks and defensive organisation. What was missing was those final actions – the actions that would have been made by Patrick Bamford in attack or Cooper in defence. Compared to last season Leeds are hitting the same numbers of shots (13.7 per game) and creating a similar number of chances (9.88 per game, down from 10.4), but their conversion rate has dropped from 11.9 per cent to 8.2%. Bielsa really needed Bamford. Defensively, Leeds’ passes per defensive action (PPDA, a metric used to measure a team’s pressing ability) is actually improved this season, down from 10.3 to 9.7, while their interceptions have gone up slightly, 10.8 per game compared to 10.4 in 2020-21. But Leeds are leaking goals because they miss Cooper, who last season topped Leeds charts for interceptions (2.4 per game), tackles (2.7 per game), blocks (1.3 per game), and aerials won (3.8 per game). Clearly something did shift, mind, over the last six games, when exhaustion and low confidence saw the high-risk tactical strategy fall like a house of cards. That is always the way with something so fine-tuned and so attack-minded, but with Cooper and Phillips returning, a sense of control and order may well have re-emerged in time for a relatively kind run-in. That optimistic state of affairs now awaits Jesse Marsch, the former New York Red Bulls and Red Bull Salzburg head coach who is set to be named as Bielsa’s successor. Marsch’s six-month tenure with RB Leipzig earlier this season went very badly, a mutual termination coming with the Champions League club sat 11th in the Bundesliga, but Leeds fans should not be put off by this hiccup. Until then Marsch’s career had been on a sharp upward trajectory, and even the ending at Leipzig can be read positively. Marsch was a bad fit because Julien Nagelsmann had altered the tactical identity of the club, turning Leipzig into a more patient and possession-based side with less of an interest in high-intensity pressing. It was too difficult for Marsch, from the German school, to swing things back the other way. That is by no means his mission at Leeds – they are a club with a tactical vision that is largely shared by the incoming head coach. The underlying principles that led him to consecutive (and record-breaking) doubles at Salzburg are similar to those of Ralf Rangnick, who first appointed Marsch as his assistant manager at Leipzig. As Rangnick’s protege, it will be no surprise to learn Marsch believes in hard pressing and exploiting the attacking transitions with sharp vertical football. He expects his teams to tackle high up the pitch and use the ensuing disorganisation to break the defensive lines, getting quickly in behind in typical Germanic style. This makes for a seamless transition from Bielsa, albeit with some of the murder-ball reined in. Marsch is not as dogmatic - who is? – and will take a calmer and more pragmatic approach to the task. Crucially, he does not believe in the man-to-man pressing system used by Bielsa, which means an end to those wild battles and the emptying of central midfield. Instead, Leeds will be organised in a system that works hard to remain compact, keeping small distances between players and pressing in a way that maintains shape - and closes down spaces, not men. Leeds will be more like Ralph Hasenhuttl’s Southampton; defined by pressing and attacking transitions, but understanding the necessity of dropping into a safer midblock for long periods when facing stronger opposition. That easing off of the most demanding and exposing aspects of the Bielsa regime, coupled with the return of Cooper, Phillips and potentially Bamford from injury, could be enough to restore some balance at Elland Road. It will not be as exciting, or as emotional, but as the next step on Leeds’ mission to become an established Premier League outfit it is a sensible appointment.

407,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-suspends-russia-until-further-notice-world-football/bltd3f35fed56e2cda7,FIFA suspends Russia until further notice as world football responds to invasion of Ukraine,"FIFA has taken the decision to suspend Russia from all international football until further notice. That call has been made on the back of an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces that were sent into combat by president Vladimir Putin. The International Olympic Committee, which has already banned the ROC from competing under its own flag, has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be prevented from participating in any organised international competitions. After holding lengthy discussions with UEFA – European football’s governing body – FIFA announced on Monday that the Russia national team would be banned from competition with immediate effect. It had already been declared that games involving Russian and Ukrainian sides would be held at neutral venues for the foreseeable future, while the Champions League final has been moved from Saint Petersburg to Paris, but sanctions have now gone a step further. ""Following the initial decisions adopted by the FIFA Council and the UEFA Executive Committee, which envisaged the adoption of additional measures, FIFA and UEFA have today decided together that all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice,"" a joint statement issued by FIFA and UEFA on Monday signalled. ""These decisions were adopted today by the Bureau of the FIFA Council and the Executive Committee of UEFA, respectively the highest decision-making bodies of both institutions on such urgent matters. ""Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people."" Russia has since responded with a statement of their own. ""The Russian Football Union categorically disagrees with the decision of FIFA and UEFA to suspend all Russian teams,"" reads the statement. ""We reserve the right to challenge the decision of FIFA and UEFA in accordance with international sports law. ""We believe that this decision is contrary to the norms and principles of international competition, as well as the spirit of sports. It has an obvious discriminatory character and harms a huge number of athletes, coaches, employees of clubs and national teams, and most importantly, millions of Russian and foreign fans, whose interests international sports organizations must protect in the first place. ""Such actions are dividing the world sports community, which has always adhered to the principles of equality, mutual respect and independence from politics."" Russia are due to face Poland in a World Cup play-off clash on March 24, but that fixture is now under serious threat. The Polish FA has already stated that it will refuse to honour the scheduling of that game if forced to face the Russians. A number of other nations, including Sweden and France, have spoken out against the ongoing involvement of a Russian side in any global competition. The suspension imposed by FIFA covers all of Russia’s national teams – with their women’s team supposed to take part in UEFA’s Euro 2022 event this summer which will be staged in England. UEFA has also kicked Spartak Moscow out of the Europa League. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The England international, who has made only eight top-flight appearances this term after being rocked by a succession of problems, was visibly distressed and close to tears as he left the field almost a quarter of the way through the match at Molineux.

A lone game against Brentford marked his comeback, where he scored an injury-time equaliser and seemingly injured himself in the subsequent celebrations, ruling him out once more until earlier this month when he returned to action once again.

The Whites are still sweating on their top-flight status with nine games left to take in before the 2021-22 campaign comes to a close. Jesse Marsch’s side are perched just four points above a trapdoor that leads back down into the Championship, but Koch is convinced that they can steer a course to safety and end any discussions regarding potential summer transfers. Koch has told Sky Deutschland when asked if he would stick around in the second tier: “We're not going down. “And if so, then I believe that the team will stand together. We agree that we'll go down together then. “We don't go to the second division. I'm pretty sure we'll stay in there [the Premier League] with this team.” Pressed further on whether his contract at Elland Road would still stand if a tumble into the Championship were to be endured, Koch said “Yes.” Koch, who has nine senior caps for Germany to his name and is still harbouring ambitions of forcing his way into Hansi Flick’s World Cup 2022 plans, is not the only Leeds player to be sparking transfer rumours. Plenty of questions continue to be asked of how long Brazilian forward Raphinha will be sticking around, with the 25-year-old proving that he has what it takes to torment Premier League defences. Koch is a big fan of his talented team-mate and admits that he would not look out of place at any heavyweight outfit. He said of Raphinha, who Leeds are hoping to tie to a new contract if safety can be secured this season: “He's a great technician, you can see that on the pitch. In addition, he has enormous speed. That's not a bad combination for a footballer. “It's fun to watch him. He is a great player. He fits in with many teams because he brings a lot with him.” Leeds, who claimed a dramatic first win under new boss Marsch in their last outing against fellow strugglers Norwich, will be back in action on Friday when taking in a trip to Wolves.

The board will just have to hope that Saturday's embarrassingly tame 1-0 loss at Everton did not terrify the current Ajax boss to the point of putting him off agreeing to become their next permanent manager. The typically vocal United away following could only watch on in silence as their team produced an insipid display against a team who are in real danger of relegation from the Premier League. Ralf Rangnick was brought in to steady the sinking ship, with United having been in freefall under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but with the team applying themselves in this manner, the German would have to be Harry Houdini to conjure up a top-four finish at this stage. Seventh-placed United still have seven games to play, so Champions League qualification is not mathematically impossible, but it now feels that way, given the ineffective nature of their performances. Remember, Rangnick's side still have to face Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea and, right now, there is no guarantee they will even have enough to get past basement boys Norwich next weekend. The United boss had said in his pre-match press conference that he took great encouragement from what he had seen in training this week, that the physicality and aggression that had been lacking in last weekend’s draw against Leicester would be present at Goodison Park. However, there was no sign of either attribute against Everton, with his players failing dismally to stand up and be counted. Everton 1-0 Manchester United 😳 pic.twitter.com/4sbqnvEomX With just two minutes on the lock, Harry Maguire knocked the ball out of play while under no pressure at all, and that inexplicable error set the tone for United’s display. Marcus Rashford, starting on his favoured left-hand side, was their brightest attacking spark, but even he dulled as the half went on, and he ended up being switched to the opposite flank. The tension inside Goodison was palpable, with Everton's loss at Burnley in midweek having left them just one point above the drop zone at kick-off. However, when Anthony Gordon’s 20-yard strike deflected off Maguire and into the United net, the roar was deafening, but even with Everton growing into the game, that excitement level didn’t last. It was a nervous energy from the home support and it filtered onto the pitch. This was a team with five defeats in their last six games and it showed: Frank Lampard’s side were desperately poor in possession – they had still enough to beat a gutless United side. Manchester United fans watching this game like 😩 pic.twitter.com/aerFS9aSco Rangnick stood on the touchline in his mauve jumper gesturing to his players to push further up the pitch but it made no difference. Collectively, United's players once again lacked drive and commitment. They should have capitalised on the home side’s anxiety and mistakes; instead, they played into their hands by making basic errors of their own. The touches were heavy, the movement wasn’t quick enough, the attacking ideas were not there, there was no desire and certainly no fight. Before football returned after the last international break, the hope from inside the club was that a rejuvenated United would finish the season on the high and secure Champions League football. The way they’re going, though, and with tougher tests coming up, they’ll be lucky if they qualify for any European competition at all next season. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

United missed the chance to move level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham after losing 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday, with Anthony Gordon grabbing the winning goal for the Toffees. Ralf Rangnick's side only managed four shots on target over the course of the 90 minutes, much to the frustration of De Gea, who felt they once again failed to live up to the required standard at one of the biggest clubs in European football. The Spanish shot-stopper got the impression that Everton wanted the three points more than United and was disappointed by the lack of fight they showed in such an important fixture. ""We knew before today they were struggling and how difficult it was going to be,"" he told BT Sport post-match. ""We don’t score, we don’t even create proper chances to score. I don’t know what to say, to be honest. We’re not good enough, that’s for sure. It’s going to be very difficult now to be in the top four. ""Of course it’s not the perfect atmosphere. They were tired, they were nervous, but they keep going and keep fighting. They had more desire than us, which is not acceptable. It’s very sad to lose today. ""It's a disgrace from us, we should be winning this game."" United are already destined to finish the season without a trophy, and are now also in real danger of missing out on Champions League qualification. If Tottenham win their game in hand against Aston Villa they will be six points clear of the Manchester outfit with only seven games remaining, while Arsenal are also currently in a better position. Rangnick will hope that his underperforming team can get back on track and revive their top-four hopes when Norwich arrive at Old Trafford on April 16, three days before the Red Devils are due to take in a trip to Anfield to face quadruple-chasing Liverpool.

Maguire, who joined United from Leicester City in a record-breaking £80 million ($104m) deal in 2019, has been subjected to intense criticism throughout the season. The 29-year-old has led a Red Devils defence that has only managed eight clean sheets in 31 games, making a number of errors along the way, but Ferdinand believes he still has plenty to offer. The Man Utd legend has pointed to Maguire's record for England as proof of his quality, with the centre-back having helped his country reach the World Cup semi-final and European Championship final over the past four years. “In an England shirt he’s been nothing but phenomenal. He’s been unreal. You can’t say he’s a dead player, he’s been unbelievable for England,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel FIVE. “What I’m saying is, for England he’s been great, but they play a particular way of football that probably suits him."" Ferdinand has suggested United's style doesn't play to Maguire's strengths, which he says was the same problem Pique had at Old Trafford before the Spaniard left for Barcelona in 2008 and went on to become one of Europe's best defenders. “Gerard Pique was at Man Utd, you could argue that he might not have had the career that he’s had at Barcelona if he stayed at Man Utd because of the way he plays,"" Ferdinand added. “It’s like boxing, styles make fights – it’s the same in football. The way of Man Utd’s football, and the way that they are trying to play, hasn’t suited him. “Also form and confidence. His confidence has taken a big knock and I don’t care who you are, you could be Messi, Ronaldo, Zidane, Mbappe all these players – if their confidence is low they are not the same player.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Footage of Ronaldo knocking the device to the floor began to circulate after Everton's 1-0 victory over the Red Devils at Goodison Park. Ronaldo later acknowledged what had happened and issued an apology to the affected supporter. ""At full-time the Man Utd players started walking off. We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past - my son was there videoing them all,"" Sarah Kelly, the mother of 14-year-old Jake Harding, told the Liverpool Echo. ""He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was - he didn’t even speak. ""Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son’s hand and carried on walking."" A spokesman for the Merseyside Police, meanwhile, confirmed to the Echo that the incident was being investigated: ""We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match today at Goodison. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. ""Inquiries are underway and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place."" Ronaldo later extended an invitation to watch United at Old Trafford to the young fan on his Instagram account. But Kelly, who shared photos with the Echo revealing a bruise on her son's hand, was shocked by the player's outburst.

""He’s really upset about it and it’s completely put him off going to the game again. This is the first football game he’s been to and this has happened.

The Red Devils suffered a 1-0 loss to the Toffees at Goodison Park, dealing a significant blow to their hopes of finishing in the top four this season. The loss comes just days after relegation-threatened Everton lost 3-2 to a Burnley team currently stuck in the Premier League's drop zone. Rangnick admits he found it difficult to explain his team's failure against Frank Lampard's men, especially since the same team were beaten by Burnley a few days prior. He told reporters: ""When we conceded, we lost a little bit of our composure and maybe also a little bit of our confidence and, if you don't score against a team like Everton, with all respect to a team that conceded three goals against Burnley, you cannot expect to get anything out of it. ""We've been talking about that for the last 10 minutes. I totally agree. It is not so difficult to see. ""If you don't score in 95 minutes against a team that conceded three goals against Burnley, and we scored three goals against Tottenham at home, it's difficult to explain. ""For us, as a coaching staff, it's not so easy to understand why we didn't create more chances in a game like this."" United are now in seventh place and sit three points behind Tottenham and Arsenal, who are currently the leading candidates for a place in the Premier League's top four. Rangnick's team have taken just one point from their last three matches in the English top flight. However, they take on the Premier League's bottom team Norwich next week, followed by a trip to Anfield to face title contenders Liverpool three days later. Four days after that, United will meet fellow top-four contenders Arsenal in north London. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The striker has struggled since he returned to Stamford Bridge from Inter last summer. Lukaku, 28, has not started any of Chelsea's last four Premier League matches, having been left on the bench for the 4-0 win at Burnley at the start of March. The Belgium international has made just 20 Premier League appearances, eight of which he has started, and his national team manager believes he will need to assess his situation ahead of the tournament in November. “We are talking about players, like Romelu, who have got over 100 caps and are part of this group of players who know the national team inside out,"" Martinez told The Sun. “I’m not going to judge or assess the condition of any player until after the summer because it is not a normal situation. “It is still seven months to the World Cup and probably you will go into the details of how a player feels when it gets closer to it than now. “But there will be a lot of players who change clubs or are going to feel in a different way in the summer. “Romelu needs to be assessed on how he feels in September, the same wayEden Hazard does and some others. “But he is one of the players for whom the summer could be a big moment for their careers.” He added: “We always speak. “I have a very close relationship with all my players. I would never tell a player what to do but we always share thoughts. “At the moment Romelu is in a good place. He is so committed. ""He was delighted to win the Club World Cup and the next step is to finish the season strong with Chelsea and make sure he can feel very important."" Lukaku has scored just five times since he made his return to the Premier League last year. The striker found it difficult to get back into the starting XI after recovering from an injury in November and made matters worse when he gave a controversial interview in December. Lukaku complained to Sky Sport Italia about the system that coach Thomas Tuchel has adopted at Chelsea. “I’m not happy with the situation and that’s only natural,"" he said. ""The head coach has decided to play a different system and I mustn’t let up, I need to keep working hard and be professional. ""I’m not happy with the situation but I’m a grafter and I mustn’t let up."" The attacker then had to make a public apology to the club's fans, his team-mates and manager saying: ""To the manager, I apologise and to my team-mates and the squad because I think it was not the right moment and I want to move forward from this make sure we start winning football games and that I perform for the team in the best manner.""

McKennie is currently out injured, but recently said he hopes to be back fully fit within the next few weeks, giving him an outside chance of featuring for Juve before the end of the season. De Ligt, surely, would welcome him back, as he says McKennie has made himself a vital piece of the team on and off the field. ""I think McKennie,"" De Ligt said when asked by CBS who the funniest Juve player is. ""Weston, he lives in a completely different world than us. It's so funny to see. ""He's from America, of course, and I think he made a big, big improvement in his game with us. In the team, he's such a funny guy and he's really important."" McKennie has certainly shown his personality since arriving at Juventus from Schalke in 2020. The U.S. men's national team midfielder has shown off a Harry Potter celebration after scoring for the Old Lady, while some behind-the-scenes content from the club has offered a closer look at his personality. McKennie drew the ire of Italian icons Giorgio Chiellini and GIanluigi Buffon for revealing he likes to put ranch dressing on his pizza, while the American also famously discussed the negatives his body has gone through from drinking cappuccino, causing him to run late for training. In total, McKennie has scored 10 goals in 74 appearances for Juve and figured to be a locked-in start for the U.S. at the World Cup later this year.

419,https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-heath-arsenal-wsl-signing-of-the-summer/1n90ymeaxf31n1upxzn2y3vijc,Tobin Heath to Arsenal: Is USWNT star the Women’s Super League’s signing of the summer?,"Every stage of Tobin Heath’s move to Arsenal, announced on Friday, made it bigger and bigger. A two-time World Cup winner, and two-time Olympic gold medallist, joining the most successful women’s football club in England - that’s big. The way it came into the news was dramatic too; Aston Villa’s former Arsenal defender Anita Asante citing the rumours on Sky Sports News’ Women’s Super League deadline day coverage, which would form the Gunners’ tease of the announcement. The many photos of Heath in old Arsenal shirts or outside the Emirates that began to circulate helped to scale up the excitement. One of the most recognisable names in women’s football, an Arsenal fan, was on the cusp of joining the club. With her world-class ability, this should be a signing that sparks big predictions. It’s not a reach to say that she could be a signing that helps a team win a title. When Manchester United were upsetting the odds last season, sitting top of the WSL at Christmas, Heath was an absolutely massive part of that. Her ability to perform in the biggest games is sensational and will be a particular boost to Arsenal, who have struggled in recent times against their closest title rivals. A dream come true for @TobinHeath 🤗 https://t.co/4JTkovX924 pic.twitter.com/pLPB13V562 “I think even pre-Olympics, we started looking at the possibility of bringing Tobin here,” Arsenal head coach Jonas Eidevall explained in a press conference on Friday. “Tobin has been very, very keen to come and play for Arsenal, which also has been very nice, of course. “Even if it's a deal now that gets presented very late in the transfer window, it's not a last-minute deal. It's something that we have been working on during this whole transfer window, basically, and we're really delighted that we could come to terms and make Tobin an Arsenal player. “I always think when you want to win something, you want players that can score points for you – [get] assists and goals. That's a really important aspect to have as a forward player and Tobin Heath, she's a point player. “She's a player that can make the difference in games at the highest level. We're excited to bring her here, to help us with the ambitions that we have this year.”  However, there is one slight caveat. There have been rumours in recent months surrounding the long-term future of Heath and where it lies. While she was in Manchester last year, the USWNT star saw her rights in the NWSL, the top league in the U.S., drafted by expansion club Racing Louisville.Since that moment, which occurred 10 months ago now, there has been very little communication from Louisville regarding Heath, and vice versa. Instead, there have been rumours linking her with a move to San Diego’s expansion side, which will come into the NWSL in the new year. That team will be coached by Casey Stoney, who signed her for Man Utd. When Heath was unveiled by the club last summer, she sang Stoney’s praises. Last season, a whole host of stars came to the WSL from the United States. Some stayed all season, like Heath and Christen Press at United, or Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle at Manchester City. Some left in the early part of this year, such as Alex Morgan at Tottenham, Rachel Daly at West Ham and Jess Fishlock at Reading. Arsenal do not disclose the lengths of contracts, meaning rumours of Heath's long-term future were not put to bed by her move to the club on Friday.   Asked about the contract, Eidevall said: “We don't go into details of the contracts. But if we would see it from long-term or short-term [perspective], it's more short-term than long-term.” This is a massive signing. Heath has title-winning credentials, is one of the greatest, most skilful wingers the game has ever seen and will be linking up with some serious firepower in north London - most notably Vivianne Miedema, one of the best players on the planet. As the Gunners try to close the gap to Chelsea and Man City, who left them behind in last season’s title race, this is a statement. The club’s commitment to the women’s team has been questioned in recent years, but to sign Heath shows that their encouraging words about that over the summer were not hollow. Her impact will be big, there is no doubt about that. Unfortunately, there is just no telling how long it will be for. But for all the uncertainty over long Heath will spend in north London, there is one thing that is a given: she will make her mark. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

420,https://www.goal.com/en/news/miedema-is-no-flat-track-bully-arsenals-big-game-struggles/1fok8jpe9obp81wvwqhiuzx0k7,Miedema is no flat-track bully: Arsenal's big-game struggles are about more than the under-fire forward,"When Arsenal welcome Manchester City on Sunday, the odds will be stacked against them as they try to re-establish themselves in the title race. The Gunners are currently nine points off Chelsea, who sit top of the Women’s Super League table, having taken just one point from their three games against the Blues, City and Manchester United, the league’s top three, in the first half of the season. This weekend’s game, and the clash with Chelsea that follows on Wednesday night, are huge for Joe Montemurro’s side. But big games are for big players, and Arsenal have one of the biggest in Vivianne Miedema. The 24-year-old is one of the top talentson the planet, a European champion and World Cup finalist, as well as the WSL's all-time top-scorer. It’s no wonder, then, that when these big games come around, two defenders are regularly following her every move. Their attempts to mark her out of the game have earned Miedema an unfair reputation among rival fans as a flat-track bully, despite her more than respectful record of eight goals and three assists in 19 games against City and Chelsea. “I do [enjoy that challenge],” Miedema told Goal in November, after finishing second in Goal 50.  “It's a good thing because it means that I need to find ways to keep improving myself, which I like because that'swhy you want to play football. “A lot of the teams are trying to man-mark me or whatever, so I always need to find a different way around it in every single game and it's a good opportunity for me to develop myself.” When she does break free, it’s telling. Against Chelsea in November, she found space out wide to supply a brilliant assist for Beth Mead as the Gunners came within seconds of a huge win, only to be denied as much by the cruellest of own goals from Lotte Wubben-Moy. Crucially, when she scores against Manchester City, the Gunners tend to win, too. The only timethat wasn'tthe case was in December, when her opening goal was rendered futile by City’s comeback in a 2-1 defeat. “The situation develops like that, where there is an advanced or forward opportunity in nullifying Viv,” Montemurro said this week. “We've worked at spaces she can take up where maybe she's going to be a little bit more difficult to mark but that frees up the opportunity for other players to be involved. GOAL!!! 🔴Is that the winner from @bmeado9?!#WomensFootballWeekend pic.twitter.com/BgKspSidCe “In these games, there's probably more transition moments than having the ball. It's a matter of identifying that moment and making sure that we find space for Viv or one of our other players to be able attack.” But, as Montemurro alludes to, Arsenal cannot just rely on Miedema in these huge fixtures. Captain Kim Little acknowledged in October that the team needed to “be better”, given they'renow winless in six against City and Chelsea. “It's really disappointing to lose those matches,” she said,with the Gunners having just lost in the FA Cup semi-finals to City and in the Continental Cup to Chelsea. “We want to go to them and get a result. I think of previous games playing them as well, we've not matched them the way we wanted. “As players, we know we need to take responsibility forhow we performed in those games. We all, collectively and as individuals, need to be better and we believe if we play to our potential, we will impact those matches in a better way and get results.”   It’s just short of two months since Arsenal lost to City, despite taking the lead in the third minute of the game with Miedema’s strike from the edge of the box. In the end, it was game management that cost the Gunners, with Montemurro admitting as much after his team succumbed to a 90th-minute goal. “They're big games that have moments,” he said this week, reflecting on that game. “It's just managing those pressure moments. “We try to do the best we can to simulate these moments. When it's a wondergoal in the last throes of the game, we learn that we have to be a little bit cleverer in closing out games when you're under a little bit of pressure like that. “Hopefully, if that situation happens again, we can make sure that we do the right thing.” If Miedema can pop up with another important contribution on Sunday, it could be pivotal as Arsenal try to claw back the deficit they face heading into a huge few days. But Montemurro and his team know full well that the key to victory this weekend is not their star striker scoring a goal to silence those who deny her unquestionable brilliance – and Miedema herself would certainly choose a result for her team over a goal for herself, anyway.

Reigning champions Chelsea kicked off their WSL campaign on Sunday with a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Arsenal. There was controversy over the Gunners' final strike,which appeared to come from an offside position. “It was two yards offside.

The negative is that by putting our product in such a brilliant place is that everyone is asking the questions of why we don’t have goalline technology or why we don’t have VAR."" The Blues were not the only team to suffer from a lack of technology at the weekend.

Hayes agrees with her colleague, saying: ""I heard before the game that there was a conversation around it not being a priority because it’s really expensive but I think we’re selling our game short.

422,https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenals-complete-player-the-meteoric-rise-of-vivianne/b2kmugyhauo41tz73frysq18r,Arsenal's complete player: The meteoric rise of Vivianne Miedema,"It’s good that Vivianne Miedema is fantastic at football. If she wasn’t, she’d be “a big disappointment”, she laughs, finishing Goal’s sentence in an exclusive interview that celebrates her place at No.2 in this year’s Goal 50. The all-time top scorer in the history of the Netherlands national team, and England’s Women’s Super League, Miedema grew up surrounded by the sport that would quickly consume her and, in time, that she would grow to dominate. From her grandfather to her father to her younger brother, everyone around the Arsenal star in her younger years was football mad. “I didn’t really have a chance to be honest, it was football or nothing,” the 24-year-old laughs. To say she has lived up to the expectations that came with that upbringing though would be an understatement. Not only has she gone on to establish herself as one of the best goalscorers in the world, but one of the game’s most unique players, too. “Throughout the whole family, we have always been No.10s, No.9s, both of them a bit in a mix,” she says,describing the player she is today as “a nine and a half”. “I started as a 10. Then at one point, the national team didn't really have a No.9, so they were like, 'Go and play up top and see how it goes'. Since the first game, I never really got away. “I think you always want to be like your dad, or your big brother or sister. He has definitely influenced me to be the No.9 I am these days.”  Scoring a 16-minute hat-trick on just her second senior appearance for the Netherlands, Miedema’s goalscoring capabilities were influenced by the goal-hungry heroes she idolised as a child, Robin van Persie and Ruud van Nistelrooy. But the player she is today is far from either of those two. Deployed as a No.9, but often acting like a No.10, Arsenal’s No.11 was not only the top scorer in the WSL last season, but she also led the assist charts too. Since leaving Bayern Munich three years ago, working with Gunners head coach Joe Montemurro has given her the freedom tobecome one of the best players in the world. “In Bayern especially, the way we played, I was a counterattacking No.9,” Miedema explains. “A lot of long balls got punted forward and they were like, 'Viv, go and run with it'. It's not really my style of play. “In the beginning, I really struggled to realise that that team needed something else from me. In the last two seasons, I fully accepted it and I did it the way they wanted to do it. “But then, after three years, I realised I had to move on for myself, to enjoy football and to be happy. Arsenal has been the right choice. “The way we play, it's fitting in with the way I want to play. [Montemurro’s style] just gives us freedom.   “Not just me, I think a lot of players. We've got a lot of intelligent, technical players that need to have that bit of freedom and need to be able to do what they think at that moment is best. “It just makes me enjoy the game and it makes me able to have a lot of touches and to do what I want to do.” Not only do Montemurro and Miedema’s ideas of football match, helping Arsenal to claim their first league title for seven years in 2019, but their personalities, too. “He's probably bored of me,” the forward laughs, with her non-stop football brain perhaps even too much for one of the most analytical and dedicated coaches in the game. “We talk a lot about the way we play, the way other teams play. It's not that I'm going in and being like, 'this is what we need to do'. Because he'll just be like, 'well, there's the door, see you later'. But I think it's really good to have those discussions. “I think it's really good to brainstorm with players, for him to ask me how I felt that game, if we as a group feel like it's working, because I think that's the most important thing in football: to communicate and to make sure you're on the right way. “I watch a lot of football. If it's the Italian league, if it's the South Korean league, I literally don't care. I just watch it anyway. “It's nice to have someone that enjoys football a lot too and especially our assistant coach, Aaron [D'Antino], he loves football too and we speak about it a lot. “I love speaking about football with him because we believe football needs to be played the same way.” That chemistry has played a huge part in getting the best out of Miedema. In Arsenal’s famous colours, the 24-year-old has 82 goals from as many games, as well as a WSL title and Continental Cup trophy. The challenge now is to keep that up while opponents do their best to stop her. “I think it's a good thing because it means that I need to find ways to keep improving myself, which I like. That, in the end, is why you want to play football,” she says. “A lot of the teams are man-marking me or whatever they're trying to do, so I always need to find a different way around it in every single game. It's a good opportunity for me to develop myself so I like it.” That focus is typical of Miedema’s approach to football. No matter what she achieves, she is also striving for more and never standing still. It’s down in part to her incredible drive, and also her humble personality. Despite her success, this is a player who doesn’t enjoy being the centre of attention. It’s something that is seen almost every week in her iconic goalscoring celebration - that being that she simply doesn’t celebrate. A simple huddle with her team-mates and maybe a quick smile, if it’s a special occasion, typify her character. “It's just about respecting your opponent and it is my job to score goals, but it's also just trying to focus on the game and just to keep going,” she explains. “I'm from a small town in Holland and there's no space really for crazy things.”   Miedema’s modesty does have one drawback, though, in that she probably doesn’t give herself the credit she deserves. To be the all-time top scorer for her country and the most prolific player in the history of the WSL, as well as a European champion and World Cup finalist with the Netherlands, at just 24 years old is mind-blowing. “I think it's the first time ever in lockdown that you actually had time to [reflect],” she says. “I was reflecting on what we all achieved with the Netherlands, with Arsenal, individually, over the last couple years. Sometimes, me, and a lot of other players, should be a bit more appreciative of what we've achieved and we should be proud of it. “I'm always that type of person and player that doesn't like to be standing in the spotlight, that doesn't like to be the centre of attention. But sometimes I do think I should just tell myself that I am doing good and I just need to keep going. “I've played different systems at every single club I've played for. I've also played in different leagues. I play at international level, and it has definitely made me a better player. “I feel like I've become a more complete player than I've ever probably been before.” With time on her side, there’s no telling how much better Miedema could get. One thing is for sure, though: she’s certainly not been a disappointment. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The 38-year-old has been unveiled by the Gunners after leavingSwedish side Rosengard, where he has spent the last three years of his career. Eidevall replaces Montemurro in the managerial hot seat following the Australian's decision to leave and subsequently move to Juventus, and will now oversee Arsenal's latest pre-season campaign. The Swede told the Gunners' official website:“I feel honoured to be taking this role. Arsenal have a rich history, more successful than any other women’s team in England. ""I want to add to these honours. It's super important that we win, and we will be very ambitious about that, but it's even more important that we live the values and defend the club badge on a day-to-day basis. I cannot wait to do that at Arsenal."" Arsenal chief executiveVinai Venkateshamadded: “Jonas was the standout candidate of everybody that we considered for this role and we think he's going to be a great fit to be the head coach of Arsenal Women. It was important that we found the right person to represent our club, both on the pitch and off the pitch. “As for his coaching style, he will bring the style of football that Arsenal fans want to see. He's someone who likes to play on the front foot, high-tempo, attractive, attacking football. ""The thing that really came out in all of our interactions with Jonas is how much he wanted to join Arsenal and his desire to be part of this club, his desire to be part of our future and to help us deliver our ambitions going forward. So we're delighted that he's joining us.” Eidevall's appointment comes on the back ofLeah Williamson signing a new contract earlier this month, with the 24-year-old having stated that she trusted the club to appoint a good manager with a desire to develop the younger players in the squad. The rise of Goal's NXGN winnerHanna Bennison proves that Eidevall has a knack for nurturing talent, as the 18-year-old helped his unfanciedRosengard side reach the Champions League quarter-finals last season. Eidevall, who previously took in a spell asHenrik Larsson's number two at Helsingborgs, also guided the Swedish outfit to three league titles, and will be expected to help the Gunners win their first Women's Super League crown since 2018-19.

424,https://www.goal.com/en/news/spectacular-community-shield-win-snippet-of-what-chelsea/nwo3q2qea5ep1t1ak8ig2uw59,Spectacular Community Shield win only a snippet of what Chelsea superstars can do,"For most teams, when your star striker misses a glut of clear-cut chances, it isprobably not going to be your day. Emma Hayes’ Chelsea, however,are not like most teams. The Blues ran out 2-0 winners against Manchester City in the Women’s Community Shield witha performance that highlighted rust at times as Australiasuperstar Sam Kerr was guilty of missing many opportunities. It also showcased, though, just how much depth the reining English champions now possess. Since winning the Women’s Super League title last season, Hayes’ transfer business has been superb. After adding Kerr in January, Chelsea signed Bayern Munich captain Melanie Leupolz, Canadian sensation Jessie Fleming and Liverpool youngster Niamh Charles over the summer, with rumours circulatingthat Wolfsburg’s Pernille Harder - one of the best players in the world right now -will be next. Fran Kirby’s return to the side from illness after a year out fits the old cliché of ‘like a new signing’ as well, and the England internationalreminded everybody just how good she is under the arch. But for all the talk of those players, Saturday was a reminder of what Chelsea already have, too. It was centre-back Millie Bright, who signed from Doncaster five years ago now, who smashed in the game’s opening goal from 35 yards – the goal that ultimately knocked the stuffing out of City, especially when followed by Jill Scott’s sending off. Erin Cuthbert, who arrived from Glasgow City back in 2017, then came off the bench to wrap things up in stoppage time. Ji So-yun, meanwhile, was the best player on the pitch, with the South Koreastar showing her true class as always in midfield, as she has done in every game since she joined this club all the way back in 2014. All three were key members of the Chelsea team that beat the 2018-19 WSL champions, Arsenal, home and away last season, as well as securing a win and a draw against Man City. It isquite terrifying to think that they now look ready to move onto another level completely.  ""I think you have to remember that I've been here nine years. This hasn't just happened. I haven't just assembled the team overnight,"" Hayes said. ""This has taken some time to build the quality. I am so lucky to be given the chance to manage at Chelsea and be given the trust by the club to build players that have stuck with me in this process, that have signed contracts to remain at the club [when] lots of them could play anywhere in the world. ""I think it's a real testament to the football club and to them, and I think for the likes of Millie and Erin, they know what we're doing here and they are two wonderful team players. ""That's what our environment is all about. It's about contributing to the team."" Given that all the talk coming into this game was about City and their new signings – Chloe Kelly joining from Everton, while World Cup winners Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis have come over from the United States – it was a moment where Chelsea reminded everyone just why they are the reigning WSL champions. Going forward, Kerr will only get sharper. Her finishing was notthere against City, but her movement off the ball was world-class, with Hayes adding: ""I'm not disappointed in anything with her game today. ""I think Sam ran well for the team today. She caused problems, she created chances, I think if you've got a striker that's not creating chances, that's a concern."" Furthermore, we have noteven seen anything of those new signings yet – with only the impressive Leupolz among the starters at Wembley. And if Chelsea are to add Harder to that squad, is there really anyone in England who can stop them? Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

425,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelseas-kerrby-partnership-is-like-prime-henry-and-bergkamp/vm9uu7jeaz5d1fuxcazxvta76,"Chelsea's 'Kerrby' partnership is like prime Henry and Bergkamp at Arsenal, says Hayes","Chelsea duo Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby have built up a partnership that is fuelling the club's attempts to achieve an unprecedented quadruple for Emma Hayes' side this season. Nicknamed 'Fran and Sam' or 'Kerrby', the pair have scored 26 goals in the Women's Super League between them and racked up a combined 14 league assists this season. Hayes tried to find a Chelsea men's partnership to compare her duo to but ended up settling on Arsenal legends Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp. ""You don't come across these types of partnerships easily when they are formed,"" Hayes said. ""Usually, when they are formed, it is over many, many years. So if you asked Sam Kerr if she could find anyone to service her with goals like Yuki Nagasato [at her former club Chicago Red Stars] did, she would question if that would be the case. ""What I do know is Sam Kerr was looking forward to playing with Kirby most in our squad because she saw the potential between them and vice versa. They just get each other. That's not coached. It is just trying to put them in the right spaces and they figure the rest out. ""They are talented world-class players and I think all of the praise given to both of them is fully justified. They are yin and yang; some call it a brilliant partnership or telepathy. ""They remind me of Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole in terms of the spaces that they fill. I was trying to think of a Chelsea version with Didier Drogba or Gianfranco Zola in it, but they never played together. I think they would say it is most like Thierry Henry and David Bergkamp. ""What stands out is Fran's selflessness, when she makes runs for somebody else or when she sets up someone else when she's in a great position for herself. ""That impacts the chemistry and it is the hardest thing to get across for players to do stuff for others. Those two understand it in their droves."" Chelsea have the second leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg up next. The Blues hold a 2-1 lead from the first leg, which was registered as an away match despite being played at a neutral venue in Hungary. That away goal puts the tie in the balance despite holding a slender lead over the German powerhouses. Having already won this season's Conti Cup, Hayes' side are top of the league with just four games to play. They also remain in the FA Women's Cup and are chasing all four major honours.

426,https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-transformation-of-australias-sam-kerr-from-wild-winger/14jfiwj9f19za1ca550chf1dfl,The transformation of Australia's Sam Kerr: From wild winger to best No.9 in women's football,"Sam Kerr is no ordinary footballer. She only started took up football at 12, having spent her childhood playing Aussie Rules. Just three years later, she was an Australia international. Fast forward to the end of 2019 and the forward's statisticsspeak for themselves. Kerris the all-time top-scorer in Australia's W-League and the NWSL in the US. She scored 41 goals in 43 games for club and country between August 2018 and 2019, earning her third spot in this year’s Goal 50 – and a huge move to Women's Super League giants Chelsea. As the striker's international team-mate Amy Harrison puts it, she’s quite simply a “freak”,something that has been apparent from day one. “I was about 13 when I first came into Under-17s Australia camp,” says Alanna Kennedy, an Australia international and current Sydney FC defender. “Because Sam's from Perth, she was running a bit late and everyone was going, ‘Oh Sam will be here soon, Sam this, Sam that.' “I was like, ‘Who is this Sam that everyone is going on about?’ And then she rocked up, the chick from Perth, and she was wild as ever. “She’s always been pretty upbeat and a fun person to be around. “She’s just an unreal athlete, raw talent, and just unbelievably talented.”  She was someone that grabbed the immediate attention of her coaches, too. “The first time we all saw Sam Kerr play we all thought she was something special,” Alen Stajcic, coach of the Matildas from 2014 to 2019, explains. “A gifted mover, mobile, athletic and the ability to beat opponents with ease – and most importantly the desire to run with the ball and not fear trying to be unpredictable or creative.” Word quickly began to spread of what the girl from Perth could do.After making her Australia debut at 15 in 2009, the hype around Kerr was understandably huge, but it wasn't a smooth transition to senior women's football. Two years later, in 2011, Kerr had surgery on her knee that meant she missed a whole season, agedjust 18– and just when she started to hit form again, injuries hit again. Another knee problem sidelined her for several months, before a ligament rupture in her foot made her a doubt for the 2015 Women’s World Cup. Shetrained on her own every day to stay in shape, but it was a difficult period for the young attacker. “I think it was sort of during that time where she really knuckled down and put in the hard work,” Clare Polkinghorne, Kerr’s long-time Australia team-mate, adds. “Not to say that injuries are a blessing in disguise, but she really made the most of it and she came back a better player and that’s a testament to her and all the hard work that she put in. “It’s a credit to her and her character.” When Kerr returned to full fitness, she would set about redefining herself as arguably the deadliest striker on the planet.   Previously a winger – and an effective one at that, with Stajcic highlighting how “she could isolate defenders and use her speed, mobility and dribbling to create goal-scoring chances” out wide– Kerr was moulded into an even more effective No.9. Bobby Despotovski, her former coach at Perth Glory, admits he had a “vision” of playing her there from the start, but it took time for her to develop the goalscoring nous to make it a success. “We worked very hard on achieving that cool, calm and collected brain to score goals,” he explains. “Obviously with her speed, she's going to separate herself from the defenders quite quickly and then she needs to collect her thoughts and be clear in her mind with what she wants to do with the ball. “Year by year, she developed her natural instincts more and more. When we started this process, it was converting two out of eight chances, now she’s converting six to seven out of eight.” Matildas midfielder Tameka Yallop,capped 81 times for her country, laughs:“It’s not like she’s a complicated player or anything! “I think she’s just brilliant in the times that she needs to be and she’s always hard-working. “She’ll always make that run and put herself in the best position to score, and I think that kind of comes naturally to her.” Amidst all the talk of her talent and mentality, though, the overriding picture painted by her team-mates is how much Kerr enjoys playing – and how enjoyable she is to be around. It’s something that makes her a great captain for her country, having assumed the role since Ante Milicic’s appointment in February. “I think she has that really good balance of being a great team-mate and being on the field trying to get the best out of everyone, which is so important,” Australia team-mate Harrison says of her skipper.   “She knows when to be serious but she’s also full of smiles and laughs as well,” adds Yallop. “She’s probably the first person to laugh at any joke – especially her own.” “She’s one of those players that could be mucking around five minutes before a game and then go and have the best game of her life,” Polkinghorne adds. “That’s just her.” And behind all her success, Kerr remains as humble as it gets. When she wins an individual award, it’s because of her team-mates. When the team is winning, it’s thanks to the coaches. And when she comes back strong from an injury, it’s because of the staff and people around her. While it’s been an incredible year for Kerr, the truth is that it probably won’t be one of her favourites. She collected the NWSL’s Golden Boot and MVP award, but was part of the Chicago Red Stars team that lost 4-0 to North Caroline Courage in the championship final. For Australia, Kerr scored her first World Cup goals this summer – five, to be exact – but couldn’t stop the Matildas from crashing out on penalties in the last 16 against Norway. “I think Sam’s the first person to say that she’d give up all her individual awards for team accolades,” says Kennedy. At Chelsea, she'll hope to do exactly that. The Blues are top of the table at this early stage of the season and have already beaten reigning champions Arsenal. With Australia, there is a chance to bounce back from that World Cup disappointment quickly too, as the Matildas head to the Olympics next summer. How many goals Kerr scores won't matter to her either. If 2020 sees her bring silverware at club or international level, she'll deem it better than 2019. Given how remarkable the last 12 months have been, that's quite the attitude. But then again, Kerr is no ordinary footballer. Additional reporting by Joshua Thomas and Kieran Francis.

427,https://www.goal.com/en/news/best-league-in-the-world-wsl-isnt-there-yet-but-it-can-be/nf6d90xuuytv12y71z8kn8lae,Best league in the world? Women's Super League isn’t there yet - but it's possible,"When the Women’s Super League returned, plenty in England were quick to declare it the best league in the world. After a summer transfer window that saw some of the best players in the world arrive on these shores, the hype was understandable. Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood left Champions League winners Lyon for Manchester City. Pernille Harder, the best player in the world right now, joined Chelsea. Five of the United States’ World Cup-winning squad moved across the Atlantic, while a whole host of Australia’s top talent landed in the United Kingdom. But since the WSL returned, a flurry of one-sided results have put the claim of ‘the best league in the world’ under the microscope. Reading were picked apart by Arsenal in a 6-1 win on the opening weekend before the Gunners gave West Ham a 9-1 beating one week later. The next day, Chelsea beat Bristol City 9-0. If we’re talking about competitiveness, you cannot call the WSL the best league in the world. InAmerica's NWSL, anyone can beat anyone. That's certainly not the case in England, whereArsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea haven't lost to anyone else but one another since January 2019, when Chelsea were beaten 3-2 by Birmingham. There have been calls for the Football Association to do something about the growing gap between England's elite sides and the rest of the league, but how can you punish clubs for investing in their women's team? “When people tell me that women should have a ceiling on their wages or a ceiling on opportunities or a ceiling on progression and growth, I’m always going to be at odds with that,” Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said after her team’s huge victory over Bristol. “I don’t believe in salary caps, I don’t believe in restricting the growth of our game. We should celebrate it. We should celebrate the opportunities we’re providing for women at the very top. “It’s not always fair, but I’m hoping what happens at the top with broadcasting eventually will drip down and help build the rest. “Might there have to be some teething pains to get to that level? Yes. Is there a gap? Yes. But I want to focus on all the great things women’s football and women’s sport does in this country and build on that and hope we take it even further this season.” For all the negatives that have been pointed out over the last few weeks, though, there are signs that the WSL can become the best league in the world. While the reason for some of those massive summer signings is that the NWSL isn’t taking place in its full form this year, the league still has a massive draw with its professionalism. Furthermore, for a team like Tottenham, signing Alex Morgan is a huge sign that they are now taking their women’s team incredibly seriously. As for on the pitch, yes, there is a gap between the very top and the very bottom – but it is being closed.  Chelsea were seen as the unbeatable Galacticos of the division, but they dropped points on the opening weekend to a Manchester United side that only had four outfield players fit enough for their bench. The following week, a well-drilled Brighton side, who recruited shrewdly over the summer, held Manchester City to a goalless draw. And, on Sunday, Everton caused the shock of the season so far, coming from a goal down to knock Chelsea out of the FA Cup.It was another sign that the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal and Man City will face their toughest test yet this year in maintaining their stronghold on the top three places, and all the silverware on offer in England. You have to go back to 2014 for the last time a team outside of that big three won the league, and 2012 in the case of the FA Cup. Chelsea, Arsenal and City are also the only three teams to ever win the Continental Cup, which started in 2011. However, Everton's win over Chelsea means the winner of the semi-final between Arsenal and Man City on Thursday night will play an unlikely finalist at Wembley in November’s FA Cup final, be it the Toffees or Birmingham. The Merseyside clubhave backed Willie Kirk financially, but not to the level of the very elite. They are an example of how a team can close that gap with strong support, smart signings, a fantastic coach and some belief. It’s something that Man United are also doing very well, and there are signs are that Tottenham are moving towards that too. If more teams can follow suit, the WSL can really be the best league in the world – but it’s not something that will happen over one summer. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

It was out of the blue and a report that, at the time, was notgiven any serious thought by those who had flown to France from down under to cover the Matildas. After all, it came on the eve of their biggest game yet - there was something more important to focus on. Few would haveimagined that it would lead to almost seven months of constant speculation, eventually culminating in her move to westLondon and long-awaited debut for the Blues on Sunday in their 3-1 win overReading. Thousands piled in to see the Aussie, whose face had led every form of marketing promotion for this fixture, despite it coming just eight days after she touched down at Heathrow Airport. Her name was greeted with raptures when read over the tannoy in the starting line-up, especially when nothing more than a place on the bench was expected. And she certainly whet the appetite of the home fans, combining with BethEngland up front as if they hadbeen playing together years. Itwas Kerr’s backheel flick that led to the England international slotting home an equaliser before the break, following Fara Williams’ opener at the other end, a goal that was coming. It was notthe first flick or trick from the former Chicago Red Stars forward, who could havescored within two minutes herself had she not blazed over, one-on-one with Grace Moloney before her pace led to the goalkeeper seeing red inside 20 minutes. She should havescored when Guro Reiten put the Blues into the lead too, only for her to be denied by substitute Rachael Laws before the Norwegian lifted the ball into an empty net. Of course, Kingsmeadow was never going to see the very best of Kerr in her first appearance in Chelsea colours. Not only was itjust over a week after she arrived in the capital, jet-lagged but well rested, given a much deserved break by the registration rule that meant she could not play in the WSL until December 27, despite signing on November 13. It was also almost two months since Kerr last played a competitive fixture; when Australia beat Chile 1-0 on November 12. This is a player, after all, who had a non-stop 2019, scoring a hat-trick on her return to the Red Stars in July, that, coincidentally, was also just eight days after Australia were eliminated from the World Cup by Norway. 🇦🇺 @samkerr1 ➡️ @Bethany_Eng15 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿Neat, clever build-up play with a finish to match! pic.twitter.com/p5llWcupqE It feels like years since that triple haul against the Orlando Pride, such has been the intensity of the speculation of her moving to Europe. For Chelsea fans, it will feel like they havebeen waiting years for her debut too, when in reality, it has been just short of two months since the 26-year-old’s signing was announced. Since then, any keen women’s football fan has notbeen able to browse social media without seeing her face, name or videos of just what she can do. There were glimpses of the latter against Reading. Her sheer pace, trickery, clever movement and ability to read play all shining through before she was withdrawn after 77 minutes. There is always the danger of overhyping a new signing, but it is difficult to do that with a player who holds almost every single scoring record in both the NWSL and W-League have. With leaders Arsenal to come later this month, this game was about Emma Hayes blooding Kerr into life as a WSL player nicely, something that she willcontinue to do in the two games that follow. Hayes knows full well that the Aussie could hold the key to wrestling this year’s title from Arsenal. As the Blues pursue that, the WSL will see more than their fair share of Kerr and her quality, there is no doubt about that. And once she has spent eight months or so settling into her new surroundings, the general cliche of overseas transfers says that next season will be even better. For now, Chelsea supporters, followers of the WSL and women’s football fans around the world have had their glimpse. And those who were at Kingsmeadow today? Well, they have an ‘I was there’ story that should age like a fine wine. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

In English football, it’s almost a myth. It’s talked about year after year, with questions about the rare achievement usually aimed at the head coach of Manchester City’s men’s team, Pep Guardiola, or, more recently, Emma Hayes, the manager of Chelsea’s women’s team. City’s chances this season were scuppered by Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea beating them in the FA Cup, though they could still secure an historic treble. Hayes’ side, meanwhile, are in the UEFA Women’s Champions League final on Sunday, having wrapped up the Women’s Super League title last weekend and claimedthe Continental Cup in March. They are in the fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup, which will be carried over into next season. As much as Hayes likes to dismiss the talk of winning the lot – understandably so, given some questions around it started long before Chelsea had even put one trophy in the cabinet this season – she is in a unique position. Not only does she find her superbly assembled team perfectly placed to pull it off, with two of four trophies already secured, she was also involved onthe one occasion it was done before. It’s 14 years since Arsenal’s women’s team became the first and only English side to win the quadruple. It was Hayes’ first season as the assistant to Vic Akers, the man she regards as the greatest coach in the history of the women’s game. “I remember just a young, dynamic, energised coach that brought in a lot of enthusiasm,” Karen Carney, who had joined the Gunners that same season, tellsGoal. 13 years ago the legend that is @TheRealVicAkers led this unbelievable team to European success, not to bettered by anyone. What a team it was👏👏 pic.twitter.com/Fl9MROKgxQ Carney would go on to work under Hayes at Chelsea, too, in a fantastic career laden with 11 trophies. “It was quite a match made in heaven with Vic, who's very old school and, like all the best coaches, made things simple,"" Carney explains, ""and then [Hayes]would bring in that flamboyance, creativity.” Arsenal had been the dominant force in England for many years and would be for many more, but winning the quadruple meant causing a big upset. After all, Umea, their opponents in the UEFA Women’s Cup final, as the UWCL was known then, were what Carney refers to as “the Galacticos of women’s football”. “If you want to compare it, actually, Arsenal’s achievement was unreal,” Hayes said this week. “To think Arsenalwon that against a full-time team that was training with top players. ""Arsenal, at the time, were training for three [or] four nights a week. You couldn't compare it in many ways. That's why I think that story is so successful.” There are similarities between Arsenal then and Chelsea now,though. Indeed, the impact Hayes’ time with Akershad on her is very evident today.  “Vic taught me so much about what it means to play for a football club,” Carney remembers, something that can certainly be likened to the passion that Hayes has for Chelsea. That love of the clubhas a direct impact on her players, who all understand what it means to pull on the shirt.Talk about the culture, the respect andthe attitude – it's all present at Chelsea, just as it was at Arsenal. “The one thing that Arsenal did was win and they did that by making sure that you stay together andalways respect the badge,” Carney adds. Hayes even noted herself this week that Chelsea'smentality is the same, while thealmost faultless recruitment is similar too, both in the sheer quality of it and the long-term approach. “Vic was putting pieces of the puzzle together for quite a long period of time,” Carney explains. “He came to my house the year before and said, 'I want to sign you, but it's a bit too early. Come next season, you will be an Arsenal player.'"" The England midfielder, then just 18 years old, would bethe only player in Arsenal’s starting line-up in the 2007 final signedthat season. At Chelsea, Pernille Harder and Melanie Leupolz are the only regular starters that have been at the club for less than 12 months. ""The principles are exactly the same,"" Carney adds.""It's about recruitment, it's about building a project, creating a culture and a mentality. Emma has done that now at Chelsea."" That approach is something that has helped their opponents on Sunday too, with the core of Barcelona’s team having been togetherfor five or six years now.   However, the one big difference isstrength in depth. The investment the Blues have made in recent years has helped Hayesbuild one of the strongest squads on the planet, which played a pivotal role in them winningthe WSL this season. Of course,credit must also go to the manager and the way she has hand-picked each individual based not only on their abilities, but their personality. “Arsenal played that [UEFA Women's Cup]final without Kelly Smith, and still won. I'm not saying losing a Kelly Smith-type equivalent would be catastrophic for us, of course it would be,” Hayes said this week, with Smith regarded as one of England’s greatest ever footballers, if not the greatest. “But I think we've got more depth to fill in around it. That's the difference.” It was some feat for Arsenal to write themselves into history all those years ago with an achievement that has yet to be matched, particularly when you factor in their underdog status for the European title. For Hayes to translate huge elements of their success into the building of this Chelsea team was a no-brainer. After learning up close what it takes to be a relentless winning machine, she’s created another in the south of London. The question is now around whether she can help another club secureanother quartet of trophies. But the truth is, that won’t be on her mind on Sunday. The Champions League is the elusive title that she and Chelsea crave more than anything. If they can put that one in the cabinet, then, just maybe, she’ll talk about the quadruple.

It's a feat that has only been achieved once - by Real Madrid in the 1950s, when Alfredo Di Stefano was the star in Spain. That is, until now. On Sunday, Lyon wrote their names into history, again,by winning their fifth Women's Champions League (UWCL) title in a row, beating Wolfsburg 3-1in Bilbao. Every time this teamsteps on a pitch, they seem to set new records. No one has played in more semi-finals, more finals, or won more UWCL titles in history than them, a record they have now extended from six to seven. No club has won more matches in the competition. No club has won more games in the competition. No club has scored more goals in the competition. This period of dominance that Lyon are enjoying will go down in history as one of the greatest eras for not just a football team, but a team in any sport, and many of the players involved over the last five years will go down as some of the greatest to play the game. Goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, forward Eugenie Le Sommer,centre-back Wendie Renard and winger Amel Majri have now won seven Champions League titles. Seven. Bouhaddi is 33 years old and has just signed a new contract until 2024. Le Sommer and Renard are31 and 30, respectively, whileMajriis just 27 years old.This isn't a dynasty that is going to end any time soon. Complementing theseexperienced players are young players who have been immersed in the elite mentality it takes to stay at the top for so long. Delphine Cascarino, for example, was the star of the show against Wolfsburg. Her pace out wide was far too much for Wolfsburg to deal with, allowing her to burst through and tee up Le Sommer for the opening goal, then forcingSara Doorsoun-Khajeh into a lunge that actually injured the German defender before half-time. She's 23 years old.  But it's not just about the players who come and stay here, either. That's what makes Lyon so special. ""We have had a squad for a number of years and a president who believes in this, who has given us money andresources to build a top level side,"" Renard told the press on Saturday. ""Players come and go but we try to keep this Lyon DNA. ""I can’t win trophies on my own. I win silverware because there are players in the squad that have been at the top for so long. ""I came in at 16, I learned from [Camille] Abily, [Elodie] Thomis and so on. You can learn a lot from those players. In different teams, we’ve always had the same mindset."" It doesn't matter who is on the pitch, when those players have that Lyon badge on their shirt, they know what to do. This time, the final was won without  the Champions League's all-time top goalscorer, Ada Hegerberg,  on the pitch. It was wonwithout Amandine Henry too, their midfield general only fit enough for the bench. Nikita Parris was suspended, but has come in to do a fantastic job in Hegerberg's absence  since herawful ACL injury.  In defence,Sakina Karchaoui has done a stellar job on the left in the last two games, only making her club debut in the semi-finals following a summer move from Montpellier. Players likeKarchaoui don't have the same experience as someone like Renard, but they were calm and composed all the same when it came down to the last few minutes of this final and Lyon were leading just 2-1, before former Wolfsburg starSara Bjork Gunnarsdottiradded a third.   Lucy Bronze, one of the best players in the world,  is set to move on this summer, but she will be efficiently replaced, as is the Lyon way. When their current superstars, the likes of Renard and Henry, finally retire, they too will be. Most impressive of all is that the won't buy new superstars to replace those that depart. They will sign players with raw talent, great potential and the desire to work hard, who will go on to develop into world-beaters at the club. ""When you work at Lyon, you understand why they win everything,"" former Lyon midfielder Kenza Dali, currently at West Ham,said this week. ""Every day is a high level. When I spoke with Lucy Bronze when she signed at Lyon,we spoke about the difference between England and France. She said, ‘Every day is a game day for me’. ""Every training is so hard, really hard, they train so hard. You have to win your place every day. You have to be at your best every day and that’s why they win everything."" As long as that environment remains,it will continue to be nigh-on impossible to stop this Lyon team from continue to set records, and then break them. Whoever does manage to stop their dominancewill be a very, very special team indeed. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Hegerberg finished last season as the French league's top scorer with 31 goals and netted 15 in the Champions League as Lyon went on to win the competition.

Hegerberg was the UEFA Women's Player of the Year in 2016 and has won the league, Coupe de France and Champions League three times apiece with Lyon. Despite her continued success, however, she us unlikely to compete at the World Cup in France next year over a dispute with the Norwegian Football Association.

The Norway international then moved further ahead at the top of the chart by netting for the 53rd time early in the second half.

The first ever Ballon d'Or Feminin winner and nominated for this year's award, Hegerberg has been in incredible form for Lyon since joining from German side Turbine Potsdam five years ago and set several records since then. It took her just 37 games to net 37 times in the continental competition and she even set a newrecord for most goals in a single campaign with 15 in 2017-18. Despite her impeccable record at club level, Hegerberg has not played for Norway since 2017 due to a dispute with the Norwegian Football Federation, leading to her missing the 2019 World Cup in France. Hegerberg has suggestedthat women's football does not get the respect it deserves in her homeland, pointing to unequal pay and a lack of investment as evidence. ""It was tough at so many camps. I have been broken mentally,” she told Josimar of her experience with the national teamearlier this year. ""It has been a deeply depressing feeling. I had nightmares after being with the national team, you shouldn’t have things like that. If you want to get anywhere in life you have to make choices.

433,https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-her-career-highlight-to-world-cup-injury-agony-ballon/1hlkk2ytgfgab1mo9fyyd82yd1,From career highlight to World Cup injury agony: Ballon d'Or nominee Marozsan's crazy season,"When Dzsenifer Marozsan makes the short journey to Paris on Monday night for the Ballon d’Or ceremony, she’s not expecting to leave with the trophy in hand. If it were any other year, she would be a front-runner. The Lyon playmaker is a generational talent, one who has collected three Champions League winners’ medals, three French league titles and twice lifted the French Cup since leaving Frankfurt in 2016. But, after a year plagued by injuries, she’ll be rooting for her team-mates on Monday – not that she’d be sat rooting for herself if things were different. “You know me, I will never say [myself]!” she tells Goal, laughing when asked who she thinks will pick up the prestigious award – but told she cannot pick herself. “I’m happy we have six players from Lyon [nominated] and I just hope it’s one of us.” Representing the club alongside Marozsan on the list of nominees is Ada Hegerberg, who won the inaugural edition of the accolade last year, and Amandine Henry, Sarah Bouhaddi, Wendie Renard and Lucy Bronze. The latter is always quick to talk about the talents of her German team-mate, telling the media over the summer that she is without a doubt the best player in the world. “In terms of football talent and ability, you rarely see players like that,” she said during this summer’s World Cup, delivering her response to England boss Phil Neville’s claims that the defender herself should win the Ballon d’Or. “You’ve not seen the best of her because she got injured in the first 10 minutes in the first game and struggled to get back to fitness to play against Sweden. “She’s someone that I’m really good friends with and I’m gutted for her.” It was no small injury either. Although she would complete the full 90 minutes of Germany’s first World Cup group stage game against China, Marozsan suffered a broken toe that would rule her out for the next three games. In any other circumstance, she would have been out for much longer. With it being the World Cup, she returned for the quarter-final against Sweden three weeks later, playing through an injury that had yet to heal. “The toe was broken. Normally, it’s not possible, but I took the risk,” she says. “We decided together [that I would play] and I would do it again. We lost the game, but it’s not because of that, it’s a lot of things.  “We have to continue and stay positive. I think we can learn a lot from this World Cup. We have a good team. We know that. “I have never been lucky with the World Cup. “All the time, I have injuries when the World Cup is starting. It’s like this, but I continue and hopefully [for] the next World Cup I will be fine. “[Injuries are] hard, but that’s football.” The way which she brushes off disappointment is admirable. Marozsan is never one to dwell on the past, but rather focus on what is next and what she can win. It’s a mentality boosted by the fact that last summer, she was given news that made her wonder whether she would ever play football again. “It was really hard with my sickness, for sure. It was a scary moment for me,” she says, reflecting on the moment in which she discovered she had a pulmonary embolism in her leg. “But I was sure I would come back and I just took my time and listened to the doctors.” The injuries are part of Marozsan’s story now, another example of her drive, motivation and professionalism; obstacles she has had to overcome that make her a great choice as one of Team Visa’s inspiring athletes. Nonetheless, it’s her incredible talent that gives her the platform to be a role model for young people around the world. For those that have seen Marozsan work her magic on the pitch, her calmness off it will come as no surprise. The German midfielder operates with a touch of class that makes the brilliant look effortless, never rash in her decision-making. It’s that which makes her the best playmaker in the game, and it’s something that comes from the footballers in her family - as does her ability to stay grounded. “For me, [my role model] was always my brother because he was really talented, but also he was always calm. He also never forgot where he was from. “That’s really important because even if you win a lot of things, you should never forget where you are from.   “That’s my way, that’s how I think, that’s why he was [my role model]. “Also, my father, he was a professional football player and that’s what he showed me. “That’s how I live my career now.” Those morals stay close to her heart and are what made her latest Champions League triumph so special. Although Marozsan has been capped 97 times by Germany, she was born in Budapest, Hungary – the location of this year’s European final. “I said to my team-mates everyday, ‘Please, girls, just this year, we have to do it again. Please!’” – and they did exactly that, with Marozsan herself breaking the deadlock in Lyon’s 4-1 win over Barcelona. “It was unbelievable. It was the most amazing moment in my life,” she says. “I will never forget it.It was so special for me, for sure that we won it, but the most important [thing] for me was that my family could be in the stadium for the first time ever. “That was so amazing.” Now, after her team-mates helped her enjoy the greatest moment in her career so far, she is hoping that one of them will receive their ownincredible momenton Monday night. And while Bronze may have spent the summer dismissing Neville’s claims that the England star should win it, Marozsan is backing the coach on this instance, not her close friend. “For me, it’s Lucy, the best player, the best defender in the world – and she knows that as well,” she says, happy to pass the individual attention onto someone else. And when a footballer of Marozsan's calibre declares someone as the best, who are we to argue? Marozsan was speaking at the Team Visa Summit, where 16 of Europe’s top female football players came together at Visa’s European Headquarters to discuss the future of the game. As members of Team Visa, these athletes will receive the tools, resources and support they need to achieve their lifelong dreams, both on and off the football field.

434,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-trailblazing-champion-pernille-harder-story/1pxmvg3yu92pd19emune245yrs,Chelsea's trailblazing champion: Pernille Harder's story,"Pernille Harder does notremember exactly what Zlatan Ibrahimovic said to her when the pair shared a stage in 2015. “It was something like, ‘Believe in yourself and keep doing what you’re doing,’” the Dane reveals in an exclusive interview with  Goal  at Chelsea's Cobham Training Centre. What she does remember, though, is how people started watching her more closely afterwards. Taking centre stage at an awards show with Swedish superstar Ibrahimovic was always going to garner Harder extra attention. And she did notdisappoint, establishing herself as one of the finest players in the women’s game over the next few years with her creativity and lethal finishing. However, it was a seemingly innocuous act off the field that made Harder belatedly realise just how important a public figure she could become. After an ecstatic Magda Eriksson had helped Sweden reach the quarter-finals of last year's Women's World Cup, she sought out Harder, who was in the crowd, and the couple shared a kiss. Perfectly natural, nothing unusual: player kisses partner after important victory. Eriksson and Harder understandably thought nothing of it. Images of the two quickly went viral, though, held up as a beautiful symbol of pure love in a world still divided by hate. Within a matter of minutes, Harder suddenly had thousands more followers on her social media channels.  ""It made me realise that I have a platform; that we have a platform,"" the 27-year-old explains. ""People are listening to me and seeing what happens on my platform. ""It showed me that I have a voice and, after that, I have wanted to use it more because I feel it makes a difference. ""It is very important to have role models, no matter who you are. In our community, it is even more important because it helps you understand that you are not alone by being homosexual or something like this. ""It is a special topic because people maybe don't like to talk about it or they don't want to come out, so, it is important to have role models so that you can feel more secure about yourself."" The LGBT+community certainly could nothave a much better role model than Harder. She grew up in the small Danish town of Ikast watching Premier League football because of her father, Mogens, who was an avid Manchester United fan. At the time, Harder had few female role models to look up to, but her dream was to become the best footballer in the world. She has now achieved that goal. After winning Germany's and UEFA's Women's Player of the Year awards for 2020,  the forward has now finished top of the Goal 50 rankings,  pipping Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema to top spot.   Harder's No.1 ranking was well deserved. The striker scored 38 goals in all competitions as Wolfsburg won the double in Germany and reached the final of the Champions League, where they were beaten 3-1 by Lyon. That defeat in Vienna was tough to take, particularly as Harder has yet to get her hands on a winners' medal in Europe's premier club cup competition. ""Of course, I need to win it,"" she admits. ""It is unfinished business until I have won it. But that's why I came to Chelsea, because the club also has those ambitions to win the big titles."" There's no disputing that. Chelsea broke the women's football world record to sign Harder for a reported £250,000 ($330,000) ahead of the start of the 2020-21 Women's Super League campaign. Harder's father obviously would have preferred to see his daughter moveto Manchester United, and fans pleaded with her online to join their club instead. However, Harder's mind had already been made up. Mogens may be a long-time United fan, but Harder has been following Chelsea for some time now because of Eriksson. ""Playing for Chelsea is weird for my dad but now he now supports the women's side at least,"" Harder laughs. ""He still supports Man United's men's team as he's such a big fan but soon I will bring him his first Chelsea shirt and see if he wants to wear it! I won't force him, though! ""But, obviously, I watchedChelsea games during the previous three years because Magda plays here, as many games as I could. ""And I had become a little bit of a fan because I wanted things to go well for Magda. So, now it's even more fun to be part of this team too."" Everything seems to have fallen perfectly into place for Harder, but there will be no let up, no resting on her laurels. She wants that Champions League winners’ medal, and she wants to continue proving herself the best player in the world. ""I think the most difficult part of getting to the top is staying there,” Harder says. “You should not be satisfied with what you have done and say, ‘Okay, that’s it.’ ""So, that's what motivates me, to keep being one of the best players in the world. If I felt like I was complete, and satisfied with what I have done now, then I would quit playing because I would stop finding football fun."" There is no chance of that, though. Just as there is no chance of Harder of giving up a platform that she knows he can use to make a real difference. Indeed, Harder is now fully aware that she can be just as big a force off the field, as she is on it. The young woman that once shared a stage with Ibrahimovic is now a star in her own right.

435,https://www.goal.com/en/news/caroline-graham-hansen-barcelonas-assist-machine-driven-by/biwblbj8zwdy10z9xbfwyz13y,Caroline Graham Hansen: Barcelona's assist machine driven by Champions League disappointment,"Caroline Graham Hansen has achieved more in her 10 years as a footballer than most do by the time they hang up their boots. With 16 major honours in three different countries, 84 caps for Norway and almost 100 goals from her 250 senior club games, there’s plenty for her to be proud of. But there is one title that eludes her: the Champions League. The winger had two shots at European glory in her five years with Wolfsburg - starting one of the finals, missing the other through injury - both of which ended in defeat. But it’s more a motivation than an area of concern for Graham Hansen. After all, she’s only 25 years old – and, for many, one of the best players around. In the 2019 Goal 50, she ranked 13th in the world for female players. “I think everybody wants to win the Champions League,” she tells Goal. “Of course, it sucks to be on the losing side, but that’s sport. That’s football. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I can’t do anything about it. “I enjoy playing the tournament and I am calm about the fact that I will hopefully get another possibility to play a final and another possibility to win it. “I get a positive motivation from picturing myself maybe one day winning it. That’s a good motivation to have.” On Tuesday, Graham Hansen will face her old club, Wolfsburg, with another shot at the Champions League title at stake. She left Germanyfor Barcelona last summer, announced just two days after the Spanish side had finished runners-up in Europe's premier competition. At times with Wolfsburg, injuries had threatened to stop the Norwegian from fulfilling her potential, but she continued to bounce back. In her fifth and final season with the club, she did as she always has: she dazzled. Before moving to Barca, Graham Hansen picked upher third Bundesliga title, her fifth German cup and scored 12 goals in 27 games in all competitions. In 22 league games, she provided 25 assists. Now, in Spain, there are new ways to improve and new things to learn.  “For me, it was a new adventure,” she says, talking about her decision to move on. “[Barcelona] werevery honest that it was their first time in the Champions League final [last season] and they wanted to build on that. As the season progressed, I also felt that we had a good possibility of doing great in [the Champions League]. “In terms of how we’re playing, we are taking so many big steps. It’s been a journey and it still is. I don’t think anyone is expecting us, or considering us, as a winner this year, but for us it’s all about the journey. “We are taking that step by step and eventually, the way we work, I am very sure that we will get there.” Like Barcelona in 2019, both of Graham Hansen’s Champions League final defeatscame at the hands of the European powerhouse of women’s football: Lyon. The French giants have won the competition four years in a row now, and a record six times in total. They are a prime example of the rewards that are waiting for those who invest in the women’s game. It’s a point that Visa – the sponsor of UEFA women’s football – is also trying to get across. Graham Hansen is one of many athletes who form its Team Visa, a group of Europe’s elite femalefootballers who the company consult with as part of their sponsorship. “They want to show that with investment, you can move the women’s game forward,” she explains. “They are also very eager to help the women’s game grow. They see the potential in the game, which is very, very cool when it’s a big name and a big brand involved in the sport.” One thing the players on Team Visa have spoken about is the desire for more women’s games to be broadcasted. An improvement has already been made. This year, ahead of the competition's resumption, deals were struck around Europe to show all of the remaining Women’s Champions League games rather than just the final. After last week's quarter-final ties,Barcelona and Wolfsburg are among the remaining teams trying to knock Lyon, who will face PSGin the competition's other semi-final,off their well-earned perch.   “Last year, at Wolfsburg, we thought that we were closer [to Lyon] than we were,” Graham Hansen admits, with the two having played out a thrilling quarter-final tie which the French side won 6-3 on aggregate. “They’ve done an impressive job to just keep that throne. I think each year that goes by where they keep winning, it’s more and more the rest of Europe against Lyon. ""I think they also enjoy that position. You can see that more and more teams come up and get a small step closer to them. “We will have to be humble enough to say that they have been the best team for the last five seasons. A lot of players there have been there for five years so it’s pretty much the same team which is also impressive. “It means that the next team that wins it, there’s going to be a lot of players who have never won it. “Hopefully we are closer this year, hopefully one of us will win this year. We will see.” Whether it’s this year or not, though, for a player of Graham Hansen’s calibre, a Champions League title cannot be too far out of reach.

Lluis Cortes’ side will be competing in their first final on Saturday against the competition’s holders and finished second in the Primeira Division Femenina this season, six points behind winners Atletico Madrid. Speaking exclusively to Goal ahead of the final, Mestre discussed Barcelona’s approach to the ever-growing female side of football. ""Football and society are linked aspects,” he said. “We must speak about female football as we do with a female surgeon or a female entrepreneur, with no differences. “Success brings media attention and they bring it to the public. Progressing in the Champions League allowed us to be on the front pages of many newspapers and televisions, this is already a big success.” Since going professional in 2015, Barcelona Femeni have gone from strength to strength and now sit on the verge of their first major European trophy. Lyon will be no pushover, though, with the French side unbeaten in the league this season having conceded just six goals in 22 games. “[Lyon] have won UCL many times because, between other aspects, they have a higher budget than us and they don't have the amount of professional teams as we have,” continued Mestre. “The female team has shown a very high capacity for progression. “They turned from an amateur team with no professional local players and a low budget to a professional team since 2015, with a higher budget and resources and a lot of local and international players whereas the male team experienced this process a long time ago."" While women’s football is on the rise, it is yet to reach the levels of male football and there still remains a number of barriers preventing its progression. Mestre knows that being successful as a team and lifting as many trophies as possible can help to draw bigger crowds, however, with the club’s ultimate goal being “to win the Liga, Copa and challenge for the Champions League.” “We have a very important role here,” added Mestre. “I’ve known the female team since we arrived in 2010 and since then it has grown a lot, not only at Barcelona. “In our case, winning the league in 2011 allowed us to play in the Champions League and we felt a big improvement which was reflected in the social aspect, and it has kept growing since then. “After that, Iberdrola joined as a sponsor and the games began to be televised and now the engagement is even higher.” Now, Barcelona are one step away from progressing even further as a club and lifting the Champions League trophy – but Mestre believes that getting to the final is a success within itself. ""Reaching the semi-finals and now the final is already a success,” he said. “We began in 2010 with no titles and we were able to win La Liga, Copa de la Reina and Copa Catalunya, and we have been growing in Europe – but winning the Champions League would be a good prize.""

437,https://www.goal.com/en/news/europe-beware-barcelona-prove-theyre-the-real-deal-with/civkwu6jnb8d1vrb3m7j50s4h,Europe beware! Barcelona prove they're the real deal with Women's Champions League rout of Man City,"A quick glance at Barcelona’s substitutes for their UEFA Women’s Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City told you everything you need to know about the quality of their team. The Spanish champions leftLieke Martens, the 2017 FIFA and UEFA Player of the Year,Jenni Hermoso, the top scorer in Spain for four of the last five seasons,and captain Vicky Losada on the bench – and still won 3-0. If anyone had questioned the strength ofthe Spanish league and whether Barcelona–top of the table with 20 wins from 20 games, after scoring 99 goals and conceding just three - were the real deal, they were given an emphatic response on Wednesday afternoon in Monza. The rest of Europe will also have noted that Barca's margin of victory could have been even greater, with the impressive Ellie Roebuck having thwarted a number of other excellent efforts on City’s goal. This is a Barcelona team stacked with talent.In Alexia Putellas, they have a genuine world-class midfielder,whileCaroline Graham Hansen is one of the best forwards on the planet. The likes of Patri Guijarro and Aitana Bonmati, meanwhile, are still very young, butproven talents.And we could go on. Of course, this is a team that has only reached the Women’s Champions League final once before, back in 2019, but Barca now lookmore than capable of taking that final step. “When we put the pieces together, we can beat any team in Europe,” manager Lluis Cortes said.It is beginning to look that way.  To have won 3-0 and there still be a sense that things could have been even better says something very significant about this side's potential. However, they will be hoping the fact the scoreline wasn’t bigger was more down to Roebuck’s display, rather than a re-emergence of thewastefulness that plagued last year'sChampions League campaign. In their 2019-20 semi-final defeat to Wolfsburg, Barca created more than enough chances to progress to the final; they just didn’t put any of them away. “We played a good game and we had enough big chances to score at least three goals,” Graham Hansen said after that 1-0 loss. “But we scored zero and they had one goal out of nothing so, for me, it feels very hard to take, this defeat.” In the opening exchanges of Wednesday’s win over Manchester City, one wondered if thatBarcelona –rather than the ruthlessly efficientversionthat is dominating in Spain –had turned up to play. However, once the deadlock was broken, they never looked like letting their opponents off the hook. Asisat Oshoala scored a terrific opening goal, then won a penalty for Mariona to convert. Hermoso pounced on the rebound of Putellas’ saved shot in the final moments to make it three.   Cortes called it “one of the best” games his team has played. For it to come against a City team who, in his words, are second “in the best league in the world” was a sign that Barcelona have what it takes to rise to these occasions in the Champions League this season. They’ll have to, as well. Next week, they’ll face a spirited City side in the second leg who will not roll over or be disheartened from this defeat. Head coach Gareth Taylor’s comments after the game appeared strange to some –“I think we can turn it around. I think we can do it, no problem at all” – but he has reason to be confident in his team’s ability to win big. City are the top scorers in the Women's Super League. They might not play Barcelona every week, but they have a wonderful attack and are a very good team. That they were beaten so comfortably on Wednesday is huge credit to Barca. In the semi-finals, either Lyon, European champions for the last five years, or Paris Saint-Germain, who are top of the French league, will await. And if they can win that game, the team most are predictingto conquer the other half of the draw is Chelsea, the leadersof, as Cortes calls it, the best league in the world. The old saying is that to be the best, you must beat the best. On paper, Barcelona can get there. Theyneed to keep proving that on the pitch now, just as they did on Wednesday.

438,https://www.goal.com/en/news/birmingham-aston-villa-bristol-worst-time-relegated-womens-super-/16b2ixf33mujq1ge4i3zv00ml3,"Birmingham, Aston Villa, Bristol and the worst time to be relegated from the Women's Super League","There is never a good time to be relegated, but this is certainly not the year for it in the Women’s Super League. Birmingham City, Bristol City or Aston Villa will be demoted on Sunday, but the likely consequences across the clubs could not be more different. With a massive injection of cash from an historic three-year TV deal with Sky, worth £24 million, to come next term, none will want to miss out. Championship clubs will still receive some of that money, but only a quarter of what those at the top table will share. For clubs like Birmingham and Bristol, who have two of the smallest budgets in the WSL, those funds would be absolutely huge and could help them close the gap on those that have raced away from them in recent years. Fortunately for Birmingham, it would take an extraordinary series of events to relegate them. They would need to lose to Tottenham, who are only two places and three points above them, and see the two teams below them win - Villa facing a particularly tricky task against Arsenal - for such an outcome to occur. They should not even be in this relegation battle,  such is the admirable manner in which they have performed despite manager Carla Ward arriving in the summer with just eight senior players on the books. However, a one-point deduction on Friday evening for a misunderstandingregarding a player's suspension means they are just about involved. Bristol start the day bottom of the table, winless since a 3-2 win over Reading in early March. The Vixens have constantly defied the odds this season,  most notably reaching the Continental Cup final.On Sunday, they need to do so again. A victory over Brighton will not secure safety for them alone – they need Arsenal to do them a favour against Villa, or Tottenham to beat Birmingham,too.  Should they fall short, the consequences would likely be much more significant than if Villa did. There would of course be mass disappointment and frustration at the club dropping back into the Championship,  just a year after being promoted,but the support behind the team would not let them stay there for long. Villa took the second tier by storm last term after announcing they would become a full-time professional team before the season began, the only one in the division. The club are clearly well committed to their women’s team and are showing it with the resources provided to them. The vision is unlikely to change should they be relegated. “It can go as far as we want it to,” midfielder Emma Follis said at the beginning of the season, talking about the club’s ambition. “I believe we can become one of the best clubs. That is the ambition of the club, the ambition of Christian [Purslow, chief executive], Eni [Aluko, director of women’s football] and everyone involved.” For Bristol, the situation is much different. Previously known as Bristol Academy, they were renamed Bristol City in 2016, have regularly played games at Ashton Gate, the men’s 27,000-capacity ground, and this season, when manager Tanya Oxtoby announced she was pregnant, the club did something amazing that has never been done before – they brought in another manager, Matt Beard, a two-time WSL champion, as maternity cover. However, with a much smaller budget that other clubs,it would not be a shock if they were togo part-time should they drop out of the top-flight. They are expected to struggle to keep hold of  Ebony Salmon, their wonderfully talented No.9 who just turned 20 years old,this summer regardless of whether they survive. Should they drop down a level, chances are she won’t be the only key player to be targeted by those remaining in the WSL. The ever-increasing professionalism in the Championship makes you wonder when Bristol would be back, too, if they were to go part-time.   This year, Leicester did exactly what Villa did last term to secure promotion and went full-time.Coventry United have ambitions of turning professional in the near future, while Charlton’s women’s team has been reabsorbed by the club in a show of their support. Durham and Sheffield United, two of this season’s top four, also have big plans for the future, with the Blades’ boss Neil Redfearn signing a two-year deal just this week.  Lewes are working towards promotion, too. The fact Liverpool have struggled this year, as a full-time, professional team that didn’t lose too many players after relegation, shows how difficult the Championship is becoming to navigate. It would certainly be sad to see Bristol leave the WSL. After all, they are a founding member of the league and a team who, in 2014-15, represented it in the UEFA Women's Champions League semi-finals.For several years, they were at the forefront of the English women’s football scene, their fantastic youth set-up and focus on developing players paying dividends. But  -like Birmingham, a mainstay in the top-flight since 2002 - they have been usurped over the years by clubs seriously investing in their women’s teams. Clubs like Chelsea and Everton, now two of the most well-backed teams in the league, finished in the bottom half of the WSL when Bristol secured European football in 2013. Manchester Cityweren’t even in the division – now they’re one of the best teams in the country. Manchester United, currently fourth in the table, didn't even have a women's team. Should Villa secure safety at the expense of Bristol this weekend, it would be just another example. Hopefully, if that is the case, it can act as a catalyst and seethe club increase their investment to catch up to the clubs they were once leading.

439,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-futures-of-uswnt-duo-mewis-and-lavelle-to-be/70uba8hfptyg13sub131wvspz,Man City futures of USWNT duo Mewis and Lavelle to be discussed by manager Taylor,"Manchester City head coach Gareth Taylor says further conversations will be had regarding the futures of the U.S. women’s national team midfielders Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle, as the Women’s Super League season comes to a close. City could lift the title on Sunday, but they need to beat West Ham and hope that Chelsea, two points clear at the top of the table, slip up at home to Reading. While the team prepare for such a big game, reports have emerged in the United States suggesting that Mewis will be back with the North Carolina Courage when the season ends. Lavelle, meanwhile, saw her NWSL rights traded to OL Reign back in August of last year.Both players signed one-year deals with City last summer, with the option for another year. Speaking to the press on Friday, Taylor was asked about the future of the two American midfielders, as well as what lies ahead of Jill Scott, the England international on loan at Everton. “Of course, these guys are going to be, hopefully, really busy in the summer with the Olympics, but at some point, we need to sit and obviously have conversations with many players around next season,” he said. “Probably one of the findings that I'm coming to grips with in the women's game is that contracts are fairly short. Especially if you're, like we are, in a situation where you're going for the league, where you want to be waiting until the end of the season to have these conversations. I thought last summer when I took the job was a busy summer, but I think this one will be as well. “At the moment, [Lavelle and Mewis are] similar [to Scott], we need to have further discussions with them. When you're working on short contracts, you have to understand that you're going to have more of these conversations and then it's obviously picking the right moment to do so. “There's going to be quite a bit of discussion had once the games are out of the way. When I say games, I don't just mean Sunday's game. I think we need to make sure that we look after the return leg, if you like, against West Ham in the FA Cup on May 16. “There's going to be a lot of speculation about various players between now and the end of the season, like there already has been. We would rather just be able to speak to the players at the right moment and make sure that everything's covered and we make sure we know where people are next season. But, like I say, there's going to be a lot of conversations around that.”  The USWNT duo have had contrasting fortunes in Manchester since moving last summer. Mewis has thrived, particularly in the first half in the season, with a header in the Women’s FA Cup final victory at Wembley a stand-out moment. She’s scored seven goals in the league, providing two assists, in 16 games. Lavelle, meanwhile, has struggled to find her rhythm, something that has been due to injuries especially. The 25-year-old had her debut delayed until October due to a problem and was again set back with another injury in December, once she had regained fitness. She has shone in moments, though, particularly in the UEFA Women’s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Barcelona, despite City losing the tie. City are currently in discussions with Jamaica international Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw, Goal has learned, and are close to completing a deal for the striker, though there are still some details to finalise. The news this week that Chloe Kelly, the electric winger who has been one of the stars of their season, has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury may well mean the club seek out the signing of another forward, too. If Mewis and Lavelle do leave, it will add a couple of midfielders to Taylor’s shopping list. However, Scott has been performing well on loan at Everton and could well re-establish herself in the team, having been a regular for many years before seemingly falling down the pecking order this season.

440,https://www.goal.com/en/news/he-knows-womens-football-chelsea-womens-manager-hayes/1udcnjpu7lldf1ty5iddo1ih8c,‘He knows women’s football!’ – Chelsea women’s manager Hayes excited about 'open-minded' Tuchel,"Chelsea women’s manager Emma Hayes has lauded the knowledge of men’s head coach Thomas Tuchel on the women’s game, following conversations between the two coaches. Tuchel was appointed by Chelsea back in January after the departure of Frank Lampard. He has since guided the team to the semi-finals of the Champions League and the final of the FA Cup. It’s a good time to be a fan of the club – with Hayes’ side top of the Women’s Super League table and also in the last four in Europe, having picked up the Continental Cup earlier this season.Speaking to the media this week ahead of her side’s second leg with Bayern Munich on Sunday, Hayes expressed her excitement about what is going on across the board in the club. “I had a lovely encounter with Thomas Tuchel,” Hayes said this week. “He's a fantastic guy, a really open-minded, progressive coach. He loves the team. He knows women's football. We had a chat about his time at PSG. We just exchanged conversation in and around Chelsea to be honest with you. “I've been here a long time, so I welcomed him to the club. I'm really excited about him being here. He is top coach, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of interactions between us in his time. There's a reason why the men's team are performing like they are and if we can mirror that success side by side, how fantastic that would be. “I've always said this about Chelsea - we always talk about winning in this place,” Hayes, who has won nine trophies in her nine years in charge, continued. “Now, that's what comes with the territory and we don't mind the pressure, the expectations, the tags, the titles, whatever comes with it. “We just know that we're a club that want to be in winning positions. It's great to think that both the men's and the women's teams have reached these stages, but as I always say, we're about winning things, not just getting here.” With the club in the semi-finals of the both the men's and women's Champions League, there is a chance for Chelsea to create history. No club has ever seen its men’s team and women’s team crowned champions of Europe. Should Hayes and Tuchel's teams lift the trophy this season, Chelsea would become the first to do so. The women’s team will take on Bayern on Sunday in the second leg of their semi-final, trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Germany but bringing a crucial away goal home with them. There is even the opportunity to go one better and possibly become the first club to win both competitions in the same season, with the men’s team also in the Champions League semi-finals. Tuchel and his players also grabbed an away goal in the first leg of their tie in midweek, drawing 1-1 with Real Madrid in Spain on Tuesday. They will host the 13-time European champions on Wednesday, knowing a win will take them into a first final since they won the Champions League in 2012.

441,https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-was-told-if-i-didnt-slow-down-i-might-not-play-football/1ul9ptaqbfu5i16ydg6pfhhqjf,"'I was told if I didn't slow down, I might not play football again' - Chelsea star Kirby relishing WSL return after nine months out","Last time Fran Kirby played in the Women’s Super League, Manchester United were the opponents. That was November of last year. The England international had been on the pitch just two minutes when her tricky feet earned Chelsea a penalty that won them the game, but that would be the last we would see of the nimble attacker for the best part of nine months. In February this year, Chelsea announced the reason behind Kirby's absence. After being absent for four months, the club revealed that Kirby was not suffering with a football injury of any sort, but with pericarditis, which is the swelling and irritation of the thin membrane surrounding the heart. Kirbywas diagnosed with the illness the day after the win over Manchester United. Now, as she prepares to make her WSL return on Sunday against the same opponent, she remarks, light-heartedly: “Hopefully the day after the Manchester United game coming up won’t be as dramatic as the day after the last. “I remember, I was reading about the illness, because I had no idea what it was when I got diagnosed with it, and I never read about one story where someone had overcome it,” Kirby explains. “It was always, ‘Oh I’m good for a month and then I’m really bad again’, or ‘I’m good for two weeks and then I’m really bad again’. “I wanted to show to myself that I could get over this and I had a positive story to give after this illness after reading the negative ones.” Kirby returned to competitive action last weekend as one of the star players in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield. It was a delight for fans of any team to see the 27-year-old put on such a fantastic performance after so long out, with Kirby crediting all those around her for helping her be in such a good place as the season returns. However, there are few people she is more grateful for than Emma Hayes, her manager.  “She’s been incredible. She’s been my rock, she’s been my go-to. She’s been the person who kind of made sure that I was protected from everything,” Kirby says. “I wanted at the beginning for my illness to be very private. I just wanted to focus on getting better, not have to answer questions about it and just kind of focus on making myself well again. “Obviously, I started to feel better and that’s when we put out the statement regarding my illness. “[Emma] was the one that was questioning the doctor all the time, ‘Can we try this? Can we try that?’ She was always the one trying to find the answers and trying to help and it just meant so much to me as a player. “She’s great with everyone, it’s not just a case of she was looking out for me because I was ill, she’ll make sure that she has time for every player and I think that’s really important. “She was always checking in on me, always asking how I was, when I wasn’t feeling great I could just go into her office and just cry in front of her and not feel embarrassed about it. I don’t think I could’ve asked for anyone better. “As was the doctor at Chelsea – incredible. My team-mates were amazing. They’ve probably seen me looking extremely, extremely vulnerable and very poorly for a long time and they still managed to tell me, ‘You look better today! You look like you’re doing alright today’. I’d look in the mirror and be like, ‘They’re lying! But it’s fine’. “I think for me, everyone has been incredible. I’ll never not be grateful for what people have done for me these last few months and Emma is probably – definitely – the top of that list, 100 per cent.”   Kirby not only says her team's success on the pitch motivated her the most during her recovery, but she also describes herself as becoming a huge fan during that time – with goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger her favourite player. But nowshe’s back on the pitch herself and ready to help Chelsea defend their WSL title. “I haven’t really focused on anyone else, especially in these last few months,” Kirby adds. “I’ve just been entirely focused on myself and how I can improve, how I can be better. “I had a conversation with Alex Scott actually a few months ago on her Instagram. I said, ‘For me, I’m going to be doing everything, every single day to be the best version of myself’. That’s one thing that I’ve really stuck to and really put a lot of time and effort into it. “Now, after everything that I’ve been through, I just see it as an opportunity now to go out there and play my best football, enjoy it, enjoy the moment of being able to play. “There was a period where I was told by the cardiologist that if I don’t slow down, I could become chronic and not play again. “I wanted to make sure that I got through that and now I’m just going to go out and enjoy it.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

At the other end of the standings, Liverpool, whose men's team are on course to be crowned Premier League champions this year, have been relegated to the Women's Championship after finishing bottom of the table. With the FAstriving to end the women's football seasonon sporting merit, a points-per-game systemwas used to determine the outcomes of the campaign after 11days of weighing up the options. Emma Hayes' Chelsea were second in the table  at the time of football's suspension  , albeit having played one game less than leaders Manchester City, meaning they edged thetop spot, claiming their third WSL title. Man City's consolation is a top-two finish for the fifth successive season, meaning they pipped last season's champions, Arsenal, to the second UEFA Women's Champions League spot. The Gunners will be without European football in the 2020-21 season,  with the changes to the competition that will ensure three participants from the WSL not to come into place until 2021-22  . The FA's director of the women's professional game, Kelly Simmons, said: ""Firstly, I would like to thank the clubs for their ongoing collaboration and support throughout this period. ""They have played a crucial role in helping to shape the decision-making process, with the welfare of the players and clubs first and foremost. ""I would also like to congratulate the players, coaches and staff of Chelsea and Aston Villa. Although the 2019-20 season has been prematurely curtailed, it has been a hard-fought campaign and their success is well deserved, with the outcome based on sporting merit. ""Women’s football has made huge strides in recent years, and The FA has been at the forefront of investment and support to help grow women’s football at every level of the game. ""Our commitment to the women’s game is unwavering and we will continue to work closely with the clubs to ensure we come back even stronger for the 2020-21 campaign."" 🏆 Congratulations to @ChelseaFCW, who have the best points-per-game ratio and win the title.Along with @ManCity, they will represent #BarclaysFAWSL in the @UWCL next season. pic.twitter.com/rxftiVYkEd Liverpool, who had just one win and six points to show from their 14 league games before football's suspension, will drop out of the top flight of women's football in England for the first time since the WSL was established in 2011. A founding member of the league, the Reds were crowned champions in 2013 and 2014 with a team that featured the likes of Lucy Bronze andFara Williams. ""Liverpool FC is disappointed by today's decision on how the 2019-20 Women's Super League season has been concluded, which will see the Reds relegated to the Championship,"" a club statement said immediately after the WSL decision was announced. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has presented huge, ongoing challenges around the world, the majority far more important than football. The focus of our women’s team and staff since the beginning of the crisis was to be ready to return to WSL play when it was safe and proper to do so. ""We believe we would have been able to meet all operational requirements but a return to play was deemed impractical."" The statement indicated they wouldn't appeal the decision, which would have been complicated by the fact it would juxtapose awkwardly withwanting the opposite for themen's team should the Premier League fail to conclude before they are crowned champions. Liverpool are replaced i the WSL for 2020-21by Aston Villa, who were unbeaten and six points clear at the top of the Women's Championshipwhen football was suspended, having won 13 of their 14 league fixtures. The Birmingham-basedclub have been part of the second-tier since 2014, when it was formerly known as WSL 2, and will becompeting in the WSL for the first time. The final WSL standings make for good reading for Manchester United and Tottenham fans too, with thenewly promoted sides finishing fourth and seventhrespectivelyin their first seasons in the top tier. The FA also confirmedthat ""the resolution of the 2019-20 Women’s FA Cup, which is at the quarter-final stage, is still under review and the FA Women’s Board will meet to discuss the matter later this month"". There is no relegation from the Women's Championshipdue to results from the third tier down to the seventh tier of the Englishgame being expunged. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

443,https://www.goal.com/en/news/beth-england-completes-her-road-to-redemption-as-she/e618p5khx6oc1wdm4v9mxk0ac,Beth England completes her road to redemption as she delivers Continental Cup glory for Chelsea,"“When you come up against the bigger clubs, like Arsenal and Man City, there’s going to going to be that bit more pressure. “It’s all about who handles the occasion the best.” In Saturday'sContinental Cup final programme, Chelsea striker Beth England made it all sound so easy. Anyone wanting the secrets behind the Blues’ incredible season so far would have been left wanting. Victory over Arsenal secured the first piece of silverware of the season for Chelsea. It was their first ever Conti Cup trophy, banishing a demon that Emma Hayes’s side have struggled with since the competition’s inception. That it was England who scored both goals - including a stoppage-time winner - in the 2-1win was fitting. The 25-year-old has madeher mark in every ‘big’ game Chelsea have had this season. Against Manchester City last week,  she fired a rocket into the top corner from 30 yards in a 3-3 draw. Last month,  in Chelsea’s 4-1 demolition of Arsenal,  she opened the scoring with a lovely curled finish. In December, she equalised against Manchester City and then assisted Maren Mjelde for the winner, both goals coming within the last 15 minutes of the game. And  against Arsenal back in October,  it was her strike that levelled the scores and started the Blues’ comeback as they dealt the Gunners their first loss of the season. It’s incredible to think that when England first arrived from Doncaster five years ago, she struggled to the point that she didn’t think she’d make it at Chelsea. After scoring three times in four starts in 2016, she didn’t find the net in six the following year and found herself returning to the north to join Liverpool on loan. “It was a tough journey because, in my head, any player that gets loaned out, you think that your manager doesn’t want you,”  she said earlier this season. “But it was changing that mindset and showing you that I can be the player that you need me to be and thankfully I did that. “I was really proud of way I handled it and managed to get back into the Chelsea squad - and now I’ve got the nine shirt.” The first goal goes to the BLUE side of London 🔵  @Bethany_Eng15  doing what she does best!  #ContiCup   pic.twitter.com/81tJYHwtes After netting 10 goals in 16 league games for the Reds, England bagged 12 in 12 starts for Chelsea the following year and this season she has 14 in 15 in the Women’s Super League. She now also has a cup-winning final strike to add to her impressive CV. The switch in mindset is evident. “There were some great players in that squad then, especially the forwards, so it was quite difficult,” she said, reflecting on when she first joined the club. Last month, speaking about the current competition for her place,  she told  Goal  something much different. “It is something that I am enjoying and I am thriving on,"" she said. ""It just makes us all better players together because we are all fighting for our position in the team so it stops complacency. We keep pushing forward."" When Sam Kerr arrived in January, Chelsea were playing with England as a lone striker. Many were quick to think that she’d vacate that position for Kerr and struggle to get into the team. That Hayes changed to a system with two strikers instead, accommodating both, tells you just how good England has been. It’s a system that certainly leaves Chelsea a little more open, seen by the plethora of chances Arsenal created in Saturday's final. But when you have a three-time NWSL Golden Boot winner in Kerr, and arguably the most in-form No.9 in the country in England, how do you leave one out? This was Chelsea’s 25th game of the season. They’ve won 21, drawn three and lost one – that being a penalty shootout defeat to Reading in the Conti Cup group stages. Take England’s goals out of the equation and it would read 18 wins, four draws and three defeats. They’d also be 10 points worse off in the league – a league in which they currently hold the upper hand in in the title race. Crucially, they’d also be without their first ever Continental Cup.

444,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-show-champions-league-credentials-as-chelsea/wcmuul094krs1iu7nk6kev92y,Man Utd show Champions League credentials as Chelsea's galacticos misfire,"When Casey Stoney was asked about Manchester United competing for the top three in the Women’s Super League this season, her response summed up just how far the club have come. “We are in our third season. I do say this quite a lot: is anyone asking the same question to West Ham, who are more into their journey than us, and Tottenham, who are exactly the same position as us?” she said. “But with the badge comes expectation and I wouldn’t simply show up if I didn’t want that expectation.” Their opening fixture of the new WSL could nothave been more difficult – against reigning champions Chelsea. But it also could not have offered a better chance for the league to see if United really are ready to compete for those Champions League places, as so many believe they are. The early answer? After a 1-1 draw, they may well be. United were often left kicking themselves last seasonagainst the big teams, losing 1-0 to Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea before the league was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While chasing games, those opponents were bringing superstars off the bench. It was depth that Stoney's sidejust could notcompete with in their first season since promotion. Inexperience would cost the team, too, when it came to the closing moments, with many players in their first ever top-flight campaigns. It might just be one game in, but there was a different feeling on Sunday. “I think its belief in the squad, an extra level of belief. Even if we go 1-0 down, we can still win, we don’t have to think we’ll lose the game,” goal-scorer Leah Galton said, explaining the difference from last season after he equaliser cancelled out Sam Kerr's opener for Chelsea. “At the end you think 'don’t let this happen again, they’ve worked so hard, it would be a sucker-punch if they conceded now',” Stoney added. “It’s probably belief and mentality really, standing strong in those moments.” There are already signs that Stoney is learning from her first season in the league. United could not compete with the depth of Chelsea’s squad this weekend. On the bench at Leigh Sports Village, the Blues had Bethany England,scorer of 14 goals in 15 league games last year; Jessie Fleming, the Canadainternational midfielder with almost 80 caps to her name; Erin Cuthbert, a creative forward who was one of the Blues' key players last season; and Pernille Harder, arguably the best player in the world who signed this week from Wolfsburg. In comparison, United had four outfield players on their bench. But Stoney knew the situation at hand, and did notuse it as an excuse.  “There was a reason I brought Jackie [Groenen] off the bench today rather than starting her,” she explains, with the Dutch midfielder a surprise omission from the XI. “We knew [Chelsea] would have five ace cards to play and we might not have that, so I needed that energy and ability to press, and she did that incredibly well.” It istactical nous that like that has managers around the league crediting Stoney as one of the best around. It isthat which has her name linked to England every time the job comes about. Her ability to change a game from the touchline wasa massive factor in not only this result, but in whyUnited are being touted for the top three. The exciting thing about this United team, though, is that there is so much more to come. Forwards Jess Sigsworth and Ivana Fuso, as well as defender Martha Harris, were all out injured on Sunday. New signing Lucy Staniforth was also missing through suspension. Throw in the reports that deals for U.S. women's national team duo Christen Press and Tobin Heath are done, and this is only a glimpse of what United can do this season. “I think we can only go up,” Galton smiled. “The first game is the rustiest game. You’re not quite yourself, you’re getting used to it. “If we can perform like that on opening day, we can go far with this squad.” As always, Stoney will stay grounded – “it’s the first game, I’m a realist about that” – but she knows that what she is building is very special. Chelsea were nowhere near their best, but this is a result that givesUnited a massive boost. “We knew we wanted to be in the top three,” Galton said. “That shows that we can be.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

445,https://www.goal.com/en/news/she-effectively-has-four-kneecaps-chelsea-boss-hayes-urges/cofuq09khi3l16jtz4v37bf0t,'She effectively has four kneecaps!' - Chelsea boss Hayes urges patience with injury-hit Kirby,"Chelsea boss Emma Hayes has urged everyone to ""look after""Fran Kirby as she makes her way back to full fitness, claiming there is a ""collective responsibility""to bring the best out of a special player. Kirby played 75 minutes of the Blues’ 2-1 win over Arsenal, assisting Beth England’s equaliser in an exciting individual performance. But Hayes insists that the England international isn’t anywhere near her best level yet and she wants to see everyone support her in reaching that. “I’ve spent a lot of time not saying much about Fran Kirby, because there is huge expectation on that player,” she explained. “I think it is important for everyone to know that she has made her way back from really, really critical injuries. She has, effectively, four kneecaps. You need to understand that. “A very explosive player like she is might need more time to recover so it’s important we build her through this period. You can’t go from zero to 90 mins. “No, she isn’t anywhere near her best level yet, but she’s come through another game [against Arsenal]. I thought she grew in confidence and yes, you can leave Fran in the game, but I value her life and I value her career. “I think it’s important to put that at the front of it and protect her because there’s not many talents like Fran Kirby, believe you me. “[It’s important to] not overexpose her so she is injured, in the team, injured, in the team. No more. We need to manage her. I have a responsibility to do that and England have a responsibility to do that.” Kirby was called up to Phil Neville’s latest Lionesses’ squad but withdrew before a game was played and returned to Chelsea due to an injury she was carrying heading into the camp. The 26-year-old had already had a demanding summer when she returned to pre-season for the club, having been part of the England team who finished fourth at the Women’s World Cup. But then she picked up an injury when the Blues travelled to Israel for a friendly and has been recovering slowly since. Erin Cuthbert is another who is working back to full fitness, having struggled with injuries after her World Cup campaign with Scotland – withdrawing from the national team squad in August. “I don’t even think they are 75 per cent,” Hayes said of the pair. “Erin only started to train the week of the Tottenham game, Fran had two weeks and no training and then when she came back in the squad, only had a week under her belt.” “They don’t have enough pre-season so you have to take risks, I took risks with Erin [against Arsenal], but sometimes you have to do it,” she added, with Cuthbert having played the full 90 minutes against the Gunners. “I will do it less with Fran. We need to look after Fran. Everybody needs to look after Fran. “We all have a collective responsibility to do that and recognise that she has had a really, really challenging time and she may not get there as quickly as everyone would want. It is important we get her back in the right amount of time.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

446,https://www.goal.com/en/news/kirby-praise-special-but-another-level/mc4efaczjymc139jzr2oq2axe,Kirby: Praise has been special but I can reach another level,"Fran Kirby has been in exceptional form since returning to the pitch after nine months out through illness, but the Chelsea and England forward believes she can be even better. The 27-year-old was diagnosed with pericarditis back in November, a condition which consists of inflammation of the lining around the heart. On Friday, she pulled an England shirt back on for the first time in 14 months and, while it was only an in-house friendly, she was again one of the best players on the pitch, continuing her fine start to the season after a trio of stand-out displays for Chelsea - but for all the praise Kirby has received over the last few weeks, she believes there is still a lot more she can give. “I’m at a stage of my career where I can be more critical of myself,” she said. “I haven’t always been good at that. I struggled to accept when I hadn’t had the best of games because I had got an assist, or I had got a goal or whatever. “You kind of walk off the pitch happy regardless [of the overall performance] and now I’m nit-picking. Could I have done better? Could I have passed there,or should I have been more selfish and maybe scored a goal? “I am at a really good level. I think I am probably the fittest I’ve been for a long, long time just purely because it’s something I’ve worked really hard on for the last three or four months. “I think there is still another level I can go to. I think I can be more clinical in my finishing, I can improve.” Back. @chelseafcw 💙 A post shared by  Fran Kirby  (@frankirby) on  Aug 29, 2020 at 8:05am PDT Kirby returned to competitive action witha stunning display in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield last month. Since then, she has backed up that performance with two more brilliant ones in the Women’s Super League, scoring her first league goal in 16 months against Bristol City – her first goal in any competition  since she netted in England’s third-place play-off at the Women’s World Cup last summer. Chelsea boss Emma Hayes couldn’t help but heap the praise on her forward off the back of that, saying she believes “Fran is at a level above already”. “When you hear a manager say something like that it is really special,” Kirby, who has 45 caps for England, said. “I’ve worked really closely with Emma the last few weeks and we’ve grown a lot closer on and off the pitch. “I think I’ve matured a lot off the pitch. I want to be the best player every day in training, in games, that means I’m the best team-mate.” The praise has come from far and wide, with messages of support for the player once described as a ‘mini Messi’ - by former England boss Mark Sampson - pouring in. ❤️💙  https://t.co/zZfziFJ9um “You see [the support], but I’m trying not to get ahead of myself,” Kirby added. “I still need to work hard and improve, but no support has gone unnoticed, reading everyone’s comments about me being back and all the positives I’ve had. “I need to keep working, I need to keep producing the performances. That’s the journey I’m on. I want to keep progressing on that, but it’s been incredible to hear people saying so many positive things about you, not just as a player but as a person. “I’ve come back energised, I’ve come back smiling. I’m enjoying it. That means more to me, how people see you as a person.” The time away from the pitch has also made her value the return to action more, after so long out on her own. “I train like every day like it is going to be my last one. That’s just the attitude I have,” Kirby said. “I will never underestimate the joy I get out of playing and training, being in a team environment. I’ve spent a lot of time by myself and I learned a lot about myself, it wasn’t always negative, but being in a team, with your friends, day in, day out, there’s nothing that can replicate that. “I take every day and I cherish every day and I enjoy every day and I think that is why my performances are going in the right way. As long as I’m happy, smiling and enjoying myself, hopefully I’ll keep building and keep putting good performances in for my team.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

447,https://www.goal.com/en/news/charles-defying-expectations-after-swapping-relegated/2kqd7ccchmvz1xikb0mdm5uvv,Charles defying expectations after swapping relegated Liverpool for champions Chelsea,"When Chelsea signed Niamh Charles from Liverpool in the summer, there were a lot of eyebrows raised. Charles had just been relegated with Liverpool, scoring just twice in 13 starts and creating less than one chance per game on average. While those numbers were no doubt impacted by the Reds’ general struggles, few expected the youngster to get many minutes for the recently crowned Women’s Super League champions, particularly given how stacked the Blues’ squad is in those forward positions. But though chances have been rare for Charles, it’s not stopped her shining. On Wednesday night, she had her biggest moment yet in a Chelsea shirt, scoring a sensational 90th-minute equaliser to send a Continental Cup quarter-final tie with Manchester City to extra time. Emma Hayes’ side looked down and out when Lauren Hemp put City 2-1 up in the 85th minute, but Charles, subbed on late in the second half, suddenly produced a moment that showed exactly why the club signed her. Teeing herself up perfectly with a great first touch on her chest, she struck the ball perfectly on the volley to send it looping over the outstretched Karen Bardsley and into the top corner. What followed was historic: Chelsea were 4-2 victors in extra time, sealing their first ever win at the City of Football Academy on their 10th visit. Two more substitutes made sure of the win, with Guro Reiten scoring the third before teeing up Sophie Ingle for a stunning fourth, with Hayes putting the win down to “the depth of the squad”, before singling out Charles for praise. 🎩 @niamhcharles7 IS MAGIC 🎩As soon as @ManCityWomen go in front, the supersub puts @ChelseaFCW back in it! 🔵We're going to extra-time 😬#ContiCup pic.twitter.com/znaZgyIz4l “She has been unbelievable in the training environment and she's been patient, she's been quiet, she hasn't said anything when she hasn't been in the team, she's just kept at it. “I'm telling you, that whole dressing room is over the moon for her, just like it will be Sophie Ingle, because sometimes the quiet ones don't get all the credit.” This season, Charles has played five league games, starting just once – but she’s got one goal, one assist and is creating a chance for a team-mate every 23 minutes. She might not be leading the league with stats, but the glimpses she has shown were enough to earn a handful of England call-ups at the end of 2020. The Lionesses didn’t play any competitive fixtures in that time due to a number of coronavirus-related reasons, denying Charles a first senior cap, but she thrived in the team’s in-house friendlies, even when playing as a right-back at times, rather than her more natural roles as a playmaker or a winger.  On Wednesday, she discovered a new position too, playing the last 15 minutes as a No.9 for Chelsea. “I think she could play full-back, she could play out wide, she could play up top,” Hayes said. “England have got a cracker on their hands. “She's playing with world-class players every day, so your application and your attitude have to be spot on because it's easy to fold. I have to put Jessie Fleming in the same category. “Those two people have been diligent and patient in their work and they're in a world=class team, so it's not going to be easy for them. “But I promise you this: those two people will find plenty of opportunities playing for this team because of how they apply themselves on a daily basis and how respected they are in the dressing room, because of how hard they work and contribute to the team and sometimes without even getting picked on a weekly basis.” That win over Man City sent Chelsea into the semi-finals of the Conti Cup, keeping them fighting on four fronts. As well as the league, they are into the last 16 of the Women’s Champions League and will have Women’s FA Cup fixtures later this season, the competition currently on pause due to all grassroots football in England being suspended. With all of those fixtures on Chelsea’s calendar, Charles will no doubt get plenty of chances to shine. With the manner in which she’s grabbing those opportunities with both hands at the moment too, Wednesday night’s strike will be the first of many memorable moments as a Chelsea player.

Every camp from now on is aimed at building a team capable of competing for the highest honours in world football, including the prestigious home EURO in 2022 and, ultimately, the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2023. “It is important that we offer as many opportunities as possible for some of the country’s best young talent to stake their claim for a place in the senior England squad for this exciting three-year period. “All the youngsters who have been given their opportunity today are extremely deserving of their senior call-ups, having performed strongly at club level and through England’s development teams. Now is their opportunity to prove themselves at senior international level and I am excited to see the blend of youthful ambition and senior experience. “Introducing greater competition for places and providing opportunities for young players to develop is absolutely key to taking England Women to the next level as we begin the long build towards the home EURO and FIFA Women’s World Cup.” England squad: Goalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Birmingham City), Sandy MacIver (Everton), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City), Carly Telford (Chelsea) Defenders: Lucy Bronze (N/A), Millie Bright (Chelsea), Grace Fisk (West Ham United), Alex Greenwood (N/A), Steph Houghton (Manchester City),Abbie McManus (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Manchester City), Demi Stokes (Manchester City), Millie Turner (Manchester United), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Lotte Wubben-Moy (N/A) Midfielders: Niamh Charles (Chelsea),Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Jill Scott (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Manchester City), Ella Toone (Manchester United), Keira Walsh (Manchester City), Katie Zelem (Manchester United) Forwards: Rinsola Babajide (Liverpool), Rachel Daly (West Ham United, loan from Houston Dash), Bethany England (Chelsea), Chloe Kelly (Manchester City),Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Beth Mead (Arsenal), Alessia Russo (N/A), Ellen White (Manchester City) Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Those watching whowantedto see signs that the Emma Hayes' side have the elite mentality requiredgo further in Europe’s premier competition than ever before, however, got what they wanted. Those are the two sides to this Chelsea team, and it was the latter that shone through over two legs as theybeat Atletico3-1 on aggregate. That isnot to say Hayes was happy with the manner in which Chelsea overcame a few scares in the second leg to progress. England and Atletico forward Toni Duggan smashed a penalty against the bar;a penalty the Spanish side felt should’ve been their third of the game, not their first. Down the other end moments later, Maren Mjelde scored from 12 yards to kill the tie, despite Emelyne Laurent’s late goal. “We have to be better than we were today, if we’re going to progress,” Hayes said post-match. But the sub-par performance, with Chelsea “a bit leggy” aftertheir third game in seven days, can also be flipped into a positive. Cool as you like from @MarenMjelde yet again! 🥶#CFCW #UWCL pic.twitter.com/PIKIddnPrR Asked what message she believes the win will send to the rest of Europe, Hayes said: “You've seen us at best with 10 players last week, and even when we weren't at our best, we're still winning. That is a sign of a good team. “To become a great team, we have to keep finding the other levels in ourselves. We haven't accomplished anything yet.” Such is the fast-moving nature of Chelsea’s season, the team will notget too much time to reflect on what was an immensely impressive victory in terms of their mental toughness. In four days’ time, they have a Continental Cup final against Bristol City to win. “Ice baths, recovery pants, flight home, recovery day, day off, in for Saturday, game Sunday,” Hayes reeled off the schedule that has become routine for a side still battling for trophies on four fronts. Despite missing their captain and leader, Magdalena Eriksson, at centre-back in both legs;despite Sophie Ingle being sent off after 13 minutes in the first game; and despite Atletico being awarded three penalties over the two matches, the Blues became the first confirmed quarter-finalists in this year’s Women’s Champions League. A slice of pizza and an ice bath will be the players’ reward for such a gruelling but rewarding week, Hayes laughed, as Chelsea prepared to fly back to London after Atletico’s ‘home’ tie was held in Monza, Italy. But the manager herself did get a brief chance to reflect after the game on the progression of a project she has been overseeing for nine years. “I don't think we would have come through this [tie] two years ago, with the squad we had then,” she said. Given that two years ago Chelsea were playing in a second successive Champions League final, such a statement is telling of where they are now ontheir journey. They are, of course, not the only team who have improved.  In France, Paris Saint-Germain have closed the gap onfive-time defending European champions Lyonwhile in Spain,Barcelona are seven points clear at the top of the Primera Division, with three games in hand. Chelsea's main WSL rivals, Manchester City,have themselves built wonderful squad depth, too. The quarter-finals of this competition, which will be drawnon Friday, is the stage where heavyweights will really start to be pitted against each other. But, as the old cliché goes, to be the best, you have to beat the best. It isa motto that Hayes certainly lives by. Atletico Madrid - despite their struggles this season meaning they are outside of the Champions League places in the Primera Divisionstandings - was the toughest draw Chelsea could have got. Hayes repeated over and over again that it was the tie she and the team wanted. Asked on Wednesdayif there is anyone in particular she would like in the quarter-finals, she responded with a shrug. “No,” she saidplainly, with a pause. “We just deal with it.” When all manner of obstacles were put in their way in this last-16 tie, that isexactly what Chelsea did. That isexactly what winners do. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

450,https://www.goal.com/en/news/former-man-utd-striker-salmon-fuelling-relegation-threatened/14yurh0ptsdcj1s3t0228s6aqv,Former Man Utd striker Salmon fuelling relegation-threatened Bristol’s unlikely cup dream,"When Ebony Salmon faced Manchester United just over a year ago, she was always going to have a little more fire in her belly than usual. The striker already hasa fantastic strike-rateat the tender age of 20, averaging morethan a goal every other game through spells with Aston Villa, Sheffield United and now Bristol City. Such is her importance for her current club that, if you took her goals away from the Vixens this season, they’d have just one point to their name in the Women’s Super League and they certainly wouldn’t be in the last four of the Continental Cup. But while her double in the quarter-finals– whichput Bristol through to Wednesday’s tie against Leicester –might rank among the highlights of her career so far, her strike against Manchester United in last year's league meeting still occupies top spot in that particular list. The forward had a brief stint with the club in between her spells with Villa and Sheffield United, but failed to make a single appearance before leaving to join Bristol in the summer of 2019. A few months later, she was the only name on the scoresheet as the Vixens shocked United with a 1-0 win that helped keep them in the division last season. ""I had a few conversations there when I was leaving, questioning if I was ready for that league,” she told Bristol Live last month.“I think that [goal] just proved people wrong – and proved that I was.” Fast forward 12 months and her reputation has only grown. Her goals are again proving crucial in Bristol’s battle to stay up, with two against Brighton on Saturday helping them to their first win of the season. Sensational.💥 @ebony_salmon 💥#MNUBRCpic.twitter.com/zCjDwwBZYe But she could help them secure something even more unlikely tomorrow: a place in a cup final. “She's on fire at the moment. It's great to have someone like Ebony in our team,” Bristol captain Jasmine Matthews said. “At the start of the year, maybe she wouldn't have finished those chances that she's getting, but now she doesn't miss. That's just vital for us as a team. “Maybe previously we only got one chance and that's when we really needed her. But now she's getting two or three chances. Like on the weekend, she had a few more chances. “She's working so hard in training and she does a lot of one-v-one with the coaches, so her hard work is definitely paying off and it's really good to see.” That greater ruthlessness in front of goal certainly shows in the statistics. Of players on the receiving end of three or more big chances in the WSL this season, no one has a better conversion rate than Salmon, who has scored five of her six.  “She's got all the attributes to become one of the best,” said Matt Beard, who is currently in temporary charge of Bristol while head coach Tanya Oxtoby is on maternity leave. “If I werethe England manager, I'd probably be looking at her now in the senior teambecause she's scoring goals in a team that has struggled this year, on a regular basis. “She’s more than just off the shoulder. She's strong, she's quick, she's good in tight spaces. What a player England have got for the future!"" Plenty of England’s most exciting young talent has been given its chance in their recent training camps, from Man Utd’s electric forward Lauren James to Birmingham goalkeeper Hannah Hampton. Salmon has already excelled at youth level, with 17 goals in 26 games across the Lionesses’ Under-17 and U19 teams, and if she keeps up this form in the top flight, it won’t be long until the 20-year-old is in the senior international picture. For now, her task is on helping Bristol stay in that top flight, though, with a prolific cup run not only boosting the confidence in the dressing room, but also giving them a flurry of games in which to maintain their new found momentum. Should Salmon and Bristol continue that form this week and secure an unprecedented place in March’s Continental Cup final, it’s a moment that might even top that goal in Manchester for the young striker.

The 26-year-old has split her time between the United States and Australia since 2013 -most recently lining up for NWSL side Chicago Red Stars and W-League club Perth Glory. Kerr, who was recently placed third in Goal's top 25female footballers, has enjoyed an outstanding 2019 and arrives at the Blues in red-hot form. The Matildas skipper was named the NWSL MVP for a second time this year as she set a record for most goals scored in the competition. At the Women's World Cup in France, meanwhile, Kerr struck four times in a group match against Jamaica and bagged five goals across an otherwise disappointing tournament for Australia. Kerr also recently bagged a double as the Matildas edged past Chile 2-1 on November 9 in Western Sydney and will now link up with Chelseawhen the mid-season transfer window opens. ""The WSL is the best league in Europe,"" Kerr said. ""I want team success and I don’t want it to come easy. ""I feel Chelsea have been building something special over the years and I want to be a part of that – I want to lift some trophies."" Chelsea are currently top of the Women's Super League after five matches of the new season and are yet to lose a game. Blues managerEmma Hayes is delighted to add Kerr to her already strong squad and believes the Australian's decision to signbodes well for the club. ""Sam has proved time and time again in the NWSL that she is a prolific goalscorer,"" Hayes said. ""She’s won the golden boot many times and she’s a player that can make things happen, but she’s also a fantastic team player. ""The fact she chose Chelsea when she could have gone to any club in the world is a testament to the players and the staff here because she saw this is the best place for her to grow and take the next step in her career. That’s a wonderful compliment to us all."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

452,https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-the-relegation-zone-to-a-cup-final-bristol-citys-remarkable-/17qznvmngkqse1h05y0worut24,From the relegation zone to a cup final: Bristol City’s remarkable turnaround,"When Matt Beard took over at Bristol City in January, they were bottom of the Women’s Super League, winless in their first 10 games of the season. They were only four points adrift of safety, but the team closest to them, Aston Villa, still had two games in hand over the Robins. Almost exactly two months later, Bristol are off the foot of the table and in a Continental Cup final. It’s a remarkable story that only gets even better the more you delve into it. Beard’s appointment was huge in itself. The 43-year-old is only a temporary hire, acting as maternity cover for Tanya Oxtoby, the Bristol head coach who is two weeks from her due date. It’s quite possibly the first instance of such a situation, but hopefully not the last. In November, Beard and West Ham had agreed to part ways after two years together. On Monday, Bristol beat Reading 3-2 to leapfrog the Hammers, pushing the manager’s former club into the WSL’s only relegation spot. A late winner from  @ebony_salmon  gives  @bristolcitywfc  a 𝗵𝘂𝗴𝗲 three points! 👊  #BarclaysFAWSL  highlights ⤵️ It means they go into Sunday’s final with three wins and one defeat from their last five games. It’s momentum they will need, for they are huge underdogs. Chelsea stand between the Robins and the club’s first-ever major trophy.  The Blues are the reigning WSL champions,  top of the league,  in the Champions League quarter-finals  and have beaten Bristol 9-0 and 5-0 this season. But cup finals can bringupsets. In the build-up to this one, Wigan’s triumph over Manchester City in the men’s FA Cup final in 2013 is referenced by both managers. “It's a cup final. We're not in it to make the numbers up and it's not a foregone conclusion by any stretch of the imagination,” Beard said this week. “We appreciate where they are, where we are, but anything can happen in a cup final.” Bristol are a team built on togetherness and collective spirit. They’re a team that rallies and knows how to stay in a game, Chelsea boss Emma Hayes crediting that trait to the work of Oxtoby. “[Matt’s] had the platform to build off. Tanya's put together a team that's learned how to stay in games. I think that was the strength of that side,” she said. “He’s added the counterattacking piece to their game and that's why they're fighting to stay in the league. I genuinely believe they will stay in the league.”  Their quality in transition is led by  Ebony Salmon, a lightning fast striker, only just 20 years old,  who earned her first senior England call-up in February. She has a clinical touch when she gets in front of goal, but also has the ability to create too. On Monday, she provided a sublime assist for another threat Hayes picked out in this Bristol team, Charlie Wellings. The Robins’ ‘never say die’ attitude, meanwhile, radiates from the captain, Jas Matthews. Since 2011, she has only spent one season away from this club and was part of the team that reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2015. She will be missing this weekend, but Bristol have as good a replacement as they could possibly find in Gemma Evans. The Wales defender was player of the match in Monday’s defeat of Reading, having been handed the armband in Matthews’ absence. “When Matt asked me to lead the team, I said:'only if Jas is okay with it', because she's a massive leader and to live into her shoes is quite a big task,” Evans said this week. “She approved. I think it's something that I can do and I will do for her.” Among the many motivations Bristol have this weekend – a first major trophy, a big upset, further momentum for their fight to stay up and winning it for their injured captain – another is the return of Oxtoby. The Australian coach may be due to give birth later this month, but she will be in the stands at Vicarage Road on Sunday, seeing the players for the first time since she took her maternity leave in January. Her presence could certainly help inspire something special. “It'll be a great boost for everyone because she deserves to be there,” Beard said. “She's done most of the work for the team getting there.” Beard will take little credit for this cup run. After all, he arrived when the club were already in the semi-finals. But if they do complete a remarkable upset on Sunday, he will deserve plenty of praise for what he has done in the last two months. As will the players, and as will Oxtoby for laying the foundations for a truly incredible story. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

453,https://www.goal.com/en/news/danish-star-harder-joins-wsl-champions-chelsea-from/1ftdngv5f8na71mrfslz2pt4o4,Harder joins WSL champions Chelsea from Wolfsburg for 'record fee',"Pernille Harder has joined Women's Super League champions Chelseafrom Wolfsburg for what the German club have called ""a record transfer fee for the women’s game"". The 27-year-old leaves Germany after almost four years, during which she won four Bundesliga titles and four German cups while scoring 103 goals in 112games. She played her final game for the club on Sunday in the Women's Champions League final, but was unable to secure a dream goodbye in the form of a European treble, with Lyon winning their fifth successive title in the competition. After being one of the hottest properties in Europe when she signed from Swedish club Linkopings in 2017, Harder has taken her game to another level with Wolfsburg. She ranked at No.5 in last year's Goal 50 andarrives at Chelsea as one of, if not the best player in the world right now. ""I’m extremely happy and extremely excited to get started, to finally be here and be a Chelsea player. I couldn’t be more happy,"" she said. ""I’m excited to just play for such a big club, to play with so many amazing players and to also be playing in the league. The English league, it’s so exciting at the moment and I’m really looking forward to it."" Harder joins a squad that already contains the likes of Sam Kerr, Bethany England, Ji So-yun and Guro Reiten - Goal's 2019-20 WSL Player of the Season. It is a deal that further underlines the club's desireto secure a European title that has not only eluded the Blues over the years, but Harder herself too, with Sunday's defeat in the final her second in three years. ""Pernille is one of the best players in the world,"" Emma Hayes, head coach at Chelsea, added. ""Her record at Wolfsburg and Linkopings, as well as internationally with Denmark, shows how valuable she has been to her teams. Very excited to join @Chelseafcw. Can’t wait to step onto the pitch wearing this shirt 💙 pic.twitter.com/iMUl5ZaPY6 ""She is a fantastic team player who wants to take her game to the next level. She chose Chelsea as the club that can push her to that level. She can play for any team in the world, but she chose us. ""She chose the players, the staff, the environment, the playing style. You can’t get a bigger compliment than that from one of the best players in the world."" Rumours of this deal have been around for some time, with Harder's partner, Magdalena Eriksson, currently the captain of Chelsea. The pair played together at Linkopings and when asked about her future earlier this year, Harder admitted that the plan was for them to play together again, albeit when her contract expired in 2021. ""It is clear that we miss each other in everyday life, so the plan is that we, at least when my contract expires, will play together again,"" the Denmark captain told Fotbollskanalenin March. ""We talk a lot about this, about our future, and we think the same,"" Eriksson added.""We feel dangerous that our contracts expire at the same time and we want to try to find a solution that is good for both of us, which above all means that we get closer to each other. ""It will have more priority than it has had in our other decisions that we have made before."" Because Chelsea have chosen to secure Harder's signature this summer instead,Sportsbuzzerreported last week that the Blues would have to pay€350,000 for the forward- a record fee for a Bundesliga player. Wolfsburg confirmed that the fee is a record for the women's game, withsporting director Ralf Kellerman saying:“Taking into account the fact that we are dealing with a record transfer fee for the women’s game – without going into the precise nature of the sum involved – and that Pernille was only going to be with us for another 10 months and had just played in the UWCL finals tournament for us, we decided that this was a fair solution for all involved. “We would like to thank Pernille for the incredibly successful stage in her career and the wonderful performances that she enjoyed in a VfL Wolfsburg jersey, and wish her every success in the new challenge that she is taking on in England."" Talks between Eriksson and Chelsea over a new deal are now expected to accelerate too, with less than 12 months left on the Swede's current contract.

PSG's place in the last eight is not yet confirmed, but they are 5-0 up from the first leg of their last-16 tie against Sparta Praha and in a comfortable position to make it through to the next round. The winner of that potentially all-French tie will then take on either Man City or Barcelona in the semi-finals. In the other half of the draw, Chelsea play Wolfsburg in a tie that will see Pernille Harder, last year's Goal 50 winner and the most expensive women's footballer of all time, face her former club. The final quarter-final pits Swedish side Rosengard against Bayern Munich, who currently top the Frauen-Bundesliga table. Both are looking to reach the semi-finals for just the second time. The first legs of the quarter-finals will be played on March 23 and 24, with the second legs to follow a week later, acrossMarch 31 and April 1. The one outstanding last-16 game, the second leg of PSG's clash with Sparta, will be played on March 17. The semi-finals will then take place on April 24 and 25, and May 1 and 2,before the final is played in Gothenburg on May 16. Winners of the Champions League title for the last five years, Lyon are the favourites to go all the way once again this year, despite someclose matches with Juventus and Brondby in the previous two rounds. As for the main challengers, PSG have beaten their biggest rivals already this season and are giving the French champions one of the toughest title races of recent years this season. Barcelona, meanwhile, are flying at the top of the Primera Division in Spain and are looking very strong this year, while both Man City and Chelsea have built squads capable of competing for the biggest trophy in Europe. Last year's runners-up, Wolfsburgare having a difficult year. After Harder's departure in the summer, they have suffered many key injuries and could concede their league title to Bayern Munich for the first time since 2016.

455,https://www.goal.com/en/news/free-scoring-chelsea-biggest-task-overturn-bayern-deficit/1pthsm9nfdbn71dr27wiw1rjem,Free-scoring Chelsea facing biggest task yet in bid to overturn Bayern deficit,"“You can’t stop players like Sam Kerr, Pernille Harder, or Fran Kirby, Guro Reiten as well, Erin Cuthbert, who didn’t play today,” said Jens Scheuer, with a chuckle. Bayern Munich’s head coach was aware he had already listed plenty of Chelsea’s attacking weapons, and he laughed with a realisation of how many he had still yet to mention. Yet, on Sunday, in a 2-1 win, his team did as good a job of silencing the Blues' forward line as anyone has in any competition for a long time. Given Bayern had conceded seven goals in their three games before the first leg of thisWomen’s Champions League semi-final clash, it was an impressive, and timely, recovery. Scheuer switched to a back five and his players, defending from the front, executed the game plan to perfection. The goal the Blues did score was a freak one too. Bayern defender Marina Hegering headed the ball against an unknowing Melanie Leupolz and Chelsea had an away goal. It was the only negative for the German side going into the second leg. To highlight how impressive Bayern were, this is a Chelsea team averaging over three goals a game in the Women’s Super League that had scored 16 in their six Champions League games before the weekend. In fact, the last time they failed to score in a game was in April 2019. They’ve now scored in each of their last 77 competitive games. That run was so close to ending on Sunday. “They changed their shape,” noted Chelsea’s manager Emma Hayes afterwards. “When teams do that, it presents different challenges.”  Breaking down defences issomething Chelsea are certainly used to in the WSL – it issomething they are used to overcoming, too. This is a side that has so many ways to attack. That iswhy they so often break through even the most resolute of defences. They have the ability to carve through the middle of teams with the magic of a midfielder like Ji So-yun, widely regarded as the greatest foreign player in WSL history. They can go out wide and put a ball in the box, with the aerial ability of Kerr and of Beth England devastating in open play, while centre-backs Magdalena Eriksson and Millie Bright are threats from dead ball situations. With the pace of Kerr and Kirby, they are dangerouswith a simple ball over the top too, while those such as Sophie Ingle, Harder, Ji, and so many more are able to find the back of the net from range all the same. There is always an inevitability of them scoring, though it was tested to the maximum at the weekend. But for Ji hitting the bar from range and Harder somehow not converting from close range, Bayern kept them very quiet. Problems at the back did contribute to the defeat too, but with regular right-back Maren Mjelde and their captain Eriksson missing, that isno huge shock – and anyway, that was the case on Wednesday in a huge game in the title race against Manchester City, but they still scored the goals and created the chances to get them apoint. “My team is extremely resilient and there's a mentality within the dressing room that, regardless of if we're not playing very well, someone's going to bail us out. You cannot underestimate how valuable that is,” Hayes said after that 2-2 draw.   After Kirby, likely to be the undisputed player of the season, produced a poor pass that led to Man City’s equaliser, goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger pulled out a world-class save to stop Chelsea losing that game. On Sunday, it was Berger’s error that gave Bayern the lead, as she completely misjudged a cross and Sydney Lohmann was there to punish her mistake. Hayes described both goals conceded by herside as “really poor” defensively, noting that the team had prepared for the crosses and expressing her disappointment at how the second, scored by Hanna Glas, had come from a throw-in. While Chelsea probably do not need ""bailing out""in the second leg given the scoreline, they do need players to come up big tosend them through to that final stage. Scheuer was clear that Bayern want to create opportunities and attack in the second leg, but thatwill likely be in an even morecounter-attacking manner than the dangerous one on show on Sunday. “They will play exactly the same way,” Hayes said. “We have to solve it, but I've got a week in training and that's my job to try and do that.” It israre that the Chelsea boss is beaten in the tactical battle, particularly when it comes down to her attack versus the opposition’s defence. With a Champions League final at stake, there hasnever been a bigger moment to come out on top. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

457,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ianis-stoica-arsenal-linked-wonderkid-romanian-mbappe/blt6e414092961643c2,Ianis Stoica: Is Arsenal-linked wonderkid truly 'the Romanian Mbappe'?,"“I currently have €7.5 million (£6.4m/$8.5m) for Ianis Stoica,” claimed controversial FCSB owner Gigi Becali in late November when discussing bids for the club’s highly-coveted teenage forward. “But I want €10m, plus 20 per cent (from a future transfer),” he concluded, before revealing that the offer for Stoica had, in fact, been made by Arsenal. Soon video compilations and online articles were proclaiming Stoica as being ‘the Romanian Mbappe’, with Gunners fans working themselves into a frenzy over their apparent interest in a potential new young star. It is important at such a time, however, to take a step back. The reason behind Stoica’s nickname is largely down to him stating in a previous interview that he admires Mbappe as a player, and hopes to replicate some of what the France international can produce within his own game. In terms of Arsenal’s apparent interest, there has been nothing out of the Emirates Stadium that would suggest they are keen on the 19-year-old, and given Becali’s somewhat bombastic history, there is a chance that he is just looking to drive up the price for any actual interested parties. With all that said, it is not like Stoica has not deserved to have more and more fans from outside Romania take notice of him so far this season. 🇷🇴 Ianis Stoica (Attaquant, 2002, FCSB)🇷🇴La révélation inattendue de ce début de saison.Un buteur avec des qualités d'ailier, ultra mature sur et en dehors du terrain, et un physique solide à seulement 18 ans. 📈9 apparitions/ 5 buts (1 but/66 min) pic.twitter.com/eQN6BdizbF In his first full season as part of the FCSB senior squad, he has six goals to his name in all competitions, and is averaging a goal or an assist every 72 minutes that he is on the pitch. Becali has previously spoken of Stoica as being a “phenomenal prospect”, and the signs are positive that he could yet make good on the promise he showed on his headline-grabbing first-team debut some four years ago. Aged just 14 years and 322 days, Stoica both played and scored in the Romanian Cup against Sanatatea Cluj, becoming the youngest player in FCSB history in the process. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: It is likely, though, that such a debut was prearranged by Becali when he lured Stoica to his club from Freiburg, where he had a rather short spell in 2016. According to the player himself, he even impressed Bayern Munich scouts while in Germany, who in turn offered him a trial. ""I chose Steaua ahead of Bayern, because I have a better chance here,"" he said in 2018. When asked about the reasons in retrospect, the player's father, Pompiliu Stoica, claimed: ""I didn’t like the conditions at Freiburg, so we went back to Bucharest."". Given the fact that Freiburg have magnificent facilities and invest hugely in youth coaching, that is a fairly odd statement, to put it mildly. 14yo Ianis Stoica played again for FCSB last night in the Cup. A fan asked for his shirt after the game. Stoica: ""Sorry, I can't. Only the older players are allowed to give away shirts!"" Brilliant. pic.twitter.com/pwuhEdzESe Stoica Sr. was a decent player himself. Having started his career as a striker, he eventually settled as a left-back, winning two league titles in Romania with Steaua, while representing the national team on eight occasions. He also spent time playing in Russia and Cyprus, but his ties to Steaua and Becali are strong, and that is likely to have been the major motivation behind his son’s move back to his homeland. As for Ianis' hopes of progressing much faster in Romania than in Germany, they were not really realistic. After his debut, he made three further substitute appearances in the cup, only to then take in four separate loan spells before forcing himself back into contention this season. He first joined Dunarea Calarasi at the beginning of 2019, for whom he made his top-flight debut, though that proved to be only one of only two appearances for the club. Stoica was then sent to second-division side Petrolul 52, but his father was not satisfied with him making just eight appearances, and brought him back to the capital midway through the 2019-20 season. His third spell, at another second-tier side, Metaloglobus, was also cut short, this time because of the Covid-19 restrictions at the beginning of 2020. 🇷🇴 | Ianis Stoica (2002), retour du super-sub, décisif dans ce dernier quart d'heure qui permet au FCSB de ne pas laisser CFR s'échapper.

(4⚽️, 1🅰️, 900 min)pic.twitter.com/Q5M8vvuRrV https://t.co/WJPOZkdvQ0 Finally, last season, Stoica joined minnows Slatina, who were reportedly chosen due to their ties to Romania Under-19s coach Dan Oprescu. Stoica scored seven goals there, including four in six games during the end-of-season play-off rounds, though that was not enough to save Slatina from relegation to the third division. His form, though, did allow him the chance to prove himself in the senior FCSB squad, and it is a chance he has grasped with both hands, despite only having started four matches thus far. As well as his goals at club level, he also netted on his Romania U21s debut against Georgia in September, with his best attributes ensuring he catches the eye more often than not when on the field. Stoica is quick, loves to dribble and improvise, and feels comfortable on both flanks. Mostly used on the right, he would arguably be more dangerous on the left, cutting inside to use his stronger right foot and show off how capable he is when shooting from distance. FCSB coach Toni Petrea remarked: ""Ianis is a valuable player, but he has a lot of work to do. First he needs to play here and improve gradually, and then we would be able to talk about taking the next step to a bigger club."" Whether that bigger club proves to be Arsenal remains to be seen, but while talk of Stoica joining one of Europe’s elite or replicating the heroics of Mbappe might be premature, there is certainly talent there. It must be hoped that the building hype around him, however, does not overshadow the developments he still has to make.

458,https://www.goal.com/en/news/zalan-vancsa-hungarian-wonderkid-premier-league-interest/bltbbf47373c77387c6,Zalan Vancsa: Hungarian wonderkid earning Premier League interest,"A few months ago, for the first time in two years, David Manasseh boarded a flight heading abroad. The super-agent, who has negotiated some of the world’s biggest deals, including Gareth Bale’s transfer to Real Madrid, had an unusual destination. He was flying to Hungary to meet a boy named Zalan Vancsa. Manasseh’s company, ICM Stellar Sport, represents some of the world’s elite players, from Jack Grealish to top teenage talents Jeremy Doku and Eduardo Camavinga. They had been tracking Vancsa for a year, and Manasseh was keen to make the 17-year-old his first ever Hungarian client. It did not take long, either, before the two of them put pen to paper on an agreement which caps off what has been an outstanding breakthrough year for the teenage winger. From Vancsa’s exploits in Hungary’s top flight with MTK Budapest, to his impressive five goals and two assists in four UEFA Youth League games, he has established himself as one of the best talents to have emerged from Hungary in the 21st century. His ascent has surprised even the most ardent footballs enthusiasts in the country. But the truth is, Vancsa’s destiny had been preordained even before he was born. Football is in Vancsa’s blood. His father, Miklos, played close to 300 games in Hungary’s top flight, representing the likes of MTK Budapest and Videoton. It was only natural for Zalan to take up the sport himself. “I remember, he couldn’t walk, he was leaning on the sofa, but he was already kicking the ball,” Miklos Vancsa tells GOAL. “By the time he started walking, football was a central part of his life.” Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Zalan’s brother, Milan, agrees. “He played football every day after school, running around changing his football shirts and pretending to score – he was completely in love with the game.” Zalan joined his father’s former club, MTK Budapest, at a young age. At youth level, he stood out straight away, and by the time he was 15, Vancsa was training regularly with the club’s first team and tearing Hungary’s Under-19s league to shreds. “I saw him playing in U19s for the first time.” Michael Boris, who made Vancsa the second-youngest player in MTK’s history aged just 16 years and 180 days in April 2021, recalls to GOAL. “Wow! He was very quick and had excellent technique. I liked that he was very skilful, but he didn’t just keep the ball, he could finish the action with a key pass or a shot.” In the summer, Boris was dismissed from his position as MTK manager, but his successor, Giovanni Costantino, shared his admiration for Vancsa. “I think he has something extra, something that is special. He has potential, he needs to work for sure, but he has all the skills to be a top player,” Costantino tells GOAL. Under Costantino, Vancsa caught the eye during pre-season, even captaining the senior side, and his performances were enough to warrant giving him a regular place in the club’s first-team squad. Vancsa’s first competitive appearance for his new head-coach would become a memorable one, as Costantino subbed the youngster on against Ujpest in August with 20 minutes to go and MTK trailing by a goal. “I said to him be ready because you will come in and decide the match,” Costantino chuckles. Little did he know, his words would become prophetic. MTK forward, Bojan Miovski, pulled one back to level the game two minutes after Vancsa was introduced, and by the 90th minute, it seemed like the match was heading into a stalemate. Both teams had become idle and the pace of the game had slowed. Still full of an abundance of energy, Vancsa, however, had not given up on Costantino’s demand. He chased down a hopeful ball by Miovski and intercepted a hasty clearance. The ball fell fortuitously in his path and Vancsa broke through clear on goal, slotting the ball into the back of the net with a deft finish to decide the game in MTK’s favour. W barwach MTK Budapest zadebiutował zawodnik z rocznika 2004 i przywitał się z seniorską piłką zdobyciem zwycięskiej bramki w doliczonym czasie gry - Zalan Vancsa 👏 pic.twitter.com/rBzYJJlzUK The goal made him the youngest player in the club’s history to score a top-flight goal in 100 years, and the sixth-youngest to score in Hungary's top division, with Vancsa only a month older than Ferenc Puskas was when he found the net for the first time at that level. “The whole 2021 year that Zalan has produced has been incredible,” Miklos Vancsa says. “Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and I pinch myself and wonder if this is really happening to us.” Having become the centre of attention in the country at such a young age, some would struggle with the intense scrutiny, but Vancsa has thrived under the additional pressure. Aside from averaging 0.44 goals per 90 for MTK’s first team this season, Vancsa – who is right-footed but plays predominantly off the left – has also caught the eye in the UEFA Youth League. With MTK in the 'Domestic Champions' path of the competition, Vancsa recorded seven goal contributions in just 350 minutes against Sparta Prague and Genk, before the Belgian outfit knocked the Hungarians out in the second round. The only things missing from the jigsaw is recognition on the international stage. Vancsa netted a brace and registered an assist against Serbia for Hungary’s U17 side earlier this year, but despite his regular minutes in Hungary’s top flight, he has not yet been called upon at U19 or U21 level. That is a move that has not only surprised his father, but leading Premier League scouts too. “A scout [from a recent Premier League champion] went to Hungary’s U19 match against Italy in November, expecting to see Zalan. When he saw he wasn’t in the squad, he was very surprised,” Miklos Vancsa says. “He couldn’t believe the coaches had ignored him.” With interest not just from the Premier League, but from top Champions League clubs all around Europe, Vancsa likely will not be ignored forever. “I know he can jump over a lot of hurdles,” Vancsa’s father concludes. “He knows he has to fight for his career. There will be no red carpets. He is a fighter and ready for that challenge.” “He’s a worker, he never complains, he gives everything. I believe he has the mentality to make the next step in his career,” Costantino agrees. With interest intensifying for Vancsa’s services, the next challenge will be to find the right club to aid his metamorphosis as a footballer. A challenge ICM Stellar and David Manasseh are well equipped to handle. For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram and TikTok.

459,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabio-carvalho-fulham-wonderkid-europe-elite-alert/blt917ee018956186b4,Fabio Carvalho: Fulham wonderkid who has Europe's elite on alert,"During the second half of Fulham’s visit to Stamford Bridge in May 2021, in which Scott Parker’s side - one game away from relegation - were trailing 2-0 to Chelsea, there was an expectation among viewers that a young, academy-produced attacking midfielder would be introduced from the bench. When the substitutes’ board was raised in the 78th minute, however, it was not the number 55 of Chelsea’s Faustino Anjorin - a high-profile talent who had been pushing for first-team minutes - that was displayed as expected. Instead, it was the number 48 of Fulham’s lesser-known 18-year-old Fabio Carvalho, coming on to make his league debut. After the Cottagers’ relegation was confirmed the following week with a 2-0 loss to Burnley, Parker showed his belief in Carvalho’s ability and potential by starting him in the last three games of the season. A well-taken first senior goal against Southampton and a tireless display against Newcastle on the final day certainly vindicated that faith, which then posed an important question: would Carvalho be trusted to start week-in, week-out in the Championship the following campaign? That question was answered with an emphatic yes by new manager Marco Silva. Before sustaining a foot injury that would keep him out for nine weeks, Carvalho recorded three goals and one assist in the first five games of the 2021-22 season, all of which he started. He then found the net once more on his return to the starting XI against Barnsley in November. Silva’s 4-2-3-1 formation is, to an extent, built around Carvalho, the now-19-year-old given the freedom to play as a roaming No.10. This gives him the ability to go where he pleases - as is typical for the position, his presence between the lines is particularly valuable to promotion-chasing Fulham - but the youngster is highly intelligent and takes up different positions throughout games, from smartly occupying the last line to dropping deep to aid the first phase of build-up play. An England youth international up to Under-18s level, Carvalho was born in Lisbon and spent time in the Benfica academy between the ages of 8-11 before his family moved to London. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: He joined Fulham’s academy in 2014 and signed his first professional contract in May 2020, but had been making waves in west London far before that, having broken into Fulham’s U18s squad at the age of 15. After spending three years flitting between that level and the U23s, Carvalho's final campaign at youth level in Premier League 2 was particularly dominant as he returned 19 direct goal contributions in just 13 appearances - providing a goal or assist every 60 minutes before earning his first-team chance at the end of the season. Pick. That. Out! 😳 Fabio Carvalho's stunning strike inspired #FFCU18s to a win over @LCFC. 📽️: https://t.co/FIJ6yIVlvJ pic.twitter.com/CKO96xIKTz Off the field, Carvalho is said to be a very determined personality, described as “dedicated to self-improvement” by Fulham’s academy director, Huw Jennings. “In the next few years, [he wants] to be competing for the Ballon d’Or. You have to aim high,” Jennings added. August’s EFL Young Player of the Month award may be some way off from those lofty ambitions, but Carvalho's ability on the pitch means that he is heading in the right direction. As dangerous a goalscorer as he is a creator, the teenager's confidence and composure on the ball instantly stands out. The question of how to progress the ball forwards is always at the forefront of his thoughts, but this desire to constantly add progressive value does not hamper his ball retention; especially considering his tender age, his decision-making is excellently measured and he does not force the issue when on the ball. He frequently drops deep to pick up the ball to feet during build-up play, and possesses a valuable on-ball gravity in these situations - his relaxed demeanour attracts defenders towards him even when not in a dangerous position, and he effortlessly evades pressure through intelligent passing combinations or nifty dribbling. It is not just his ability in deeper areas that stands out, though: the combination of his high-level agility and excellent close control, along with a strong technical foundation, makes for a menacing final-third presence. Carvalho has also displayed a Frank Lampard-esque aptitude for runs from midfield that lead to late arrivals in the box, allowing him to get himself into good goalscoring positions. It is clear from just his 17 first-team appearances that Carvalho’s prospects greatly exceed what he can achieve at Fulham. He seems to already be aware of this, too, as illustrated by his apparent reluctance to sign a new contract as his current deal enters its final few months. This has prompted rumours linking him with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool and Chelsea, but there is more to this situation than meets the eye. Carvalho’s existing agreement with agency Unique Sports Management is set to expire in January, and he is said to not even be willing to consider signing an extension with Fulham until his new management team is fully arranged and in place. He is reportedly being pursued by super-agent Jorge Mendes, who is said to want to move him to Liverpool, and as to be expected, Fulham boss Silva is “not happy with the situation”. “I really hope [those advising Carvalho] are taking care of [him], not just for the moment, not just to do a big contract, but about the boy of Fabio Carvalho,” the ex-Everton boss said when asked about potentially losing the club’s top young talent. There is much to consider when giving thought to what Carvalho would be best advised to do in this situation. There is a large part of the current season remaining, and how he does both in terms of minutes and performances is likely to dictate the options that will be available to him come the summer. There will, however, at least be one baseline decision for him to make: whether to leave or stay at Fulham. If Silva’s side earn promotion back to the Premier League - which looks likely given how they have played so far this season - then staying would in itself represent a step up in quality of opposition for Carvalho, and there is even an argument to be made that a second season in the Championship could be beneficial if the Cottagers were to remain in the division. However, what Carvalho may most desire - and understandably so - is an increase in the quality of his team-mates, so that he can attempt to raise his level in order to match them. For this, he would have to move clubs, and it is unlikely that he will be short of options. But he will have to consider his choice of club very carefully: for example, Liverpool are unlikely to be the best fit given that work out of possession is the area of Carvalho’s game that has the most room for improvement. What is in no doubt, however, is how much potential he has to grow. Those who watched him make his Premier League debut at Stamford Bridge back in May may well have seen the emergence of a future star.

460,https://www.goal.com/en/news/unstoppable-barcelona-juventus-growth-five-things-women-s/blt6207fb99094ff10c,From an unstoppable Barcelona to Juventus' growth: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The penultimate round of this season’s Women’s Champions League group stage fixtures provided plenty to talk about, as the last eight really started to take shape. Juventus’ trip to Chelsea was the most intriguing of the week’s games, setting up a thrilling finale in Group A, which also contains two-time winners Wolfsburg. Meanwhile, the Emirates Stadium hosted UWCL football for the first time as Arsenal welcomed reigning champions Barcelona. Here are five things that we learned... “We were just happy to be in the group stages,” Juventus head coach Joe Montemurro said after his side’s draw at Chelsea on Wednesday. The result saw Juve become the first team to stop the Blues from scoring at Kingsmeadow this season – and they could’ve nicked the win, too. ""I've had experience at this ground. You don't come here and win easily or get a point easily, so for a club that's four years old, in its first real foray into Champions League, to get something, it's quite special."" The performance that Juve put on was typical of an Italian side away in Europe. It was excellent. Midfielder Martina Rosucci described the game plan as “perfect”. To see such a performance from a Montemurro side, who usually play so expansively, was another nod to his growth as a coach in Italy. With the game there growing at the same rate, the Bianconere are making incredibly encouraging strides as they go into the final game with qualification in their own hands. This ambitious Real Madrid side have not had a great first half of the season. They are ninth in their league standings, sacked head coach David Aznar and have been fortunate not to be in a more testing group. However, this week, Kosovare Asllani returned after over two months out and showed that she can help ignite the team. At her best when playing close to a No.9, she shone in her role next to Esther Gonzalez on Wednesday, scoring two goals, winning a penalty and creating three chances in Real Madrid’s 3-0 win over Breidablik. Her return is huge for this team. When Erin Cuthbert joined Chelsea five years ago, she arrived as a raw attacking talent, an 18-year-old who had just finished as Glasgow City’s top goalscorer as they continued their dominance in Scotland. On Wednesday night, she shone against Juventus, but as a full-back. With the Blues lacking depth in that area, she’s played regularly as a wing-back this season in a role that suits so many of her great traits: her grittiness, her work-rate, her intelligence but also her attacking qualities too. It was just another brilliant display in a season which has seen her keep quiet some of the game’s most electric wingers, while also being an attacking threat herself. Earlier this week, after Chelsea’s FA Cup win over Arsenal, manager Emma Hayes simply said: “People like Erin Cuthbert are some of the reasons why we are what we are – and she deserves all the credit.” It’s hard to disagree. In his pre-match press conference, Arsenal head coach Jonas Eidevall was asked what he admired about Barcelona. As he rattled through their qualities, his answer was three minutes long. That was a clear indication of how good the reigning European champions are. On Thursday, they were without Patri Guijarro, who tested positive for Covid-19 just before the game. To be without your holding midfielder is a big deal for most. However, Barca simply dropped Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas back from her advanced midfield role and let her control the game instead. They won 4-0. Arsenal tried a different game plan from their 4-1 defeat in Spain, Eidevall having learned from that. But, in reality, stopping this team – even without Guijarro and star centre-back Mapi Leon – remains the toughest task in the women's game right now. Should they not win the Champions League again this season, it would be a huge shock. A CHRISTMAS CRACKER OF A GOAL 💥Gift wrapped by Rolfö 🎁🎙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👉https://t.co/3Pq4d3s3LC🎙🇪🇸👉https://t.co/pXmk8Fxci4 pic.twitter.com/tsHnKDkB22 Going into the penultimate round of UWCL fixtures, there was only really one group where the drama intensified – that which includes Chelsea, Wolfsburg and Juventus and sees them all going into the last game with a chance to qualify. Every other group had two teams more comfortably positioned than the others. Going into the final games, it's only the aforementioned group that doesn't have its two progressing teams confirmed, and Group C, where a truly incredible turn of events in Arsenal's clash with Hoffenheim would see the Germans advance instead. The group stages have been entertaining, but it will take time for other teams in Europe to catch up to those elite sides to create more drama. This new format, giving less experienced teams games against the giants, will certainly help. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

461,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fridolina-rolfo-barcelona-swede-war-injuries-star-olympics/7iljo3v3wsyl1pz35518dwt9l,Fridolina Rolfo: The Barcelona-bound Swede who battled a ‘war’ of injuries to be the star of the Olympics,"At Yokohama Stadium on Friday, football showed its ability to be incredibly beautiful and incredibly cruel, all at the same time. After Canada and Sweden could not be separated after 120 minutes of football, the final of the Olympic Games' women's football tournament went to a penalty shootout. After 12 spot-kicks, despite them being huge underdogs before kick-off,the big prize was Canada's. While Christine Sinclair, the greatest international goalscorer of all time, picked up a gold medal at the age of 38, there were fairy tales among the opposition that did not have the same happy ending. Be it Hedvig Lindahl enduring “such a bad ending”, as she confirmed she will notplay at another major tournament, or Caroline Seger, the iconic 36-year-old midfielder, blazing her penalty over the bar when it could have won gold instead. Among those distraught on that pitch after the final penalty of the shootout had been scoredwas Fridolina Rolfo. Her story may not be over, or quite as heart-breaking as some of her team-mates, but the absolute star of the Games was inconsolable all the same. It isalways sad to see a player who has shone brighter than any other notend the tournament as a winner. But if anyone knows how to bounce back from such disappointment, it isRolfo. A post shared by Fridolina Rolfö (@fridolinarolfo) After all, this a player who has seen her career plagued by injuries, so much so that she has described her battle to recover from them all as a “war”. Be it the fractured metatarsal that cut her 2016 Olympics short, or the many fitness issuesthat meant she started just 10 league games in what proved to be her final season at Wolfsburg in 2020-21, Rolfo has hardly had the best of luck in recent years. Because of that limited game time, the 27-year-old did notcome into this tournament at the top of everyone’s ‘players to watch’ lists. But there has never been any doubt around Rolfo'sability when she is fully fit, which is exactly why the newly-crowned European champions Barcelona have snapped her up this summer. They will be glad they did so before the Olympics got under way, because they would have certainly had more competition for her signature off the back of her performances in Japan. The winger’s two-goal showing against Australia in the second game announced her to the tournament, a sweeping right-footed finish in the box showing off her goalscoring instincts before a left-footed rocket in the second half demonstrated her class. In the quarter-final match-up against Japan, she contributed in a different way. A well-flighted cross set up the first goal, headed home by Magdalena Eriksson, and a sensational reverse pass played in Stina Blackstenius for the second. In the semi-finals, an acrobatic, improvised finish securedher country's place in the final with a 1-0 win over Australia. “I feel happy with the work I’ve put into this tournament,” she said after thatgame. Only Blackstenius, with five goals and one assist, was involved in more goals for Sweden this summer. But it has not just been the goals and the assists. It has been Rolfo’s general play that has made her stand-out in an attack where every player complements each otherso well. Her vision and ability to find the right pass have been superb, qualities that no doubt attracted a team with the ideology of Barcelona. Meanwhile, her quick feet, skilful touch and confidence to run at full-backs is everything that the Catalans ask from their wingers. There is no doubt that her style fits the club to a tee.  Before she can look ahead to that next chapter, there is the task of coming to terms with another heartbreak though.""It just hurts,"" were Rolfo's simple, poignant words after collecting her silver medal. But unlike some of her team-mates, Rolfo still has plenty of time to get her crowning moment in her country’s colours. Her world-class ability will be massive for Sweden going forward as they look to continue thedevelopment they have shown since the 2016 Games. If they continue this ascendancy, there isno reason why that moment cannotcome next summer at the European Championship,or at the World Cup in 2023, as the team look to improve on a third-placed finish in 2019. But those are botha long way away yet. Next upis that flight to Barcelona and taking to the field with the European champions, combining with some of the best players in the world. After her performances this summer, there will be plenty as excited as she is for that journey to begin. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

462,https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-putellas-greatness-to-bayern-munich-s-tactics-five/bltc4349567da2cdc29,From Putellas' greatness to Bayern Munich's tactics: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The Women's Champions League returned with a bang this week, with some of the most highly-anticipated clashes of the group stages taking place. After giving Chelsea a serious test in the last round, Juventus played out a thrilling 2-2 draw with two-time winners Wolfsburg, while Lyon, another former champion, hosted Bayern Munich. As ever, there was plenty to take note of across the eight games. Here are five things we learned... Jessie Fleming played more minutes at the Olympic Games in the summer, helping Canada win gold, than she did in her first season with Chelsea. Blues boss Emma Hayes is always eager to give new signings time to settle in and, fresh out of college, Fleming was slowly integrated throughout the last campaign. She's still not a guaranteed starter, but her involvement has stepped up with the London club this season and her quality is shining through as a result. A goal and an assist against Servette on Tuesday followed her winning strike against Aston Villa on Sunday, taking her up to three goals and three assists already, despite her making only four starts so far. It's awards season. GOAL50 voting is well under way, to be decided by the fans for the first time, while accolades like the Ballon d'Or will be dished out very soon. Quite simply, those individual prizes should not be going to anyone but Alexia Putellas. The Barcelona star has been so far ahead of everyone else for the past 12 months that she is on another planet. Two goals on Wednesday against Hoffenheim – including a rocket of a free-kick – took the midfielder up to 35 goals in 52 appearances this calendar year. She also set up Marta Torrejon for Barca's fourth of the night to take her assists tally to 26. Nobody can compete with those numbers. Alexia Putellas in 2021:🔹 52 games🔹 35 goals🔹 26 assistsBallon d'Or loading... ⏳ pic.twitter.com/XgmlkgdY57 Sweden was once at the very forefront of women's football in Europe. Its clubs were champions on the continent and its league could boast players like Marta. Things have changed dramatically in recent years, though, as investment increases in countries traditionally more successful on the men's side. Swedish champions Rosengard didn't reach the group stages of the Champions League this year, while second-placed only Hacken got their first points on Wednesday, against a Benfica side that is just four years old. It was a positive result and performance, but played amid a backdrop of some of the team's best players preparing to move on. Swedish players are in demand across the world and its national team will continue to thrive, but it will be interesting to see how clubs respond to the challenges they are beginning to face. There have been criticisms in the past that Arsenal depend too much on Vivianne Miedema, their serial goalscorer and record-breaker. This season, though, new head coach Jonas Eidevall has began to squash that myth. Miedema has played a full 90 minutes on very few occasions, so the goalscoring burden has been shared around a lot more and Miedema even spent the past two weeks resting after a busy summer at the Olympics. She returned to the line-up on Wednesday night, but was not involved in any of Arsenal's five goals against Koege. That is not a bad thing for her. The 25-year-old is still one of the best players in the world and playing well for her club. It is healthy to see the responsibilities to score and create being divided up among her team-mates. With Miedema out-of-contract in the summer, and no news of a new deal yet, it's not a bad thing for the team either, given the possibility of them soon losing their best player. Going into Wednesday's clash with seven-time European champions Lyon, Bayern Munich fielded a star-studded XI with plenty of great options on the bench. But their game-plan did not suggest as much. This is a team that was crowned German champion last season, reached the Women's Champions League semi-finals and has every reason to believe they can go toe-to-toe with Europe's elite. Lyon have defensive injuries that have made them vulnerable, too. However, Bayern played on the counter a lot more than expected and succumbed to a 2-1 defeat in France. As well as their obvious qualities, perhaps Lyon's unbeatable aura still has an impact on the mentality of opponents, despite their trophyless campaign last term.

463,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-bid-best-womens-team-germany-europe/blt06fda8e514288a77,Behind Bayern Munich’s bid to be the best women’s team in Germany - and Europe,"For the casual football fan, to learn that Germany has had more Women’s Champions League winners than any other country, but that Bayern Munich are not among them, may be a surprise. Bayern are the most successful club in the country on the men's side by a huge margin - winning 80 major honours, with Borussia Dortmund in second place with 22 trophies. On the women’s side, though, Frankfurt, Duisburg, Turbine Potsdam and Wolfsburg have all been champions of Europe - three of them before Bayern’s Champions League debut in 2009. Fast forward 12 years, though, and the club has come a long way. With three league titles in the last six years, and two UWCL semi-finals in the last three, Bayern is establishing itself among the elite. On Wednesday, they face seven-time European champions Lyon in a Champions League clash for which it is difficult to predict a winner. That progress has not come overnight, nor is it a project nearing completion. “When you see what has happened in these past 10 years, I think it’s unbelievable,"" sporting director Bianca Rech tells GOAL, reflecting on how much things have changed since she left Bayern as a player in 2010. It was in 2016 when Rech returned, initially in a team management role. Bayern had just won back-to-back league titles, ousting two-time European champions Wolfsburg from their position at the top. But she ""felt something was missing"". “I didn't really see a future plan. This is why I sat down with the head of women's football and said: 'If we want to win something in the future and have a vision, we need to write something down'. That's why I wrote the strategy [of] where we want to go as FC Bayern. ""Our vision was to become the number one in Germany - and not just for one year. Wolfsburg were the German champion four times in a row and we want to take over the role as the leading champion in Germany."" Lots of things have developed to put Bayern in a position where they were able to reclaim that title, for example: excellent facilities, growth of the youth teams and professionalisation. Head coach Jens Scheuer has proven himself tactically brilliant, too, and the club’s improvements mean he has a good squad to work with. “Last year, it was a huge step for us when we signed players like Hanna Glas [from Paris Saint-Germain] and Viviane Asseyi [from Bordeaux], bringing in players from outside, from big foreign clubs and football countries,"" Rech explains. ""Normally, it was the other way around. For example: Melanie Leupolz or Vivianne Miedema leaving the club to England. ""We said: ‘Okay, to make the next step, we have to, first of all, bring in players from outside, and second continue bringing in top German players'. It was important to bring in an experienced international player who is deciding to come to Germany, instead of going to Spain or England. We continued this path this summer - for example with Saki Kumagai [from Lyon]. ""The most important thing was, and still is, to bring continuity in our team and try to avoid having too many transfers and player changes after each season. “There are a lot of top clubs right now with an ambition to win the Champions League and being able to invest a lot of money. But there is a problem: the quantity of top players is not there yet. ""If you look for one position, you don't have - compared to the men's game - maybe five or 10 players. It's around one to three, maximum. There are around five top clubs who want the same player. Then you can imagine how the market works – player are getting really expensive. ""Our position is for sure not the easiest. The brand FC Bayern Munich isn't enough. Our league in terms of visibility struggles compare to the English league. The income from TV rights is much higher and therefore much more money available. ""We have to take other routes and sometimes we convince the player, because the really believe in our project. For example, Saki Kumagai, she's an amazing player. If she would have gone for the money, she would have chosen another club, right? But she decided last summer to come to us because of the project and the concept we have.” It is also about signing players who fit into the environment. “There's one big statement and this is something powerful. If you would ask players on the men's team, they would probably say the same thing: Even though we are such a huge club, we're still a small family,"" Rech adds. ""It's the players, it's the people that work here. They make you feel welcome every day. Players from abroad tell me often: 'This feels like a second family'.“ That togetherness was huge last season for Bayern’s league title triumph, but it is not just domestically that these factors are having an impact. Bayern were 90 minutes away from the Champions League final last season, until Chelsea made an historic semi-final comeback. Making that next step in Europe, and eventually becoming champions, is another part of Bayern's vision - which Rech admits they are already working “ahead” of. “The main focus is to win the league and we want to win the German cup,"" she says of this year. ""The Champions League, with the new [group stage] format, is a challenge, but our first goal is to reach the quarter-finals."" For a club like Bayern, the culture is winning, so it is no surprise that there is more desire than ever from the board to bring success to the women’s team. ""I think with the progress and development in the last two years, they recoginse the development and the hard work as a department. This is something which they're very proud of,"" Rech says. As for a timeframe on European success? There is no pressure, but it is certainly on the mind. “At the time we wrote the strategy, our vision was to win the Champions League. We started our process in 2019-20 and to win the Champions League was, and is, a mid-term goal. ""We need to do the right steps to reach this goal.""

The Spanish champions overcame English opposition in the final in May to be crowned queens of Europe, beating Chelsea 4-0 in an incredible performance. The Blues themselves were given a tough draw for the new season as they look to go one better than last term, taking on two-time champions Wolfsburg, who gave them a difficult quarter-final earlier this year, as well as Juventus. With Wolfsburg and Lyon both sitting in pot two ahead of the draw -clubs thattogether won all but one edition of the UWCL between 2011 and 2020 - there were always set to be huge clashes in this first round. The French side, seven-time European champions, will face Bayern Munich in the group stage, the German champions who reached the semi-finals last season. They beat Chelsea in the first leg of that last-four tie, but ultimately fell short due to defeat in London. The inclusion of Real Madridin pot three made the draw even more interesting. While PSG got a kinder draw by avoiding Arsenal, Lyon and Wolfsburg by drawing Icelandic outfit Breidablik from pot two, their meetings with Las Blancas will be extremely tough. This is the Spanish side'sfirst venture into Europe, with it being just thesecond ever season that Real Madrid have had a women's team. However, their defeat of Manchester City in the last round of qualifying has sent a statement straight away. Other debutantes in the competition are Koge and Hoffenheim, who both went into Group C with Arsenal and Barcelona. The former, of Denmark, beat Sparta Prague in qualifying to reach this stage, while Hoffenheim sent a message by dispatching of Swedish outfit Rosengard, who reached the quarter-finals last season. The first games of the group stages will kick-off on October 5 and 6, with the top two in each of the four groups to progress to the quarter-finals. Those final group games will be played on December 15 and 16. Although the idea of a women's equivalent to the Europa League has been discussed, such a competition does not exist yet, so those finishing third and fourth in their groups will be eliminated.

Today, Girelli isone of the faces of Italian women’s football, a seven-time Serie A winner and one of the most prolific forwards in Europe. But it all started for her as a fan, going to the stadium to watch the club she has supported since beinga young child. It was there that she found her idol -Alessandro Del Piero. “It was enough to see how he moves on the pitch, his behaviour and, of course, how he touched the ball,” Girelli explains, telling  Goal  why she was drawn to the club’s legendary No.10. “I think every time he touched the ball, he created something special that maybe other players cannot. I was captured by him. “Finally, I met him during a national team camp, but in the World Cup in France two years ago, after my hat-trick against Jamaica, he sent me a video message. From that moment, we kept in contact on Instagram. ""Sometimes he says congratulations. It's amazing for me.” A post shared by Cristiana Girelli (@cristianagirelli) A quick look at Girelli’s numbers and it does notcome as a shock that she spent her childhood looking up to one of Italy’s greatest ever forwards. The top-scorer in Serie A for the last two seasons, she already has seven goals this season -four of those coming in qualifying for the group stages of the Women's Champions League. Those were her first for Juventus in Europe, with the club having had some especially difficult ties in recent years. Last season, they drew  seven-time champions Lyon  in the round of 32. The year before, it was  a quickly developing Barcelona, who went onto lift the trophyMay. This season, the group stages offera chance to grow into the competition and see where they stand against the elite. On Wednesday, they take on  last season's Women's Champions League finalists,  Chelsea.  They also have two-time winners Wolfsburg on their agenda. They have a coach at the helm with experience of reaching the quarter-finals in Europe too as,  after leaving his role as Arsenal head coach in the summer, Joe Montemurro took charge of the iconic Italian giantsfollowing Rita Guardino’s departure. “Joe has an idea, a philosophy, of football that is different from Rita’s,” Girelli explains. “I think it is something different also for us, but we enjoy it a lot to play in this way. ""We know that to improve, to have this philosophy, this idea of football, it takes time. We need time also to improve and to train but I think we are on the right way. 2️⃣2️⃣ Serie A goals this season.😎  @cristianagire  , the  #QueenOfGoals  ! 👑⚽️  pic.twitter.com/jPVpsI0fs5 “It's enjoyable because I also like how I'm involved in this game. Maybe the last year, I was standing more [at] the top. Now also, for my future maybe, my characteristics of playing, Ilike to drop deep and to play more with maybe the midfielder or maybe do an assist. “[In training], we play a lot with the ball and the intensity is higher now. Maybe it is made shorter, but is more intensive. It's all about ball possession.” The change in coach is also something that Girelli believes sent a message to Europe,and there is a desire throughout the club to be up there with the best that complements it. “I feel [that desire] every day, every year that has passed, and also not just in what the club says, but also from what the club does,” she explains. “For example, when Joe was coming, it was a big signal, you know? Okay, maybe we won in Italy, but now we want to also try to win in Europe. “We feel it - to be in one of the best clubs in the world every day we are here - and that iswhy wegive our best every day.  “Maybe the first two years [in the UWCL] we didn't express good football, and maybe also we didn’t reach our result, butlast year, we sent a signal in the first leg against Lyon. ""We were leading 2-1 and then we lost 3-2, but I think we sent a message: 'Here we are. We are coming and next year, we will try to do better'. And here we are. “Now, it's up to us because it's a beautiful experience to play a group stage. We know that it will be a tough group stage, but we also think that we have a big chance to bring this club where it deserves to be.” With the final to be held at Juventus’ stadium next summer, there is another factor that could drive theclub onto the heights it has long been associated with. The Bianconere may not be one of the front-runners, but do they dare to dream they could achieve such a feat? “Why not?” asks Girelli. After all, she isliving a dream already.

466,https://www.goal.com/en/news/sheriff-real-madrid-breidablik-icelandic-minnows-psg-womens/g2991sy65vgn151kew77vjr9t,‘Sheriff beat Real Madrid - maybe Breidablik will too!’ - The Icelandic minnows aiming to upset PSG & Real in the Women's Champions League,"For most people, a regular day at work does not involve watching the football team you play for draw Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in the Champions League group stages. But when Hildur Antonsdottir went into the office last month, days after her goal had set Icelandic side Breidablik on their way to the group stagesof Europe’s premier club competition, that isexactly what she did. “When the picture came out with all these big clubs and then we saw Breidablik, I just got goosebumps,” Antonsdottir tells Goal. “Like, wow. That's amazing.” On Wednesday evening, PSG will be their visitors as they set their sights on navigating a group that also contains Real Madrid and Ukrainian outfit Kharkiv. A part-time team, the task Breidablik faces is made tougher by the fact their domestic season ended on Friday night – when they beat Throttur Reykjavik 4-0 in the Icelandic Cup final. The club started its pre-season for the 2021 season in October 2020, and will now play the entire group stage in its off-season, supplementing a lack of regular season fixtures in between its European adventure with games against the boys’ team. But this is not a normal part-time team. Training five times a week in a fantastic environment thatIceland women's manager, Thorsteinn Halldorsson, describes as “one of the best in Iceland”, there are massive professional elements to the team. The attitude the club as a wholehas towards its women’s team helps, too.  “The members who are in control, they have the same things for the men's team and the women's team in every field except for the pay,” Antonsdottir explains. “They really think about us and do everything for us.” Ulfar Hinriksson, Breidablik’s head of elite development, first joined the club in 1995. Asked if he remembers when the club first began to work towards that sort of equality, he simply does not. “It's just normal,” he tells Goal. “It's more that the people who run the club and the board see it as a natural thing. “But I think in the last 10 years it has been more structural. For example, three years ago, one of the youth lads was playing with a ball in the locker room and broke the TV, so we had to get a new TV, so we bought two TVs. There was no discussion about it. If there's a TV in the men's locker room, we had a TV in the women's locker room.” That structure applies to everything, and is perhaps most impressive in its youth set-up, which is crucial for a club that is used to losing its best talent to teams fromabroad. In the last 12 months alone, players have left for Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg and the Houston Dash.   There are over 500 girls playing for Breidablik’s youth teams, and they havea satellite team that plays in the second division with an average age of around 17 years old. There is huge emphasis on these young players coming through and playing for the first team – as well as an important consideration of not putting too much pressure on young shoulders. That isall particularly beneficial for the national team too, which continues to defy the odds, qualifying for the last four editions of the Women’s Euros. Considering it is representing a country with a population of less than 400,000, that is remarkable. The youth system in general is something which Halldorsson, head coach of Breidablik for five years before moving on to the national team, believes plays a huge part in Iceland’s continued success on the biggest stage. “[It] is quite different from most other countries because everybody can go and play football,” he explains to Goal. “We don't have this academy system. You're not picked out when you're 10 years old and you have to stop or go to some other worse team. You can always be in your own team until you're at least 19. “The system has high quality coaches. Every coach has to have [their] UEFA A or UEFA B [licence] to coach, even though you're coaching Under-12s. I think that's a part of it. “Coaches are on payroll and it's just not the parents or somebody like that who coaches U8s or U10s. It is coaches who have degrees in coaching and that's their job.”   The success of both senior national teams “has an effect” on these young players too, as will Breidablik’s appearance in these UWCL group stages, Halldorsson believes. Antonsdottir has already noticed the hype growing in the country. “[People in Iceland] are following this very much and everyone knows [about] it,” the midfielder explains. “I was just walking around downtown and the most unbelievable people that I know were like, 'Oh, you're playing against these teams'. I was like, 'Do you even watch football?'. Everyone knows! Whether they are fans of football or not. “A lot of my friends went to the [qualifying] game against Osijek. People who aren't often coming to the games, they went to this game and are probably going to go to all the other games.” Hinriksson, who also works with the Football Association of Iceland alongside his role at Breidablik, has already seen first-hand what impact this can have, too. “It will help the national team in 10 years' time because then we will see players play who have [had] role models [in] the Champions League. This has happened before,” he explains.   “[In] 2012, I selected four players [for the U17s] from three different clubs, and when I started to communicate with them, they came all from the same village of 800 people in the south of Iceland. It's incredible. They were all in the same class. I did not know it because they were playing in three different clubs. “What was probably the biggest factor for them was that an U17 national women's tournament was played - two matches were played in that town. Who were the ball girls? You guessed it. “They stood with the ball at eight, nine years old, seeing these girls, big stars, playing. They say, 'Okay, I want to be a football player'. I expect the Champions League to have similar effect on Breidablik players and just all Icelandic players.” As for the impact that Breidablik could have on the Champions League? They have experience of playing PSG before, losing 7-1 over two legs in the last 16 back in 2019. “I thought we were better at the second game because they play much faster than us.” Antonsdottir remembers. “We get six games [in the new group stages] so we can get a taste and get used to the level that they're playing at, instead of getting two games. We have more opportunities to get better.” Halldorsson believes there is a “good chance” against Ukraine’s representatives, Kharkiv, as Breidablik aims to securethe first-ever Champions League group stage win for an Icelandic team. As for Real Madrid? “Football is so lovely that you never know what's going to happen,” Hinriksson says. “We saw Sheriff beating Real Madrid [in the men’s Champions League]. Maybe Breidablik will beat Real Madrid. You never know. We're going to give it our best shot.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

That’s how Barcelona winger Caroline Graham Hansen describes winning the UEFA Women’s Champions League for the first time, a title that has eluded her for many years, but one she could finally hold in her hands on Sunday. That’s how many players would describe it, of course, but for Graham Hansen, it was a dream she was ready to give up chasing only three years ago. The Norwegian is now rightly considered one of the greatest players in the world, but for a long time, injuries threatened to stop her reaching that point. They were so damning, in fact, that after losing the UWCL final in 2018, she was ready to walk away. “I was serious when I called home and said, 'I'm done. I want to quit',” she tells Goal. “I was so far down. I was injured again. I couldn't perform at my best level. I didn't have any fun anymore. At that moment, after so many rehabs, I didn't have any motivation to keep getting smashed in the face. “You can't always win, but it was the way it happened, always being injured. It was not because you weren’t necessarily the best player, or you weren’t performing at your best. I was not performing at my best because I kept being unlucky. “Of course, that's also part of sport, but you have vacation, you get back and then eventually you find your way again. I did, luckily for me. It's a fun and nice story when you then win the Champions League three years later in the way we did. It makes all the hours you put down really worth it. It's also a motivation to just keep going, no matter what happens.” Good day today as well #Soyculé pic.twitter.com/a47pHqVltg Two years on from losing 4-1 in the final against Lyon, being 3-0 down after 20 minutes, Barcelona produced an almost identical performance in Gothenburg last weekend, with Chelsea on the receiving end. Graham Hansen scored the fourth and final goal after just 36 minutes, the score reading 4-0 at half-time, and full-time. For those that have watched Barcelona this season – top of the league in Spain without a single point dropped, 136 goals scored and five conceded in 27 games – the level of performance was no surprise. Yet, against a Chelsea side stacked with talent, who play in a league some call the best in the world, it served as a statement. “I think it's funny how people talk about our league. They mostly look at the results that we have every weekend, which are big numbers, and just assume that it's because everyone is so sh*t,” Graham Hansen says. “But the fact is that people are not sh*t - we are just really, really good. “I think also, going into the game, a lot of English press were very confident that Chelsea would go out there and win it, based on the fact that they were playing in a stronger league. “But if you look behind the results, they played Atletico Madrid - and Atletico Madrid had a good chance to beat Chelsea - and they are sixth in our league. Maybe sixth is not the right position for Atletico Madrid this season, but they're a good team.  “The same way as we beat Man City over two games, they were a really good team as well. We beat PSG, also, which was a really good team, which beat Lyon. “It's funny how the English press still then, after all these games that we play, assumed it would just be for Chelsea to go out there and run over us, if you can say it in this way. “Everybody had a lot of motivation to go out there and prove everyone wrong based on the final loss two years ago, and also everybody believing that the Spanish league is so sh*t, but it's not. “Of course, we have a lot of improvement to do around it, but that's not up to us. We need help from the federation and they have to do a better job. When it comes down to individuals and teams in the league, there's a lot of good players in it. They just don't get the recognition they deserve. “Hopefully our Champions League victory now can contribute to more journalists and experts actually looking our way and giving us the well-deserved recognition our league also deserves.” OH-MY-GOD- @CarolineGrahamH pic.twitter.com/SFdoQFhS0l Graham Hansen, who ranked at No.6 in Goal 50 last year, will certainly be a contender for the individual accolades when they come around, ending the UWCL with three goals and five assists from nine games. ForBarcelona, head coach Lluis Cortes saysthat the aim is to continue to win on this stage. “I don't think you should expect anyone to do the same [as Lyon],” Graham Hansen says, referring to the five successive European titles the French side won before Barcelona snapped their streak this year. “Anything is possible, but I think to put the pressure on any team to do that is insane.” However, crediting consistency for the Catalans’ triumph this season, the winger is optimistic about the future of this team. “I think it's a work in progress,” she says, a scary thought given the levels reached this season. “We still have to continue to be humble and work every day. You have to work hard every day if we want to make what [Lluis] said happen, and that's about consistency. Consistency is key. Without it, we won't win any more Champions League titles, for sure.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

468,https://www.goal.com/en/news/did-uwcl-debutantes-real-madrid-miss-their-chance-against-a/1iwtmuwcwwx4r1cy24usjyocjm,Did UWCL debutantes Real Madrid miss their chance against a sloppy Man City?,"“We need to be better.” It’s something that, in a few different ways, Manchester City head coach Gareth Taylor repeated several times in his press conference on Tuesday evening, following his team’s 1-1 draw with Real Madrid. City looked like they were going to take a slender advantage home to Manchester ahead of the second leg of this UEFA Women’s Champions League second qualifying round tie, to be played next week. However, Kenti Robles had other ideas. In second-half stoppage time, she drove a low shot past the impressive Karima Benameur Taieb, sparking elation from the home bench. In their first ever UWCL game, they had the goal they deserved. The only frustration for the hosts will be that it wasn’t more. Summer signing Esther, scorer of 30 goals in 33 league games in Spain last season, had a ton of chances in particular, including a first-half penalty, but somehow ended the day without a goal. The worry for the Spaniards now is – will they get this sort of opportunity in the second leg? It’s always difficult for teams to prepare for their first games of the season when it comes to scouting. Real Madrid, who signed eight new players this summer and let five go, caught City out with their pressing in the first half, forcing several turnovers.  But a half time switch of roles for former Barcelona midfielder Vicky Losada and Laura Coombs helped City improve. They kept the ball better, chances dried up for their opponents, and they nearly saw the game out. City are far too good a team to make the same mistakes twice. They’ll tighten up. They’ll adapt. They’ll not give Real as many opportunities and the Spaniards will need a new way to surprise them in the second leg. The Women’s Super League club may well have new personnel available to them for that clash, too. There are hopes that Georgia Stanway and Ellie Roebuck will be back, with eyes also on Keira Walsh’s situation, the midfield maestro who City missed massively in Madrid. “She understands the way I want us to play. She picks things up very quickly,” Taylor said of the England international after the game. “Vicky's been in the building not very long at all. We have to give her time and create that understanding together. The slight change at half time, I think, really worked. I thought Laura Coombs went in [the deeper midfield position] and did really well –again, a player who understands the kind of concepts a little bit more. That was all it was. “Like I say, I think it's just time, giving the players opportunity and time to get fit. That's our first game.” With Lucy Bronze, Ellen White and Chloe Kelly all also on the sidelines, Taylor certainly didn’t have many options on his bench for this game. Alanna Kennedy and Hayley Raso, the Australia internationals who have only recently signed, haven’t had much time with the team in training.   Another week, plus a game on Saturday as the WSL begins, will help top up the sharpness. Throw in the fact City will be at home for that second leg, at a ground where they've not lost in 90 minutes since September 2018, and last season’s UWCL quarter-finalists certainly have the edge. They also have big experience in this competition and the core of theirsquad has been together a long time. The quirk to that statistic, though, is that the team to beat Citythree years ago was Spanish opposition in the Champions League: Atletico Madrid. They will be the favourites to complete the job on their own patch. They will expectto control the game and entertain, as they welcome their fans back for the first time in 18 months. But should they falter, should they show weaknesses and prove to be susceptible to that incredible pressing once again, Real Madrid will be there. They will react. They will create. They may have been wasteful on Tuesday, but to see that sort of performance from a player like Esther again next week would be a huge surprise. ""You have to believe,” Las Blancas captain Ivana said after the game. “You have to keep working."" That’s what they did in the first leg. That’s what they’ll do in the second leg. Real Madrid have a team packed with quality. It’s a team with experienced heads, but it’s also a team that has a lot of hunger. It’s a team representing the club for the first time in the UWCL, but one that has already shown that the club will be a threat both now, and in the future. Have they missed their chance in this tie? Tuesday was certainly a big opportunity. But Wednesday could be too.It will simply be up to them to take it. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

469,https://www.goal.com/en/news/womens-champions-league-exit-beginning-not-end-man-city/7etetk55kx7i1m74pviixnonx,"Women's Champions League exit only the beginning, for new-look Manchester City","If you look at Manchester City’s squad on paper, perhaps you would havebeen surprised by their eliminationin the quarter-finals of this year’s Women’s Champions League. After all, there are three World Cup winners in theteam, two players who won the Champions League last season with Lyon,and a whole host of players that have won multiple trophies around the world in their careers. But, of course, neither games, nor titles, are won on paper. Wednesday’s exit at the hands of Barcelona was a bittersweet one for Gareth Taylor’s side. After looking defensively fragile in the first leg – understandably given Steph Houghton, their captain and the leader of their defence, was missing– City were much improved in their home game, winning 2-1. The damage, however, was done last week, in a 3-0 defeat. With City’s squad, some may demand more, but the fact that Lluis Cortes, the Barcelona manager, believed that the first leg was “one of the best” games his team have played this season, shows how well the Catalans performed in this tie. Barca have been building up to Champions League glory for some time now under Cortes. Eight of theirXI on Wednesday started the 2018-19 Champions League final. Two more were on the bench for that game, a 4-1 defeat to Lyon. “The team is actually more experienced than that of two years ago,” Asisat Oshoala, the scorer of Barca’s only goal in that final, explained this week. “We've learned a lot about how the competition is being played. Now, we're smarter. Of course, we still have to play our style of football. We have a signature which we present to the world every time, but then we have to be smart.”  That game management was evident on Wednesday. The visitorsknew that the impetus was on City and that they would inevitably see more of the ball, but Barcawere impressive in the spells of dominance they were afforded and got theaway goal they needed through Oshoala. City, however, are in a different place. Seven of the XI that started their final Champions League game of the 2018-19 season, a round of 32 defeat to Atletico Madrid,are noteven at the club anymore. There hasbeen a lot of change, including in the dugout, with Gareth Taylor only appointed in the summer. To build a team that can excel in Europe does not happen overnight. It is something that Chelsea manager Emma Hayes can attest to. “I’ve waited nine years for today,” she said on Wednesday, after her side beat Wolfsburgto reach the semi-finals. “They've been doing this for a long time now and have probably got that [bit] more experiencethan what we have,” Taylor said after his side’s exit. “I think that's what [this tie] gives us, it gives us real good experience. I'm new to the role and I just think I'll add that experience. We stick together and [when] we arrive in those moments again, I think that experience is going to help us going forward.” “A SEMIS!!! A SEMIS!!!” #UWCL💙❤️ Força Barça! pic.twitter.com/isjJVobawF When teams crash out of cup competitions, there is always the tendency to put them under the microscope and find out where it went wrong. For City, they could havebeen more defensively solid in the first leg, and they could have been more clinical. Had they put away one of their two clearest chances last week, or scored from the spot when awarded a second-half penalty, things might have been different. But there is no shame in losing to a team that is not only further along in their quest for European glory, but a team that is very, very good, too. Barcelona are top of the Primera Iberdrolawith21 wins from 21 games, 103 goals scored, three conceded. The season is notover yet, either. City still have a fantastic chance of winning a league title, sitting two points behind Chelsea in the Women's Super League standings, with the pair to meet at the end of April in what looks set to be a title-decider. With a Women’s FA Cup already in the bag from November,this will bea successful first season for Taylor nonetheless. Champions League contention will notcome for him and his new-look sidewith a click of the fingers, nor does it have to. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

470,https://www.goal.com/en/news/can-man-utd-or-everton-beat-chelsea-man-city-or-arsenal-to-a/1m6zpal3ibsu17awxqvakx3po,"Can Man Utd or Everton beat Chelsea, Man City or Arsenal to a Women’s Champions League place?","Seven years. That’s how long it’s been since a club other than Arsenal, Chelsea or Manchester City finished in the top three of the Women’s Super League. In that time, they’ve simply dominated all below them. In 263 league games against the rest of the division, the ‘big three’ have losta combined 11 times. That outlines just how difficult it will befor a club to break the stronghold they have on the top of the league. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t clubs with the aim,and potential,to do so. Manchester United and Everton made no secret of their ambitions last season. Both wanted to break into those UEFA Women’s Champions League spots. Both showed signs they could. United took points from Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal in the first half of the campaign. They were top at Christmas. But injuries and points dropped to those below them proved costly in the New Year. “I think for us, consistency is a huge thing,” Man Utd captain Katie Zelem said ahead of the new season. “We got some great results against what you would call the top three, but for us it's aboutmaintaining our standards, no matter who we play. “It’s making sure that it's not just the big games that you focus on, but every single game you play contributes to getting in the Champions League.” United ended the season in fourth, one pointbehind Arsenal. Since then, there’s been a lot of change.  Head coach Casey Stoney left, and Marc Skinner has replaced her. Ten players have also departed,most notablyLauren James, who has joined Chelsea, and the U.S. women’s national team duo of Tobin Heath and Christen Press. The club has made some good additions–Norway's talented midfielder Vilde Boa Risa is the most eye-catching of the five–but there is a question mark overthe depth oftheir forward line. With a new manager, too, there is always uncertainty over how things might go. AndSkinner, who closed thegap to the big guns during time at Birmingham, is under no illusions of what is required of him. “We (Birmingham) challengedbecause we believed in each other,” he said at his unveiling as United's new boss. “We closed the gap because we believed in what we were doing and we knew that we had to fight against some financial might. “It's about making sure we have the most together team on the field. I think that's what's the most exciting thing about being at Manchester United. Not only can we have the support away from the ground and away from what we're doing on the field, but also on the field, we're free to invent who we are. “We're at a club that wants to be successful. It's putting everything in place to crave the successes that come from winning titles, that come from winning cups and that's part of the reason that I came here as well.”   The position that Everton find themselves in is very different. They showed signs last year of being able to shake up the establishment, beating Chelsea in the Women’s FA Cup and taking Man City to extra time in the final. However, in the league, they lost all six games against the ‘big three’, finishing 16 points off the European spots. “There was already a lot of quality at the club,” England international Toni Duggan, who returned to her childhood club this summer after leaving Atletico Madrid, said. “They had a great year last year. But I think to take that next step, we needed more experienced players. Also, bringing winners in.” All nine of the players Everton have brought in during the transfer window areregular senior internationals, many with experience of winning titles and playing in Europe. “We've definitely gone to the next level in that respect,"" Duggan added. ""Now, on the pitch, we need to take that to the next level as well.” The key factor in all of this, though, remainsArsenal, Chelsea andMan City. Are there any signs that one member of the 'big three'mightfall short and open the door for the chasing pack?   Chelsea have added centre-back depth to an already star-studded squad, though there are questions at full-back. Man City have had one of the best transfer windows in the league, but do have injuries to key players in Lucy Bronze and Chloe Kelly. Arsenal have impressed in their early Champions League outings undernew boss Jonas Eidevall, too. There is also the fact that the rest of the league in general is making huge strides. The transfer window has indicated as much, with Reading, who finished seventh last year, signing Canada’s Olympic gold medallist Deanne Rose and West Ham, who staved off relegation, securing the services of Yui Hasegawa, whose name was linked with Barcelona and Real Madrid. As Zelem says, it’s not just about United, and Everton, or beating the ‘big three’. Maintaining consistency against those below them will be tougher than ever – as it will be for Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City, too. Questions have long been asked of the WSL and its competitiveness. As the league prepares for its biggest ever season, following an historic television deal with Sky Sports and the BBC, it looks better placed than ever to make huge steps forward. An incredible battle at the topwill certainly help too. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A Kim Little double proved the centrepiece of a 5-0 victory at Meadow Park, asJonas Eidevall's side made it three wins from three to keep their perfect start to the new season intact. Vivianne Miedema, Katie McCabe and Leah Williamson also scored, whileU.S. national team star Heath's lateappearancewill have alsothrilled Gunners supporters. With Arsenal 4-0 up and cruising to victory,two-time World Cup winner Heathcame on for fellow striker Beth Mead in the 86th minute. The 33-year-old - a childhood Gunners fan who spent time last term with Manchester United- then played out the remaining nine minutes of the match. Although she did not manage to find the target herself, she was on hand to celebrate Williamson's effort late in injury time which added a final touch of gloss for the hosts. Speaking after the match, Eidevall was quick to praise Heath for her commitment following a quick turnaround that only saw her arrive in the country at the end of the week. ""It's obviously been [three] intense days for her,"" he stated.""She landed on Friday, she did one session Saturday and she was on the pitch here now on Sunday. ""It's a long [trip] from the U.S. to here so I think she has managed it extremely well. She was very much focused on looking forward to trying to get minutes here today. ""I always love when the players have that ambition. Hopefully we can add some more training time and get her settled in even more."" Heath's debut comes after she played sparingly in the USWNT's recent friendlies against Paraguay- but with further minutes likely to come, she will hope to feature for both club and country. With Arsenal, she will aim to back up her reputation as the signing of the off-season in the WSL, as the Gunners go in search of further silverware With her country, she will hope to figure in their upcoming friendlies with South Korea, scheduled for the end of October.

472,https://www.goal.com/en/news/coombs-proving-her-worth-in-midfield-among-man-citys-uswnt/1tdwea9jlduob12qehxnk0qlxh,Three goals in three games: Coombs proving her worth among Man City's USWNT stars,"When Manchester City went 2-0 up against Manchester United on Saturday, you’d have been forgiven for forgetting there were no fans at Leigh Sports Village. As Laura Coombs rifled the ball into the top corner, chants of ‘Coombsy, Coombsy’ rang out from behind the dugouts, with City’s bench acting as the midfielder’s own little fan club as she bagged her third goal in three games. While City had less to celebrate come full time,  as United mounted a spirited comeback to draw 2-2,  the game itself was another reminder of Coombs’ superb form over the last few weeks. Despite the arrivals of  Sam Mewis  and  Rose Lavelle,  the United States’ World Cup-winning duo, the former Liverpool star has risen to the challenge of increased competition in midfield, despite only starting one Women’s Super League game in the entirety of last term. “Laura is a good footballer with real composure,” head coach Gareth Taylor said on Saturday. “She’s comfortable on the ball, really intelligent, picks up good positions on the pitch and she’s added goals to her game now as well. “She’s earned her place in the team and there’s a lot of competition in her area of play. That’s probably the highest competition we have, the attacking midfield positions. “But she’s adaptable, she can play in the holding position as well. Good players can play anywhere and she’s a good player.” What a finish,  @lauracoombs91  !  @ManCityWomen  are 0-2 up in the derby. 💙  #WomensFootballWeekend   pic.twitter.com/0C4RyyrJlm Coombs’ performances are all the more impressive given the chaotic start to her City career. The 29-year-old was brought in last summer by former head coach Nick Cushing, but wouldn’t start a league game for her new club until December, due to injuries. The way Cushing managed his new players, he tended to ease them in too, so her opportunities didn’t come as thick and fast as she might have liked once she was back to full fitness. “It takes time for players to get into the rhythm of how we tactically work,” Cushing explained back in January, speaking about Coombs’ limited game time  after she had starred in a Continental Cup win over Sheffield United. “She’s missed out a lot of games and she then got an injury when she was playing well. “For her, it’s about now training to get consistency in performance, in understanding, to try and get more and more games.” The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,  which would bring the 2019-20 WSL season to a premature end,  limited how much she could rise to that challenge, and when the new season rolled around, Coombs had a new manager to impress,  with Cushing leaving in February to join New York City FC in MLS. When  new boss Taylor  brought in Mewis and Lavelle to strengthen a midfield department that Cushing had already dubbed as “hard” to break into, the challenge rose. But Coombs has risen with it. Days after winning her first trophy with the club, the Women’s FA Cup,  Coombs scored a stunning goal in the Continental Cup against former club Liverpool at the beginning of November, flicking the ball over her own head with her first touch before lifting it over the goalkeeper’s with her second. Since then, she hasn’t stopped scoring. Now that is some goal from  @lauracoombs91  ! 🤩What a touch 😍What a finish ⭐️  #ContiCup   pic.twitter.com/yZYMFueIrq Against Bristol City, it was her goal that put Taylor’s side 2-1 up and on their way to an 8-1 victory, after Bristol had pegged their high-flying opponents back with an 11th-minute equaliser. It was a goal that showed just what she is about too - a lung-busting run from deep creating the opportunity, before an emphatic finish followed. After two great strikes in back-to-back games, Sunday’s goal in the Manchester derby didn’t disappoint either. When Mewis’ effort was blocked, Coombs was the player alert to the loose ball, latching onto it and thumping it into the top corner from the edge of the box. It may not have helped City get the result they wanted, but it was yet another step in the right direction for a player whose City career has been stop-and-start for so many reasons. “I came here to be better and I knew it would maybe take some time. I’m going to be patient with it but I’m not here to make up the numbers,”  Coombs said back in December 2019, in an exclusive interview with  Goal  . “I really want to push for a place and help the team where I can. As weeks go by, I just want to make sure that I’m feeling fitter and becoming a better player.” It’s almost a year on, but things appear to be finally falling into place for Coombs at Manchester City.

Pogba was a second-half substitute for the Red Devils on Wednesday but failed to turn the tide as Atletico Madrid advanced to the quarter finals with a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford. His children remained at home but were thankfully unharmed during the incident. ""Last night our family's worst nightmare was realised when our home was broken into and burglarised while our babies were sleeping in their bedroom,"" Pogba wrote in a statement published on the United man's Twitter account. pic.twitter.com/O3hocLUh51 ""The burglars were in our home for less than five minutes but in that time they took from us something more valuable than anything we had in our home... our sense of safety and security. ""This occurred during the final minutes of last night's match when they knew I wouldn't be home. My wife and I rushed home not knowing if our children were safe and unharmed. As a father there is no feeling worse in this world than not being there to protect your children and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to feel what I felt last night."" Pogba offered a reward for information relating to the burglary at his home, while GOAL understands that United are working with all their players to strengthen and review their security.

474,https://www.goal.com/en/news/henry-worried-neymar-mental-health-psg/blt49ccc50c31e743ad,Henry worried about Neymar's mental health as PSG star continues to underwhelm,"Thierry Henry has admitted that he is worried about Neymar's mental health as the Paris Saint-Germain star continues to underwhelm with his performances in 2021-22. Neymar is enduring arguably his worst season yet in a PSG shirt, with only four goals and four assists to his name from 18 appearances in all competitions. The Brazilian has missed another 18 matches due to familiar injury problems, and former France international Henry is concerned about his psychological state. Neymar's latest poor showing came as PSG slumped to a 1-0 loss at Nice in the battle between the top two teams in Ligue 1 on Saturday. Henry, who also played for Arsenal and Barcelona at the height of his playing career, thinks the struggling 30-year-old forward has been crying out for help during his most recent media interviews. ""When you analyse an action and he doesn't position himself properly, okay, that's a fact and it must be said. Yes, he is a little worse than he has been, but there are reasons,"" Henry told L'Equipe. ""Neymar has often talked in his recent interviews about his well-being, about the pressure, so my first thought is: 'Is he ok?'. It's not about that he no longer does nutmegs, sombreros, or about the fact that he doesn't beat people with his pace anymore. ""He talks, but can you hear him? He's asking for help – there are things happening in his head, just like any other human being."" The main interview that Henry appears to be referencing is one that Neymar gave to DAZN last year, during which he said that he is planning to retire from international football in the near future. ""I think it's my last World Cup [in 2022],"" he said. ""I see it as my last because I don't know if I have the strength of mind to deal with football anymore."" Neymar has also suggested that he is growing tired of the intense demands of the European game at club level, opening the door to a potential foray into MLS. ""I'd love to play in the U.S., actually. I'd love to play there at least for a season,"" the PSG star told the Fenomenos podcast last month. ""Their season is shorter, so I'd get three months' vacation.""

Silva has played alongside Neymar for the Selecao fora decade and also competed alongside the forward at Paris Saint-Germain. As a world-renowned centre-back, Silva said he can relate to the feelings Neymar has expressed - and acknowledged it washurtful to be publicly labelled ""a crybaby, weak, very weak, mentally"" when speaking out on his struggles. So, the defender is determined to provide public backing to his countryman in hopes of helping him regain his love for football. ""Here at the national team, I have gone through some moments that are very similar [with what Neymar is going through], especially after the 2014 World Cup,"" Silva told reporters. ""I was called a crybaby, weak, very weak, mentally. These are things that hurt you and you know that you are not what you have been called. ""I hope he doesn't lose his joy, continues to be happy the way he always is. He is a very special kid and, when he's happy, doing what he loves, he delivers."" Find yourself a friend like Thiago Silva and never let them go. In an Instagram story, Silva added: ""If you need someone strong to be by your side, know that I will always be there. The Silva family love you."" ""I think it's my last World Cup [in 2022],"" the Paris Saint-Germain star said onDAZN. ""I see it as my last because I don't know if I have the strength of mind to deal with football anymore. ""So I'll do everything to turn up well, do everything to win with my country, to realise my greatest dream since I was little. And I hope I can do it."" Mental health has become a key conversation in football in recent years as players have started to open up about their personal struggles, helping normalise the importance of asking for help rather than keeping emotions inside. Neymar has joined the likes of Jack Wilshere, Tyrone Mings and Christian Pulisic in speaking out about mental health this year. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Pulisic recently opened up about his own struggles with mental health and how speaking to a therapist has helped him throughout his time at Chelsea. He said that, at one point, he felt that talking to a professional was a sign of weakness, with the U.S. men's national team (USMNT) star saying that he now understands it's a sign of self-awareness and strength. ""It took me a while to realise that to speak up feels strong,"" Pulisic told the Daily Mail. ""I thought that I was too tough to need help. When it’s all on you, it can really feel like a lot. Opening up, it’s a hard thing for a lot of people, as it was for me. I reached out to a therapist and that’s not something that anyone should ever be ashamed of. ""It was kind of building up, as it was for a lot of people. Not just living alone but everything being closed up. Covid times brought a lot of changes and things were happening in my life. I was lucky that people at Chelsea and the national team steered me in the right direction."" One positive thing lockdown brought to Pulsiic was chess, as he rekindled his love for the game. Pulisic says he grew up playing the game was his grandfather, who taught him an appreciation of strategy that has now helped him bond with his Chelsea teammates. ""Chess is a recent passion that I rekindled during all the time indoors inlockdown,"" Pulisic said. ‘I’d say N’Golo [Kante]and I are the top two. We always have good battles. He was much stronger than me when I started, always the No. 1, but I made it my goal to beat him so I had to work hard. ""I used to see him playing Olivier Giroud on the plane and we’d talk about it. It’s an incredible game that can help you with a lot of things like problem-solving or seeing different patterns. I’m not saying it directly correlates to me being a better footballer but it’s certainly better than staring at a screen, gaming."" Pulisic's grandfather Mate passed away in December in what was a dark moment for Pulisic. The winger, whose middle name is Mate in honor of his late grandfather, recently got a special tattoo of a queen chess piece with his grandfather's name to commemorate the man that helped him fall in love with the game. ""I had it done after the Champions League final,"" he said. ""There’s no great significance to the queen, though it’s a cool piece -versatile, powerful and can move anywhere. ""It was my grandpa who taught me how to play when I was younger. I was nowhere near his level and I wish we’d played more but I’m glad we shared that. It’s a memory I hold close to my heart.

The ex-Gunners manager also thinks his countryman is ahead of Erling Haaland, as the duo continue to be the centre of transfer specuation. World Cup winner Mbappe has grown in reputation since firing France to glory at Russia 2018, and Wenger describes him as an ""exceptional"" talent. ""When I first saw him, I said on French television: 'There's Pele in him',"" Wenger told BEIN Sports. ""Everyone thought I was a bit crazy, nut he's got to this level. ""Technically, he is a little ahead of Haaland. He has his fantasy, not just his speed. ""He has intelligence, good technical quality, good timing in his runs, quick analysis of the game. He is also a free spirit, he is exceptional."" Speculation remains rife about which club will land the two superstars. Mbappe appears all but set to head to Santiago Bernabeu to link up with Real Madrid, having run down time on his PSG contract, but Haaland looks likely to play in the Premier League. The Norway international is reportedly poised to join Premier League champions Manchester City. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Ligue 1 leaders were thrashed on Sunday to increase discontent in the wake of their elimination from the Champions League. They are still on course to win the title, but Mbappe and captain Marquinhos were not happy with the result or the performance on display at the weekend. ""We lost to a great team who are playing to get into Europe. They were determined and carried out their game plan,"" ex-Monaco star Mbappe explained to Amazon Prime Video after the final whistle. ""I hope they get into Europe. They deserved to win. ""The goal is to go for the 10th league title. The rest doesn't matter. ""Even if we win 8-0 or 9-0, people will still be thinking about the Champions League. We must remain professional and respect each other. ""We have to respect the fans who support us, the people and our families. You have to respect yourself if you have a shred of respect for what you do."" Brazil defender Marquinhos offered a similarly harsh analysis of his team's showing: stating that if they continued in this vein PSG might even miss out on Ligue 1, where they currently enjoy a 12-point lead at the top over rivals Marseille. ""It's a catastrophe and difficult to digest. It's our worst game of the year,"" he told reporters. ""We're in a tough spell and we can't throw it all away. We have to work together to get out of this moment. ""There were a lot of expectations [against Real Madrid] and the defeat hurt us. We still have goals to chase.

Haaland is arguably the most in-demand forward in world football right now, with the likes of Manchester City, Manchester United, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich all reportedly interested in his services. GOAL has previously reported that the 21-year-old is also a target for Madrid, who had been planning to make a move after finalising a deal for PSG's Mbappe. The Blancos are confident of signing Mbappe as a free agent in the summer as the striker has yet to show any sign of extending his current contract at Parc des Princes. Haaland was next on the club's list as they look to overhaul their attack, but GOAL has learned that they are now sceptical about convincing him to continue his development at Santiago Bernabeu. The Norway international is not certain that it would be the best career step for him to link up with Mbappe and Benzema because he wants to be the main man wherever he plays. GOAL has learned that Madrid officials now also fear that Haaland is more likely to join City - the club his father Alf-Inge played for between 2000 and 2003. It has been reported that the Premier League champions have offered the forward a contract that would make him the highest-paid player in English football and Dortmund believe he will head to the Etihad Stadium when the transfer market reopens. However, Madrid is Haaland's preferred destination under the right circumstances and the situation could change if they launch a formal bid, with his agent Mino Raiola still in contact with several parties and working to find the best possible deal.

Pogba left Juventus for Manchester United for a then-world record transfer fee of £100 million ($134m) in 2016, although his spell at Old Trafford has been inconsistent. The Frenchman's contract expires this summer and Juve have been linked with bringing Pogba back on a free transfer but Allegri has batted away those claims. Speaking at his press conference ahead of Juve's weekend Serie A meeting with Spezia, Allegri said: ""Pogba? It makes no sense to talk about the market now. He's a Manchester United player, I don't know whathe's going to do next season. ""It's true that I had a great relationship with him, but he's angry with me because I always beat him at basketball!"" Pogba has made the move from Old Trafford to Turin before, departing on a free transfer in 2012 after being unable to agree new terms at Old Trafford. In four years at Juve, he emerged as one of the world's best midfielders and was key in Allegri's side who dominated Serie A and reached the Champions League final in 2015. This persuaded United to spend a world record fee to bring him back, although he now looks set to leave on a free once again, with time running out for the Red Devils to get a new contract sorted out. The player himself, meanwhile, has refused to comment on what he plans to do next, while his agent Mino Raiola teased back in September 2021 that ""Turin is still in his heart"".

The France international’s deal at Old Trafford is up at the end of the season and he has not put pen to paper on the new contract which has been on the table since the summer. Unless the midfielder has a last minute change of heart he looks set to leave the club on a free transfer for the second time in his career but his unsigned contract will not stop Rangnick selecting him when he is back to full fitness. Anthony Martial has not featured in a Premier League squad for Manchester United since the start of December after telling club chiefs he wants to leave this month, but Rangnick says Pogba will not be given the same treatment despite also wanting to go. “Yes of course,” Rangnick replied when asked if there was any point in playing Pogba even though he knows he wants to leave. “I also played Nemanja Matic in the last games and his contract is also expiring. By the way, my contract as a manager is also expiring in the summer. For us we have the same goal. We have the same ambition to be as successful as we can possibly be in the next three or four months. “For me it's not a question if a player has an expiring contract, the question is how much does he still want to be a part of this group, how much does he still feel emotionally and physically on board. As long as this is the case, why shouldn't Paul Pogba now after two and half months of injury, fully fit again now and he also wants to show up, he wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be and even if it's only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that and why should I then not play him? “But as I said, there is a difference of how players deal with their current situation. How do they handle that? If they handle that in a professional way, an ambitious way, of course I will play players although they have a contract expiring in the summer.” United travel to Brentford in the Premier League on Wednesday but the game is too soon for the midfielder to feature as he only returned to full training on Monday. Rangnick is hopeful the 28-year-old will be fit for the FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough on Friday, February 4, which is the first game back after the break. The last game Pogba played for United was the 2-2 draw against Atalanta in the Champions League at the start of November. He hasn’t played in the league since the end of October when he came on as second half substitute in the 5-0 defeat to Liverpool and was sent off 15 minutes later. A new contract has been on the table from United since last summer but the midfielder has not signed and talks have been ongoing in the background. Sources said the club were preparing to lose the 28-year-old on a free transfer in the summer rather than sell him in the current window. Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola has consistently stated his client’s desire for a new challenge and he is able to negotiate with foreign clubs over a pre-contract agreement this month.

Pogba was left in awe as Ronaldo scored in a variety of ways, beating Hugo Lloris from outside the box, via a tap-in and with his head. Amid reports that Ronaldo has been unhappy at Manchester United, Pogba said his team-mate has ""never been a problem"" while hailing his abilities. ""We hurt them at the right times and Ronaldo did what he does best,"" Pogba told BBC Sport. ""He has never been a problem. You have the best striker in history in our team, he cannot be a problem. Today the performance from him and all the team was very brilliant."" He added to Sky Sports: “Everybody knows Cristiano – there’s no need to talk about him. That’s what he does. He didn’t play in the last game, but he comes back and scores three goals. Everybody’s happy."" “It was good today. You can hear the fans – they were pushing us and feeling it,"" Pogba said. ""I think today was a very good performance as a team and a very good reaction from the City game. “We kept believing. In the second half we didn’t get the nice passing, and the movement I think wasn’t there. We gave them a bit of confidence, that’s why they scored. But we got a corner and scored the winning goal. “It’s a boost. We needed it to go again. We want the top four and they were opponents who are looking for the top four also. It was a good win and a good performance.” Saturday was a cathartic victory for a Manchester United group that has struggled over the past month, and with the win, their top-four prospects have improved. Ronaldo scoring three goals will also reduce pressure on him and likely dispel some of the rumours of dressing-room unrest, at least for now. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

483,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pogba-perfect-opportunity-impress-employers-strong/blt87bbddbc880c79ba,Pogba has perfect opportunity to impress potential employers with strong Manchester derby performance,"Long after Paul Pogba has left Manchester United the same questions will be asked about his second stint at Old Trafford after signing from Juventus for £100 million ($134m) in 2016. Was it a success or a huge failure? In the four weeks since he returned from his most recent injury, the World Cup winner has produced the kind of performances that typify his six-year tenure at United. There have been moments of brilliance and moments of dominance followed by long spells ingames where he has been anonymous. His inconsistency means that the fanbase will be divided on their conclusions about the playmaker when he inevitably moves on this summer. “I have been a big critic of Paul,” club legend Paul Scholes told Premier League Productions last week. “You don’t know what you are going to get with Paul. But when he is on his game, he is brilliant. But then when he isn’t, then against your Liverpool and Man Citys, you might struggle in those areas. Where do Man United go next year to replace him?” A midfielder is top of United’s shopping list when the transfer window opens in the summer and, with no signature on the fresh terms which were laid out for the 28-year-old before the start of this campaign, there is the expectation that they are looking for someone to replace the France international rather than accompany him. But, as Scholes states, how do United go about replacing an ‘in-form’ Pogba? On his day he is one of the best midfielders in the world. The ease with which he can stroll through a midfield and pick a pass is not replicated by any other player in the squad. Manager Ralf Rangnick said Pogba would be returning to the squad with a point to prove to his next potential employers and on the whole, in the seven games in which he has featured since coming back, that is what he has done. He has reminded everyone of his ability to control games and his skill has been shown in moments of ridiculous quality - topped off by that impudent flick against Leeds a couple of weeks ago. If he was producing those performances for 90 minutes every match there would be no debate about his United legacy. The problem is he doesn’t seem capable. The issue of consistency plagues the debate. Against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16 first leg, particularly in the first half, he was dreadful. If he does, as expected, leave in the summer he will be missed as much off the pitch as on it. Pogba is known to be one of the most friendly and popular members of the squad, who has time for everyone and is a welcoming presence at the training ground. His meetings with Rangnick are understood to have gone well and the pair have a good working relationship despite the German manager knowing the likelihood of the midfielder leaving. “He wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be. Even if it's only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that,” Rangnick said. This weekend presents a perfect opportunity for Pogba to show to potential future employers what he is capable of. On his day he can be the man to turn the game in Manchester United’s favour but off his best he can be a weak link. If he wants to show that he deserves a move to one of Europe’s elite clubs then he needs to perform his best against the best. Sunday’s Manchester derby is the opportune moment to display his talent and help with United’s top-four push. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The club have suspended Mason Greenwood ""until further notice"" following the allegations which were made against the striker. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed on Wednesday morning that Greenwood had been released from custody while its investigation continues. A GMP statement read: ""A 20-year-old man arrested on Sunday 30 January 2022 on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman has been released on bail pending further investigation."" It comes after Man Utd confirmed at the weekend that Greenwood would not be involved with the club for the forseeable future. “Mason Greenwood will not return to training or play matches until further notice,"" a statement from the club said on Sunday. In an earlier statement, the Old Trafford side made it clear that they are aware of “images and allegations” that appeared on social media regarding the 20-year-old. A spokesperson for United said that the club “does not condone violence of any kind”. A statement from GMP confirmed last week that a man in his 20s had been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. ""Greater Manchester Police were made aware earlier today of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence,"" the statement on Sunday read. ""An investigation was launched and following enquiries we can confirm a man in his 20s has since been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. He remains in custody for questioning. Inquiries are ongoing."" GMP were then granted additional time to question Greenwood, who was detained in custody as he was quizzed about the allegations. This extension ended on Wednesday. The statement from GMP on Sunday concluded: ""We remind people to avoid any commentary or sharing of images that could compromise the victim's right to lifelong anonymity, or risk prejudicing a live investigation with active proceedings.""

485,https://www.goal.com/en/news/inside-story-van-de-beek-man-utd-misery/blt9be040f02cfda61f,The inside story of Van de Beek's Man Utd misery,"This was supposed to be the season when Manchester United fans finally got to see the real Donny van de Beek. The Dutchman returned for pre-season training full of hope after positive talks with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer about his role in the team. Van de Beek believed that he would get a real shot at proving his worth after a nightmare first season at Old Trafford in which he started just 15 times following his £35 million ($46m) move from Ajax in August 2020. However, the first half of the current campaign continued in the same vein and not even a change of manager helped him push his way into the team. The midfielder's unhappiness led to a deadline-day departure to Everton, where he will stay on loan until the end of the season. So, where did it go wrong for Van de Beek at United? Among some at the club’s Carrington training base, there was a belief that when he arrived, he was not ready for the physicality of playing regularly in the Premier League. They felt that, compared to other players that had come from abroad, he was struggling to adapt to the rigours of English football. Consequently, there were those that argued that, at least initially, Van De Beek should be used more regularly in the Champions League, where he had made his name with Ajax. However, his lack of game time raised eyebrows. It was only a matter of months after his arrival in Manchester that famous former Netherlands internationals began publicly urging Van de Beek to put in a transfer request in January 2021. He was willing to fight for his place at that point but, by the summer, he wanted out and requested a loan move. However, Van de Beek was told that he was likely to see more action in 2021-22, with Solskjaer planning to ditch one of his two holding midfielders in order to play a more attacking formation. The 24-year-old had enjoyed an impressive pre-season campaign and, after having to withdraw from the Netherlands squad for last summer’s European Championship due to injury, he had spent the time off bulking up to help him deal with the demands of the Premier League. All in all, then, Van de Beek didn't feel too bad about his loan request being denied. However, his sense of optimism was quickly replaced with a familiar feeling of frustration. Sources say that van de Beek wasn’t given an explanation as to why he wasn’t being selected by Solskjaer and there was a feeling that the Norwegian had his favourites, players that would always start no matter what. The arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo also complicated matters for Van de Beek. The Portuguese obviously wasn't a direct rival for a starting spot but his guaranteed inclusion in the starting line-up did mean that United always had to play in a certain way, while the competition for starting spots among the squad's more creative players only increased. So, when he was dropped by his national team in August, Van de Beek again pushed for a transfer and he could have even joined Everton before the close of the summer window had Solskjaer not blocked the move. Once again, the former United forward told Van de Beek that he was ""needed"" at Old Trafford. Van de Beek, though, was annoyed by the decision and his disappointment only intensified as the season wore on, with Solskjaer only using him six times in all competitions before being dismissed in November. By that point, Van de Beek had clearly had enough. His lack of a transfer, coupled with minimal minutes, led to him changing agents ahead of the January window. Great second session as a 🔵! Thank you for making me feel so welcome. 🙌🏼 pic.twitter.com/rJhl4dtQ2z Van de Beek left long-term advisor Guido Albers to link up with Ali Dursun in the hope of finally securing a move away from Old Trafford. Van de Beek finally got his wish on Monday but there is no option to buy in the loan deal, so his Old Trafford career might not be over just yet. Indeed, it is understood that United believe that there could still be a future for him at the club. Consequently, they want to wait until a decision is made on their next permanent manager before letting Van de Beek leave for good. Ralf Rangnick obviously occupies the hot seat for now and it is not yet known for sure if his interim role could turn into a permanent position. What's clear, though, is that the German, just like Solskjaer before him, felt he had better players than Van de Beek at his disposal. ""It’s a question of competition,” Rangnick told reporters when asked why he had only given Van de Beek one start. “Like Paul Pogba, I see him in the centre of midfield as one of the 6 or 8 positions and we have quite a few other good players in those positions and, therefore, he didn’t get much game time. ""But that doesn’t mean he’s not good enough for the Premier League or Manchester United. “I’m pretty sure that he will get his game time at Everton and show what kind of quality he can be. ""He’s a fantastic person and in the last nine or 10 weeks when I got to know him I’m fully aware he’s a fantastic team player and I wish him all the very best for the next months at Everton.” OFFICIAL: Donny van de Beek joins Everton on loan from Manchester United ✅Frank Lampard's first signing as manager 🤝 pic.twitter.com/Dc169dZoQ5 Frank Lampard is also optimistic van de Beek will prove himself a Premier League player. “A player like Donny is someone who can link play and has the confidence and intelligence to receive the ball in all areas,” Lampard said. “He’s versatile in midfield.” Of course, it must be said that the qualities Lampard is talking about were barely seen in Van de Beek's 18 months at United. The club’s social media accounts celebrated the midfielder’s 50 appearances for the club last month but just 19 starts and nine 90-minute outings are not much to shout about for a player that arrived to such fanfare. Still, if things go well for him at Goodison Park, he will likely return to Manchester with more Premier League minutes under his belt than he has managed in his United career so far. Whether he would use a successful loan spell to secure a permanent move away from Old Trafford remains to be seen. For now, he just needs to prove all those doubters wrong and show he has exactly what it takes to make it in the Premier League. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

486,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-pogba-out-pochettino-ten-hag-in-man-utd-champions-league-/blt002141a0b1ae6ef6,"Ronaldo and Pogba out, Pochettino or Ten Hag in - Where do Man Utd go after Champions League elimination?","“It’s another bad year for us."" David de Gea’s reaction after Manchester United were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid at the first knockout stage could have been copied and pasted from most of the last decade. A Europa League triumph under Jose Mourinho in 2017 represents the best of United’s efforts in Europe over the last 10 years, their last trophy win of any kind now five seasons ago. For a club which still proclaims itself as one of the biggest in the world, that simply is not good enough. “You're right, too many years without any trophies, we are fighting for trophies,” De Gea continued. “So I think we need to be clear, we want to achieve good things and fight for trophies. We don't just want to play for the top four and be there, get out of the Champions League at the quarter-final. “So we need much more from everyone, because this club is too big for where we are now. We are far from fighting for the Premier League and Champions League. We need much more from everyone.” So where do United go from here? Paul Scholes and Rio Ferdinand, who both know exactly what it takes to win the Champions League for United, have spoken of the need for a ""reset"" in the summer while on punditry duties. That button has been pressed so many times since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, though, that it is in danger of becoming stuck. They have tried the Ferguson-recommended managerial replacement in David Moyes, the well-respected Louis van Gaal, a serial winner in Jose Mourinho and the former player who gets the club in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer; no one has managed to get United back to where they want to be. “I really believe Man United will be back, I’m sure - I don’t know when but it’s definitely going to happen,"" said De Gea. At this stage you would have to admire his optimism. The top four, and with it re-qualification to the Champions League, looks extremely unlikely. Arsenal are sitting a point ahead of Ralf Rangnick’s side with three games in hand, and that brings its own problems. Cristiano Ronaldo has divided opinion since coming back to Old Trafford, but his goal return in Europe was the only reason United were in knockout action at all on Tuesday. He has also won them vital points in the Premier League. He is unlikely, however, to hang around and ply his trade in the Europa League or, even worse, the Europa Conference League, so the club will likely have to find a replacement for his goals. This summer is set to be another important one in the post-Ferguson era. Big signings are needed and, most importantly, a new manager. The difficulty for new CEO Richard Arnold and his transfer team is that they will not be able to dangle a lucrative Champions League carrot in front of prospective employees. The Manchester United badge is no longer enough to get big-name players to join and, with little evidence of progress this season, it could be a tough window for the club’s hierarchy. And they do need to spend. The squad needs an overhaul, but with a £1.4 billion ($1.8bn) spend over the last 10 years, and little to show for it, there must be a rethink in strategy, as well as personnel. Paul Pogba is set to leave on a free transfer, Ronaldo will not hang around if there is no Champions League football, Edinson Cavani will depart and there are plenty of other squad players whose futures are up in the air. That list now includes Marcus Rashford, whose form is in a state of decline which shows no sign of abating. This is not a team who just need a couple of signings to finish off a rebuild; they need major investment, a new manager and a new direction. Their top two managerial targets for the permanent manager’s job are Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag - both of whom also saw their teams, Paris Saint-Germain and Ajax, respectively, eliminated from the Champions League at the last 16 stage. There still remains the question of whether either of them could get United back to where they need to be. Scholes does not believe that the next manager will make a difference immediately because of the current state of the club. “It will take at least two, three or four years until they’re challenging, and I’d snap your hand off for that now,” the former United midfielder said on BT Sport. “You saw [Manchester] City and Liverpool for a couple of years, you felt them coming. You knew they were coming and getting better and that they’d start challenging. “We’ve not had that for 10 years, and there’s no sign of it even getting closer to that. It feels like we’re going in the opposite direction. “It’s going to take the right man, and the next man might not be the right man, those people need to make sure it’s the right man.” The defeat to Atletico has not triggered a knee-jerk reaction from these former players. The performance on Tuesday was a culmination of a season’s worth of disappointments, which has seen the club out of all competitions before the end of March. United find themselves at yet another crossroads, and depending which route they take could be the deciding factor in whether they go another five years without a major honour.

Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford were replaced by Bruno Fernandes and Anthony Elanga in the starting line-up, while Scott McTominay returned from injury to start ahead of Nemanja Matic. Manchester United enter the tie level at 1-1. ""Well, to start with, it was also about fresh legs and also about, as I've said, playing with a high level of aggression and energy,"" Rangnick told BT Sport. ""And that is why I decided [to select] this starting XI."" On Elanga, who scored Manchester United's lone goal in the first leg, he said: ""Yes, [the first-leg goal helped], but this is not the only reason. It's also about verticality and about speed. ""We saw in the first leg this could be a major issue for us today."" Luke Shaw is the only player unavailable to Manchester United, as he's still dealing with Covid-19. Rashford has struggled throughout the season while Elanga has come on as a key attacking piece in recent months. Fernandes, of course, is considered one of the club's most important players. Pogba is high-profile too, so his exclusion is certainly notable, but he may be introduced as a substitute. McTominay has been Rangnick's first-choice over Matic when healthy. Given their struggles in the Premier League, it's vital for Manchester United to advance past Atletico Madrid in the last 16 in order to help salvage their season. They will be expected to do so playing at Old Trafford - but they've slipped up at home plenty of times this campaign. For permanent access to GOAL's Champions League newsletter, sign-up free here.

GOAL reported this week that United are considering ideas to upgrade the stadium and are even open to demolishing and completely rebuilding it on the same site. The club hope to modernise their home ground, but plans are still in the early stages and nothing is being ruled out. Neville gave his backing to the proposal to completely rebuild Old Trafford as he believes the club should always have one of the best football grounds in the world. ""There is a story emerging today from Old Trafford that they might be looking rebuild the entire stadium and I have just been asked what I think of it,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram. ""I actually think that it would be the right move. I think that by the time that they have spent money on Old Trafford, the existing one, then I think you would probably be better off building a brand new, super stadium. ""I do think that Manchester United should always be at the forefront of stadiums, best facilities and they have fallen behind."" Asked by Jamie Carragher if he would get behind the Glazers if they were to build a new stadium, Neville said: ""No, not particularly. I do think it's time for them to sell. I do think that they've, to be fair, overstayed their welcome. ""I think the fact that they said they would engage with the fans three, four, five months ago and they haven't done since is not good enough. I think it would be a breath of fresh air. ""But I do think the stadium needs redevelopment. It's fallen behind many other stadiums, not just in this country, but obviously in Europe and I do think they need to rebuild that stadium."" Old Trafford has served as United's home stadium for 112 years. It has already gone through several expansions since then and is currently the United Kingdom's largest club football stadium - only England's home stadium Wembley has a bigger capacity. GOAL reported on Monday that the option of tearing down the entire stadium and building a new one from scratch looks the least likely option. The club would rather upgrade Old Trafford in a way which would allow the team to continue playing their home games at the same place. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

United host Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford on Tuesday for the second leg of their last-16 tie in the competition. The two teams are tied at 1-1 on aggregate from the first fixture and Ronaldo is determined to keep their dream of winning the competition alive. Ronaldo wrote in a caption on Instagram: ""Tomorrow (Tuesday) is one of those days that we’ve all been waiting for. ""One of those chances to show the world the reason why Old Trafford is known as the Theatre of Dreams. ""Let’s recreate the amazing atmosphere that we saw in our last home game and let’s keep our Champions League dream alive! ""We are Man. United! Let’s do this together! Let’s go, Devils!"" Ronaldo was the key man as the Red Devils beat Tottenham 3-2 at Old Trafford on Saturday. The 37-year-old scored a hat-trick to ensure his side secured the three points and remain within touching distance of a place in the Premier League's top four. United boss Ralf Rangnick was asked if he can expect Ronaldo to be at his best once again when they meet Atletico so soon after playing more than 80 minutes against Spurs. Rangnick replied at a press conference: ""I’m not worried that he has not been able to recover. ""So far he’s always been a person who looks after himself and his body and he knows what to do. I’m not worried about that. ""If he can score another three we will see. It’s not so easy to score three against this team at all. ""His overall performance was good, if not even very good and this is what we hope to get from him again tomorrow (Tuesday) night. ""It’s not just about Cristiano, it’s about the whole team. We saw in the first half in Madrid what we shouldn’t do and how we should not play and this was obviously a big topic for us yesterday and today when we spoke about tomorrow’s game. ""We have to know what it takes and what it tactically takes and the rest is about energy. ""We had a team against Spurs that just wanted to win that game and it became obvious The supporters played a vital role because they realised how much we wanted to win that game and tomorrow will be similar.""

Man Utd & NFL stars' retirement conversation explained,"Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Brady set the sporting world aflame when the pair were spotted having a post-match chat following the former's winning hat-trick for Manchester United against Tottenham. Just over a day later, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback had announced a reversal in his decision to retire at the end of the 2021 NFL season, announcing he would be back for at least one more go around. But what exactly did one GOAT say to another - and why is Brady coming back? GOAL explains. After initially exchanging a hug, where Brady was heard to congratulate Ronaldo on his performance, the Portuguese asked one simple question to his fellow GOAT - ""You're finished, right?"" Brady was not heard to give a definitive answer but instead produced an apparent knowing smile. Just over 24 hours later, he had confirmed that he would lace up once more for the 2022 NFL season. 🐐 x 🐐 @Cristiano 🤝 @TomBrady #MUFC pic.twitter.com/GFTkJ8B84W Brady stated on social media that since hanging up his boots, he had come to decide that he still had more to give for Tampa Bay, and therefore committed to a U-turn in his plans. ""These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""That time will come. But it’s not now. ""I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business.""

491,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-hope-big-offer-will-convince-inter-to-sell-lukaku/sig4nwnnobz71i0p0b6wup1wp,Inter would consider Lukaku sale at €120m after rejecting Chelsea offer,"Inter could sell Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea if they receive an offer in the region of €120m(£102m/$142m) afterrejecting the Blues' bid of €100m (£85m/$118m), Goal can confirm. The Serie A champions decided to rebuff the offer, that also included Marcos Alonso heading in the opposite direction,as it fell short of their valuation of the forward, while they are not interested in a player exchange deal. Chelsea were hopeful that they couldcapitalise on Inter's financial difficulties by making a big offer for Lukaku, and the Nerazzurri would likely consider a sale at around the €120mmark. Lukaku said last week that he is  gearing up for the new season with the Italian champions after he returned to training, suggesting he wants to stay. Meanwhile, Inter CEO  Giuseppe Marotta has insisted that the forward will not be allowed to leave any time soon, saying: ""Lukaku is not for sale. Lukaku is an important piece on the chessboard available to Simone Inzaghi.” And while Lukaku is not expected to attempt to force a move as he is enjoying his time at San Siro, he is aware of Tuchel's project and appreciates their status as Champions League winners. The Stamford Bridge side are in the hunt for a new striker, having seen Olivier Giroud leave this summer. Chelsea already have Erling Haaland and Harry Kane on their list of targets, but Borussia Dortmund are not willing to sell the former during this transfer window and Tottenham are not letting their star man join their London rivals. Lukaku, 28, has blossomed into one of the world's top strikers in recent years. He scored 24 goals and registered 11 assists in Serie A last season as the Nerazzurri secured the league title. Only Cristiano Ronaldo scored more goals in the Italian top flight in 2020-21. Lukaku joined Chelsea from Anderlecht in 2011 but was unable to secure a place in the first team. He ended up joining West Brom on loan for a year in 2012 and then went to Everton a year later. Lukaku then joined the Toffees on a permanent deal, leaving Chelsea with just 15 competitive appearances to his name and no goals. The Blues are already trying to sign Jules Kounde from Sevilla ahead of the new season. They have been offering several players to the Spanish side in exchange for the defender. Kurt Zouma, Emerson Palmieri and Kenedy are among the names the Premier League side have floated by Sevilla. They aretrying to get rid of Zouma first to make room in the squad for Kounde, with West Ham also in talks to sign the French centre-back. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

492,https://www.goal.com/en/news/god-wanted-me-to-play-for-milan-giroud-chelsea/cr5zn5wehdv8174xe22emajge,'God wanted me to play for Milan' - Giroud explains decision to leave Chelsea,"Olivier Giroud has explained his decision to leave Chelsea, claiming ""God wanted me to play for Milan"". Giroud completed a €2 million switch from Chelsea to San Siro on July 17, committing his future to the Italian giants through to 2023. The France international is now eager to help Milan fight for success on both domestic and European fronts, having decided the time was right to embark on a new challenge in a different league after four years at Stamford Bridge. Giroud was officially presented as a new Rossoneriplayer on Monday, after scoringon his debut in a 1-1friendly draw with Nice at the weekend. “I won many trophies at every club I’ve been at and would like to do the same here,"" he said. ""I do have an objective in my mind, but I don’t want to reveal it, otherwise there’d be too much pressure. Let’s just say my final objective is to win with Milan. “The time had come to leave Chelsea and discover a new league. God wanted me to play for Milan. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I really believe in the project here. ""We’ve got what it takes to have a very good Champions League campaign.” Giroud has inherited the coveted No 9 shirt at Milan, which has proved to be something of a poisoned chalice for a number of highly-rated strikers since Fillipo Inzaghi's retirement in 2012.

The 34-year-old went on to insist that he can still deliver the goods in the final third despite his advancing years, citing new teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the perfect example of how to ensure longevity at the highest level. “My age means nothing,"" he added.""Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a few years older than me, but it’s all about your mentality.

Questions are being asked of how long theWales international midfielder will be sticking around in Turin. A return to the Premier League has been speculatedfor some timewith various landing spots mooted, and the Magpies have now joined the hunt. Goal understands that there is no shortage of interest in Ramsey from English football, and Newcastle have approached Juve in an effort to determine where the Serie A giants stand. For now, said discussions are very informal and no transfer talks have been entered into. That situation could change as the Bianconeri finalise their plans for 2021-22.  Juve have Ramsey tied to a contract through to 2023 and are under no pressure to sell. They have, however, seen a man snapped up as a free agent in 2019 enduremore injury issues while in Turin. Massimiliano Allegri is giving Ramsey every opportunity to prove his worth, and has asked him to fill a holding role in pre-season. He toldSport Mediaset when asked about Ramsey and supposed interest in taking Miralem Pjanic back to Italy from Barcelona: ""I don’t know about that. The club takes care of the transfer market, we talk every day. ""Ramsey played very, very well in front of the defence and I think in that role he can really become an important player. ""I salute Mire, because we spent four years together with great victories. He is a Barcelona player now, we have talented players, and I think if Ramsey can be convinced to play in front of the defence, he can really do well there. ""He already can see passing channels, has a good sense of the geometry of the field and can also rest on the ball more than he does up front."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Criticism has been directed at a five-time Ballon d'Or on the back of his decision to depart Italian football after three seasons that failed to deliver Champions League glory. Ronaldo has been accused of leaving Juve in the lurch, with a second stint at Old Trafford agreed late in the summer transfer window, but Buffon claims to have no issue with an all-time great dictating where and when he does things. Legendary goalkeeper Buffon, who worked with Ronaldo at Juve, has told Radio anch'io Sport: ""I don’t think the fans should be surprised. He has the reputation of a great professional who rightly thinks about himself a lot. ""In these three years he has contributed with great performances and scored many goals. I don’t see anything illogical in his choice to leave, he thought a lot about it. ""Juve are in a transition period, I don’t know if it’s generational or the skeleton. You pay a bit when these things happen. When you have a coach like [Massmiliano] Allegri, maybe you don’t reach the target, but you get close to it.""  Another of those to have made a high-profile move this summer is Gianluigi Donnarumma, with Italy's current No.1 leaving AC Milan as a free agent to link up with Paris Saint-Germain. The Euro 2020 winner has also come in for criticism, with accusations levelled at him of prioritising money over loyalty, and he is currently sat behind Keylor Navas in the pecking order at Parc des Princes. Buffon believes a talented 22-year-old will get his chance in time and can appreciate why a move to Ligue 1 heavyweights was made - with the 43-year-old taking in his own spell with PSG in 2018-19. He added: ""The choices of a lad, who is also a professional, must be respected. ""After years in which he has not played at certain stages, he has chosen to go and no one can comment on it. ""We are talking about a boy who has years and years left in his career, looking for the gratifications that I found. ""He was in a particular situation; Paris Saint-Germain have one of their strengths in goal and that’s why Keylor Navas is playing. ""I don’t think Gigio will have problems being a reference.""

495,https://www.goal.com/en/news/a-waste-of-ronaldos-time-and-juventus-money-agnellis-cr7-project-/1qqxksa7v4cdt1gf249lhcx27u,A waste of Ronaldo's time and Juventus' money: Agnelli's 'CR7 Project' was an abject failure,"Merely mentioning Cristiano Ronaldo's name is a perilous proposition. Even within the divisive and increasingly tribal world of football, the Portuguese polarises opinions like few other personalities. His followers are as passionate as they are plentiful.Any perceived slight is jumped upon by his staunchest supporters.Some are even willing to go so far as to seek out private social media accounts to personally insult the alleged perpetrator and his partner... It is important, then, to begin an analysis of Ronaldo's Juventus legacy with the following statement:Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest players of all time. That is beyond dispute.As he so often says himself, the numbers don't lie: he has scored 783 goals in senior football. But while his status as a living legend has long since been sealed, it is perfectly fair to question the success of his transfer to Turin. Remember, Juve president Andrea Agnelli admitted that for the first time in the club's history they had signed a player for more than sporting reasons. Commercial considerations had also played a significant role. Ronaldo did what he was paid to do, of course: score goals.In three seasons in Italy, he netted101 times in just 134 appearances. And he also delivered off the field. Before his €100 million (£86m/$117m) signing, Juve had just over 49 million followers across their social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram). That figure has now more than doubled (112.7m), and the resulting boom has, unsurprisingly, made the club far more attractive to investors. In January 2019, the Bianconeri signed a new, improved, seven-year sponsorship deal with their kit manufacturer, Adidas, worth €357m (£308m/$395m) – twice the value of the previous agreement – and that partnership has since been extended until 2026-27. In addition, Juve have benefited from a €28m (£21m/$30m) increase in the annual value of their contract with shirt sponsors JEEP, from €17m (£15m/$19m) to €45m.  This was 'The Ronaldo Effect' in action. Juve's profile has increased enormously due to its associationwith the 'CR7' brand. However, the Bianconeri still aren't even close to being the richest or most popular club on the planet. Ronaldo hasn't magically made all of Juve's dreams come true; and they didn't expect him to either. He was always viewed as a hugely significant stepping stone. The plan was always to use his enormous global appeal to propel the club to another level. As Agnelli explained at the time of his arrival from Real Madrid, the idea was that Juve would end up in a position where they would be able to sign the next Ronaldo at 23 – rather than 33. The acquisition of the much-coveted centre-half Matthijs de Ligt from Ajax two years ago bode well, but it was clear even before Covid-19 hit that Juve were living beyondtheir means. The club posted a €40m (£34m/$48m) loss at the end of Ronaldo's first season in Serie A. It was already clear that healone wasn't going to bridge the gap between the Bianconeri and Europe's elite. In October 2019, after asking the club's shareholders to approve a €300m (£340m/£260m) capital increase in October, Agnelli stated, ""These numbers seem enormous when compared to the Italian reality, but our point of reference is the great European clubs. ""Our current level of turnover, excluding the transfer of players, is about the level of turnover that Real Madrid had when I took over the presidency of Juventus in 2010. ""It is clear that the growth rates we have developed have been higher than those of Real Madrid but there is still a gap, which we must obviously fill."" But their desperation to close that gap to Europe's elite, coupled with a speculate-to-accumulate approach, was ruthlessly punished by the pandemic.   Any hope Juve had of the 'CR7 Project'realising its twin objectives –commercial growth and Champions League glory –were obliterated by the financial crisis caused by Covid-19, which resulted in losses of €113.7m (£97.4m/$134.1m)during the first half of last season alone. The Old Lady got off more lightly than others, primarily because of the continued support of EXOR –the holding company with a 63.8 per centstake in the Bianconeri –which has just invested a further €75m (£64m/$88m) ""to strengthen the equity and financial structure of the club pending the execution of"" another imminent capital increase, this time worth €400m (£340m/$470m). But, again, like every other major European club affected by pandemic, Juve only have themselves to blame for ending up in such a dire situation by relying on a fragile financial framework. They may have got desperately unlucky with the outbreak of a pandemic but the Old Lady essentially gambled €340m (£290m/$400m) on Ronaldo, in transfer fees and wages, and it hasn't paid off. In fact, in Champions League terms, Juve's returns were pathetic. They have failed to make it beyond the quarter-finals once since his arrival and it's not as if their runs were ended by theEuropean game's super heavyweights: Ajax, Lyon and Porto were their continental conquerors. Questions, then, began to be asked as to whether Ronaldo was worth the €87m (£74.5m/$103m) he was costing the club on an annual basis.The argument was that such a colossal amount of money wouldhave been better served strengthening the squad. Certainly, Juve were caught up in a vicious cycle: they were paying Ronaldo to win them the Champions League but his wages prevented them from surrounding him with the level of talent he required to fire them to glory. Nowhere was this more obvious than in midfield. But while Juve wanted either Paul Pogba or Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, they could afford neither. It was a similar story with goalkeeper Gigi Donnarumma, who was available on a free transfer this summer and willing to move from Milan to Turin. Juve, though, simply couldn't match the wages on offer at Paris Saint-Germain. Again, it is important to state: Juve's economic problems are not Ronaldo's fault. Nobody forced them to pay him a gross annual salary of €60m (£51m/$71m). Furthermore, it wasn't he who squandered millions in transfer fees and wages on the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Danilo and Arthur, or sanctioned the sales of Joao Cancelo, Leonardo Spinazzola or Moise Kean, who, rather damningly, could now return to Turin to replace Ronaldo. The blame for all of those disastrousdeals fallson former sporting director Fabio Paratici, who proved nowhere near as competent in the transfer market as mentor Beppe Marotta and paid for poor recruitment with his job.   He has since been replaced by Federico Cherubini, while Massimiliano Allegri has returned as coach, underlining that this is a time of transition at Juve, but also great change. They are trying to implement the overhaul that Allegri was requesting before being forced out in 2019. The brutal bottom line is that they have wasted the past two years. They made a mistake by firing Allegri, and compounded it by failing to give either Maurizio Sarri and, to a lesser degree, Andrea Pirlo sufficient time to implement their ambitious ideas. Ronaldo, then, could be forgiven for not wanting to partake inyet another rebuilding job at 36 years of age. Indeed, while he remains in excellent physical condition, he is running out of time at the very highest level and we are talking about a club that is undeniably further away from winning the Champions League than it was when he arrived in 2018. In a sportingsense, then, Juve's 'CR7 Project' cannot be considered anything but an abject failure.It has been terminated prematurely, one year before the end of his contract, and neither the player nor his employers have a Champions League trophy to show for their efforts. Worse still, their run of nine consecutive Serie A titles has been brought to a brutal end by bitter rivals Inter, with Juve finishing fourth last season. It is not in the least bit surprising, then, that the ruthless Ronaldo, one of the game's great competitors, felt his prospects of winning a sixth Champions League would be better served by a return to big-spending Manchester United. Juve, for their part, were willing to let him go– so long as they got the fee they needed to avoid making a capital loss on their investment–as it means that they can now focus fully on the future. This is an undeniablyunsatisfactory end to the Ronaldo-Juventus love affair, which started with a goal in Turin all the way back in the spring of 2018. Neither party really got what they wanted out of the relationship, so it now makes sense for them to go their separate ways. When the man himself was asked about his future in June, he replied, ""Whether I stay at Juventus or leave, whatever happens will be for the best."" And his exit now suits everyone concerned. Surely not even his staunchest supporters could argue with that?... Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Massimiliano Allegri is still on the lookout for his first win since returning to Juve for a second spell in the managerial hot seat, with Ante Rebic scoring a late equaliser for Milan to cancel out Alvaro Morata's second-minute opener in the battle between two Serie A heavyweights. The Bianconerislipped to 18th in the table as a result, eight points behind leaders and reigning champions Inter, and also reached a new defensive low after missing out on another clean sheet. Juve have now conceded one goal or more in 18 successive league matches - a run that stretches back to March 9 - which is currently the worst record in Europe's top five major leagues. The Italian giants are now only one game away from equalling their streak of 19 games without a clean sheetin 2010, and three away from matching their worst-ever run set back in 1955. Allegri is also now only the fourth Juventus coach to ever oversee a four-game winless streak at the start of a season, with the club failing to win the title on the other three occasions in 1942-43, 1955-56 and in 1961-62. 4 - La #Juventus non ha vinto nessuna delle prime quattro partite stagionali di Serie A per la quarta volta nella sua storia, dopo il 1961/62, 1955/56 e il 1942/43. Affanno.#SerieA #JuventusMilan #JuveMilan Allegri tried to take the positives from the final result against Milan, but did admit that Juve will struggle to regain the Scudetto if they don't cut out the regular mistakes at the back. “It was important to get a positive result and we did. A defeat would’ve not definitively left us behind Milan, but a big advantage, now it is easier to bridge,” he insisted. “The problem is that winning a game is one thing, winning a league is another, and that means not conceding goals due to errors like that. We can draw games if the other team does better, not if we give it away. “There were some positives, in other words the first half, but what makes me angry are the final 15 minutes. We should’ve suffered more, been ready to fight tooth and nail. At those moments, you can’t look at being aesthetically beautiful, you just take the result home, even if it’s ugly.” The Bianconeri now only have three days to pick themselves up before a must-win trip to Spezia, with a home fixture against Sampdoria set to follow on Sunday. Allegri will then prepare his players for their second Champions League group-stage outing against Chelsea, where they will be aiming to build on a 3-0 win at Malmo on matchday one.

Ronaldo scored late to seal a stunning 3-2 comeback for Man Utd, who took down Atalanta despite going down 2-0 in the first half. The legendary forward, who was joined on the scoresheet by Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire,has been criticised in recent weeks for his workrate and defensive effort, but Solskjaer says Wednesday's winner is indicative of just how good Ronaldo is. ""He had chances in the first half but Marcus kept on going,"" Solskajer told BT Sport. ""He got a knock but he is going to be very important for us. It was instinctive finish from Harry. I don't think you would have expected him to score that one. ""And Cristiano is great in front of goal. If anyone wants to criticise him for effort and work-rate just watch this game. Watch how he runs around."" Solskjaer went on to add: ""I was really, really pleased with how [Ronaldo] led the line. Run the channels, drop in, press more, we wanna get the crowd behind us. ""He was down inside his own six-yard box at the end, you see him sprinting, he did everything a centre-forward should do. And the goal is what he does better than most."" Ronaldo rejoined Man Utd this summer, returning to Old Trafford after originally leaving to join Real Madrid in 2009. He's scored six goals in eight games since the move, with three of those goals coming in Man Utd's three Champions League matches.

498,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-solskjaer-and-man-utd-hit-back-at-critics-with-yet/15efvz3zpsyh81pzj1toztyj6h,"Ronaldo, Solskjaer and Man Utd respond to critics with yet another sensational comeback against Atalanta","Manchester United have been criticised for lacking identity in their play in recent weeks but if there is one thing that characterises Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, it is grabbing an unlikely victory when the odds are stacked against them. When it comes to 'get out of jail free' cards, the Norwegian must have a stack in reserve to cash in when times are getting tough. But, when you’ve got Cristiano Ronaldo in your ranks, there is always that possibility that defeat can be turned into victory. Both he and his manager had come under intense scrutiny after last weekend's dreadful 4-2 defeat at Leicester but it was,of course, the Portugal international who popped up with atrademark headerin the 81stminute to complete the kind of dramatic comebackthat those who have been coming to Old Trafford for years have grownaccustomed to watching. The 36-year-old fist-pumped the air towards the Stretford End as he walked off at the end of this absorbing 3-2 win over Atalanta, cutting a far differentfigure to the one that headeddown the tunnel at half-time. The victory has given Uniteda lifeline in the Champions League when, for 45 minutes at least, they looked to be down and out. Indeed, they spent much of the evening rooted to the bottom of Group F but, by the end,they were top. Still,much like that dramatic win against Villarreal a few weeks ago, it is a result that papers over the cracks. United did play better against Gian Piero Gasperini’s side and created enough chances to win– they had22 shots to Atalanta’s 13–but again, it was a performance that led to further questions of Solskjaer’s team. For starters, how can a team thathas a specialist set-piece coachconsistently concede from dead-ball situations? It's baffling. Comeback: Complete ☑️Next up: Liverpool 👀  pic.twitter.com/ZP5X4rkVRU Having already been far too easily opened up for Mario Pasalic's close-range opener from a Davide Zappacosta cut-back,Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and David de Gea were all culpable as Merih Demiral headed home a corner. Marcus Rashford had spoken before the game about the need to go back to basics yet it seems they don't even know the basics of defending set-pieces. Credit where it is due, though, Uniteddeserved the three points which eventually came their way. Their heads looked to have totally dropped as they went 2-0 down to arguably their toughest opponents in Group Fand they were met with a smattering of boos as they walked off the pitch at half time. However, whatever was said in the dressing room worked wonders. In many ways, Bruno Fernandes personifies United's up-and-down form right now. His first-half display was poor, a shadow of what he is capable of, but he orchestrated United's stirring fightback, creating goals for bothRashford and Maguire. His second assist may have beenfortunate, with his cross somehow finding its way to Maguire at the back post, but his first was genius.  Fernandes produced a perfectly measured, defence-splitting pass which was clinically finished by the previously wasteful Rashford, who has now scored seven goals in his last seven Champions League group-stage games. It set United on their way to three unlikely points and when Solskjaer talks about United DNA, these areexactly the sort of performances he means, those full of desire and perseverance. But how often can they keep turning things around after making life so difficult for themselves? Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday will certainly be a tougher assignment than this, given Atalanta played in a way which accommodated United’s forward play, in that they gave their hoststhe space they wanted to create chances. It’s hard to imagine Jurgen Klopp’s side affording them so much room and time. As United legend Paul Scholes said on  BT Sport  afterwards, ""I get all the excitement but that first half I just didn't enjoy it and I think that first half put me off the second. I think if they were playing a better team they'd be out of sight. That first half was worrying. It looked anything but a team, it lacked unity and that was a worrying sign. ""Can they play Liverpool like that? Never in a million years. Can you play Manchester City like that? Can you play a top Champions League team like that? I don't want to sound like a party pooper but that first half was a major worry for me."" Scholes' concerns are valid but the euphoria that greeted the full-time whistle at Old Trafford represented a welcome release for both the fans, the players and their under-pressure manager. Solskjaer had asked for a reaction from his team. This wasn’t entirely what he was after but it is a start. They certainly don't lack fighting spirit but whether that will sustain them through the more difficult fixtures ahead remains to be seen. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

499,https://www.goal.com/en/news/southgate-sterling-silence-doubters-england-germany-wembley/fp7cshaae0qx111rslyn180pm,Show Sterling and Southgate some respect! England silence critics with deserved win over Germany,"England 2-0 Germany: Match Statistics Gareth Southgate has faced a barrage of criticism for his decisions at Euro 2020,not least for persisting with Raheem Sterlingwhen England have so many other attacking talents. The Three Lions managermust have felt fully vindicated whenthe Manchester City forward repaid hisfaith by netting his third goal of Euro 2020 in Tuesday night's 2-0 win over Germany before a raucous crowd atWembley. Many fans had been calling for Jack Grealish, Phil Foden or Jadon Sancho to take Sterling's place on the left wing but, once again, it was the latter who made the breakthrough when England needed him most. Sterling didn't just finish the move, either. It was he who made a driving run through the middle which ended with him tapping home a low cross from Luke Shaw with just 15 minutes remaining in this last-16 clash. Harry Kane's late header from a Grealish cross ensured that someone other than Sterling would get on the scoresheet for England for the first time at this tournament, which would have only made Southgate feel even better for sticking with his struggling centre-forward. England had Germany's profligate forwards to thank for registering their fourth consecutive clean sheet at the Euros.Timo Werner shot straight at Jordan Pickford when put through on goal by Kai Havertz in the first half, before Thomas Muller missed an even more straightforward one-on-one just moments after Sterling's opener. However, Southgate's decision to play a 3-4-3 formation– one similar to that of Germany– paid off, with England taking control of the contest after a slow start. Such games are often decided by big players and Sterlingmade the difference. Not that that should come as a surprise. Granted, he finished his club campaign out of form and on a low, with City beaten by Chelsea in last month's Champions League final, but Sterling's value has continued to rise with England, for whohe has now scored 15 times in his last 20 appearances.  He is an inspiration, not only to a younger generation of fans but also the more inexperienced members of the dressing room, with the 26-year-old having emerged as a mentorfor Sancho and Foden. Bizarrelyhe remains underappreciated by many, but he is underlining his importance to the England cause with his performances at a stadium located in the same area in which he grew up. It's a timely return to form. He hasjust a year left on his contract with City and speculation is mounting that he will be sacrificed if his employers manage to sign two of his England colleagues, Kane and Grealish, this summer. However, if Pep Guardiola now considers Sterling expendable, hopefully all of England is now realising just how important he is to the national team. As midfielder Declan Rice told the BBC after the game,“Raheem Sterling is proving so many people wrong."" Just like Southgate. The England boss has faced mounting criticism for a conservative style of play which yielded just two goals during the group stage. There was an undeniable fear that the Three Lions would bow meekly out of the tournament without having utilised the full power of their attacking arsenal. Southgate has remained resolute, though, just like his team. He has ignored all of the social media attacks and booing of his substitutions at Wembley. He also has the backing of the Football Associationregardless of what happens in this tournament, having modernised England behind the scenes, but he wants to be judged on results, which is why this latest win was just so significant for the manager and his players. They are all united and fully believe in Southgate's approach. It is not producing free-flowing football but England have reachedthe quarter-finals of the European Championship without conceding a goal and are now brimming with belief after a deserved win over great rivals Germany. Is 'Football coming home'? It's still too early to say–but it's definitely high time the doubters showed Southgate and Sterling some respect. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

501,https://www.goal.com/en/news/prolific-ronaldo-lazio-legend-immobile-deserves-more-respect/blt223fd58fe7bd5985,As prolific as Ronaldo: Why Lazio legend Immobile feels he deserves more respect,"Ahead of Lazio's Serie A clash with Juventus last November, club president Claudio Lotito presented Ciro Immobile with a framed jersey to commemorate the striker becoming the Romans' all-time leading goalscorer. In recognition of his historic haul, the number 160 was emblazoned on the back of the special-edition shirt, just below the words 'The King'. Immobile managed to keep his emotions in check during the presentation but as he made his way back to the dressing room, he looked towards the Curva Nord and saw one giant banner sporting an image of his face, and another which read 'Welcome to History'. Tears began to well in Immobile's eyes. And it was easy to understand why: achieving legendary status has been anything but easy. Just a couple of months before, Immobile had been racked with self-doubt. He had begun the season in fine form, netting six times in his first five Serie A appearances, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't quite suited to Maurizio Sarri's style of play. Lazio's performances at that point were disjointed and inconsistent, and Immobile asked the newly appointed coach, ""Am I a problem for the team?"" Sarri said no and assured him that he would adapt his tactics to Immobile's strengths. As he told Sky Sport Italia last month, ""This is a team with a centre-forward who scores over 30 goals per season, so we have to build around his characteristics. There’s no point avoiding that."" 👑 @ciroimmobile premiato dal Presidente Lotito per esser diventato il miglior marcatore nella storia del Club! #CMonEagles 🦅 pic.twitter.com/R9AXipADvA That approach is reaping dividends, with Lazio having picked up 17 points from their last eight games to climb from eighth to fifth in the Serie A standings ahead of this weekend's derby against sixth-placed Roma. The Biancocelesti's rise has been founded upon greater solidity at the back but Immobile is still scoring goals. Indeed, his winner from the penalty spot against Venezia on Monday night gave him the outright lead over Dusan Vlahovic in the race for this season's capocannoniere award. It also saw Immobile become Lazio's all-time leading scorer in Serie A, moving him one ahead of previous record holder Silvio Piola. Perhaps even more interestingly, he has now scored as many league goals (144) as Cristiano Ronaldo since joining Lazio from Borussia Dortmund in 2016, while only Robert Lewandowski (185) and Lionel Messi (164) have struck more times across Europe's 'Big Five' championships over the past six years. It's also worth pointing out that he has a better shot conversion rate (20 per cent) than both Messi (17.05%) and Ronaldo (14.68%) during the same timeframe, and converted a greater share of his 'big chances' (52.04%) than even Lewandowski (47.68). Yet Immobile's name is never mentioned in debates over the best strikers of the modern era. Part of that, of course, is down to his poor record at international level: 15 goals in 54 appearances for Italy. On two separate occasions, he has gone two years without finding the back of the net for his country. 144 - Since he joined Lazio (2016/17), Ciro #Immobile has scored 144 goals in Serie A: as many as Cristiano Ronaldo in the Big-5 European Leagues in the period and fewer only than Messi (164) and Lewandowski (185). Uncontainable.#LazioVenezia pic.twitter.com/AT3eIT7DZe Immobile struck twice during the group stage of Italy's Euro 2020 triumph but, in England at least, his campaign is probably best remembered for his 'simulation' during the last-16 win over Belgium. The widely held belief is that the Azzurri won the tournament without a world-class striker, and that argument has only been strengthened by the team's subsequent failure to secure automatic qualification for this year's World Cup. Despite dominating their final two group games, against Switzerland and Northern Ireland, Italy were held to consecutive draws and must now navigate a play-off bracket that also features Portugal in order to make it to Qatar. Immobile has, thus, borne the brunt of the criticism and he freely admits it has upset him. ""I can’t deny that I struggle sometimes,"" he told reporters in November. ""My figures [with Italy] are not the same as the ones at Lazio, but it’s impossible to have the same. ""We only play seven-to-eight games a year with the national team. I’d like to score the same amount of goals. ""But I don’t get the same treatment as others and, sometimes, it seemed that I wasn’t part of the team that won the Euros."" Indeed, Mancini even felt compelled to remind the Immobile last September, ""You are a European champion. You don't need to prove anything."" He certainly doesn't need to prove anything to anyone at the Stadio Olimpico. Lazio fans idolise Immobile and their Roma counterparts respect him. In fact, he admitted earlier this week that some Giallorossi supporters had even been begging him not to play on Sunday night. Ciro Immobile becomes Lazio's top goalscorer EVER with his 160th goal! 🇮🇹 pic.twitter.com/5Ozrey3D9k What's clear from looking at Immobile's career is that when he feels important, like a key player in any team, he scores freely. For example, at Borussia Dortmund, he felt he was given little help settling in off the field, and thus struggled on it, admitting that the perceived lack of support from the club played a part in him buckling under the pressure of replacing Lewandowski, who had just left for Bayern Munich. There were tactical and stylistic issues at Sevilla, meanwhile, and he left the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan after just six months, 15 appearances and four goals, returning to Torino, where he kick-started his career. What he has since achieved at Lazio certainly deserves respect. Despite not playing for one of Serie A's strongest sides, he has been crowned capocannoniere twice, to take his overall tally to three, having previously finished as top scorer with Torino in 2013-14, and even claimed the European Golden Shoe in 2020 after equalling Gonzalo Higuain's single-season record for Serie A goals (36). He's not made any secret of the fact that his primary objective now is ensuring he's ""Italy's starting striker at the World Cup"". His critics will argue that the Azzurri might not even make it to Qatar if they have to rely on the 32-year-old to fire them past North Macedonia and Portugal or Turkey in the upcoming play-offs. Immobile, though, is by his own admission as ""stubborn"" as they come. He's been written off umpteen times in his career and yet he still keeps scoring. And Sunday night's derby offers another excellent opportunity for the king of Rome to prove that he could belatedly become the saviour of Italy. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Euro 2020 champions went down to a late defeat in Palermo to bow out of the running for Qatar. It is the second consecutive World Cup finals the Azzurri will miss, the first time in their history that has occurred. Jorginho, usually one of football's most assured spot-kick practicioners, erred twice in as many matches against Switzerland during the first round of qualifying, depriving Italy of two wins that would have seen them take first place ahead of their neighbours in Group C. “It hurts when I think about it, because I do still think about it and it will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" the Chelsea midfielder told RAI Sport. ""Stepping up there twice and not being able to help your team and your country is something that I will carry with me forever, and it weighs on me. “People say we need to lift our heads and carry on, but it’s tough.” Italy became on Thursday the first reigning European champion to miss out on the World Cup since Greece in 2006 and Jorginho, one of the heroes of their Euro 2020 triumph, admits that it will take time to recover from such a blow. “It is hard to explain what happened,” he added. “It hurts so much. I’ll be honest, I am still incredulous. I don’t think we lacked creativity, as we always dominated matches and created so many chances. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish them off. “We played good football, we won the European Championship last summer, but unfortunately in the last few games we made small errors and were unable to recover from them. They made the difference.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

503,https://www.goal.com/en/news/mancini-unsure-on-future-after-italy-lose-to-north-macedonia-and-/bltf8eabd10a5ff70a4,Mancini unsure on future after Italy lose to North Macedonia and miss out on 2022 World Cup,"Roberto Mancini has admitted to being unsure about his future as Italy head coach after seeing his side lose to North Macedonia and miss out on a place at the 2022 World Cup. Euro 2020 champions Italy came into the qualification play-off semi-final clash at the Stadio Renzo Barbera as overwhelming favourites, but ended up being the victims of a huge upset that will live long in the memory. Aleksandar Trajkovski fired home a stunning stoppage-time winner for North Macedonia, who had barely had a sight of goal over the previous 90 minutes, leaving Mancini with his head in his hands on the touchline. Mancini signed a new-four year contract extension with Italy following their triumph at last summer's European Championship, but he is no longer certain about his position at the helm. The 57-year-old says a period of reflection will first be necessary before any decision on his future in the dugout is made. ""We will see. Now I feel too disappointed to speak about my future, we will see,"" Mancini told Rai Sport post-match. “I’m sure this team has a great future. I’m supporting these players now more than ever."" Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini added: ""We're hugely disappointed. We played well but a goal was missing. I'm proud of my teammates. We're devastated. I hope that Mancini will remain."" Chiellini was also asked if he now plans to retire from international football, to which he replied: ""This isn't the right time to say if I've played my last game for Italy."" Italy dominated possession against North Macedonia and recorded 32 shots over the course of the game to their opponents' four, but only managed to hit the target five times. The hosts squandered a number of clear openings before Trajkovski landed a sucker-punch blow, but Mancini has jumped to the defence of his players. The Azzurri boss still believes in his squad and doesn't think that the final result was a true reflection of their performance. ""I think that if last July was the best thing I had professionally, I think this is the biggest disappointment,"" said Mancini. ""You can't say anything. This is football. Sometimes incredible things happen and tonight it's It happened. ""Maybe we shouldn't have been there, but we did everything to try to win. It is difficult to comment on this match, with a goal that arrived after the 90th minute without conceding anything else. ""This is a group with great players and I'm sorry because we didn't deserve it. Now it is too early to talk about the future, we still have to digest this defeat. ""I think that the victory of the European Championship was deserved, then luck turned into total bad luck. ""On a human level, I can say that I love the boys more tonight than in July. It is a time of great difficulty and therefore my affection is even greater."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The United States men's national team midfielder was not expected to play again this term after fracturing two metatarsal bones. However, he is aiming to play again in the coming weeks after making good progress in his recovery. Speaking to CBS Sports, McKennie said: ""When I speak in terms of being back in April, in my head I would assume that would mean at minimum training fully with the squad. ""Obviously there's many factors in play here, many things I still have to overcome. But that's my goal right now, and based on how I'm progressing it seems pretty realistic. ""The ideal journey for me right now is to be back by April, play a couple of games before the season ends, and fly straight over to the Nations League."" McKennie has not played since February 23, when he was injured in the final minutes of Juve's Champions League round-of-16 first-leg clash with Villarreal. The Turin side have eight Serie A games left this season plus a two-legged Coppa Italia semi final against Fiorentina, with McKennie aiming to play at least some part. Beyond that, he is aiming to play for the USMNT as they aim to defend their CONCACAF Nations League title. The competition begins this summer, with the first four matchdays taking place from June 2 to 14, before concluding in 2023. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

505,https://www.goal.com/en/news/new-elements-mbappe-mistake-staying-psg-huge-changes/blt37a95de22b3fa258,'New elements'? Mbappe would be making a major mistake staying at PSG without huge changes,"Though Karim Benzema might now be the heavy favourite to win the 2022 Ballon d'Or, over the past fortnight, Kylian Mbappe has yet again shown why he is regarded by many as the best footballer on the planet. In his last two matches for club and country, he has provided eight direct goal contributions. With France, he scored two and created one against South Africa, and then followed that up with Paris Saint-Germain by netting a double and completing a hat-trick of assists against Lorient. Critics will point to the modest standard of opponent in each game, but the performances of Mbappe were, nonetheless, spectacular, and a goal or an assist in each of PSG’s eight Champions League fixtures this season negates the notion that he might be a flat-track bully. Indeed, the clamour for news over his future is proof enough over his on-field value. For months, what Mbappe will do at the end of the season has been the subject of rabid speculation. Out of contract on June 31, the 23-year-old is destined to become the game’s most eligible free agent for years – arguably ever. Real Madrid have appeared to be in front in the race for the France international since the beginning of the season, yet in recent days there has been a subtle change of momentum. “I haven’t made my decision, there are new elements to consider. Which elements? Just new elements,” Mbappe told the media after his stunning display against Lorient. “I’m calm, I am trying to make the best possible decision together with my family. ""Had I made that decision I would’ve said it and embraced it. I always do that; I don’t need to hide. I just want to make the best decision I possibly can.” These comments arrived soon after the French press broke the news that PSG are willing to make him the figurehead and captain of the team going into the next stage of their project, which is at a major juncture given the nature of their Champions League loss to Madrid and also the uncertainty over Mbappe’s future. PSG, it has become obvious, cannot do without Mbappe. He may play alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar at the forefront of their attack, but the hierarchy in the front three is obvious to anyone who has spent much time watching them this season: the Frenchman is head and shoulders above those around him. The Parc des Princes outfit will move heaven and earth to keep the forward, which may be the “elements” that Mbappe referred to last weekend. Although he left this statement deliberately ambiguous, it is likely to be more than simply being handed the armband. Bigger moves could be at play, such as the ousting of sporting director Leonardo, whose performance has finally come under serious scrutiny. Perhaps PSG might even be closing in on Mbappe’s good friend Paul Pogba, whose presence may be enough to give him reason for further consideration over his future. Certainly, if there is not a seismic shift in PSG’s project this summer, Mbappe would be making a mistake in re-signing for the club. Their haphazard transfer policy has been well documented, while their lack of mental fortitude continues as a source of chronic embarrassment on the biggest stage. PSG, after all, had their collective foot on the necks of Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, and yet it is Carlo Ancelotti’s side who now stand on the brink of reaching the semi-finals. History can be overplayed when players have big decisions to make in their careers, yet PSG’s trend of catastrophe has become an alarming one and Mbappe should not allow himself to be sucked into that vacuum of failure. There are risks associated with going to Real Madrid, too, though. With Vinicius Junior and Benzema occupying his favoured roles on the left and centre, respectively, Mbappe faces the prospect of being shunted out to the right – a position he has not played regularly since his early days at Monaco. Perhaps it might be a wise decision, then, to spend another 12 months in Paris to cement his legacy at his hometown club – likely becoming their all-time leading scorer – and then move to Santiago Bernabeu when one of his favoured roles opens. Mbappe, having barely turned 23, has the luxury of time on his side. Nevertheless, the decision he makes in the weeks ahead is one that will affect the remainder of his life – both professionally and personally. It is one that he is clearly assessing carefully.

506,https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-tactical-fouling-football/i8qlq4e2hxqc1v7rs3f0udfq9,Explained: What is tactical fouling in football?,"Tactical fouling has been frowned upon by managers in football, with figures in the industry describing it as an unfair technique. But what exactly is tactical fouling, how is it used and is it officially illegal? Goal takes a look. Tactical fouling happens when a team loses the ball in the opponent's half and, before the counter-attack is even launched, commits a foul to immediately stop play. The referee then awards the team given the opportunity to counter-attack with a free kick, to be taken where the foul was committed– nowhere near the threat of goal – while the player who committed the tactical foul is punished with a card. It can be a yellow or red card depending on where the foul occurs. Tactical fouling is usually committed by attack-minded teams who drive players forward, leaving them potentially vulnerable in defence. Then, before the team gets to counter-attack with the ball that has been given away, a tactical foul stops the momentum and slows down the game, abandoning the counter-attack. It reduces the chance of a player giving away a penalty or receiving a red card when they attempt to clear the ball or quell the counter-attack inside the box. Former West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has accused Manchester City of committing tactical fouls, after his side were defeated 5-0 at the London Stadium in August. ""Every time we tried to arrive in their box they committed fouls, 13 to our five,"" Pellegrini said at the time. ""I think we were a little bit innocent. We must be intelligent to know when to use tactical fouling. If you review the game today, the reason we didn't create too many chances was because all of our offensive ways of attacking resulted in a foul."" Rodri also spoke about using tactical fouling as a method to suppress the counter-attack, telling ESPN FC: ""We have lots of offensive players and many other teams try to counterattack you and a lot of the time you're alone but it's good for me. ""I am learning new things, how to go, when to stay, when I have to do a tactical foul, when I have to jump. It's good for me to learn these things. And for the team it's good because we need those offensive players to be able to play our game."" After Guardiola accused Liverpool forward Sadio Mane of diving, Jurgen Klopp retorted with his thoughts on Man City's tactical fouling. “I couldn’t really believe it to be honest and then I saw it,"" the German manager told reporters when he read Guardiola's comments.“I am not sure if Pep spoke in that moment about Sadio or the team – both is not too nice to be honest. I am not too sure if I want to put oil on the fire. I am not interested in these kind of things. “And I promise not to mention tactical fouls. That is maybe already too much, but that is the only thing I say about it.” Guardiola has denied that he tells his side to prioritise the tactical foul, saying in 2018: ""We are a team that try to play and, of course, when there is a counter-attack sometimes the contact, the action is a foul but as a team we don’t think about that. “Never have my teams been focused on doing something wrong against the opponents. Sometimes situations happen but we are a team that always try to attack, to defend well, to try to play our game but never having to think about making actions like that. Brendan Rodgers' Leicester side, who have contended the 2019-20 season as Premier League title challengers, have also mastered the art of the tactical foul. There is no set rule against tactical fouling, and though it may be frowned upon by managers or teams who have been on the receiving end of it, they are not illegal. However, as with any foul, a punishment is nevertheless meted out. As mentioned before, players who commit such fouls are often given a yellow card, with the other team awarded a free-kick in the midfield – not a dangerous area to score from.

The veteran forward returned to Old Trafford last summer but has struggled to fire them back to their former glories, with the club set for another season without silverware. Much of the blame has been directed towards Red Devils skipper Maguire, who leads the team over Portugal captain Ronaldo, and Bayern Munich and Canada star Davies admits he cannot believe the centre-back is the man who calls the shots. ""Can you guys imagine [that] you're Ronaldo, right?"" Davies asked his followers on his Twitch channel. ""One of the greatest players ever, in the 21st century. ""Harry Maguire is your captain. You refer to him as captain – I don't know what he says to him."" The left-back added: ""I'm not dissing Harry Maguire, but Ronaldo should get the armband, man."" This is not the first time the decision to hand Maguire the captaincy at Old Trafford has made headlines. Indeed, there were reports of a rift in the United camp, with the Daily Mirror having reported that there was a ""power struggle"" taking place. England defender Maguire denied the report on social media back in February, while Ralf Rangnick has continued to support his skipper, despite his below-par performances in the 2021-22 campaign. It seems unlikely that United will now change their captain before the end of the season, although the new manager at Old Trafford, who could well be Erik ten Hag, may have other ideas.

Rakitic and Modric formed the midfield that helped Croatia to the World Cup final, where they ultimately lost to France. The Real star subsequently won the UEFA Player of the Year award  , having also helped Real to Champions League glory, leading to criticism from a number of pundits. Indeed, Cristiano Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes,  felt that the decision was ""shameful"" in the way that it snubbed his client  , now at Juventus. Rakitic, though, says that Modric is on another level, and has issued a firm rebuttal to those who are ""jealous"". ""Luka is now La Liga's big gun, he is the best player in the world this year and we Croats are very proud of him,"" he told  Novi list  . ""I wish him that last prize that is left for him to win [the Ballon d'Or]because he absolutely deserves it. ""Those that are jealous of Luka, let them die in their jealousy! I am proud of him and as happy as if I was winning those awards! ""We've been together in national team for 11 years, went through a lot, I love him as my brother. I am happy he decided to stay in national team, I don't know what my decision would have been if he retired."" Rakitic admits that he considered retirement following the success of their historic World Cup run, but he says he listened to his heart. ""Yes, I did consider retiring from Croatia, I thought a lot, spoke to my coach, even more to my wife, only to realise my wish to play for Croatia was stronger than anything else, it was hard to say goodbye. ""My heart decided. There is no greater motive in the world but to play for Croatia and put your hand on your heart as you hear your national anthem! So I can't wait to join the team in Elche for the Spain game."" A number of Croatia's players are now in their thirties, but Rakitic insists that there should not be any pressure on the next generation.""Croatia still has great young players but we shouldn't put pressure on them to replace Mandzukic, Subasic and Corluka immediately,"" he added. ""Of course they will be missed, but we have to let those young talents write their own story with Croatia."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.
