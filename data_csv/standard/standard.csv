Premier League match stream, latest team news, lineups, TV, prediction today","est Ham vs Burnley LIVE! West Ham turn their focus back to the Premier League this afternoon when they welcome Burnley to the London Stadium. Less than 72 hours after after David Moyes’ side blew Lyon away in France to reach the Europa League semi-finals, they must now ensure there is no drop intensity after such a historic result. Victory over the Clarets would lift West Ham into fifth, just three points behind Tottenham though they would have played a game more than Antonio Conte’s team. For Burnley, they will be without Sean Dyche in the dugout for the first time in almost a decade. Dyche was sacked in the build-up to this match, having been the league’s longest serving manager. With just eight matches remaining and Burnley four points adrift of safety, it’s starting to become now or never for their survival bid. Kick-off is at 2:15pm at the London Stadium - follow all the action with Standard Sport’s LIVE blog below... How long will Mike Jackson be caretaker boss at Burnley? It’s not a question he’s too keen to engage with... “I have been asked to take charge of this game,” Jackson said. “I’m not being disrespectful, I couldn’t care less about the rest.” David Moyes says he wants his West Ham players to believe that they are favourites to win the Europa League. The Hammers have reached the semi-finals in remarkable fashion after beating Lyon 3-0 away from home in the second leg of their quarter-final. “We’re not favourites [to win it], but I want the players to think they are,” said Moyes. He added: “It is huge what we have done in two years. We have not won any trophies yet but we are trying to compete and to qualify from European football again, if we can. To be getting to these later stages, we have beaten big clubs that are used to European football.” So three changes for West Ham. Fabianski returns in goal as expected, with Cresswell also back in the side as Coufal misses out. Vlasic also gets a start, with Fornals dropping to the bench. Cork and McNeil return for Burnley, as Jackson makes two changes in his first match in charge. Starting XI: Pope, Collins, Tarkowski, Taylor, Lowton, McNeil, Cornet, Cork, Westwood, Rodriguez, Weghorst Subs: Stephens, Roberts, Lennon, Hennessey, Long, Brownhill, Barnes, Vydra, Bardsley Starting XI: Fabianski, Johnson, Diop, Dawson, Cresswell, Rice, Soucek, Bowen, Lanzini, Vlasic, Antonio Subs: Areola, Fredericks, Coufal, Noble, Kral, Masuaku, Benrahma, Fornals, Yarmolenko Team news coming up in about ten minutes. Will be interesting to see what Moyes opts to do. Will be some tired legs after Thursday night, so could we see a rotated Hammers side? Big decisions for caretaker boss Jackson too - he hasn’t got much time to turn Burnley’s woes around. Michail Antonio hasn’t scored in his last nine West Ham appearances. It’s 12 without a goal in the Premier League, with his only goal of 2022 coming on New Year’s Day. Maybe a match against Burnley will bring him back to form... Much of West Ham’s focus for the rest of the season will be on their European adventure, with that seemingly their best chance of securing Champions League football next season. But in terms of their domestic ambitions, yesterday was a good afternoon for the Hammers. With Tottenham and Arsenal both losing, they can close the gap today. Victory over Burnley would lift West Ham into fifth, just three behind Spurs though they would have played a game more. ",positive,liverpool,0

Jurgen Klopp’s brilliant Reds inflicted all their damage in a thoroughly one-sided first half in the second dramatic meeting between English football’s two leading clubs in six days, with centre-back Ibrahima Konate rising highest to power home his third goal in as many matches from an Andy Robertson corner inside 10 minutes. Man of the match Sadio Mane then notched a decisive brace, first sliding in to double the advantage after a dreadful error from City goalkeeper Zack Steffen, starting in place of usual No1 Ederson - who escaped from a similar situation in last weekend’s pulsating 2-2 Premier League draw at the Etihad Stadium. Steffen simply took too long to try and pick a pass after the ball was sent back harmlessly by defender John Stones and was left embarrassed after Mane was quickly able to close the angle and slide in to score. Mane’s spinning volley on the stroke of half-time after a delicious ball from Thiago Alcantara looked to have ended the match as a contest, with Liverpool simply irresistible and their opponents - who surprisingly made five changes from last week’s meeting - in utter disarray after producing one of their worst halves under Pep Guardiola. However, Jack Grealish struck within two minutes of the restart after fine work from Gabriel Jesus to give City hope of an unlikely comeback to keep their treble bid intact. Liverpool regained control thereafter and were confidently seeing the game out until Bernardo Silva’s close-range finish in the first minute of stoppage time set up a grandstand end to proceedings, in which Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling all had real chances to force a period of extra time. But ultimately Carabao Cup winners Liverpool held on to book another return to Wembley on May 14, when they will face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet in an all-London last-four clash on Sunday afternoon. It is the third time they have reached both domestic cup finals in the same season, having also achieved the feat in 2000-01 and 2011-12. It will be Liverpool’s 15th appearance in English football’s showpiece fixture overall and first since 2012, when they lost 2-1 to Chelsea. Liverpool have not lifted the trophy since beating West Ham on penalties in Cardiff in 2006. Saturday’s semi-final was overshadowed by a small section of City fans who disrupted a pre-match minute of silence in memory of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, leading to the tribute being cut short and an apology being issued by City during the match.

Both teams come into the game with recent setbacks on otherwise encouraging runs of form, as well as relatively recent experience of appearing at Wembley. Real Madrid knocked Chelsea out of the Champions League in midweek, making this their final chance of a third trophy this season after the European Super Cup and Club World Cup. Up against last year’s losing finalists are Patrick Vieira’s, who reached the FA Cup final in 2016 and have enjoyed a solid first year under the French manager and his squad brimmed with youthful talent. Wembley has been an unhappy hunting ground for Chelsea in recent times. From back-to-back FA Cup final defeats, to the Carabao Cup penalty shoot-out heartbreak against Liverpool, they have endured misery on this stage. But Tuchel will do well to remind them of their successes, not least back-to-back FA Cup semi-final wins here, with the chance now to make it a hat-trick. It would be disrespectful to call Palace a one-man team, but there is no doubt who will spark most fear into Chelsea’s star-studded line-up. Wilfried Zaha has not had enough opportunities in his career to stand out on the biggest stage, but at Wembley he has the opportunity to further enhance his reputation by seizing the occasion. A Wembley semi-final should be the perfect opportunity to focus Chelsea minds after the emotion of Tuesday night. The disappointment of going out of the Champions League to Real Madrid in such cruel circumstances at the Bernabeu will live with Tuchel’s side for some time yet. But the season is not over and there is still the chance to put some added shine on it. ",positive,liverpool,1

Defeat to Southampton means they have now lost three Premier League games in a row and, after starting this international break in fourth, they are now sixth. The scenes back in March, when they clung on to beat Aston Villa, felt like a lifetime ago at the full-time whistle at St. Mary’s. Arsenal players had their heads bowed after a 1-0 loss to Saints, while the hosts linked arms and cheered in unison with their fans after Jan Bednarek’s goal had secured them a first Premier League win since February. Before kick-off Arsenal had been handed a golden opportunity in the top-four race after Tottenham lost to Brighton. Suddenly, the Gunners knew they could move level on points with Spurs - with a game in hand - if they beat Southampton. But they blew their chance and instead they finished they day sat sixth in the table following Manchester United’s 3-2 win over Norwich. There may well be more drama as the race to qualify for the Champions League continues, but right now Arsenal don’t look like a team ready for Europe’s elite. They had plenty of possession against Southampton, 76 per cent to be precise, however they were blunt going forward. Fraser Forster made an excellent save to deny Bukayo Saka in the first-half and Emile Smith Rowe late on, but other than that the Saints goalkeeper didn’t have masses to do. Arsenal seemed to lack urgency, particularly in the first-half and they were made to pay just before the break. They cleared a corner but, after the ball was hooked back in, Mohamed Elyounoussi squared it for Bednarek to lash home at the near post. Mikel Arteta’s side tried to get back into the match after the break, but they couldn’t find a way to break Saints down - who only a week ago shipped six against Chelsea. Arsenal finished the game with Gabriel Martinelli and Saka as the wing-backs, and Eddie Nketiah and Nicolas Pepe as the strikers, but even then they didn’t have any joy. It leaves them in a precarious position ahead of what promises to be a huge week. Next on the horizon is Chelsea on Wednesday night, before they host Manchester United in the lunchtime kick-off on Saturday. If Arsenal play like this, it could well be five defeats on the spin.

It was the Seagulls’ 2-1 victory at Arsenal last weekend that allowed Spurs to steal the initiative in the race for the top four by thumping Aston Villa a day later, but those watching events at the Emirates closely will have seen enough not to mark this down as a home gimme in the run-in and so it proved as Leandro Trossard’s wonderfully composed last-minute winner made it back-to-back victories in this part of town. Graham Potter’s side had been in wretched form, with one goal, six defeats and a 0-0 draw with bottom side Norwich to show for the seven games preceding their north London double-header, but have risen to the role of top four kingmakers with a pair of impressive displays. Led by the magnificent Yves Bissouma - who will himself surely be plying his trade for a club with Champions League ambitions come August - they stifled a previously free-flowing Spurs side who had scored nine times in their last two matches. The much lauded attacking triumvirate of Heung-min Son, Dejan Kulusevski and Harry Kane misfired for the first time since February’s defeat at Burnley, the pair of flying wingers largely grounded and Kane starved of those deep pockets from which he has been busily redefining the possibilities of the centre-forward’s remit. Such space might have opened up more readily had it not been for Craig Pawson’s clear desperation to keep a full complement on the field. The referee neglected to send Kulusevski off for a riled elbow on Marc Cucurella and then allowed Enock Mwepu two further lives when already on a booking, the second of two quick fouls - on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - certainly worthy of a second yellow before the break. SPONSORED Kulusevski’s lash out came as a rash response to Cucurella’s tug but it was symptomatic of a day on which Spurs’ usually rampant front-three were frustrated and constrained, their best chances coming from an opportunistic long-throw and a hopeful clearing header by Hojbjerg rather than the slick, crafted counters of recent weeks. The door was quickly slammed shut on Son’s one brief opening on the break by the omnipresent Bissouma, while Kulusevski was denied by an important Cucurella intervention and Joel Veltman made a similarly crucial tackle on Kane, who was left limping after being landed on awkwardly by Robert Sanchez - untested in the Brighton goal - and struggled to influence the game thereafter. That neither Son nor Kulusevski were left on the pitch by Antonio Conte as Spurs searched first for a late winner and then an even later equaliser said plenty about the scale of their individual and collective rare off-days. If the last week has taught us anything it is that both Arsenal and Tottenham remain too liable to them, too inherently flawed, to think there won’t be further twists and turns along the way. Most run-in predictions would have had them down for three points apiece from home games against Brighton. Instead, they’ve not managed one between them. Set against a title race defined by freakish consistency and win-or-bust jeopardy, the imperfections, the blips, are almost reassuring. So long as they are distributed relatively evenly, all roads once again point towards a blockbuster derby meeting on May 12. At half-time, Spurs legend Alan Mullery, the guest of honour here, had urged the home crowd to applaud the visitors on account of the favour performed at the Emirates last Saturday. A similar ovation is now due from across north London. ",positive,liverpool,0

David Moyes’ side are on cloud nine after another epic European night on Thursday, with goals from Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen brushing aside Lyon 3-0 in France to secure a 4-1 aggregate victory and tee up a huge Europa League semi-final showdown with Eintracht Frankfurt. The visit of Burnley to London Stadium may feel a bit after the lord mayor's show, but Moyes will demand 100 per cent commitment once more as West Ham look to stay in the thick of the race for a top-six finish this season. Burnley are four points adrift of safety after a damaging defeat by rock-bottom Norwich and on Friday announced the surprise sacking of the Premier League’s longest-serving manager Sean Dyche after 10 years and with only eight matches left to play this term. CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW WEST HAM VS BURNLEY LIVE! The good news for West Ham is the return of left-back Aaron Cresswell, who missed the memorable triumph over Lyon due to suspension following his controversial red card in the first leg. Declan Rice spoke of how much motivation Moussa Dembele, who got Cresswell sent-off, gave the Hammers. However, Kurt Zouma remains sidelined with the ankle injury suffered against Brentford last weekend that it is feared could keep him out for the remainder of the campaign. Angelo Ogbonna could yet return this season, but is still out for now as he works his way back from knee surgery performed before Christmas. Moyes had made three changes after Thursday’s European exploits, but he will be wary of changing too much as West Ham look to keep momentum up and fight for that top-six finish. Ben Johnson misses out as Cresswell comes back in on the left of defence, while Lukasz Fabianski starts in goal as expected. Nikola Vlasic comes in as Pablo Fornals gets a breather.

Record signing Lukaku missed Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid due to an Achilles issue but has now rejoined group work at Cobham and is set to be fit to play at Wembley. His return is a boost for Chelsea, who will be looking to keep their season alive after their agonising European elimination. Whether Lukaku is picked to start is another matter. Callum Hudson-Odoi remains sidelined with his Achilles injury and Ben Chilwell (knee) is a long-term absentee, but other than that Thomas Tuchel has a fully-fit squad to choose from. After playing 120 minutes at the Bernabeu in midweek, Tuchel may look to freshen things up against Palace. Captain Cesar Azpilicueta is likely to come into the back three, with Reece James switching over to right wing-back. Apart from in the quarter-final against Middlesbrough, Kepa Arrizabalaga has been Chelsea’s FA Cup goalkeeper this season and Tuchel faces a decision over whether to start him or Edouard Mendy against Palace. Mendy was preferred for the Carabao Cup Final against Liverpool and Tuchel could stick with his No1 given the importance of the game. “Romelu was back in training on Thursday,” said Tuchel on Friday. “Let’s see if he can get any reaction or not. “Except for Ben Chilwell and Calum Hudson-Odoi everybody seems to be OK.

But Vieira has warned that he won’t risk either key player if they are not 100 per cent fit and ready to feature. The unlucky Nathan Ferguson is definitely out, while Will Hughes has also been carrying a knock. Chelsea loanee Conor Gallagher is ineligible to face his parent club after a request from Palace allowing him to play was denied.

On a day when widespread anti-Glazer protests took place against the club’s owners, United had Cristiano Ronaldo to thank as he struck the 60th hat-trick of his career to give his side a 3-2 win that keeps their top-four hopes alive. Pogba’s substitution in the second-half was first met by cheers and the Frenchman was then booed as he walked off. He received another hostile reception after the match, which he responded to by cupping his hand to his ear. Rangnick believes it was reasonable for United fans to feel general frustration during the match, but didn’t like that it was targeted at Pogba. “I didn’t hear it myself to be honest, we were talking about it with my staff in the locker room,” Rangnick said. “I think the fans here are amazing, I really do. The support in the stadium today was great, it could not have been any better. “I can understand if the fans are frustrated and disappointed, so are we. I don’t think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or player. It’s a collective responsibility. For me it doesn’t make sense and this is why I will always defend and protect my players. “By the way I think Paul in the first half in possession of the ball did well.” On Pogba cupping his hand to his ear in response, Rangnick added: “It was probably his reaction to the chanting of the fans. As I said, I can understand in a way the fans and supporters but it doesn’t make sense to take on individual players.” Rangnick had a similar response when asked earlier this month about Harry Maguire being booed by England fans while on international duty, responding that it was “difficult to understand”.

The Hornets have now lost ten Premier League matches in a row at home, falling to defeat on every occasion at Vicarage Road since their win over Manchester United in November resulted in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer getting sacked. Pontus Jansson’s 95th-minute winner gave Brentford a 2-1 victory, which leaves Watford six points off 17th-placed Everton having played two matches more. Brentford took an early lead when Christian Norgaard slotted the ball home from an unmarked position, before it was cancelled out by Emmanuel Dennis’ strike in the second half. However, despite Jansson’s late header securing victory for the visitors, Hodgson insisted the Watford team must not give in. “One has to believe, one has to keep faith, one has to take some sort of heart from their desire and commitment and effort during the second half,” the Hornets boss said. “You just have to hope that six times 95 minutes more, they’ll be able to do that and maybe, who knows, we will pick up points we aren’t expected to and we will get ourselves back in the race. “But it’s not the right moment in time to start predicting that from the next game onwards we are now going to sweep the board and kill all opposition that we find in front of us, because if I say that people will laugh at me.” The result leaves Brentford just one point shy of the coveted 40-point mark and crucially, 15 points clear of the drop zone. Bees manager Thomas Frank praised his side’s mentality and how far they have come this season. “It’s been in many ways a crazy season for us, remarkable season, we are now on 39 points, try to keep focused on winning the next game and finishing as high as possible,” the Brentford boss said. “With coming up through the play-off final, lowest budget all of that, I think we (must) remember to say that on a day like this. “On top of that and then we managed to have that, it’s been nearly three years since I’ve been in charge of the Bees and I can’t remember a last-minute winner and we have had three this season and we had more goals where we scored in the last seven or eight minutes. “We’ve scored 13 goals in the last 15 minutes this season which are remarkable stats and shows two things, that we are unbelievably fit as we keep going throughout the game and the character and the mentality of the group of players is remarkable.” Additional reporting by PA Sport.

Referee Michael Oliver had to bring the silence to a premature end as chanting from the City end of Wembley marred the marking of the 33rd anniversary of the disaster. The club released a statement on the incident, apologising to Liverpool for the actions of those fans, and Guardiola has echoed that sentiment as he criticised those involved. “I think Manchester City made a statement,” Guardiola said. “This is not Manchester City. We are close to Liverpool club for the tragedy that happened years ago. We are alongside them. “After these guys singing (it) doesn’t represent what we are.” Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said of the incident: “In the moment it was a really strange feeling. “I thought there are moments in football where all the rivalries should be put aside - this is one of these moments. But you cannot change it. “I’m pretty sure it wasn’t all of the City supporters. Hopefully they got a proper word from the people around them as well. It’s not about Manchester City, there are a few people who obviously didn’t understand the situation.” On the pitch it was just as painful an afternoon for City, as they saw their treble hopes come to an end after a 3-2 defeat. Guardiola’s side were 3-0 down at the break, the second of those goals coming as Sadio Mane slid in and caught goalkeeper Zack Steffen taking far too long on the ball. The City boss made the decision to start Steffen instead of Ederson at Wembley, as he often does in domestic cup competitions, and accepted that such an error can occur with the team’s style of play. “It was an accident,” Guardiola said. “One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there it can always happen. It was an accident and he will learn for the future. “I have spoken with the team - not him personally but he is strong.” ",positive,liverpool,4

A header from Ibrahima Konate and then a brace from Sadio Mane put the Reds 3-0 up after 45 minutes, punishing any mistakes from their opponents in ruthless fashion. Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva got on the scoresheet as City threatened an incredible comeback but it finished 3-2, with all the damage done in the first-half. It’s set up to be an historic end to the season for Liverpool, who are still targetting a quadruple, and Klopp hailed his side for how they dismantled City early on. “I am absolutely proud,” the Liverpool boss said. “It’s incredible, I think the first half was one of the best we ever played. We did all the right stuff, I loved every second of it. “Second half started with a goal from Man City and then the game opens up. The quality of City is insane. “We had counter-attacks which we didn’t use and we can close the game there. It’s so difficult to win against them, but because we have my boys in the dressing room we have a chance.” Over the past week Klopp has criticised BT Sport for their scheduling of Liverpool’s match against Newcastle, which is an early kick-off on April 30. That comes less than 72 hours after the Reds are in Champions League action against Villarreal. With Liverpool continuing to fight on all fronts more disruptions seem inevitable, something Klopp admits he just has to accept. “We will get another game in midweek because they have to move another one,” Klopp said. “I’m not sure if we have a full week before the last matchday. It’s all difficult, but who cares? “We knew about these problems, but we wanted to go to the final and to beat the best football team in the world is a pretty special moment.” ",positive,liverpool,5

Earlier on Saturday, Arsenal had been given a major boost after their rivals Tottenham lost at home to Brighton. It meant the Gunners could go level on points with Spurs, with a game in hand, if they beat Saints, but they slipped to a 1-0 loss. Arsenal are now sat sixth in the Premier League and Arteta was left to rue a golden chance to boost the club’s hopes of Champions League qualification. Asked how big a missed opportunity it felt after Spurs dropped points, Arteta said: “Huge. “Because somebody that doesn’t know the result and is watching the game, you know what they would tell you - that Arsenal won the game, and we didn’t. “It’s very disappointing and difficult to explain with words, but this is what makes this sport different to any other. “Because again, in basketball, you have 25 shots and the opponent has one, you win 10 out of 10 times. “They (the Arsenal players) are really down today and they are down because they cannot find the right answers, apart from what we can do better around the box, not to win the match. That’s the frustration. “When somebody is better you shake their hands and you have to do something, you have to be critical with yourself. “But when it is happening the way it is happening, apart from 25 minutes against Palace and some periods against Brighton in the first-half, it’s very difficult to explain and accept.” ",positive,liverpool,0

United had looked comfortable when 2-0 with just over half an hour played, but Norwich got themselves level as the mood soured even further on a day when widespread protests againt the Glazer family took place. Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki cancelled out Ronaldo’s brace, only for United’s star man to have the final say as he fired home a sensational free-kick to earn his side the three points. It leaves them just three points behind Tottenham in fourth, keeping their hopes of Champions League qualification alive. Green and gold flares filled the air along with chants against the owners before kick-off, with thousands joining the protest organised by a recently-formed supporter group called The 1958. Anti-Glazer songs continued throughout the Premier League encounter. Anthony Elanga, Jadon Sancho and Ronaldo had early attempts for the attack-minded hosts, who pressed Norwich into a costly seventh-minute mistake. Elanga has been a rare bright spot in a wretched season for the Old Trafford giants and his pressing led to him rob the ball off flustered Ben Gibson before squaring for Ronaldo to simply slot home. Jesse Lingard, Diogo Dalot and Sancho had efforts as the United onslaught continued whilst chants against the Glazers echoed around Old Trafford. Tim Krul superbly denied Lingard at the near post as United pushed for a second that would arrive from a 32nd-minute corner, with Ronaldo rising above Gibson to head home Alex Telles’ set-piece. Ronaldo sent an audacious overhead kick over against a Norwich side that had created precious little, only to all too easily outmanoeuvre the hosts on the stroke of half-time. Pukki played inside to Dimitris Giannoulis and United somehow failed to track the Finland forward’s run inside, so too Dowell’s burst to the backpost where he headed home unmarked. It was a gut punch at the end of what had been a largely one-sided first half and Krul prevented Lingard’s sweetly-struck volley restoring United’s two-goal advantage early in the second period. Norwich did not make any changes at the break and appeared to have been buoyed by Dowell’s goal, with the roles reversed as City stunned Old Trafford in the 52nd minute. Goalscorer became provider as Dowell put Pukki through, impressively keeping his cool before striking past De Gea and in off the near post. The goal was ratified after a VAR check for offside and Milot Rashica would have turned the game on its head was it not for a fine one-handed stop by De Gea that tipped his 20-yard strike wide. Ronaldo saw a header saved from a Telles corner and Dowell tried his luck from distance as both teams continued to push. Some United fans showed their discontent and Norwich smelt blood, with Rashica blocked by Dalot before Sam Byram headed over. A number of fans welcomed Paul Pogba’s substitution, letting him know in no uncertain terms that are happy for him to leave this summer, as the mood threatened to darken. But as anger mounted Ronaldo provided a release for all those connected to United, hitting a thumping free-kick that Krul could only tip onto the inside of the post as Old Trafford rocked to its foundations.

Tottenham’s defeat to Brighton earlier on Saturday gave the Gunners a much-needed bost in the race for Champions League football, but once again Mikel Arteta’s side slipped up themselves. Bednarek put the Saints in front just before the break and Arsenal had no response in the second-half as their dreadful run continued. They trail Spurs by three points with a game in hand, which comes in midweek away to Chelsea. Alexandre Lacazette missed out for the Gunners with Covid, while Nuno Tavares started after a tough period for the youngster as Granit Xhaka returned to the midfield. Arsenal were certainly better than they have been in recent games in the early stages, with Gabriel Martinelli cutting inside and having a curling strike saved by Forster. That was a decent save from the English goalkeeper, but what followed shortly afterwards was absolutely sensational. The Gunners broke quickly after winning it back, Martinelli rolled it across the face of goal and Bukayo Saka looked to have a tap-in, only for Forster to fly across and tip the shot over superbly. Cedric Soares wasted a couple of set-piece opportunities and Southampton then started to grow into the match as the half went on. They got their reward on the verge of half-time. Mohamed Elyounoussi did well to keep the ball in, he cut it back for Bednarek and the centre-half swept the shot past Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal dominated possession after the break as they looked to keep their top-four hopes alive. Eddie Nketiah flicked a clever effort just wide, before Emile Smith Rowe was introduced and had a powerful strike blocked by teammate Martinelli. Nicolas Pepe was also brought on as Arteta threw all his attacking options at the problem. The Ivorian sent an acrobatic effort towards goal that flew just wide of the near post. Forster again denied the Gunners with a brilliant save, this time diving full-stretch to tip Smith Rowe’s scuffed effort behind as the visitors’ frustrations continued. Saka lashed a strike at goal, only to find Forster in his way once more, before Odegaard dragged an effort just wide seconds later after working the space well. Granit Xhaka then added his name to the list of players to have their afternoon ruined by the goalkeeper. There was to be no Arsenal equaliser, as they fell to another painful defeat.

Having seemed to seize control of the race for the final Champions League spot by beating Aston Villa after Arsenal’s defeat to Brighton last weekend, Conte’s men had chance to hammer home their advantage in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. However, they produced a sub-par performance in comparison to their recent excellent form Leandro Trossard’s last-minute strike earned a 1-0 victory and all three points for the visitors. Speaking after full-time, Conte insisted that experiencing the challenge of having to either follow Arsenal’s results or set the pace themselves will stand them in good stead going forward. “We have to know that we are in this race for the Champions League,” he said. “I think not many people thought this, but we are in this race because we showed that we deserved to stay there. Now we have to continue. Once you are in a good position in the table you have to keep this position. “It's a good opportunity for us also to cope with pressure, because when you arrive and then you know that [if you win] you stay is a fantastic target for you. “[If] you’re winning the league and you are first, then you have to cope with the pressure, with the other results and I think this is a good opportunity for us to improve because I think this group of players need it, no? They needed this type of examinations for improvement.” It was a particularly frustrating afternoon for Spurs’ in-form forward line of Dejan Kulusevski, Heung-min Son and Harry Kane, with the hosts failing to muster a single shot on target. While Conte praised the visitors for their organisation under Graham Potter, the Italian was critical of his side’s failure to ensure they at least escaped from an off-day with a point. “For sure, not a good result for us and a lesson that we can learn today that there are games that if you’re not able to win, you’re not to lose,” he added. “It was very clear that today it wasn’t our day but I understand we wanted to try and get three points because it was very important for us to get three points playing before our rivals in the race for the Champions League. “Brighton were very good to close every space but we helped our opponent in this job because we moved the ball slowly. “Maybe a more fair final result was a draw but Brighton played a good game.

Chelsea or Arsenal, who face off later this weekend, await in the Wembley showdown after Lauren Hemp struck twice in the second-half at Dagenham. Lisa Evans had briefly put the hosts back in the match after goals from Ellen White and Chloe Kelly, before Hemp hit her 50th club goal and a stoppage-time sealer. The visitors took the lead with 21 minutes gone when White reacted first to dive and head home, with keeper Mackenzie Arnold desperately scrambling back across her goal after the impressive Keira Walsh's 25-yard piledriver had come back off the crossbar. White saw a second equally impressive effort chalked off after the officials ruled that Lucy Bronze had not kept the ball in play before she crossed, and Hemp, who had been well marshalled until that point, fired over as City started to turn the screw. SPONSORED They got their reward eight minutes before the break when Kelly ran on to Gilly Flaherty's ill-judged pass across her own penalty area to beat Arnold and make it 2-0. However, Evans gave the Hammers hope three minutes before the break when, after Alex Greenwood had been dispossessed on halfway, she capitalised on hesitancy in the City defence to round Ellie Roebuck and reduce the deficit. White saw a 52nd-minute header correctly ruled out for offside as the visitors looked to kill off the game, but West Ham defended resolutely to keep themselves in with a chance. They might have been level when Evans slid Tameka Yallop in behind the visitors' defence, but she stabbed her attempt wide as Roebuck closed her down and their hopes were ended by Hemp when she turned smartly before thumping a shot past Arnold. Katerina Svitkova forced a late save from Roebuck, but Arnold had to tip substitute Filippa Angeldahl's fierce drive on to the crossbar and was beaten for a fourth time at the death as Hemp completed a good afternoon.

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates after Trossard goal today","ottenham vs Brighton LIVE! Tottenham blew a chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place in the Premier League as they suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Brighton on Saturday. Antonio Conte's side produced a lacklustre display and looked set for a frustrating stalemate before Leandro Trossard made things even worse with a 90th-minute winner. After four successive wins the pre-match mood in north London was one of optimism but Tottenham's performance was in stark contrast to the bright spring sunshine. They managed only one goal attempt in a dismal first-half in which Brighton were by far the better side. SPONSORED Spurs showed a little more urgency after the break with Son Heung-min twice having shots blocked, but Brighton always carried the greater goal threat and deservedly took the points when Trossard cut in from the left and beat Hugo Lloris with a low angled shot with the outside of his foot. Tottenham stay fourth with 57 points, just three points ahead of Arsenal who have two games in hand and play later on Saturday at Southampton. Brighton moved up to 10th with 40 points.

Recap the Seagulls’ win with our match report. “A difficult game, we knew this,” he tells BT Sport. “I saw the game against Arsenal and we knew what could happen. It was very tactical and in the end a draw was the more fair result, but they deserved to win. “We started very slowly and in this type of tactical game, you have to move the ball quickly and try to find the right space to attack. Today we did everything too slow and maybe the spring weather was an excuse, but not a good game for us.” A lot of action to follow later today with Arsenal’s trip to Southampton now of even greater importance, and kicking off in just 15 minutes’ time.

The Seagulls looked good value for a point in the spring sunshine with Antonio Conte’s Spurs floundering having finally taken fourth place off Arsenal with last week’s defeat for the Gunners at home to Brighton. And yet they fell to the same fate with Leandro Trossard’s 90th-minute winner. Here’s how Conte’s side rated at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium... Largely untroubled, albeit thanks to some important blocks from those in front of him. Classy and composed as ever until blunder gave Trossard possession and the winning goal. Struggled to find passes to break the lines but solid in defence until the late winner. Almost put Lloris in trouble with casual back pass after magnificent control and got away with error in possession deep in own final third. Key block to deny Lamptey. Returned on left in place of injured Matt Doherty. Opportunistic long throw created chance for Son and miraculously avoided a booking for cynical foul on Mwepu. Crucial touch to take Joel Veltman flick clear of danger and went close with long-range effort at the other end. Booked and subbed. On the receiving end of tackle that should have earned Mwepu second booking and fired great ball across goal that was crying out for finishing touch. Did fine in midfield battle but outshone by Bissouma. Clunky in possession and little attacking threat but did bail out Davies with timely intervention on Caicedo. Booked - and should have been sent off - for a frustrated lash out at Cucurella during quiet display before being replaced soon after the hour. That a chance early in the second-half was his first real threatening moment said plenty about a display that failed to live up to recent electric form. Probably forgiven an off-day. Denied by vital Veltman tackle before leaving hearts in mouths when appearing to hurt famously fragile ankle in unnecessary collision with Sanchez. Not as involved as usual as packed Brighton midfield denied him space to drop deep. Substitutes Lucas Moura (Kulusevski, 64’) - 6 Added some much-needed thrust. Harry Winks (Bentancur, 72’) - 6 Steven Bergwijn (Son, 88’) - 5 Squandered brilliant late chance at immediate equaliser.

The first-half passed by largely without incident down the Brighton end, the visitors having shocked Arsenal just a week ago and fancying the same with a Joel Veltman shot from close-range requiring an urgent Harry Kane block. Dejan Kulusevski was fortunate to avoid a red card for elbowing Marc Cucurella after receiving a bump from the Spanish wing-back, which earned a rake down his Achilles later on in the half in reply. In turn, Enock Mwepu was given the benefit of the doubt from Craig Pawson after two risky challenges on a booking. After the break, Son Heung-min enjoyed little space from good positions in the area as he found blocks denying two goalbound opportunities before Emerson Royal rushed in to deny Moises Caicedo after the ball dropped for the Ecuadorian in the box. For each spell of Tottenham pressure, Brighton successfully slowed the play down as shown by Caicedo taking his time coming off injured shortly after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s bustling run down the right almost produced a cross to Sergio Reguilon in a great position on 75 minutes. In the end, it was the away team looking most likely to snatch a winner and, just as a week ago, they upset the team sitting in fourth place when Leandro Trossard beat Eric Dier with a neat piece of skill before poking past Hugo Lloris in the 90th minute.

The news is a blow to Arsenal, who have already been hit by injuries to Kieran Tierney, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Thomas Partey. The Gunners face Chelsea and Manchester United next week and Lacazette would now seemingly be in a race against time to play in one of those games. Lacazette has struggled for form recently, but he is a key figure in the Arsenal dressing room and has become captain following the departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Barcelona.

Johnson played 90 minutes as the Hammers banished Lyon to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, winning 4-1 on aggregate thanks to a 3-0 thrashing in France. David Moyes, the West Ham manager, has taken the club from a relegation battle, into Europe and then - at their first crack in this competition - into the last four. The mentality is now one of fearlessness and while fans will be dreaming of European glory, the squad are yet to give up on securing another year of continental football via the Premier League. West Ham sit sixth in the Premier League with six games to go, six points off fourth-placed Tottenham. “I think we're now at the stage where everyone's fully elated but now we have come too far really to let it slip,"" Johnson said. “It is Champions League or Europa League [qualification], or the Europa League trophy that we're aiming for. We've made improvements on last season no end and want to make improvements for next season. So we're setting the bar high but we're just going to continue taking it game by game.” West Ham are in uncharted waters as a group, now into their first European semi-final since 1976. Despite their inexperience at this level, Johnson feels the Hammers have been developing a big club mentality ever since their relegation escape during Project Restart in 2020. “I think it was from the restart [after Covid], which was a few years ago,” said Johnson. “We were obviously in a relegation battle. We had to beat Chelsea, that was a deciding factor in our season to give us a chance of staying up and we went into that game with full confidence that we were going to win. “I think we get that confidence from the manager. I think to want to become a big team you're gonna have to have the mentality for it. And I think we've got a great group of lads who have that mentality. “We just looked as if we were going to win every game last season, it was it was a strange feeling and that's continued this year. We're not going anywhere in Europe or in England, and going for a draw. We're going to win so we're always gonna have that mentality.” West Ham fans may well have been feeling rather strange as they watched their side tear through Lyon from the gods at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday night. “It was a memorable night,"" said Johnson. “Another milestone achieved, which was brilliant for the boys. “I think all the boys were focused from the warm up to the final whistle. So it was just a memorable night. Amazing feeling for everyone involved. “So many fans came over and they were great, they held their own against the Lyon fans who we know are a bit problematic.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Earlier on Friday came the news that the consortium led by Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family and backed by American billionaires Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert had withdrawn from the four-horse race to take over at Stamford Bridge. “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea FC,” an official statement read. “In the process of finalising the proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. “We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans and we wish the new owners well.” Standard Sport understands the issues with the bid concern a failure to agree on terms among the consortium and are not related to their interest being met with opposition by some Chelsea fans on account of historic emails sent by patriarch Joe Ricketts in 2009, with the family confident they had largely won that battle after a series of positive meetings with fan groups. With the Ricketts family consortium officially out of the running, the battle to buy Chelsea is now between consortiums fronted by La Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly, former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. The deadline to submit final bids to Raine Group was on Thursday and Standard Sport understands that all three offers from those parties were made without a hitch. After largely staying silent in the process up until now, Pagliuca has unveiled his grand vision for Chelsea in recent days, partnering with chairman of Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment (MLSE) Larry Tanenbaum. The bid also includes the likes of former Disney CEO Bob Iger and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, while having the backing of the John Terry-led True Blues Consortium. Broughton is the former chairman of Liverpool and British Airways, with his bid backed by Lord Sebastian Coe among others. Meanwhile, Boehly’s bid also involves Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and property developer Jonathan Goldstein. ",positive,liverpool,2

After booking their first European semi-final since 1976, the Hammers squad celebrated with the travelling fans in the away end at the Groupama Stadium in Lyon before making their way back into the dressing room, where Moyes delivered his verdict. The Scot, usually able to keep his cool, told his players how proud they had made him. He then reflected on their remarkable rise in a brief but emotional speech - which still managed to include a reminder of Sunday’s meeting with Burnley - before all hell broke loose. An old favourite, Rednex’s Cotton Eye Joe, blared out in the away dressing room and even Moyes could not resist joining in the rendition. Players and staff alike joined to toast this remarkable moment, bouncing along to the tune which has marked so many wins during last season. Aaron Cresswell, suspended for this second leg, and Angelo Ogbonna, who has been injured since November, where there to enjoy the moment they deserved to be a part of too. Vladimir Coufal, who had danced with a flag in front of the away end at full-time, was the unfortunate one to be hooked aside by UEFA for the usual doping control tests but he was joined by compatriot Tomas Soucek for their own mini celebration. As Pablo Fornals tried to gather his thoughts to speak to the media, his team-mates were wandering the corridors of the Groupma Stadium telling anyone who would listen that ""West Ham are massive"". ""I don’t know where I am right now, everyone in the dressing room is the same,"" said Fornals. ""Everyone is screaming and jumping [in the changing room], the emotions are high. It was a really lovely moment for everyone."" All the while the West Ham fans, for more than an hour, had been kept in the away end as the home fans were cleared out. Hearing their chants still echoing, the players began to make their way back out to salute them once more before Moyes walked back out to soak up their praise. Mark Noble and Declan Rice, the father and son duo of this squad, headed out to pose for pictures with West Ham fan James Corden, who had flown in from Los Angeles for this moment. Moyes has never reached this stage of a European competition in his career and this milestone was watched from the stands by his brother, Kenny, and father, David Snr. With the squad not returning to London until Friday morning, Moyes was ready to allow himself a moment of celebration over a glass of wine back at their hotel. After the raucous celebrations, captain Noble, who appeared as a second half substitute and was in tears following the game, found the time to video call his wife and children back home before, as he always does, sweeping the dressing room clean. Thanks to his efforts there may be no sign of the scenes moments before, but they are memories which will last a lifetime. ",positive,liverpool,0

After Nottingham Forest were beaten at Luton earlier on Good Friday, Marco Silva’s runaway leaders headed to the iPro Stadium for an evening kick-off knowing that victory would rubber-stamp their immediate return to the top-flight with five matches to spare. And prolific Fulham looked to be firmly on course to begin their promotion party, with Fabio Carvalho beating Derby goalkeeper Ryan Allsop just before the 20-minute mark after fine interplay with Bobby Decordova-Reid finished off a typically incisive passing move. The Portuguese winger is expected to join Liverpool when his contract expires this summer, with Shakhtar Donetsk’s Israeli international Manor Solomon lined up as his replacement in a £7million transfer. However, Wayne Rooney’s Derby hit back after the interval, with Crystal Palace loanee Luke Plange enjoying a starring role as he provided an initial close-range finish before forcing Tosin Adarabioyo into a decisive own goal 17 minutes from time. SPONSORED Fulham thought they had got back in front when record-breaking top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic slotted home at 1-1, only for the Serbian striker to be quickly denied by the offside flag. Other results could see the Cottagers promoted by the time they host Preston in their next fixture at Craven Cottage on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, an unlikely victory sees Derby rise from bottom to 22nd and level on points with Peterborough, who beat Blackburn earlier in the day.

The former Chelsea midfielder, 33, has a year remaining on his contract at Old Trafford but has indicated his intention to depart the club at the end of the current season after talks with the board, his team-mates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick. It remains to be seen if United will pursue a transfer for Matic, or if the club - who have agreed a deal in principle for Ajax boss Erik ten Hag to assume the coaching reins next season - intend on agreeing an early termination of the three-year extension he signed in July 2020. Writing on Instagram on Friday, Matic said: “After a great deal of thought, I have decided that this season will be my last with Manchester United. I have informed the board, the manager and the players of my decision. “It has been a huge honour and a privilege to play for this great club. A big thank you to the fans for their unwavering support. “I will now give everything until the end of the season to help my teammates finish as strongly as possible.” In a follow-up statement, United wrote: “Thank you for all of your efforts over the last five seasons Nemanja and here’s to a strong finish to your time at United, over the coming weeks.” Matic has made 183 total appearances for United across all competitions since arriving from Premier League rivals Chelsea in a £40million deal in the summer of 2017 that reunited him with Jose Mourinho. He has failed to win a single major trophy during his five years as a Red Devil, forming part of the squad that lost the 2017-18 FA Cup Final against Chelsea and the 2020-21 Europa League Final against Villarreal. Matic has started only 11 Premier League matches so far this season, earning a recall for last weekend’s listless 1-0 defeat by struggling Everton at Goodison Park. United are likely to have significant work to do to reshape their midfield this summer for incoming boss Ten Hag. As well as Matic departing, Paul Pogba is also widely expected to leave Old Trafford for the second time when his contract expires in June.

The loss was spiralling Scunthorpe’s 17th in their last 20 matches, leaving them with an unassailable 16-point gap to League Two safety with only four matches left to play this season.

I am angry. I don’t want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it’s not stood me in good stead, but I’m very, very disappointed,” Scunthorpe boss Keith Hill told BBC Radio Humberside after relegation was confirmed. “I’ve been disappointed a lot of times, but I’ve got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. “It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn’t been good enough. “Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you’re staring down the barrel of relegation. Scunthorpe fans have witnessed a swift decline of their club over recent seasons “We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don’t think we’ve been competitive enough throughout the course of the season.” Scunthorpe are the second EFL club to have relegation confirmed in April so far.

Zaha has already scored more goals this season (12) than he has managed in any campaign in his second spell at Palace and Butland says the Ivory Coast international will be ready for the big occasion this weekend. “Absolutely, he will be up for it, like we all will be,"" said Butland. ""He is going to leave it all out there, which we all are. “When Wilf does that, there are not many people in the world who can play like him or can stop him. “I’m sure we will see the Wilf that we are seeing at the minute on Sunday.

It is not us playing Chelsea, they have got to play us as well. “It will be a good occasion, and I am sure we are all going to bring it.” Vieira, who won five FA Cups as a player, has turned Palace into a progressive and attractive team since taking over from Roy Hodgson last summer and has embedded a fearless mentality within his young squad. After years of struggling with confidence at Stoke City, Butland has flourished during this FA Cup run thanks to that mentality. Butland said: “When you believe, feel confident in each other, and you have got a manager who we are all clearly learning from, and the way of playing that he is trying to instil in us is enjoyable - we are being pushed, and we are being made to work hard. “When you have got a manager who has achieved what he has achieved, he comes with that experience and that winning mentality. It is very difficult not to feed off that and take aspects from that. “He has been keen to push us, push us and push us, and that has shown. When you do that, and you have got a platform that you can build from, it is very difficult not to become confident. “The group gets on extremely well - everyone pushes each other. There are no egos, it is just a group of people who want to push each other and enjoy working with each other. “When you have got that environment, success is the next step.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Partey limped off with a thigh injury in the 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace earlier this month and Arsenal fear the midfielder will not return until the summer. Losing Partey for the run-in would represent a severe blow for Arsenal in their fight to finish fourth and qualify for the Champions League. The Gunners have slipped below Tottenham to fifth place after back-to-back defeats and have also lost Kieran Tierney for the rest of the season due to a knee injury. Speaking ahead of Saturday’s trip to Southampton, Arteta provided a worrying update on Partey. “The news that we got after having another assessment was not great,” said the Arsenal manager. “It is not looking very positive [for] his availability this season, but we will have to wait and see. “He is trying to get back as quick as possible, but at the moment we are not very optimistic about it. “At the moment it is not ideal and we knew that towards the end of the season one of the key elements was going to be having the team available and the squad available as much as possible.” ",negative,liverpool,0

The quartet looking to succeed Roman Abramovich had until Thursday to submit their final bids to New York merchant bank Raine Group, who are running the process. The Ricketts’, who own the Chicago Cubs baseball team in the States, had partnered with American billionaires Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert in an attempt to purchase the Premier League side but a statement released on Friday confirmed they had decided against taking their efforts any further. The Ricketts’ interest had been met with opposition by some Chelsea fans on account of historic emails sent by patriarch Joe Ricketts in 2009 but the family were confident they had largely won that battle after a series of positive meetings with supporter groups. Sources close to the Ricketts’ insist the decision to withdraw from the bidding process is unrelated and claim they were simply unable to reach agreement to go ahead with a final offer. SPONSORED Standard Sportunderstands the issues related to a failure to agree on terms among the consortium set up by the Ricketts family, which included hedge fund billionaire Griffin. “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea FC,” a statement read. “In the process of finalising the proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. “We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans and we wish the new owners well.” The Ricketts’ withdrawal leaves the race between the consortiums put together by Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca to buy out Abramovich.

Craig Dawson was signed for just £2million from relegated Watford and has defied doubters to become a new Hammers cult hero who is being dubbed “Ballon D’awson”. The 32-year-old was a colossus for West Ham in Lyon on Thursday night as West Ham stormed into the semi-finals of the Europa League. It was not just his trademark header, which set West Ham on their way to a 3-0 win. Dawson was a rock for 45 minutes in the first leg when the Hammers went down to 10 men and, after a shaky start alongside Issa Diop without the injured Kurt Zouma in France, was a titan again in the second leg. As West Ham fans have become accustom to, Dawson stood firm to repel Lyon, making more blocks (6) than anyone on the pitch. And having already taken a blow to his nose in the first leg, he twice stuck his face in front of efforts from Lyon winger Tete. If things had gone to plan for Moyes and both Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna had been fit, Dawson would not even have been on the pitch. But it would have been hard to find anyone more reliable in this squad. Whenever there have been defensive problems at West Ham this season, and there have been a few, the no-nonsense centre-half has stood up, even if it meant playing through a long-running and nagging groin injury to ensure West Ham had a full back line. West Ham captain Mark Noble was full of praise for Dawson after the historic win in Lyon. ""Big Daws, who has been so reliable for us and been fantastic,"" said Noble. ""He was incredible in the first leg and even better tonight so that is a big statement for him."" It is a statement many should take note of. Eyebrows were raised in many corners when West Ham signed Dawson, initially on loan, in 2020 after a £30million move for James Tarkowski fell through. Some at Watford were happy to offload him. You can be sure those same people would pay a hefty cab fare to get him back to Vicarage Road now as they head towards relegation. In comparison, Dawson is only looking up. “It is incredible and we love those stories,” said Joe Cole while working as a pundit for BT Sport. “I was interviewing him a few weeks ago and after they had done some defensive work he went and got the fitness coach and he did 15 minutes of fast feet by himself. “As a 31-year-old, you can see the determination in him to be a footballer. That is all you want as a manger, a player with professionalism and a love... you know he is giving everything blood, seat and ears for the team. You have got to love him. Ballon D’awson!” Carlton Cole added: “Credit to him. Everything that has been asked of him by David Moyes and the club, he has stood up tall. He has done himself proud.” Fans will tout Dawson for individual awards and there have been a few tough-in-cheek calls for an England call-up, but that is of no concern to Dawson. He is happy to continue impressing and proving doubters wrong for West Ham as he drives their European dream. ",positive,liverpool,0

Only last week, Burnley were celebrating a dramatic 3-2 win over Everton that appeared to have reignited their survival hopes, but Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to bottom side Norwich - coupled with the Toffees’ victory over Manchester United the previous day - has left them four points adrift of safety with eight matches to play. Dyche had been the top-flight’s longest serving manager after nine-and-a-half years in the job. He earned promotion from the Championship in 2013/14 and then was retained when the club were relegated the following season, securing an immediate return to the Premier League at the first time of asking in 2015/16. The 50-year-old has been lauded since for establishing Burnley as a top flight club on a tight budget and though they finished 17th last season, they did so with an 11-point gap to the relegation zone. This season, however, they have struggled badly, winning just four games all season, fewer than any other side in the division. SPONSORED A club statement confirmed that assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have all also left the club. “Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Seanand his staff for their achievements at the Club over the last decade,” Burnley chairman Alan Pace said. “During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. “However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. “The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Serbia international Filip Kostic converted a fourth minute penalty and added another in the 67th with a low drive after Rafael Borre thundered in their second goal in the 36th for a 4-3 aggregate victory and a sensational win at the Camp Nou. The Catalans, pre-match favourites after a first leg 1-1 draw in Germany last week, missed a couple of chances with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but were far less threatening than their opponents who could have added to their tally. They did score twice in stoppage time through a Sergio Busquets shot and Memphis Depay’s penalty after Frankfurt’s Evan N’Dicka was sent off but ran out of time for a third goal that would have forced extra time. Eintracht, who last reached the semi-final stage in 2019 and are unbeaten away from home this season in the Europa League, will now face West Ham, 4-1 aggregate winners over Lyon. SPONSORED Oliver Glasner’s team, currently in ninth place in the Bundesliga, got off to a perfect start when Eric Garcia brought down Jesper Lindstrom four minutes into the game and Kostic coolly sent Marc-Andre ter Stegen the wrong way from the spot. Despite Barcelona taking control, it was the visitors who were more effective and scored again with Borre’s 25-metre missile that left Ter Stegen beaten. Aubameyang should have done better three minutes after the restart when he failed to connect with an Ousmane Dembele cutback in front of goal. Ter Stegen then temporarily kept them in the game when he stopped a shot from Lindstrom in the 58th but could do nothing when unmarked Kostic found himself with far too much space on the left and drilled in a shot past the keeper. Barca’s two stoppage time goals came far too late for a team that had almost 70 percent possession but fewer (10) attempts on goal to their opponents (16).

David Moyes and his band of brothers seemingly know no limit in this competition, rising from a rough start to rip through Lyon and leave themselves one step from the Europa League final at the first time of asking. From front to back they rose to the challenge once again in this most remarkable of seasons as Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen etched their names into the history books. Moyes has brushed off talk of his side being favourite for this competition all season - but there can be little doubting that now. Along with the tens of thousands of visiting fans, the great and good of West Ham, and James Corden, had travelled to France for their biggest night in 41 years, the last time the Hammers reached a European quarter-final - a moment that is now firmly eclipsed in Hammers folklore. West Ham were without Kurt Zouma and Aaron Cresswell through injury and suspension - making this night even more remarkable. Lyon had their own injury troubles but - bizarrely - included Brazilian Lucas Paqueta in their matchday squad despite his positive test for coronavirus on Thursday morning. Peter Bosz, the Lyon manager, was hoping the home support could make the difference and, despite there being a number of empty seats, the Hammers were met with a wall of noise and smoke as they emerged. With the pre-match pyrotechnics from the home fans behind Alphonse Areola’s goal still swirling in the air, the visitors were given an early scare as Karl Toko Ekambi jinked inside past Tomas Soucek and clattered the near post. Minutes after Ekambi’s effort, Dawson sparked a scramble when he missed a whipped cross from right-back Malo Gusto, almost allowing Moussa Dembele the chance to tap in at the far post. Dawson and Issa Diop both had a swing and a miss after Soucek’s attempted clearance ended up getting the back four in trouble. Dawson then had to throw himself in front of an effort from Dembele and Diop was booked after just 22 minutes having clattered Toko Ekambi. It was far from an assured start, but this was a first half which could well serve as a microcosm of Moyes’s time at West Ham. From the chaotic and concerning start with the defence in disarray, they suddenly stunned a side who just two years ago were in the last four of the Champions League. The visitors had come through the opening spell by the skin of their teeth and finally started to pose a threat themselves. Michail Antonio beat three Lyon players down the left before lifting a cross for Bowen who, on the stretch, could only steer it wide of the post. The two combined again as Antonio chested the ball down for the West Ham winger, whose shot was deflected behind for a corner by Jason Denayer. Premier League clubs have come to fear West Ham at corners since Moyes’s arrival, but the message may not have quite reached the continent. Pablo Fornals sent a ball whipping towards the near post, where Dawson barged his way to meet the ball and nodded home - some moment for the man taken off relegated Watford for a measly £2million. West Ham had their chests puffed out now, they were leading away in Europe in a second leg knockout tie. This was new territory and they grew into it rapidly, pushing forward again on the brink of half-time. Ben Johnson, deputising for Cresswell superbly, swung a cross from the left which was nodded straight to the feet of Rice by Emerson Palmieri. The West Ham captain was given so much space on the edge of the box that he almost took a double take before firing low and watching his shot deflect off Castello Lukeba and in. This was dreamland for the travelling West Ham fans high in the corner and watching Rice charge the length of the pitch, kissing the badge all the way, to celebrate with them. Moments like this could just keep him in claret and blue for a while longer. West Ham were comfortable now and, despite two changes at the break from Lyon, the Hammers forced their hosts into an embarrassing collapse just three minutes after the restart. Antonio, at his troublesome best here tonight, had dragged the Lyon back line into all sorts of trouble as he rolled the ball back for Fornals. The Spaniard fizzed a first time ball through for Bowen, given the freedom of the Lyon half, who raced forward and rolled the ball into the far corner with his weaker right foot. From there West Ham needed only to see the night out but they were still giving everything, Dawson twice blocking shots from Tete with his face. West Ham were there - into the last four, another dizzying step taken on this remarkable rise under Moyes. There was even time for a semi-sentimental touch too as Moyes sent on veteran Mark Noble in his last of 18 seasons at the club for his first taste of a European quarter-final. Those in the away end will spend the night in Lyon’s bars dreaming of Mr West Ham holding that trophy aloft next month. ",positive,liverpool,0

On the biggest night in the club’s recent history, the Hammers players more than rose to the occasion as they put their opponents to the sword to seal a 4-1 victory on aggregate. Craig Dawson and Declan Rice put the visitors in control at the break and Jarrod Bowen’s strike early in the second-half effectively put the result beyond doubt. West Ham fans may have hoped for a semi-final clash against Barcelona but it’s Eintracht Frankfurt who they will meet in the last four, after the Germans beat Xavi’s side at the Nou Camp. The home fans were in fine voice ahead of kick-off and their side responded as they started impressively. Karl Toko Ekambi hit the post in the early stages with a powerful low strike, before Moussa Dembele nearly turned a dangerous cross in at the back post. West Ham were looking shaky at the back without Kurt Zouma and Aaron Cresswell, but started to grow into the match from an attacking perspective. Michail Antonio shrugged off a couple of challenges and curled a lovely cross to the far post, where Jarrod Bowen diverted it wide on the stretch. Seven minutes before the break, the Hammers took a crucial lead. Pablo Fornals whipped a corner into the near post and Dawson was there to power it home for his second goal of the Europa League campaign. The celebrations in the away end had barely finished when Rice doubled the advantage. A cross was headed out to the edge of the box, where the West Ham captain was waiting to give his side control of the tie with the help of a slight deflection. A brilliant night became a dream one when Bowen extended the lead further three minutes after the break. Fornals found the winger in an incredible amount of space and he burst through on goal before firing past Julian Pollersbeck with supreme confidence. The Hammers continued to offer a real threat on the break and Antonio had a shot comfortably saved at the near post, as he looked to bring an end to his goal drought. Dembele sliced a volley wide Malo Gusto had a powerful strike well saved as Lyon looked for a goal that might spark a late comeback. Dawson, who was imperious throughout, and the West Ham defence were in no mood to give up any gifts though and they ensured a famous night was capped off with a clean sheet. Genk, Rapid Vienna, Dinamo Zagreb, Sevilla and now Lyon have been ticked off on this incredible run. Just Eintracht Frankfurt stand between West Ham and a European final. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Premier League table-toppers played out a goalless draw at the Wanda Metropolitano to give them a narrow 1-0 win on aggregate in the quarter-final tie, with the match descending into chaos in the final 15 minutes as frustrations boiled over. Atletico’s Felipe was sent off while his teammate Stefan Savic was incredibly fortunate to follow him back to the changing rooms. The home side did go close to forcing the match into extra-time though, with Angel Correa and Matheus Cunha denied by some last-ditch defending. After City’s 1-0 win at the Etihad in the first leg, Pep Guardiola referred to “pre-history” as he discussed the 5-5-0 formation Atletico played out of possession, and the Spanish side’s president has hit back following their Champions League exit. “It was a match that, with a bit of luck, would have taken us to the semi-finals,” Cerezo told Radio Marca. “We were not lucky enough to score a goal and reach extra time. “We are a team that has a lot of status so that someone can offend us and in the end it has been shown that everyone has their pre-history. We played a good game, attacking, and City yesterday played pre-history, defending and put a wall in front of their goal so they wouldn’t score. “Everybody has seen it. City was a completely defensive team. In the second half they shot on goal once. Yesterday it was shown that each one has their pre-history.” Cerezo was also in no mood to condemn Diego Simeone or the Atletico players for their antics in the closing stages of the match. “In the sporting and human aspect, Simeone cannot be criticised,” Cerezo said. “He knows how to be in all situations. He will continue with us, his story is there, he is a winner and will be with us as long as he wants.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Dozens of supporters pushed the safety barriers that were held by stewards after the final whistle following the London side’s 4-1 aggregate victory. France’s Ligue 1 has been hit by a spate of fan violence this season and a Lyon game was called off in December after Olympique de Marseille’s Dimitri Payet had been hit by a bottle thrown from the stands. Nice were docked points after serious incidents during their game in August against Marseille, whose players clashed with home fans after they pelted them with missiles and stormed onto the pitch. The northern derby between RC Lens and Lille was hit by crowd problems in September, with the start of the second half delayed after rival fans threw objects at each other before people ran onto the pitch, prompting riot police and stewards to intervene.

Underdogs Eintracht Frankfurt scored a major upset when they stunned hosts Barcelona 3-2 on Thursday thanks to two goals from winger Filip Kostic to march into the semi-finals of the Europa League. Serbia international Kostic converted a fourth minute penalty and added another in the 67th with a low drive after Rafael Borre thundered in their second goal in the 36th for a 4-3 aggregate victory and a sensational win at the Camp Nou. The Catalans, pre-match favourites after a first leg 1-1 draw in Germany last week, missed a couple of chances with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but were far less threatening than their opponents who could have added to their tally. Sergio Busquets pulled a goal back for Barca with a powerful stoppage time effort and the Catalans scored again with a Memphis Depay penalty even deeper into stoppage time after Frankfurt’s Evan N’Dicka was sent off.

The Reds travel to St James’ Park in the Premier League on April 30 in the early-kick off on Saturday afternoon, which comes after they host Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final on the Wednesday night less than 72 hours earlier. It is a quick turnaround that Klopp is less than impressed with, and he has called on BT Sport to move the match back to a later slot on Saturday to give his players a few more hours to recover. “It’s the first time that we are in the semi-finals of two competitions and that’s our problem, I have no problem dealing with that,” Klopp said. “But (the early kick-off) is a massive difference, each hour counts. If you want to cause us problems you send us to 12:30 at Newcastle. “I don’t understand it. I can understand that people want to see a football match between Liverpool and Newcastle but I don’t see why any team should have an advantage or a disadvantage. “The league and the broadcaster really have to try at least to help. We will see. I haven’t heard anything yet. Nobody from BT contacted me yet. “But I’d say common sense would tell you that it’s probably the right thing to do to move the game slightly backwards.” Reports on Thursday afternoon suggested that Liverpool have made an official request for the kick-off to be pushed back against Newcastle, though they are not particularly confident they will get their wish.

Conte tested positive for Covid-19 last weekend and he has been distancing from the Spurs squad, who have trained without him. The Italian, however, is feeling “fine” and is hoping that he can be in the dugout on Saturday lunchtime. Spurs have won four Premier League games in a row and are looking to extend their lead in fourth place over rivals Arsenal. “I had my staff, they did a really good job after the game against Aston Villa (4-0 away win) and the day after I started to feel a bit of mild symptoms, a bit of pain in my throat,” said Conte. “I asked to have a COVID test and it was positive, but now I’m fine. I’m well and for sure this was a strange week for me and the players, they are used to having sessions with me, but it’s OK because my staff are doing a great job. “I think on Saturday I will be able to be with my players on the bench given the length of time from my COVID test.” Tottenham beat Aston Villa 4-0 in their last game, but the win was marred by Matt Doherty suffering a knee injury. The wing-back, who has been back to his best recently, is due to miss the rest of the season and Conte admitted his absence is a blow. “I think the first visit with the doctor said he can recover without surgery,” Conte said. “Seven to eight weeks before he recovers. For this reason, his season has finished. “This is really bad news for us. We know very well the improvement in our team and it’s a pity to lose a player like him for the rest of the season. “Also (defender Japhet) Tanganga and (midfielder Oliver) Skipp are not available for us. “Bad news for us on one hand, but on the other hand I think we have solutions to try and cope with the situation until the end of the season.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Carlo Ancelotti made just one change to the side that had started the first leg as Nacho replaced the suspended Eder Militao in defence, while Thomas Tuchel handed starts to Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic as he bolstered the midfield that had been so overrun at the Bridge, with Reece James and Marcos Alonso given the nod as full-backs in a back-four. The Blues were in need of a fast-start and Mount provided it as he took advantage of a fortuitous break off Werner to lash a superb finish past former Chelsea ‘keeper Thibaut Courtois. The visitors were much the better side and were level in the tie soon after the interval as Rudiger’s powerful header left Courtois no chance, though Real Madrid were furious with the award of a corner after James’ strike appeared to go wide without a touch from Luka Modric. Marcos Alonso looked to have completed the turnaround with a thumping right-footed strike but the effort was chalked off by VAR for a handball by the Spaniard in the build-up. Instead, it was Werner who put Chelsea ahead for the first time in the tie, showing great composure to shimmy inside two challenges, Courtois’ touch not enough to deny the German as his effort trickled wide of Ferland Mendy on the line. Within five minutes, however, the home side had responded as Rodrygo volleyed home from Luka Modric’s outrageous, outside-of-the-boot ball to force extra-time. Moments after Alonso’s disallowed effort, Benzema had headed against the woodwork when well-placed but the ruthless streak that downed the Blues in London returned in extra-time as he took advantage of Rudiger’s slip to finish from Vinicius Junior’s cross and set up a semi-final meeting with either Manchester City or rivals Atletico Madrid.

Their FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea is two years in the making and reward for the preparation, and then execution, of their plan to transform the south London club. Palace have a new identify under Patrick Vieira and increased hope for the future. They are confident of adding to a bad week for Chelsea — but it has been a long road to this point. In 2020, during the first lockdown, Palace chairman Steve Parish and sporting director Dougie Freedman used the football shutdown to re-evaluate and look ahead. Between them, they decided that it was time for the club to kick on. Roy Hodgson had brought some much-needed stability after Palace had reverted to a short-term policy after ditching the Frank de Boer experiment, but fans had grown weary of his pragmatic style, Palace had an ageing squad and a change was needed to take them to the next level. SPONSORED Parish had long wanted to push ahead, but the time they had to plan at the start of the pandemic accelerated the first phase of the revamp. A decision was made to stop new contracts for older players, with their high wage bill restricting their ability to make moves in the transfer market. A new profile of player would be targeted. Instead of going for experienced players, such as Gary Cahill, who it should be said excelled following his free transfer from Chelsea, Palace earmarked younger signings. Eberechi Eze and Nathan Ferguson were signed in the summer of 2020, while their transfer business last summer was almost flawless when you consider the impact of Marc Guehi, Joachim Andersen, Michael Olise, Conor Gallagher, Odsonne Edouard and Will Hughes. Once Hodgson informed Palace that he would be leaving at the end of the season, Parish started the search for a figurehead to lead the overhaul needed in his five-year plan. Palace started with a shortlist of 10 managers, split into two columns. On one side were the more experienced bosses, such as Lucien Favre and Nuno Espirito Santo. On the other, younger managers, including Frank Lampard and Steve Cooper. Freedman had laid out a style of play for the future when he sold his vision for the club to players such as Eze, and wanted a manager to fit that mould, as well as the structure in place where the head coach did not control everything. Freedman had built a recruitment team to draw up a list of players who would suit the new style based on data, before he would go and scout players in person. The Scot has been known to go and watch prospective signings more than 40 times before making a final decision on them. Such was the effort put into the new structure that it was crucial any manager could work within it. Palace interviewed and rejected two managers over their demands to have full control of transfer policy at the club. Vieira was well aware he was never first choice at Selhurst Park. He had his own demands, but was happy to work with Freedman and Parish and was pleased with the players being recommended. Michael Olise The appointment of the Frenchman has proved a masterstroke. Many doubted his appointed, but Vieira has thrived. The first thing he noticed was the need for a change in mentality. The three-time Premier League winner sensed an acceptance of failure and immediately moved to transform that. Palace now fear no one. They have beaten Manchester City away and held the champions to a draw at Selhurst Park, while thumping Tottenham and Arsenal in 3-0 wins at home. Having slashed £30million off their wage bill with the departure of players out of contract, Palace were ready to move quickly in the transfer market once Vieira was in place. A new-look central defence was formed. The signing of Andersen was considered a coup, but senior figures at Palace were more excited about the arrival of Guehi. Both have impressed, and Guehi has been made captain and took his bow with England in March. Palace are already prepared to replace Gallagher and will be an attractive prospect for signings. The real ace up their sleeve, though, has proved to be Olise. Palace signed the dynamic winger for just £8m, thanks to a clause in his Reading contract, and the Eagles believe there were as many as 25 other clubs interested in a move for the 20-year-old. That they were also able to sign Gallagher on loan from Chelsea relatively unopposed now seems astonishing, given his sparkling season. The midfielder, who cannot play on Sunday against his parent club, will return to Chelsea this summer and will leave a big hole in the Palace team. But, thanks to the hard work behind the scenes, Palace are already prepared to replace him and will be an attractive prospect for any prospective signings. Their trip to Wembley is another indication that everything at Palace is going to plan. ",positive,liverpool,0

Providing the German has recovered from his exertions at the Bernabeu, he is a must-start against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final. The £45million forward will never be everyone’s cup of tea, but Tuchel is finally getting a tune out of him and, right now, he is a part of Chelsea’s strongest attack. His future remains uncertain. There are doubts as to whether he is suited to Premier League football or if he will ever iron out the creases in his game to be a consistent goal-scorer at the highest level. He could go this summer, with Borussia Dortmund among the clubs interested in handing him an escape route. But for nuisance factor alone, he is carving out a role in Tuchel’s team — and at the Bernabeu on Tuesday he may have produced his finest performance in a Chelsea shirt. SPONSORED Real Madrid will not soon forget his contribution to a Champions League classic, with his wonderfully-taken goal putting Chelsea on the brink of an historic comeback. It was as spectacular as it was unexpected. Werner’s composure to ride the challenges of Casemiro and David Alaba in a frantic box before finding the bottom corner with his shot was out of keeping with the erratic finishing that has been so prevalent and frustrating since he arrived at Stamford Bridge. The Germany forward’s work-rate and ability to get behind defenders has never been in doubt, but his wastefulness and decision-making have undermined the good work he does elsewhere. Even at the Bernabeu there were the typically frustrating moments in the final third, but his relentless running off the shoulder of the last man constantly pulled Real out of shape. His goal crowned a wonderful display — and on the back of his double against Southampton last weekend, he is enjoying a purple patch that Tuchel cannot ignore as he bids to keep Chelsea’s season alive at Wembley. Top four may not be guaranteed, but it would take a remarkable collapse in the final weeks of the campaign to see Chelsea fail to qualify for the Champions League. So, after the defence of their European crown came to an end in Madrid, Tuchel will know the importance of ending the season on a high, with an FA Cup final to look forward to and the potential of a third piece of silverware of the campaign to go along with the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup. That they will face Manchester City or Liverpool if they progress past Palace will only add extra glamour and significance to the occasion. Victory could serve as an early statement of intent as they look to break the dominance of English football’s top two next season. It is far from clear whether Werner will be a part of that expected title challenge, with the balance of the Blues’ attack a key issue Tuchel plans to address. But his current form demands another start at Wembley — and maybe even suggests he could yet have a bright future at the club. ",positive,liverpool,1

That would mean takeovers by any of the groups would not involve the servicing of any debt, while the funding of a Stamford Bridge renovation is not be expected to be an issue.

The Eagles pair had been fitness doubts for the game at Wembley but Palace hope that both players will be ready to play as they look to reach a second FA Cup final in six years. Olise suffered a foot injury while away on international duty with France’s Under-21s last month and missed the 3-0 win over Arsenal and the 2-1 defeat against Leicester. Mitchell, meanwhile, was substituted in the first half of that loss at the King Power Stadium with a calf issue. But both are set to feature against Chelsea. Mitchell is likely to start at left-back but it remains to be seen whether Palace manager Patrick Vieira will risk Olise from the start. SPONSORED Vieira said on Friday: ""Tyrick [Mitchell] and Michael [Olise] have had some individual training and a little more today. We have to wait until tomorrow but they’ll only get involved if they're 100 per cent fit.” Palace will be without Conor Gallagher, who is ineligible to face his parent club. Chelsea rejected a request from Palace to allow the midfielder to play at Wembley. Vieira said: “The frustration is more for Conor. He played every single round, he has been doing really well, and not having the opportunity to be on the field and have this experience is something that he will miss. “But we knew that playing Chelsea would mean Conor would not take part.

Record signing Lukaku missed Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid due to an Achilles issue but has now rejoined group work at Cobham and is set to be fit to play at Wembley. His return is a boost for Chelsea, who will be looking to keep their season alive after their agonising European elimination. Whether Lukaku is picked to start is another matter. Callum Hudson-Odoi remains sidelined with his Achilles injury and Ben Chilwell (knee) is a long-term absentee, but other than that Thomas Tuchel has a fully-fit squad to choose from.

Captain Cesar Azpilicueta is likely to come into the back three, with Reece James switching over to right wing-back. Apart from in the quarter-final against Middlesbrough, Kepa Arrizabalaga has been Chelsea’s FA Cup goalkeeper this season and Tuchel faces a decision over whether to start him or Edouard Mendy against Palace. Mendy was preferred for the Carabao Cup Final against Liverpool and Tuchel could stick with his No1 given the importance of the game. “Romelu was back in training on Thursday,” said Tuchel on Friday. “Let’s see if he can get any reaction or not. “Except for Ben Chilwell and Calum Hudson-Odoi everybody seems to be OK.

73,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-making-big-mistake-picking-ten-hag-over-pochettino-b994118.html,Why Manchester United are making a big mistake picking Erik Ten Hag over Mauricio Pochettino,"here has long been a view that Manchester United need not just a new manager but a total ""cultural reset"" to address the drift which currently characterises the club, making the appointment of a permanent successor to interim head coach Ralf Rangnick so significant. If there is one (soon to be available) elite coach with a history of transforming the culture at a leading Premier League club, it is Mauricio Pochettino, which is why it feels like such a mistake that United are overlooking the former Tottenham boss for Ajax's Erik ten Hag. Pochettino's work at Spurs is widely celebrated (even if his lack of silverware is always a caveat) but a still underrated aspect of it is the way he transformed the culture of the club while building a great team. When the Argentine and his assistants arrived in north London in the summer of 2014, the club was a mess, still reeling from Tim Sherwood's scorched-earth policy. Pochettino found a magnificent training ground but a cold and fearful environment, with some players already pessimistic about the opening day visit to rivals West Ham. He set about completely changing the mentality of both the squad and the entire club, and soon there was no one at Spurs, from chairman Daniel Levy to the ground staff, who had not directly felt his influence. United appear in desperate need of the same kind of deep shake-up, which Ten Hag, who is first and foremost a training-ground coach, is unlikely to deliver. Erik ten Hag (right) has beaten Mauricio Pochettino in the race to become new Manchester United boss Pochettino, though, has the charisma, ego and, crucially, the experience to do the job, while he is also the perfect profile as a coach. Like Spurs, United want a manager who will promote young players, play progressive attacking football and, importantly, has the personality to get an unsettled squad to buy into his methods. Pochettino ticks these boxes, and more. There are far more question marks over Ten Hag, not least whether he is the right character for one of the biggest jobs in football. Spurs found him short of charisma when they interviewed him last summer (a factor, admittedly, somewhat undermined by their eventual appointment of Nuno Espirito Santo). In choosing Ten Hag, you cannot help but wonder if United are going for a safe option again, having previously shied away from approaching Antonio Conte. This concern would be to overlook Pochettino's diplomacy, however. True, he is moody, loves flirting with other clubs and is not averse to a public power-play, but Pochettino still spent five-and-a-half largely harmonious years working under Levy, and remains the only Spurs manager ever to be handed a contract extension by the chairman. He can only be gaining further experience in diplomacy at the circus that is Paris Saint-Germain, so there is no reason to think he is an especially risky choice politically, liable to rock the boat. And in many ways, Pochettino would actually be lower maintenance than Ten Hag. He comes with an established five-man coaching team and would have a clear idea about potential signings, so United would have been largely able to leave him to get on with the job. By contrast, the club will have to build a structure around Ten Hag (there is already talk of Steve McClaren or Robin van Persie returning as his assistant) and it is doubtful they have the expertise to replicate the building blocks in place at Ajax, which is one of the reasons why so many coaches are successful in Amsterdam but not elsewhere. There are other concerns about Ten Hag, including his lack of experience in a major league, but this decision should not be about the Dutchman's shortcomings, but rather Pochettino's strengths. Tottenham found Ten Hag short of charisma when they interviewed him... he lacks experience in a major league The suggestion that Pochettino has somehow damaged his reputation at PSG should be dismissed. The French side are as dysfunctional as any club in Europe and the success of Unai Emery, Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti since leaving the Parc des Princes proves that no manager should be judged on PSG's repeated Champions League humiliations. And his lack of silverware, while a lingering concern, really distracts from the remarkable work he did at Spurs. If anything, Pochettino's stock should have risen since he left Spurs given their sharp decline since, which he long forecast in repeated pleas to the club to refresh his squad. Looking back, it is clearer than ever that Pochettino was the most important person in Spurs' rise from 2014 to 2019, and United may come to regret passing up yet another chance to pursue him.

Arsenal had the chance to leapfrog rivals Tottenham back into fourth in the Premier League with a point at Selhurst Park last night, but instead they were beaten 3-0 by Patrick Vieira’s side. To make matters worse, Kieran Tierney missed the game with a knee injury that Arsenal fear could end his season and Thomas Partey limped off with a muscular problem. The Gunners are still in a strong position in the race to qualify for the Champions League as they are level on points with Tottenham, who will they will face in a rearranged derby on May 12, and have a game in hand. And Odegaard said: “We should have done much better, but there is no time to feel sorry for ourselves. We have to get back to work and think about the next game already. Today is tough, but we have to look forward. We have to learn from it obviously. “We have to look at the game, what we did wrong, and make sure it won’t happen again. It was a terrible game from us, from start to finish. Maybe a bit better in the last 10 minutes, but in general I think it was a really bad performance. “A lot of things went wrong. We weren’t really strong on the ball, we didn’t win any duels and we looked a bit slow from the start. We lacked the sharpness and aggressiveness we always have. “I think the fans were again brilliant here, cheering us on and I feel sorry for them. We have to apologise and we have got to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Hopefully next game we are back with a win.” Arsenal and Tottenham are neck and neck in the race to finish fourth, with all eyes on their clash next month. Martin Odegaard insists Arsenal cannot dwell on their humbling defeat by Crystal Palace A date for the derby, which was postponed in January due to Arsenal’s squad being decimated by Covid, injuries and international call-ups, was finally confirmed yesterday, but Odegaard is focusing on the present. “That’s really far ahead.

Follow all the reaction with Standard Sport’s LIVE blog below... 65 mins: Stellar defending at one end as Konate stands firm to repel Sterling’s cross after Liverpool are momentarily caught out. Then Ake brilliantly ensures that Salah is unable to get a shot away after a dangerous low ball fed in from Mane. 60 mins: City are dominating possession just at the moment, probing patiently and waiting for another opening to potentially tee up a grandstand finish. 58 mins: Mane into the book now for a cynical trip on Fernandinho. Approaching the hour mark at Wembley, with De Bruyne getting ready to enter the fray. 55 mins: Scuffles break out after a wild sliding challenge from Fernandinho on Mane. The City captain - always a master of avoiding yellows - was typically very fortunate already not to be in the book, but he certainly will be now. You wonder if Pep will consider quickly taking him off in a bid to avoid potentially going down to 10 men. 52 mins: Action at both ends at Wembley as Ake turns behind a dangerous free-kick intended for fellow Dutch defender Van Dijk, who almost gets his head to the resulting corner. Then Van Dijk does just enough to recover and put off Jesus, with Ake almost getting a touch to Foden’s corner. 49 mins: City far more lively at the start of this second half as they plot the unlikeliest of comebacks. Both Keita and Fabinho are now on yellow cards after the former goes in high on Fernandinho. 47 mins: City hit back within two minutes of the restart! Fernandinho feeds Jesus, who feins to shoot and terrifically turns inside Fabinho before teeing up Grealish, who blasts home from inside the box. Game on? Exactly what was required from Guardiola’s men. Back underway for the second half at Wembley. Is there any way back for City here? A Manchester City spokesperson has apologised to Liverpool after a small section of their fans continued singing during the pre-match minute’s silence to remember the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. Gary Lineker reports on BBC that the minute was cut short by referee Michael OIiver as a result. “Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute’s silence before today’s game,” said the City spokesman. “The Club sincerely apologises to all those connected with Liverpool Football Club.” ",negative,liverpool,7

Manchester City 0-3 Liverpool What a first half from Liverpool. City utterly blown away. The Reds are firmly on course for the FA Cup final on May 14. It will take one hell of a comeback from Guardiola and Co to rescue this. 46 mins: Game over before half-time? Brilliant football from Liverpool, with Thiago clipping a wonderful pass out to Mane after exchanging passes with Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the box. Mane’s spinning volley beats Steffen all ends up at his front post. Liverpool fans in dreamland. One of the worst 45 minutes you will ever see from Manchester City. 44 mins: That’s also a bad challenge from Ake on Keita that goes unpunished. City could easily have four or five players in the book in this dreadful first half. 41 mins: There’s a tidy flick from Salah at the other end, though a driven cross is seen off by Ake. Diaz then squares up Cancelo and tries to beat the Portuguese, who crudely barges him over and is fortunate to escape a yellow card. 39 mins: Liverpool have defended resolutely in this first half when required, with Diaz beating Stones in the air and Thiago then battling hard to dispossess Jesus after a floated free-kick into the box from Fernandinho that followed Keita’s foul on Silva. 37 mins: Liverpool are pressing so well here with an intensity that belies their hectic schedule as Silva is caught out by Keita, who quickly feeds Mane. Mane then tries to beat Stones, but the loose ball is gratefully gathered by Steffen. 35 mins: A crucial intervention from Cancelo stops Robertson in his tracks. City try to break, but Fabinho cynically trips compatriot Jesus from behind and joins him in the book. ",negative,liverpool,10

Mane is then scythed down by Silva, who also took out Fabinho a few minutes ago. The Portuguese is clearly trying to inject some much-needed fight into City here, but he needs to be careful. 29 mins: The goalkeeping blunders are contagious at Wembley as Alisson botches a clearance and almost provides Grealish with the chance to pull City back into the tie totally against the run of play. However, his long-range attempt is blocked and the Brazilian breathes a hefty sigh of relief. 27 mins: City are so sloppy again as Jesus has to race back to challenge Diaz, giving away a foul and receiving a yellow for the same cynical tackle that Fernandinho got away with only a few minutes before. City have got to wake up here. They haven’t started at all. 25 mins: As you might expect, Mane races in to close Steffen down once again. This time the City ‘keeper gets the ball clear from the Senegalese, but straight out of play on the far side. 24 mins: Liverpool still asking all the questions at Wembley as Salah floats in a ball that narrowly evades the head of Van Dijk. Another Salah cross then falls safe as City receive some much-needed respite. 22 mins: City are so rattled here as the noise continues from the jubilant Liverpool supporters. Captain Fernandinho chops down the lively Luis Diaz and is lucky to get away with just a warning from referee Michael Oliver. 19 mins: The television cameras pan to Ederson on the City bench... a penny for his thoughts right about now! The Brazilian escaped from the same situation with Diogo Jota at the Etihad last weekend, with Guardiola subsequently calling him “crazy”. Liverpool fans are celebrating like they’ve already reached the final. Deafening noise and plenty more pyro as the red smoke once again drifts across Wembley. 17 mins: It’s two! What a dreadful, dreadful error from Zack Steffen in the City goal. We saw Ederson get away with this last weekend, but his deputy certainly doesn’t. Stones feeds him the ball back and he takes an age to sort his feet out, trying to pick out a pass but allowing Mane the time to slide in and double Liverpool’s lead with the clock having not yet hit 20 minutes. A mountain to climb for City already at Wembley. 14 mins: City have tried to mount a quick response to that early setback, earning a corner off Van Dijk that was cleared. Now Foden does well behind Sterling to get his head on a Jesus cross from the right, but out comes Alisson to confidently pluck the ball high out of the air. ",positive,liverpool,8

It’s another magnificent leap from Konate, who fights off Gabriel Jesus and rises high above Ake to power a header from Robertson’s corner beyond Steffen. A third goal in as many games for Liverpool’s £36m summer signing. He scored similar goals in both Champions League quarter-final ties against Benfica. 8 mins: Liverpool are causing an uncertain City backline problems early on at Wembley, with Mane picking up space once again and earning a corner off Stones. 7 mins: City again are caught sleeping at the back, but Foden gets back to diligently do his defensive work in the corner. A clearance down the left flank sets Sterling loose, until he’s barged over in unsubtle fashion by Konate. 5 mins: A couple of nervy moments at the back for City now as Zinchenko gives the ball away cheaply and Liverpool quickly pounce, though Guardiola’s men wake up to thwart the danger. The playing surface at Wembley is almost split evenly down the middle in terms of bright sunshine and dark shadow. Robertson pouring down that left flank for Liverpool as usual. 4 mins: The first chance of the afternoon falls for City, with the ball sitting up nicely inside the box for Grealish, whose low drive is well blocked by Van Dijk. Grealish has been busy early on here, looking to make a nuisance of himself playing off the front. A big chance for the £100m man today. 2 mins: Both teams feeling each other out early on, with some early City nerves as a routine clearance is punted straight out of play on the near side. It looks like Grealish is in the De Bruyne role for City, with Silva sitting much deeper than usual and Foden operating off the left. We are underway at Wembley! Will it be Liverpool’s quadruple hopes that end today, or City’s bid for a treble? Time to find out. Let’s hope for another cracker between the two best teams in English football... Before kick-off, we will have a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. It was the 33rd anniversary of the disaster on Friday. Disappointed to report there was a small section of City fans that definitely did not respect that silence. Here come the teams to a cacophony of noise at Wembley.

Ajax boss Ten Hag has agreed to become the new permanent United manager at the end of the season and, barring any last-minute hiccups, will sign a four-year contract at Old Trafford. An announcement is not expected until after Ajax face PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Cup Final on Sunday. Ten Hag wants to bring his assistant Mitchell van der Gaag with him to United and could also add the likes of Van Persie, Steve McClaren and Rene Meulensteen to his backroom team. Former Arsenal forward Van Persie, who won the title at United in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in 2012-13, is currently coaching at Feyenoord. He is also working with their academy, where his son Shaqueel plays. Robin van Persie is currently coaching in the Eredivisie at Feyenoord Former England manager McClaren, meanwhile, has been out of work since he was sacked by QPR in 2019. McClaren was assistant manager to Ferguson when United won the Treble in 1999 and could also be in line for a return to Old Trafford. Meulensteen is another potential candidate, with the former Fulham manager and current Australia assistant having previously worked at United as a first-team coach under Ferguson between 2007-13 and also took charge of the youth and reserve teams. Van der Gaag is a former Motherwell defender who was promoted to assistant manager at Ajax by Ten Hag at the start of this season. He has previously been manager at several clubs including NAC Breda, Excelsior, Maritimo in Portugal and the Ajax reserve side. Ten Hag will replace Ralf Rangnick, who has been doing the job on an interim basis since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November. Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino had also been considered by United along with the likes of Spain’s Luis Enrique and Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui, though they have opted against appointing the former Tottenham manager. RB Leipzig were also interested in making Ten Hag their new head coach but the 52-year-old has chosen United instead. ",positive,liverpool,0

As the now three-horse race to buy the club from Roman Abramovich reaches its final stages, Chelsea are battling to keep their on-pitch campaign alive this weekend after a valiant but ultimately agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid in Spain. But Thomas Tuchel’s side are likely to face another stern test from capital rivals Palace as they bid to reach their 16th FA Cup final overall and fifth in the last six years. The revamped Eagles are enjoying a successful first season under Patrick Vieira, with their style of play revolutionised and a top-half finish well within their grasp. They have taken four points off both Manchester City and Arsenal this season, so performing at their best in big games hasn’t been a problem. After seeing a seven-match unbeaten run spoiled by Leicester last time out, Palace are aiming to seal a third FA Cup final appearance and first since 2016, when they lost in extra-time to Manchester United. The winner of this one will face Liverpool in the final, after they beat Man City 3-2 in thrilling fashion on Saturday. Chelsea vs Crystal Palace is scheduled for a 4:30pm BST kick-off today, Sunday April 17, 2022. The match will take place at Wembley Stadium in London. TV channel: Today’s semi-final tie will be broadcast live on ITV, with coverage beginning at 3:45pm. Live stream: Television license-fee payers can also catch the game live online via the ITV website or ITV Hub. Live blog: You can also follow all the action via Standard Sport’s live match blog, with James Robson at Wembley. Romelu Lukaku should be fit for Chelsea after returning to training in the aftermath of an Achilles injury that saw him sidelined for the midweek trip to Madrid. However, Callum Hudson-Odoi remains out with his own Achilles issue and Ben Chilwell (knee) is a long-term absentee. Ross Barkley has recovered from the bout of illness that saw him miss out at the Bernabeu, meanwhile. Palace are still waiting on the fitness of Tyrick Mitchell (calf) and Michael Olise (foot), with both players able to take part in some individual training ahead of Sunday’s game. But Vieira has warned that he won’t risk either key player if they are not 100 per cent fit and ready to feature. The unlucky Nathan Ferguson is definitely out, while Will Hughes has also been carrying a knock. Chelsea loanee Conor Gallagher is ineligible to face his parent club after a request from Palace allowing him to play was denied. Chelsea will have exerted a lot of energy during their epic but ultimately unsuccessful comeback bid in Madrid, so Palace will sense a real chance to reach May’s final. Tuchel must keep things fresh in a bid to ward off exhaustion against a Palace side full of trickery and pacey attacking flair, spearheaded by Wilfried Zaha but without the industry and guile of Gallagher. We are anticipating a cagey, tense affair at Wembley that may even require extra time. But in the end, Chelsea should have enough to come out on top. Chelsea to win, 1-0. Hakim Ziyech notched a last-gasp winner when these two sides last met in the Premier League at Selhurst Park in February, while Marcos Alonso, Christian Pulisic and Trevoh Chalobah were all on target in a 3-0 victory on the opening weekend of the season at Stamford Bridge. In fact, Palace have lost all of their last nine meetings against Chelsea, last winning in October 2017. Chelsea wins: 33 Crystal Palace wins: 12 Draws: 15 ",positive,liverpool,1

The latest slip-up provides further encouragement for fellow top-four hopefuls Manchester United, who edged past Norwich thanks to a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo. Mikel Arteta has conceded it is increasingly unlikely that Thomas Partey will play again this season. Partey limped off with a thigh injury in the 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace earlier this month and Arsenal fear the midfielder will not return until the summer. Speaking ahead of the trip to Southampton, Arteta provided a worrying update on Partey. “The news that we got after having another assessment was not great,” said the Arsenal manager. “It is not looking very positive [for] his availability this season, but we will have to wait and see. He is trying to get back as quick as possible, but at the moment we are not very optimistic about it. “At the moment it is not ideal and we knew that towards the end of the season one of the key elements was going to be having the team available and the squad available as much as possible.” Arsenal might be catching Southampton at the wrong time. While the Saints looked on the beach already prior to the Chelsea game, the manner of that result should prompt some sort of a reaction from a team who, while capable of losing by such big margins, do boast quality on their day. 1-1 draw. It will be fascinating to see how Arteta tackles his left-back problem. In the loss at home to Brighton, Granit Xhaka was deployed out of position in place of Nuno Tavares after his poor performance away at Crystal Palace. Arteta has hinted that Xhaka will continue in the role this weekend, while Alexandre Lacazette should be available after missing a few training sessions for private reasons. Elsewhere, Arsenal will surely look to change things up in midfield too, particularly with the double pivot of Martin Odegaard and Albert Sambi Lokonga being dominated all too often. Certainly, there’s a lot of questions to answer for Arteta, who has a fairly small squad already and will likely be without both Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey for the rest of the season. Takehiro Tomiyasu should return to full training after this weekend. Predicted XI: Ramsdale; Cedric, White, Gabriel, Xhaka; Odegaard, Lokonga, Smith Rowe; Saka, Lacazette, Martinelli. Ralph Hasenhuttl will surely make changes after the miserable home loss to Chelsea. Indeed, his team have reacted well to similar results in the past and star striker Armando Broja is once again available after being ineligible to face his parent club. Alex McCarthy, Shane Long and Lyanco all face late fitness tests.

Problems to solve at both ends of the pitch for Arteta - we’ll soon find out what his solutions are! So, so important that Arsenal get back to winning ways. There was a lot of positivity around the club before the international break, but defeats to Crystal Palace and Brighton since then have really dampened the mood. Trip to Stamford Bridge to come in midweek, then the Gunners welcome Man United to the Emirates before facing West Ham away from home. Tough run coming up for Mikel Arteta’s side - got to get the three points this afternoon. Currently 0-0 in north London, between Tottenham and Brighton. Both sides could have been reduced to ten-men in the opening 45 minutes - very little in the way of goalmouth action.

Bednarek goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","outhampton vs Arsenal LIVE! Arsenal’s faltering quest for Champions League qualification suffered another setback after they slipped to an uninspiring 1-0 Premier League loss at Southampton. Tottenham’s shock home defeat to Brighton in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off offered the Gunners the chance to move level on points with their fourth-placed north London rivals. But Mikel Arteta’s men blew a major opportunity to capitalise at St Mary’s as Jan Bednarek’s strike on the stroke of half-time condemned them to a fourth defeat from five games. The Gunners found Fraser Forster in inspired form, with the Southampton goalkeeper making stunning saves to deny Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe. SPONSORED Arsenal still have game in hand over Spurs, albeit that’s an extremely tough trip to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in midweek. The latest slip-up provides further encouragement for fellow top-four hopefuls Manchester United, who edged past Norwich thanks to a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo. Mikel Arteta has conceded it is increasingly unlikely that Thomas Partey will play again this season. Partey limped off with a thigh injury in the 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace earlier this month and Arsenal fear the midfielder will not return until the summer. Speaking ahead of the trip to Southampton, Arteta provided a worrying update on Partey. “The news that we got after having another assessment was not great,” said the Arsenal manager. “It is not looking very positive [for] his availability this season, but we will have to wait and see. He is trying to get back as quick as possible, but at the moment we are not very optimistic about it. “At the moment it is not ideal and we knew that towards the end of the season one of the key elements was going to be having the team available and the squad available as much as possible.” Arsenal might be catching Southampton at the wrong time. While the Saints looked on the beach already prior to the Chelsea game, the manner of that result should prompt some sort of a reaction from a team who, while capable of losing by such big margins, do boast quality on their day. 1-1 draw. It will be fascinating to see how Arteta tackles his left-back problem. In the loss at home to Brighton, Granit Xhaka was deployed out of position in place of Nuno Tavares after his poor performance away at Crystal Palace. Arteta has hinted that Xhaka will continue in the role this weekend, while Alexandre Lacazette should be available after missing a few training sessions for private reasons. Elsewhere, Arsenal will surely look to change things up in midfield too, particularly with the double pivot of Martin Odegaard and Albert Sambi Lokonga being dominated all too often. Certainly, there’s a lot of questions to answer for Arteta, who has a fairly small squad already and will likely be without both Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey for the rest of the season. Takehiro Tomiyasu should return to full training after this weekend. Predicted XI: Ramsdale; Cedric, White, Gabriel, Xhaka; Odegaard, Lokonga, Smith Rowe; Saka, Lacazette, Martinelli. Ralph Hasenhuttl will surely make changes after the miserable home loss to Chelsea. Indeed, his team have reacted well to similar results in the past and star striker Armando Broja is once again available after being ineligible to face his parent club. Alex McCarthy, Shane Long and Lyanco all face late fitness tests.

Arsenal paid £8million to sign the Portuguese youngster last summer yet his form has been inconsistent, resulting in a poor performance at Crystal Palace earlier this month before he was dropped by Mikel Arteta. A three-time league title winner in north London, ex-Gunners left-back Winterburn does not believe Tavares is defensively equipped to succeed in the position. “I just don't think he fully understands the complete role of a full-back and I think there's a lot more he needs to learn defensively in terms of the situations he puts himself in,” Winterburn told the Mirror. “He needs to learn that side of the game very quickly and get back to the form going forward that he showed earlier in the season. SPONSORED “The problem is when you've had a couple of games like the ones he's had, then your confidence just drops so quickly. You can also lose the trust of the supporters, so it makes it difficult to come back when that happens.” Kieran Tierney’s injury absence has put Arteta in a tricky spot, with Granit Xhaka moved to left-back for the loss to Brighton and Winterburn is not confident in Tavares coming back into the side. “It's hard to say what's happened when you're looking from the outside, but it seems his level of performance has dropped,” he continued. “I'm not sure if that's down to the amount he's played or if it's a confidence issue. For me, I don't see him at this minute in time as a viable option for Arsenal due to his performances. He played well in certain games at the start of the season when Tierney was out injured.” ",negative,liverpool,0

Tottenham blew a chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place in the Premier League as they suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Brighton on Saturday. Antonio Conte's side produced a lacklustre display and looked set for a frustrating stalemate before Leandro Trossard made things even worse with a 90th-minute winner. After four successive wins the pre-match mood in north London was one of optimism but Tottenham's performance was in stark contrast to the bright spring sunshine. They managed only one goal attempt in a dismal first-half in which Brighton were by far the better side. SPONSORED Spurs showed a little more urgency after the break with Son Heung-min twice having shots blocked, but Brighton always carried the greater goal threat and deservedly took the points when Trossard cut in from the left and beat Hugo Lloris with a low angled shot with the outside of his foot.

After a heavy defeat to Crystal Palace in their last match, the Gunners really needed a response to get their Champions League ambitions back on track heading into the final few weeks of the season. But it was another dreadful display from Mikel Arteta’s side, as Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu got on the scoresheet to put the Seagulls in control. Martin Odegaard’s deflected strike pulled one back late on, but there was to be no miraculous comeback. It leaves Arsenal level on points with Tottenham, who play Aston Villa later on Saturday. Spurs will have played a game more after that match, though Arsenal’s game in hand is away to Chelsea. Granit Xhaka was preferred at left-back for Arsenal over Nuno Tavares, leaving the Gunners without the Swiss international and Thomas Partey in midfield. Brighton started much the better of the two sides, with Arsenal showing the kind of sluggish performance in possession that saw them turned over by Palace. A brief moment of optimism in attack came when Gabriel headed Bukayo Saka’s cross into the side netting, but it was the Seagulls who took the lead shortly after. Mwepu got on the end of a long ball forward, played a great cut-back into the path of Trossard who was completely free in the box and took full advantage to fire past Aaron Ramsdale. The Gunners thought they had gone themselves level seconds before the break. A corner was swung in deep, Gabriel headed it back across the face of goal and Martinelli nodded home. However, after a four-minute VAR check, it was ruled out for offside. Martinelli was moved to left-back in the second-half as Mikel Arteta pushed for an equaliser. Saka blazed a shot over the bar when it fell to him in plenty of space on the edge of the box. There was little in the way of clear-cut chances for the Gunners though, and it got even worse for them midway through the half. It was a lovely move from Brighton, with Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo combining brilliantly to set up Mwepu, who swept a stunning finish into the bottom corner. Nicolas Pepe was denied by Lewis Dunk and Albert Sambi Lokonga fired a shot just wide from distance, before Odegaard and Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar in a matter of seconds in a chaotic passage of play. Odegaard gave his side hope of late drama, when his shot from miles out flicked off Danny Welbeck and looped beyond Robert Sanchez. The board then went up for six minutes of added-time as the Emirates crowd roared their side on. Sanchez produced a stunning save to deny Nketiah but Brighton held on, leaving Arsenal to ponder why it took them nearly 90 minutes to really pile the pressure on. ",positive,liverpool,0
91,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-arteta-southampton-top-four-b994366.html,Arsenal: Goals once again the issue as Mikel Arteta looks to avoid unwanted record and stabilise top-four push,"ikel Arteta has learned how to navigate storms during his time at Arsenal — and now he is hoping to negotiate another one that is brewing. More than any other club, Arsenal seem to lurch from calm to crisis, but Arteta has always successfully managed to steady the ship. Under the Spaniard, they have never lost three games in a row in all competitions, despite losing two on the spin seven times, and Arteta will be desperate to keep that record in tact when Arsenal play at Southampton on Saturday. Defeats by Crystal Palace and Brighton since the international break have allowed Tottenham to leapfrog them into fourth place in the Premier League and, ahead of games against Chelsea and Manchester United next week, Arsenal need to get back to winning ways. “We know that this route is taking us nowhere, especially where we want to be,” said Arteta after last Saturday’s home defeat by Brighton. SPONSORED If Arsenal are to rediscover the form that had many last month tipping them to qualify for the Champions League, then they need Alexandre Lacazette to start firing. The striker’s last goal from open play came against Saturday’s opponents on December 11. Since then, the Frenchman has only found the net twice — and both of those came from penalties. Lacazette’s woes leave Arteta in a difficult position, as the prospect of dropping him is hardly an appealing one. Arsenal’s captaincy struggles this season are well known, and benching their current skipper with eight games to go would surely only add to that. There is also the issue of who is a genuine alternative to Lacazette. Eddie Nketiah, Arsenal’s only other recognised striker, has not scored a Premier League goal all season. Gabriel Martinelli could be moved into the middle, but there are questions about his ability to lead the line. Lacazette’s lack of goals is a problem but during Arsenal’s good run in February and March, his link-up play was allowing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Martinelli to flourish around him. “We need to score more goals, that’s for sure — and that’s a collective issue,” Arteta said last week, when quizzed about Lacazette’s form. This is a young Arsenal team and they are already lacking in senior players, given Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey are out through injury. Dropping Lacazette would reduce that number further — and there is also the issue of deciding what to do with Granit Xhaka. The midfielder filled in at left-back last week against Brighton, but you could sense his hunger to shift centrally and influence the game more. Against Southampton, with Partey still sidelined, returning Xhaka to his preferred role could give Arsenal some much-needed stability. Their top-four hopes are far from dead, and they are just three points off Spurs in fourth, with a game in hand and the north London derby to come next month. Arteta has, however, been here before, and that should give him confidence. The rescheduled Tottenham game comes after matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, which is why Arsenal must find form now. If they cannot click against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, then that does not bode well for the tougher tests ahead. Arteta has, however, been here before, and that should give him confidence. The first time Arsenal lost two games in the spin under him, the second of those defeats came against Brighton. Then, just like now, questions were being asked of Arsenal, but they responded by beating Southampton. After losing against Brighton last weekend and suffering two defeats in succession, Arteta will be hoping history repeats itself on Saturday. ",positive,liverpool,0

His return is a boost for Chelsea, who will be looking to keep their season alive after their agonising European elimination. Whether Lukaku is picked to start is another matter. Callum Hudson-Odoi remains sidelined with his Achilles injury and Ben Chilwell (knee) is a long-term absentee, but other than that Thomas Tuchel has a fully-fit squad to choose from.

The co-owner of the NBA’s Boston Celtics and Serie A side Atalanta says he will make a “significant and credible” offer for the European champions ahead of Thursday’s deadline. And he has vowed to keep the trophies rolling in if he wins the race to buy out Roman Abramovich. The American billionaire has been silent since being shortlisted by US bank Raine Group alongside the Ricketts family, Toddy Boehly and Sir Martin Broughton. But he has now declared his intentions, revealing: He also vowed never to damage the heritage of the club. Pagliuca was a surprise inclusion in Raine’s list of preferred bidders, with his interest largely kept a secret. He explained: “This process has been a disconcerting time for the football club and fans. Throughout my life and career, my ethos has always been to operate quietly, with integrity, and let my actions and results speak loudly. Stephen Pagliuca also co-owns the NBA’s Boston Celtics and Atalanta in Serie A “However, it is imperative to clarify and assure supporters about our bid group and its commitments, to emphasise how seriously we take our potential responsibility to Chelsea. “Ultimately, fans will see our commitment and, we hope, trust us to stay true to our values on and off the pitch. We understand the responsibilities that come with such an important sporting institution and hold ourselves accountable to the fans. “Later this week, we will submit a substantial and credible bid proposal – one that we expect will meet the respective requirements and regulations of the Premier League, UK Government and UEFA – and we pledge to honor our commitment to credibility and good guardianship of Chelsea Football Club from day one.” Pagliuca confirmed his commitment to keep Chelsea at the top of European football, adding: “Our first focus and goal is to make strategic investments to continue competing for championships and trophies. “We will support our players and managers to make sure that Chelsea are habitual winners and title contenders, whether in the Premier League, Champions League or the Women’s Super League [the only Super League we intend competing in, for the record]. In addition, we will continue to invest in the youth academy to develop the stars of the future and we would not be in this process if we did not have an exciting and inclusive vision for Chelsea. “Our second focus will be to continue to cherish and preserve the legacy and traditions of the club. In over 20 years of ownership of the Boston Celtics, we have not once considered changing the name, colours, or logo of the club. This is our guarantee to Chelsea fans. “Not only are we committed to remaining at the home of Chelsea, Stamford Bridge, but we are inspired to renovate or redevelop the stadium. Chelsea is a world-class team, in a world-class city, with world-class fans: it deserves a world-class stadium.” Chelsea Supporters’ Trust (CST) revealed last week that Pagliuca was the only bidder not to reach out to them during the takeover process. Pagliuca insists he will run an inclusive club if successful in his bid. He said: “We believe passionately that clubs have a social responsibility, and we will continue to support The Chelsea Foundation and its impressive work in education, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion both locally and globally. “Chelsea should be the Pride of London for its on and off-field accomplishments.

Regardless of other results this weekend, two wins — against Derby and then Preston at home on Tuesday — will be enough to take Fulham up. Fulham lost 3-1 at home against Coventry on a rare off-day last Sunday, but Silva insists they are not feeling the pressure of getting over the line. “I don’t see a reason for there to be any pressure,” he said. “It is normal in our job and we have to be comfortable dealing with this pressure and to face the challenge.” Elsewhere in the Championship, Millwall face Preston and Hull over the next four days as they bid to gatecrash the play-offs.

Antonio Conte's side produced a lacklustre display and looked set for a frustrating stalemate before Leandro Trossard made things even worse with a 90th-minute winner.

The 20-year-old Albania international has hit nine goals in 32 appearances this season, his first in the Premier League, to draw big interest from Southampton and other clubs in a summer transfer. As the deadline for takeover bids to buy Chelsea arrived on Thursday, the Saints boss said: “We are discussing this topic in the moment. “We all know the situation at Chelsea that there are a lot of changes there.

The Hammers will be fielding an almost entirely second-choice back-four in tonight’s quarter-final second leg against Lyon. Kurt Zouma is injured and could be out for the season, while Aaron Cresswell is suspended following a controversial red card in last week’s first leg. Those two join long-term absentee Angelo Ogbonna in only being able to watch on as West Ham bid to make history. What was already a difficult task for a squad new to these occasions has become an even greater challenge in the space of a week. West Ham have already done remarkable things this season. The Hammers stormed their group, remain in a fight for the Premier League’s top six, and knocked Sevilla, the kings of the Europa League, out in the last round. SPONSORED Now they face a second leg at another established European side. The pressure of these occasions is something to relish rather than fear, but Moyes does not want his players to treat it as a novelty. The Scot has transformed the mentality in his squad but is now tasking his players to go a step further. If West Ham are to progress to the semi-finals, where either Barcelona or Eintracht Frankfurt await, their key figures must stand up and be counted. “We have a great chance,” said Moyes. “To be at 1-1 is a really powerful position. We’ve got a wee bit of toughness about us we can show. We played 45 minutes with 10 men last week, let’s see what we can do with 11. “We have to show our levels of quality, they need to rise. We’ve probably showed our best qualities in this tournament, against Sevilla especially. So we have to do that. It’s a big game and tough game, but we’ve been good this year when we’ve been challenged. “Against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, we’ve been challenged, and in the main we’ve risen to the challenge. Let’s hope we can do that again.” Moyes and his squad must draw on those occasions tonight. When they beat Liverpool, they did so having lost Ogbonna to injury in the first half, while Zouma was forced off in the win against Chelsea. In those encounters, West Ham showed plenty of character and a cutting edge when counter-attacking which has evaded them in most games since. However, West Ham have a knack for the big moments, and Moyes has his side bursting with confidence. Another cornerstone of West Ham’s rise under Moyes has been the reliability of certain figures. This is a shot at history and a chance for the Hammers to truly establish themselves in Europe. Whether it be Michail Antonio causing problems in the forward line or Declan Rice dominating midfield, the Hammers are at their best when those players are driving them. They, too, must draw on performances earlier this season to get past Lyon. Antonio has not scored in the Premier League since New Year’s Day and has just one goal in the FA Cup since then. Despite setting high standards earlier this season, Rice has been ineffective in West Ham’s last two outings. These are the moments when the best players stand up. This is a shot at history and a chance for the Hammers to truly establish themselves in Europe. ",positive,liverpool,2

Sunday’s one-sided triumph in the 2020/21 showpiece delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic means Emma Hayes’ side complete a belated and historic domestic treble, having also won the Women’s Super League (WSL) title and League Cup last term. Chelsea made a dream start to the occasion as they looked to inflict revenge on Jonas Eidevall’s in-form WSL leaders, to whom they lost in the season opener back in September, going in front after only three minutes. Arsenal repeatedly failed to clear their lines as dangerous duo Kerr and Kirby tried to combine, with the latter left clear to fire coolly beyond the helpless Manuela Zinsberger. Kerr was hurt during the build-up to that early goal, but she quickly returned and almost made it 2-0 just minutes later, only to be thwarted by Zinsberger. Kerr was later denied what looked a clear penalty after being wiped out by Jennifer Beattie while providing a brilliant cut-back for strike partner Kirby. Vivianne Miedema’s strike was deflected high and wide during a rare foray forward for below-par Arsenal, who were then indebted to Zinsberger again as she scrambled low to her left to tip wide a fine strike from the relentless Kirby, who reached a century of Chelsea goals in the recent 5-0 WSL rout of Birmingham. Captain Magda Eriksson headed wide from the subsequent corner as the chances just kept on coming, with Guro Reiten just struggling to get a shot away before Kirby’s latest drive was deflected wide. Millie Bright volleyed well wide before Kerr curled an effort against the crossbar after brushing aside the challenge of Lotte Wubben-Moy. Arsenal could realistically have been four or five-nil behind, but began to come into the game after swapping Beth Mead and Katie McCabe and playing Stephanie Catley in a more advanced role, while they had a seemingly cast-iron penalty shout of their own turned down when the otherwise hugely influential Erin Cuthbert handled on the floor. However, they failed to muster a single shot on target and only a poor pass from Kirby to Kerr saw an incisive Chelsea counter-attack falter before the interval. The Blues began the second half in confident fashion, though Kim Little began to link play nicely for Arsenal from her no10 role, with Mead showing great feet to turn Eriksson before being dispossessed by a well-timed sliding challenge in the box from Jess Carter. Catley produced a vital defensive header at the back post and Zinsberger had to be alert again to keep out Kerr’s header after good work from Cuthbert out wide. However, the prolific Australian would not be denied much longer as she collected a long ball forward and pushed a shot through the legs of Wubben-Moy and in at the near post with Zinsberger unsighted. Arsenal went for broke with several attacking changes, but it mattered little as Kerr added a delightful third with a sublime dinked finish after Kirby - who went off to a standing ovation with a knee issue - had thumped a strike off the post.

Beth Mead gave the Gunners an early lead at the King Power inside two minutes, but Leicester then held firm until midway throught the second period. Arsenal then ran riot though, with striker Miedema scoring twice in two minutes. An own goal from Ashleigh Plumptre made it four, before Tobin Heath rounded off the scoring shortly after coming off the bench. The win was a positive result for Arsenal as they bounced back from Champions League disappointment, after Wolfsburg knocked them out in midweek. It lifted the Gunners two points above Chelsea, before Emma Hayes’ side were in action later in the day. “What Chelsea do doesn’t matter at all,” Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall told BBC Sport. “We can prepare for the games we are playing, we can control our own performances. I’m just as motivated if we’re on top at the moment or if we’re number two. “We need to keep on believing, keep on preparing, keep on performing, and who knows where it takes us in the end. But we can only do whatever we can do.” Later on Saturday, Chelsea thrashed Reading 5-0 following braces from both Sam Kerr and Beth England to return to the summit. Earlier in the afternoon, Leah Galton got the only goal of the game as Manchester United beat Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 to re-open a three-point cushion over fourth-placed Manchester City, who beat West Ham United 2-0 on Saturday. Tottenham’s Champions League hopes took a significant hit as they were beaten 1-0 by Aston Villa, with Ramona Petzelberger scoring the winner in the 87th-minute. They are now ten points behind United in third, but do have two games in hand. Bottom side Birmingham City battled to a scoreless draw with Everton on Friday. Trailing Leicester by seven points, they look almost certain to be relegated. Additional reporting by Reuters. ",positive,liverpool,0

Two goals each for Lauren Hemp and Georgia Stanway secured yet another victory in the Lionesses’ march towards next year’s tournament Down Under. Ella Toone also got on the scoresheet as England pushed their qualification goal tally to a whopping 68 goals in eight matches, all of which have been won without conceding a goal. A dominant win in front of a bumper 15,348 attendance at Windsor Park in Belfast keeps England five points ahead of Austria at the top of Group D with just two matches remaining. The hosts could ill-afford to lose further ground in their push for second place and were grateful for an offside flag after White netted on the rebound after Beth Mead's strike was parried by Jackie Burns. But they fell behind three minutes later in curious circumstances as Toone's centre from the left was met by Hemp, who did not seem to connect cleanly but the ball looped up and went in at the far post. It was no less than England deserved and, although Northern Ireland were able to keep the deficit to just one goal at the interval, the floodgates opened in the second half. White came close to getting on the scoresheet upon the resumption before Toone did so with a composed first-time finish after Lucy Bronze had bustled her way into the box before cutting back. Northern Ireland came close to an immediate response but Lauren Wade was denied by Mary Earps before Hemp shut the door on an unlikely comeback after rounding Burns and slotting into an empty net. The industrious Toone then jinked her way into the area in the 70th minute and unselfishly teed up Stanway to rifle beyond Burns. Nine minutes later the rout was completed with Stanway on target again after a header back across goal led to the Manchester City midfielder reacting quickly to get a shot away and the ball trickled in. Merely avoiding defeat against Austria in their penultimate qualifying match in September will be enough to send Sarina Wiegman’s side to Australia and New Zealand for next year’s World Cup.

West Ham fear the defender could be out for the rest of the season after an ankle injury sustained at Brentford on Sunday. It means Moyes will have to go into Thursday’s tie, which is poised at 1-1, with a second choice central partnership of Craig Dawson and Issa Diop.

The Hammers arrive in France with the tie finely poised at 1-1 following a first leg in which Peter Bosz’s side used every trick in the book to get under the skin of their hosts, which resulted in Aaron Cresswell being sent off. Former Fulham man Moussa Dembele was seen winking at a team-mate after drawing the foul which led to Cresswell’s dismissal, and David Moyes warned last week that football can come back to bite you. Antonio insisted that the antics from last week were not needed to bring an edge to this quarter-final, but warned their Ligue 1 hosts that the Hammers were up for a fight. “There’s always an edge,” said Antonio. “It’s a quarter-final. We know we need to go out there and win. Last week was edgy, tonight is going to be edgy and tonight there’s going to be a fight.” SPONSORED Moyes was critical of his side’s performance at the London Stadium last week and is now without France international Kurt Zouma, who is sidelined with an ankle injury, as well as Cresswell. Despite those setbacks, West Ham are still pushing to go all the way, having battled their way from relegation scraps to the last eight in Europe. “The way things are going now, we’re going to win it,” said a defiant Antonio. “We’re in it to win it. When we’ve had knock-backs, we’ve always come back from them. Last week [in the first leg], we showed our resilience. “We believe we can come here and win the game. That’s the plan. It’s been a physical season, a lot of games, but you can see the resilience we have. “It’s a great opportunity for us. It’s a dream come true to get this far and we’re not going to let anyone take it from us. “One thing the gaffer has given us is the self-belief that we can beat anybody. That’s the confidence he has given us — to go out there and give your all to win the games.” Antonio has scored just twice since the turn of the year and, while putting in encouraging performances, Moyes has said now is the time for him to deliver. “I’m disappointed I’ve not scored in a while,” said Antonio. “This is the longest streak I’ve had of not scoring a goal in my career.

Lanzini then runs at the Lyon defence, can’t beat his man though. 41 mins: Free-kick for West Ham and up come the defenders again. NEARLY! Wow they nearly scored again. Soucek completely free at the back post, heads it across the face of goal but none of his teammates can get on the end of it. Craig Dawson scoring in a European quarter-final...

Pass isn’t the best but West Ham work it out to the left. Johnson’s cross is headed out to Fornals on the edge of the box who goes for goal first-time. Tame effort, straight at Pollersbeck. West Ham are hanging on a bit here. Moyes wants a show of character this evening and they will need just that to get through this opening spell and silence the crowd. The Hammers are struggling to deal with Lyon at the moment. 14 mins: Lyon are playing some lovely football, they’ve started really well. Another flowing move ends with Ekambi drilling a great ball across the face of goal, Dembele can’t react in time to turn it home at the back post. 11 mins: HOW HAVE LYON NOT SCORED?! Chaos in the West Ham six-yard box. Such a dangerous cross from Gusto and it causes all sorts of problems for the defence. Dawson and Coufal both don’t deal with it. Dembele and Aouar try and bundle it in, penalty appeals... nothing given. 9 mins: Taken quickly, Lanzini gets to the byline and cuts it back. Clearence is shanked, nearly comes back to Dawson but Lyon do a proper job of clearing the danger at the second time of asking. 8 mins: Antonio holds the ball up nicely with his first real touch of the match. Bowen then drifts past Mendes and wins a cheap free-kick for his side, as they look to grow into the game. 6 mins: EKAMBI HITS THE POST! Real let-off for West Ham. Ekambi is allowed to drive into the box, he cuts inside onto his right foot and drills a low effort at the near post. Areola is very grateful that it smacks against the post, not sure he was getting down in time. It’s then fired over the bar from a tight angle. 3 mins: West Ham happy to let Lyon knock the ball around in defence, no desire to push right up the pitch in the early minutes. They’ll be looking to keep this tight for the first 20 minutes or so, which would certainly quieten down this crowd. 1 min: Fornals is in behind with less than 20 seconds on the clock and he drags a shot wide of the far post. Offside flag then goes up, wouldn’t have counted anyway. Positive start though. There are a fair few empty seats in the home end here in Lyon but the hosts are doing a good job of creating a big atmosphere. The West Ham end is almost completely covered in smoke thanks to some flares from behind Areola’s goal. ",positive,liverpool,0

The two sides played out a heated match, which City won 1-0 on aggregate after a goalless draw last night, and it boiled over towards the end after Atletico defender Felipe was sent off following a late tackle on Phil Foden which earned him a second booking. Atletico and City players had to be pulled apart, while tempers flared once again after the final whistle. Players clashed in the tunnel at the Wanda Metropolitano, with staff from both teams ensuring they were kept apart and police also getting involved. UEFA were this morning waiting for the referee’s report before deciding whether to launch an investigation. A UEFA ethics and disciplinary inspector could be appointed to ascertain exactly what transpired. Footage from the tunnel on social media shows City midfielder Jack Grealish and Atletico defender Stefan Savic exchanging heated words and being kept apart by team-mates. SPONSORED City were unhappy with Savic, who spent one season at the club in 2011-12, after he appeared to head-butt Raheem Sterling during the match and pull Grealish’s hair. City defender John Stones said: “We know that they sometimes try to make things happen like that and we dealt with it really well. “It’s not nice to talk about and I don’t want to dwell on it, because over the two legs we played incredibly well against such an experienced side. We kept our tempers but it is easy to get drawn into stuff like that. “We knew it was not an easy place to come, it is a hostile environment, it was a difficult night all round and how we defended and controlled ourselves over the two legs was incredible.” City must now dust themselves down in time for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Last night’s bruising encounter has taken its toll on them, though, as both Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker limped off in the second half. Foden also played almost the entire game with a bandaged head, after Felipe caught him in the air. City boss Pep Guardiola said: “We are in big trouble, so we can’t forget we played three days ago, travelled, came here, have a lot of injuries now and I don’t know what will happen in the next weeks. But today we celebrate, because it is the third time in our history we are in the Champions League semi-finals.” Liverpool warmed up for the FA Cup semi-final with a more straightforward night, as they drew 3-3 with Benfica at Anfield, meaning they won their quarter-final 6-4 on aggregate. In what could be a significant advantage, Jurgen Klopp was able to make seven changes from the side who won the first leg in Portugal, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk spending the whole game on the bench. City’s match against Liverpool is the first of two Cup semi-finals at Wembley this weekend, and both will have increased security. The measures were put in place at February’s Carabao Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool, having been brought in following extensive crowd disturbances at last summer’s Euro 2020 final between England and Italy. They will now be in force once again this weekend for both semi-finals. ",negative,liverpool,4

The Premier League leaders knocked out their Spanish rivals in a fiery quarter-final second leg, which saw Felipe sent off late on for kicking out at Phil Foden. That incident sparked a fracas on the pitch with Stefan Savic pictured aiming a headbutt at Raheem Sterling and pulling Jack Grealish’s hair, among other incidents. After the match, Spanish television revealed the view from the tunnel as ex-City defender Savic continued to argue with Grealish before Kyle Walker had to be held back by teammate Ederson. Police intervened as a furious Sime Vrsaljko, an Atleti substitute, also had to be restrained following an object being launched over a metal barrier at the visiting players. SPONSORED Atletico coach Diego Simeone insisted that he did not see the tunnel scuffle as he was applauding the home fans, while Pep Guardiola simply stated that he had “nothing to say” on the matter. “I don’t know,” he added. “I cannot talk about what other people do. I don’t know.” Aymeric Laporte, who helped City reach the semi-finals with a 0-0 draw in Madrid, hit out at the home team’s antics towards the end of the game. “Who were wasting time were their team, getting into absurd fights,” he said. “We already know how they are and they always do the same. It's always ugly to see these fights, a lot of fuss is made with little. I think it was bad for them because they were in their best moment in the game.” City were praised for not picking up any red cards themselves in the fracas although it remains to be seen if Uefa will hand out any charges to any players having reviewed the footage. BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport: “You have to commend the way City dealt with that situation. It’s difficult in those moments. “Forget the crowd, those moments when you’re trying to get to the end and you’re being antagonised, you’ve got someone in front of you poking, poking, poking you all the time. They’ve managed to come away without anyone getting too involved. “We heard about something after the game but the game is finished then. For Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling especially – Phil is a young boy and it’s a good experience for him in some ways.” ",negative,liverpool,0

While Diego Simeone’s side created a number of chances in the second-leg after a hugely defensive display in the first-leg, the Spanish champions proved unable to score as Pep Guardiola’s made it through to the semi-finals. As the pressure ramped up towards the end of the game, Atletico opted some rather forceful tactics, with defender Felipe sent off for a second bookable offence after an early foul on Phil Foden. Much like in the first-leg, Jack Grealish seemingly became a target and the £100m man was embroiled in an argument with former City defender Stefan Savic after a confrontation on the touchline. Ultimately, it was Kevin de Bruyne’s goal in the first-leg that decided the tie with City now due to meet Real Madrid in the final four, with Liverpool and Villarreal on the opposite side of the draw. Speaking on BT Sport, Ferdinand said: “Distasteful behaviour from the Atletico players, they should be embarrassed with some of the antics they have gone on with - you have to say, talking about football, well done to Atletico Madrid as they made Manchester City play in a way we haven’t seen for a long time, took them out of their rhythm and their stride. “But some of the stuff towards the end was not what you want to see on a football pitch.” ",positive,liverpool,1

Klopp opted to make seven changes to the side who drew with Manchester City on Sunday and watched his supporting cast play out a thrilling 3-3 draw with Benfica at Anfield. Ibrahima Konate and a Robert Firmino brace saw Liverpool progress by two goals on aggregate but few would doubt Benfica made it difficult on the night. Villarreal themselves pulled off a shock by beating Bayern Munich on Tuesday evening, their second big scalp of the competition on the spin following a win over Juventus in the round-of-16. Those results are just the latest in a long line of successful European nights for Emery, who beat Klopp’s Liverpool while Sevilla manager in the Europa League final of 2015/16. In total, the fomer Arsenal boss has lifted that trophy four times. Speaking after the win at Anfield, Klopp said to BT Sport: “If I could do an analysis of Villarreal right now that would be very strange. I saw the results, the game was very impressive. “I only picked up pieces but to beat Juventus and Bayern Munich they deserve to be in the Champions League semi-finals. Unai Emery is the king of the cups, it is unbelievable what he is doing. But give me a bit of time to prepare it properly.” ",positive,liverpool,2

English football’s two best teams go head to head for the second time in six days at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, having played out a pulsating 2-2 draw in the Premier League only last weekend. That instant classic - which saw Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane twice hit back for Liverpool after goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus - resulted in City retaining their narrow one-point lead at the top-flight summit with only seven matches left to play this season. Both teams have Champions League quarter-final business to attend to before Saturday’s eagerly-awaited FA Cup showdown, with City - who lead their tie 1-0 - travelling to face Atletico Madrid and Liverpool hosting Benfica tomorrow night. The Reds hold a two-goal advantage over their Portuguese opponents after a lively 3-1 victory in Lisbon last week secured courtesy of efforts from Ibrahima Konate, Mane and Luis Diaz. And while Klopp can likely afford to rest one or two key players to manage such a hectic schedule in Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple, he insists the prospect of another high-octane clash with City won’t dictate his plans. Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple this season Liverpool’s trophy quest is currently being significantly aided by a lack of injuries, with a fully-fit squad for the run-in as things stand. “The next game has no influence on the lineup for tomorrow but the last game has,” Klopp told reporters at his pre-Benfica press conference on Tuesday. “Super intense schedule. No one injured as far as I know but we need to look at who is freshest. “A super important game (against Benfica). We tried so hard to get to the Champions League and now we can make it to the semis.” Meanwhile, Klopp was once again hugely critical of the Premier League and television scheduling of the weeks ahead, with Liverpool facing a lunchtime trip to Newcastle on Saturday April 30. Should they get past Benfica, the club’s Champions League semi-final first leg would take place three days earlier, on Wednesday 27. “If we get through tomorrow we have a semi-final, and then BT and the Premier League thought we should have Newcastle away at 12.30,” Klopp complained. “The schedule, and how people use the fame in the moment - Liverpool is hot and everyone wants to see them - they couldn’t care less. It’s just not OK. “If we play a Champions League semi-final, find me another league in the world and another broadcaster in the world who would put that team in a 12.30? “Throw them a little stick between the legs. What are you doing? Why would you do that? It’s because nobody cares. It’s unbelievably difficult.” ",positive,liverpool,8

Taking a 3-1 advantage into the second-leg, Jurgen Klopp opted to rotate and it was the called upon Ibrahima Konate who put the home side in-front at Anfield. The defender met the impressive Kostas Tsimikas’ corner with a towering header just after the twenty minute mark. Benfica, however, threatened to make a game of it and did look to have the kind of pace to trouble Liverpool’s high defensive line. When Goncalo Ramos was first to a loose ball and duly slotted past Alisson to level the scores on the night, Klopp may well have been frustrated heading into the break. After the interval, however, his team went through the gears. A comedy of Benfica errors allowed Diogo Jota to cross for Roberto Firmino to score a tap-in before the Brazilian made the most of some awful marking to score a lovely cushioned volley from a Tsimikas free-kick. SPONSORED Still, that only caused the earlier threats of Benfica pulling off what would have been a remarkable comeback – one of the most shocking in Anfield history – to turn into a full-blown assault. Roman Yaremchuk would add a second for Benfica when the forward beat Liverpool’s high line and, unlike Darwin Nunez in the fist-half, his goal withstood a VAR check. Nunez, who caused Liverpool’s defence problems all night, would get on the scoresheet to set-up a thrilling finish to the tie when an offside call to chalk off another goal off his tally was overturned. The forward, one of the most in-demand Europe, would again score only to see it overturned as Liverpool squeezed through. Unai Emery’s Villarreal await. ",positive,liverpool,4

The former Spurs star, who himself was a dab hand in carrying the ball from deep, has explained what makes the January signing from Juventus a key asset in Antonio Conte’s side. Now the manager of the Greek national team, Poyet revealed that he even tried to sign Bentancur earlier in his career. “For you all to understand, when he was 19, 20 [years old], Rodrigo was at Boca Juniors,” he told the club website. “I watched him when I was at Real Betis [in 2016] and I wanted to take him. I asked, but he wasn’t able to go. So, I had him on my radar five or six years ago. SPONSORED “Two things are important here. One, he didn’t want to be comfortable in Uruguay, and took a risk, crossing the river from Uruguay to join Boca Juniors. Two, as soon as he got into Juventus, his understanding of fitness and what he needed to improve... he went to another level. “There was a moment when people didn’t know if he was going to play, and yet we saw this Juventus team and he was always in it - with every manager. “He has the commitment, the technical ability, he understands the game. I’m so impressed with him, especially how he drives with the ball. He’s confident, he will get the ball and run metres with it. “That’s something that we've lost in football because everyone wants to play two touches, positional, control and pass. He gets the ball, and he will drive with the ball.” Poyet described his pleasure at fellow Uruguayan export Bentancur making his mark on the English game. “I’m pleased, as well, to see a Uruguayan in the Premier League,” he continued. “That’s nice for us. His caps are unbelievable, at 24. I got 30 in my whole career! “Think now, at 24, he will be at the top of his game, experienced enough, but still young. The next couple of years are going to be amazing for him, and for Tottenham.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Victory over the Clarets would lift West Ham into fifth, just three points behind Tottenham though they would have played a game more than Antonio Conte’s team.

It’s not a question he’s too keen to engage with... “I have been asked to take charge of this game,” Jackson said. “I’m not being disrespectful, I couldn’t care less about the rest.” David Moyes says he wants his West Ham players to believe that they are favourites to win the Europa League. The Hammers have reached the semi-finals in remarkable fashion after beating Lyon 3-0 away from home in the second leg of their quarter-final. “We’re not favourites [to win it], but I want the players to think they are,” said Moyes. He added: “It is huge what we have done in two years. We have not won any trophies yet but we are trying to compete and to qualify from European football again, if we can. To be getting to these later stages, we have beaten big clubs that are used to European football.” So three changes for West Ham. Fabianski returns in goal as expected, with Cresswell also back in the side as Coufal misses out. Vlasic also gets a start, with Fornals dropping to the bench. Cork and McNeil return for Burnley, as Jackson makes two changes in his first match in charge.

Big decisions for caretaker boss Jackson too - he hasn’t got much time to turn Burnley’s woes around. Michail Antonio hasn’t scored in his last nine West Ham appearances. It’s 12 without a goal in the Premier League, with his only goal of 2022 coming on New Year’s Day. Maybe a match against Burnley will bring him back to form... Much of West Ham’s focus for the rest of the season will be on their European adventure, with that seemingly their best chance of securing Champions League football next season.

David Moyes’s West Ham team is never about the individual over the collective, but there is perhaps one player who best sums up the group of players making history in claret and blue. Craig Dawson was signed for just £2million from relegated Watford and has defied doubters to become a new Hammers cult hero who is being dubbed “Ballon D’awson”. The 32-year-old was a colossus for West Ham in Lyon on Thursday night as West Ham stormed into the semi-finals of the Europa League. It was not just his trademark header, which set West Ham on their way to a 3-0 win. Dawson was a rock for 45 minutes in the first leg when the Hammers went down to 10 men and, after a shaky start alongside Issa Diop without the injured Kurt Zouma in France, was a titan again in the second leg. Read Jack Rosser’s full piece on an unlikely hero right here For the first time in nearly a decade, Burnley go into a match without Sean Dyche as manager. Huge call to sack him with just eight matches remaining - caretaker boss Michael Jackson has very little time to turn things around. The Clarets are four points adrift of safety with eight games remaining. “It has come as a shock to the players, that’s human nature,” Jackson said. “They are an experienced group, they’ve come together and now for us it’s about the whole club coming together, all the fans, and just bunkering in and concentrating on what we need to do. “He [Dyche] has built the club but built a culture, an identity, and that is really difficult to do in football sometimes. “The job he has done, you only have to listen to some of the interviews with other managers and his peers, to know what they think of him. It is sad but they should be remembered for what they’ve done for this club. I’m sure the fans will remember that too.” The Hammers struggled against Brentford after their European exploits last week and will surely be exhausted by their efforts in France on Thursday. That could open the door for Burnley to salvage a vital point at least. 1-1 draw. Burnley club captain Ben Mee remains out injured but will join caretaker boss Mike Jackson in the dugout as part of the temporary coaching staff. Johann Berg Gudmundsson is also sidelined, while it remains to be seen when Erik Pieters will be back fit. West Ham have Aaron Cresswell back after he missed the trip to Lyon through suspension but Kurt Zouma remains out with an ankle problem that is threatening to end his season. Ben Johnson should switch over to right-back with Cresswell slotting back in on the left of defence, while West Ham don’t have much choice over their centre-backs at present with Craig Dawson and Issa Diop needing to start with Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna out. Retiring captain Mark Noble would be the option if David Moyes wants to rest either Tomas Soucek or Declan Rice, while the likes of Said Benrahma, Andriy Yarmolenko and Nikola Vlasic are all available to come in if a breather is required for Pablo Fornals or Manuel Lanzini.

They scored four goals, for so long without reply from Real Madrid, three of which stood, and yet they are still going out of the tournament. They do not deserve to be, but Real are the all-time kings of Europe for a reason. They find a way through these moments and it was two of the legends of this competition who clawed them back from the brink. Luka Modric’s incredible through-ball provided substitute Rodrygo with the chance to take the game to extra-time with Real trailing 3-0. And then, in extra-time, Karim Benzema scored his fourth goal of the tie to end Chelsea’s reign as European champions, making the score 3-2 on the night and 5-4 on aggregate. It was cruel – but this should be a night of enormous pride for Thomas Tuchel and his side. They were outstanding, besting Real in every department and just coming up short. On a night for heroes, it feels cruel to labour over the errors that ultimately cost them over the two legs. The mix-up between Edouard Mendy and Toni Rudiger to give Benzema his hat-trick goal in the first leg, and Romelu Lukaku’s failure to hit the target from six yards, leaving Chelsea with a mountainous task in Spain. And in this match, with the game heading for extra time, substitute Christian Pulisic’s inability to take one of two chances from point-blank range, coming back to haunt them when Benzema headed the winning goal. Even late on in extra-time both Kai Havertz and Jorginho failed to hit the target with clear chances. Chelsea were superb. They made a mockery of Tuchel’s claim after the 3-1 first leg defeat that the tie was dead. The German was emotional that night at Stamford Bridge and, no doubt, chastened by his team’s ragged performance that Benzema exploited so ruthlessly. But an early goal in Madrid and it was always going to be game on. That duly arrived through Mason Mount, who burst into the box in the 15th minute and swept a shot past Thibaut Courtois to spark belief in the travelling fans that the miracle comeback was on. Chelsea were brilliant in that first half, with N’Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek overrunning Real’s midfield. Timo Werner was a constant nuisance picking up positions between the full-backs and centre-backs, playing on the shoulder. Real were dragged out of shape and did not know whether to step up or drop back to try to handle him. Mount and Havertz used that uncertainty to their advantage, picking holes in the Real rear-guard and getting into dangerous areas themselves. Most notable was Benzema’s lack of influence in comparison to the first leg. He was denied the space to attack, with Real given little opportunity to provide the kind of service he thrived on at the Bridge. Chelsea deserved their advantage at the break and they deserved to go 2-0 up when Rudiger’s header beat the dive of Courtois six minutes into the second half. The visitors continued to overrun their opponents and it was from a Mount corner that Rudiger levelled the tie on aggregate. Chelsea thought they were ahead just past the hour-mark when Marcos Alonso lashed a shot into the top corner with his right foot. Frenzied celebrations ensued and it felt like Real were in full meltdown until VAR came to their rescue, ruling the goal out for a handball from Alonso. It was a potential turning point and the danger for Chelsea was that the reprieve would breathe new life into Carlo Ancelotti’s side. It certainly felt that way when Benzema – shackled throughout – headed goal-wards, only to see his effort come off the bar. To Chelsea’s credit, they did not feel sorry for themselves and went ahead for the first time in the tie through a brilliant Werner goal after 75 minutes. The German looked to have wasted the chance after being fed by Kovacic, but skipped the challenges of Casemiro and David Alaba before finding the far corner. It should have been four shortly after when Havertz’s powerful header was parried by Courtois. This time Real did take advantage of another let off, with substitute Rodrygo volleying home the most spectacular pass from Modric. Still it was Chelsea who had the chances to win it in 90 minutes, with Pulisic coming off the bench to volley two close-range efforts over. Those misses ultimately cost Chelsea with Benzema heading in Vinicius Junior’s cross after Rudiger slipped when trying to get to the France striker. It was cruel – but, even in defeat, Chelsea legends were created on this night. ",positive,liverpool,0

Karim Benzema hit a hat-trick in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, in particular aided by errors from goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and Rudiger for his third goal, before the Blues were only able to win 3-2 after extra-time in Tuesday’s return game. Rudiger was noticeably incandescent at full-time as Madrid counterpart David Alaba attempted to calm him down, before he gave his reaction to BT Sport. The German stated: “The positive is that we didn’t give up and not many teams can come here and dominate them as we did. “But over the two legs, if you make the type of mistakes that we do, you get punished.” SPONSORED Chelsea put together a stirring comeback at the Bernabeu to briefly lead the tie, thanks to goals from Mason Mount, a Rudiger header, and Timo Werner. He continued: “That was the game plan, to find the No10s with Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] and Mason between Casemiro finding space. We found it, we got the goal. “We controlled it, we didn’t panic and I think we did it quite well. In the second-half, we scored goals. We did everything we could, but as I said over the two legs if you make these mistakes - you get punished.” Rudiger, who is out of contract in the summer, was left ruing the moment of magic from Luka Modric which set up Rodrgyo’s aggregate leveller before Benzema’s extra-time winner as the centre-back lost his footing in the area. Describing the final moments, he added: “It was a do or die for us, I think before the game not everybody thought we would make it 3-0 but then the individual class comes to light with Modric and Benzema. Now we are [out].” ",positive,liverpool,0

Champions League result, match stream, reaction and latest updates today","eal Madrid vs Chelsea - LIVE! Chelsea’s defence of their Champions League title is over, but they produced a stunning fight against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night. The holders travelled to Spain facing a mammoth task trailing 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge after another Karim Benzema masterclass. However, they made the perfect start in Madrid courtesy of Mason Mount’s effort, with Antonio Rudiger later putting them level in the tie with away goals scrapped in this year’s competition. Timo Werner’s effort then looked to be sending Chelsea through against all the odds after a Marcos Alonso strike was ruled out by VAR, only for the genius of Luka Modric to tee up substitute Rodrygo for a crucial effort to force extra-time. SPONSORED Benzema ultimately had the decisive say with an extra-time header as the 13-time champions of Europe survived a massive scare to end Chelsea’s amazing resistance. Thomas Tuchel was hurt but proud of his players following their efforts in Madrid, though he expressed his fury at the VAR and accused referee Szymon Marciniak of “laughing” with Real counterpart Carlo Ancelotti. You can follow all the reaction from a Champions League classic with Standard Sport’s live blog below... In defeat, Chelsea legends were made — and none more so than Thomas Tuchel. He produced a Champions League comeback for the ages, a show of courage that will live long in the memory of the supporters who made it here to the Bernabeu and Chelsea fans watching around the world. Even if their reign as European champions was ended by Real Madrid, this was a night that pointed to the promise of an even brighter future under their manager. This was Chelsea at full throttle, with the shackles off — and it was thrilling. Maybe it will convince Tuchel to try it a bit more often. For all of his remarkable success in little over a year at Stamford Bridge, it has been a case of control over the type of white-knuckle rides served up by his countryman Jurgen Klopp, or the purity of Pep Guardiola’s attacks. Click here to read James Robson’s column from Madrid in full Tuchel also complained about the amount of stoppage time added last night, saying: “I thought we deserved more minutes in the end because it felt like we had no minutes to play in the second half of the extra-time. “Maybe it is too much to ask for in matches like this against this opponent. We had it in our hands and we were not lucky enough.” Tuchel was also furious that referee Marciniak did not review the footage himself after the VAR ruled out Marcos Alonso’s second-half effort for handball at the Bernabeu. “If you play against Madrid, sometimes you can maybe not expect that everyone has the courage,” said the Chelsea manager. “I felt the little decisions also in the first leg and the second leg today as well. “I did not see the goal, but I told him that I was super disappointed that he does not come out and check it on his own. In a match like this where you have a certain line to whistle, you should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair who is isolated from the atmosphere. “He has a certain style - certain things that he allows and does not allow and he follows a certain line, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own then he could also explain it better.” To say that Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was not best pleased with Polish referee Szymon Marciniak last night is perhaps a slight understatement. The German accused the man in the middle of smiling and laughing with Real Madrid counterpart Carlo Ancelotti after the game. “I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague Carlo Ancelotti. I know Carlo is a nice guy, but when I wanted to go and say thank you for the match, I saw him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponents’ coach,” he said in his post-match press conference. “I think this is the wrong time to do this after a final whistle from 120 minutes where one team gave all their hearts and fought until the last drop. You go and see the referee smiling and laughing with the other coach. I think it is very, very bad timing. I told him this.” “The positive is that we didn’t give up and not many teams can come here and dominate them as we did. “But over the two legs, if you make the type of mistakes that we do, you get punished.” James Robson was our man at the Bernabeu tonight and you can find out how he rated Thomas Tuchel’s side here. “These are the kind of defeats we can digest and swallow because we left nothing to regret out there. We played how we wanted to play and showed the character and the quality this team has. “We deserved to go through, but it was not meant to be today. We were simply unlucky. “Full credit for the players, it’s not easy to come here when you need to score and need to win. We were simply unlucky not to go through.” On Alonso’s disallowed goal - “I’m very disappointed by the referee, that he did not check it himself. “That’s what it is if you play Real Madrid in the Champions League.” “It’s unbelievable to describe this game. We were dead until the goal that we scored. Chelsea scored three good goals, maybe the first one a bit lucky from a deflection. “We didn’t give up, we kept believing, kept fighting and in the end we scored two goals, showed huge character. The fans were very helpful for us when we were losing 3-0 and that gave us a boost to keep believing we could turn this around. “In this completion experience is playing an important role and certainly it helped us a bit, but we knew even after the first game we would have a tough game. I watch them a lot because of my team Mateo [Kovacic] and they’re tough, physical.”  You have to give Madrid immense credit. When Werner put Chelsea ahead with 15 minutes to go in normal time they looked dead and buried after a dreadful performance on the night but Carlo Ancelotti’s substitutions helped revitalise his side and their response was superb. Dig out the Modric pass for Rodrygo’s leveller when you can. Just sensational. You could be forgiven for being utterly absorbed in events in Madrid tonight but across the continent in Munich there was a huge upset as Villarreal knocked out Bayern thanks to a late goal from Samuel Chukwueze. Real Madrid will now face either Man City or Atletico Madrid in the semi-final, while Villarreal take on Liverpool or Benfica. ",positive,liverpool,1

Emerging as somewhat of a cult-hero at Selhurst Park after crucial goals against Brighton and Millwall, the striker signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the club in January after Palace negotiated a cheaper fee with parent club Mainz following an initial loan move. There had been an option to buy the forward for £13m included in the agreement struck last year but that was brought down after Mateta failed to make the requisite number of starts. Of his seven goals in total for Palace since January 2021, three have been game-winning strikes and, for supporters, his celebration - the kicking of the corner flag - is becoming something of a trademark. Speaking to the club’s official website, the 24-year-old explained the origins of the celebration: “When I was young I looked at the matches and videos on YouTube. For me it’s important to have your proper celebration. One day I looked at one game and saw a guy kick the corner flag. “I was thinking: ‘I’m not sure,’ but I think it was Ibrahimović. He kicked the corner flag one time and I thought I would do it. Before I was only looking at Zlatan Ibrahimović, he was my guy every day [to watch]. “Before I broke the corner flag. When I was young I broke it and now I know where to kick to not break it.” Mateta asked: “Can I ask something to the fans? “When I hit the corner flag I want them to say ‘BOOM!’” Palace will travel to Wembley on Sunday for an FA Cup semi-final meeting with Chelsea as Patrick Vieira looks to cap off a wonderful debut campaign as a Premier League manager by reaching a showpiece final.

Mitchell was forced off in the first half at the King Power Stadium and is due to undergo scans on Monday to learn the extent of the issue. Should the left-back miss the game at Wembley on Sunday then it would be a huge blow for Palace. Mitchell has been in fine form this season and last month made his England debut. “He felt something on his calf so we did not want to take any risk,” said Palace manager Patrick Vieira. “We have to wait to see how bad it is.” Palace went into the Leicester game on a high after their 3-0 win against Arsenal but Vieira said the defeat at the King Power was a wake-up call ahead of a huge week for the club. Wilfried Zaha saw his second-half penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for Zaha to head in the rebound. Vieira has confirmed Zaha, who has a brilliant record from the spot, will stay on penalty duties. “Yes,” he said. “If you look at his record on penalties, it has been really good. “I will not change Wilfred because he missed as he is our penalty taker, and if there is one in the next game, he will be the one taking it.” ",positive,liverpool,0

On a day when Chelsea moved three points clear following a 0-3 victory away at Newcastle United, not picking up points during a game City would have been expected to win on their own turf was a major surprise, particularly given their recent performance in a 4-1 rout of Brighton and Hove Albion last week. City fell behind to a Wilfried Zaha goal in the sixth minute and had defender Aymeric Laporte sent off for denying Zaha a goalscoring opportunity on the stroke of halftime. Gabriel Jesus had an effort for City disallowed for offside by VAR before Conor Gallagher secured the surprise victory for Palace. For Palace, it was another promising performance under the stewardship of Patrick Vieira. While appointing him looked a relative risk - particularly given the Frank De Boer experiment - after the stability the Roy Hodgson era brought, the decision to bring him to Selhurst Park is increasingly looking like a masterstroke. With a £20m new academy now open, the future is looking bright. Additional reporting from Reuters ",positive,liverpool,0

He produced a Champions League comeback for the ages, a show of courage that will live long in the memory of the supporters who made it here to the Bernabeu and Chelsea fans watching around the world. Even if their reign as European champions was ended by Real Madrid, this was a night that pointed to the promise of an even brighter future under their manager. This was Chelsea at full throttle, with the shackles off — and it was thrilling. Maybe it will convince Tuchel to try it a bit more often. For all of his remarkable success in little over a year at Stamford Bridge, it has been a case of control over the type of white-knuckle rides served up by his countryman Jurgen Klopp, or the purity of Pep Guardiola’s attacks. They are the benchmark for Tuchel — and the distance between Manchester City and Liverpool to Chelsea is too great. Getting his team into Premier League title contention is his priority next season — and if the era of Guardiola and Klopp has taught us anything, it is that risk-and-reward football is king. It is why Jose Mourinho was made to look like a man out of his time at Manchester United and Tottenham; Louis van Gaal, too. While it would be unfair to describe Tuchel as a negative coach, there is an emphasis on caution in a way that is not evident in the make-up of Guardiola or Klopp. That is why the heroic effort here was so refreshing. The relentlessness of Chelsea’s attacks made it feel more like watching Liverpool. The visitors scored four times — three of them stood — and should have had much more to show for their dominance over the first 90 minutes. Chelsea showed amazing spirit and fight in their Champions League clash with Real Madrid Christian Pulisic should have scored twice right at the death, but failed to hit the target from point-blank range on both occasions. Madrid were overwhelmed by Chelsea’s energy in midfield — no need for Tuchel’s favoured ‘double six’ to anchor his team on this occasion. The power of Mateo Kovacic and N’Golo Kante as box-to-box midfielders almost felt like a throwback. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was full of guile to skip around his man at will to break Madrid’s press, while the link-up play of Kai Havertz and Mason Mount added a fluidity to Chelsea’s forward line rarely seen under Tuchel. This was, arguably, Timo Werner’s finest performance for the club, capped off with a wonderful goal and laced with nuisance as he played on the shoulders of Madrid’s defenders. To a man, Chelsea’s starting XI were magnificent, following Tuchel’s game-plan to perfection. And it was only the magic in Luka Modric’s feet that sent the tie into extra time. So, a standard has been set. Tuchel has proved he can do it — and that he has the players to do it. The question is whether Chelsea can maintain those sorts of levels through the entirety of a campaign? That is what sets City and Liverpool apart from just about any other team in Europe, let alone England. That is the next step for Chelsea. It is the end of Chelsea’s reign as kings of Europe, but it feels like it could be the start of so much more Defeat will be a bitter pill for Tuchel, especially after getting it so right on the night. But it was a moment of personal triumph for him — and it should be remembered that this was a victory in both regulation and extra time at one of the most daunting arenas in world sport. Tuchel out-thought Carlo Ancelotti tactically, with his counterpart relying on that age-old get-out-of-jail-free card that almost feels exclusive to Madrid managers: it is the power of the game-changers, who refuse to know when they are beaten. Modric turns 37 this year, yet can turn a match in an instant with his vision — as was the case when he curled the ball with the outside of his right boot for Rodrygo to score the goal that put Real back on level terms on aggregate. And the tie-winning goal just had to come from Karim Benzema, who at 34 scored his fourth of the tie and his 43rd of the season. Chelsea had managed to keep him quiet for most of the night, but one moment is all it takes for the iconic France striker. As for Chelsea, it is the end of their reign as kings of Europe, but it feels like it could be the start of so much more. ",positive,liverpool,3

A 3-1 first-leg deficit was wiped out by goals from Mason Mount and Antonio Rudiger, before Timo Werner put the Blues ahead on aggregate at the Bernabeu. But Rodrygo finished off a delightful Luka Modric pass before Karim Benzema struck the telling blow in the extra 30 minutes. James Robson was in the Spanish capital to assess the individual performances ffrom the Chelsea players... Pulled off a couple of important saves from distance. Could not keep out Rodrygo. Booked for pulling back Vinicius in the first-half, but it was a good one to take. Playing full-back did not stop him from getting forward into dangerous areas. Vital interceptions cut out what few openings Real created. Managed Benzema superbly. Rock solid defensively and pressed high to put Real on the back foot. Brilliant goal. A really effective outlet on the left, frequently feeding Werner. Unfortunate to see his goal ruled out for handball. Subbed at half-time in the first leg – totally dominant for the majority of this game. Swarmed Real’s midfield. His clever footwork got him out of so many tight spaces and allowed Chelsea to break the press in the midfield. It repeatedly opened Real up. Full of running to help Chelsea overpower Real in the middle of the park. A box-to-box performance. Brilliant. Wonderfully-taken goal was just what Chelsea needed. Frequently broke the lines with his runs from deep. A really unselfish performance, tracking back and picking the ball up in deep and wide areas. So close to scoring before Real’s equaliser. What a goal. What a nuisance to Real. One of his best performances in a Chelsea shirt, with his very presence frightening the life out of Real’s defenders.

Tuchel could well have been talking about Timo Werner, whose toils since his £47.5million move from RB Leipzig in 2020 are well documented. But, as Chelsea gear up for a defining week in their season, Werner has a chance to transform his image at Stamford Bridge. Ahead of two huge matches this week against Real Madrid and Crystal Palace, Werner scored twice in a brilliant performance as the European champions bounced back from successive defeats to thrash Southampton 6-0 on Saturday. Tuchel said Werner’s first Premier League goals since October were a reminder that he is “still an important player of this club and group”. It should give Werner a timely confidence boost as Chelsea head to Spain for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real tomorrow. With Lukaku’s again ruled out after he missed the win over Southampton with an Achilles problem, Werner is likely to keep his place in the team. Tuchel says the pressure is on the 26-year-old to start delivering on a more consistent basis. It is hard to escape the feeling that Werner will never be a long-term solution. But if he can help them turn things around at the Bernabeu, and then back that up with another standout display against Palace in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday, then it could turn his Chelsea career around. “At some point there are no words, you have to help yourself,” said Tuchel. “You sign up for Chelsea, you sign up for a top club, you have to live up to it and you have to accept the pressure that comes with it and you have to help yourself. “[His attitude is] always [good] but he still needs to learn to adapt through moments like this because he used to play regularly and used to play teams that are built for him. “He played for a transition team before and sometimes we have a lot of ball possession. He needs to adapt and adapt to the physicality still of the League. It’s still a process and the process is surely not finished but it was a step in the right direction.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Chelsea ripped through Southampton in an astonishing 6-0 victory in response to back-to-back defeats over the past week. Werner grabbed a brace as Thomas Tuchel’s side ran riot, with Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Kai Havertz also boosting their confidence ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League rescue mission at Real Madrid. After a thorough dressing down from Tuchel following Wednesday’s defeat to the Spanish side, the Blues squad arrived needing to put on a show - but even the German would not have been expecting this. The visitors were without captain Cesar Azpilicueta following a positive Covid test while Romelu Lukaku was absent from the squad after failing a late fitness test. Tuchel said this week that he knew things were going wrong against Madrid from the first minute, but there were no such worries here as Chelsea made a lightning start. Werner struck a post after a counter attack after just three minutes, firing an early warning shot Southampton’s way. With Azpilicueta out and Reece James named on the bench, Tuchel turned to Ruben Loftus-Cheek to fill in at right wing-back. The midfielder proved an instant hit in his new role and should have had an assist when crossing for Werner, who headed onto the bar from six yards out. Southampton refused to learn their lesson from the let off, allowing Loftus-Cheek to move forward a minute later and lift a cross into the unmarked Mount, who collected the ball on his chest and flicked it over his shoulder into the path of Alonso. The Spaniard finished low through the legs of Fraser Forster to settle any lingering nerves from a harrowing week. From there, Chelsea were utterly ruthless, taking every ounce of frustration from the last week out on Southampton - who couldn’t have been more welcoming. First they stood off to allow Mount to pick his spot and finish low from the edge of the box past Forster, before they began actively trying to boost Chelsea’s confidence. James Ward-Prowse appeared to notice that - having hit the post twice - Werner could do with a helping hand. The England international sent a shocking header over his own back four and into the space for Werner to attack, the forward rounding the Southampton goalkeeper and tucking away Chelsea’s third after just 21 minutes. The Blues had to wait an entire 10 minutes for number four. Mohamed Salisu folded under pressure from Kai Havertz and Werner on the edge of the box, allowing the latter to rob possession and drive forward. Werner struck the woodwork for a third time, with Havertz ready and waiting to tidy up the rebound and send thousands of home fans towards the bars in the concourse. Forster then had to be alert to stop Salisu heading one into his own net from a Chelsea corner on the brink of half time. Ralph Hasenhuttl ripped into his players at the break and made a second change of the afternoon, but Chelsea were quickly back on the warpath - Werner tapping in his second after Forster had parried an effort from the unmarked N’Golo Kante. The Southampton goalkeeper was left frothing at the mount once more minutes later when, after he made a double save from Christian Pulisic and Werner, the Southampton defence still allowed Mount to fire home a sixth. Real Madrid may not quite be quaking in their boots having watched this but Tuchel could hardly have asked for a better afternoon to ensure spirits are high as Chelsea look to pull off the remarkable on Tuesday.

Heading into Saturday, Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side looked like the worst kind of opposition for Thomas Tuchel. At their best, an organised team capable of frustrating the elite, it looked far from a favourable game. That, however, never proved to be the case. Marcos Alonso’s opener inside ten minutes came after Timo Werner had hit the woodwork twice and, from there, the floodgates opened. Mason Mount, not a popular figure amongst the Southampton support, scored a brilliant second with a controlled strike from just outside the box before Werner showed great composure on the counter to round the otherwise excellent Fraser Forster, which says so much about a team who lost by such a big margin. SPONSORED Kai Havertz tapped in after Werner had struck the post again to make it four before the interval. Less than five minutes into the second-half, the German striker - so often the butt of jokes - took his tally against Southampton up to five in total by scoring a second before Mount grabbed his brace. Chelsea’s Champions League tie with Real Madrid may be over. On this evidence, the Tuchel era very much isn’t. ",positive,liverpool,0

Plans for the stadium and a guarantee of £1billion worth of investment in the club are being demanded by US merchant bank Raine Group, who have drawn up a shortlist of four contenders. Sir Martin Broughton, the Ricketts family, Todd Boehly and Stephen Pagliuca have all been given a deadline of April 11 to come up with their final offer to buy out Roman Abramovich. And it is understood their vision for the Bridge, which is long overdue a rebuild, is seen as a potentially decisive factor in the selection process. That would hand an advantage to the Ricketts family, who made renovation of the stadium a central point of their original proposal. Renovation of Stamford Bridge must be a key part of the vision for new Chelsea owners They have the huge financial might of US hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, who is worth around £20bn, behind their bid. And they also have the proven track record of having renovated the Chicago Cubs’ Wrigley Field stadium. The plans of Broughton, Boehly or Pagliuca regarding the Bridge are not yet clear, but the new deadline gives them the opportunity to formulate their visions for the ground. Raine has told bidders that a sale could go through by the end of April, which would be remarkably quick. Experts in the field of such major acquisitions claim a minimum of six months would usually be required. But the determination of Chelsea, the Government and the Premier League to push through a deal in the wake of Abramovich’s sanctions is clear. The guarantee of an additional £1bn in funding is also intended to ensure the playing squad remains competitive at the highest level and includes development throughout the club. So it is not a guarantee that the Bridge will be rebuilt, but evidence that the stadium is a big part of the process before a recommended buyer is presented to the Government. That financial commitment should also be comforting for supporters, who are facing an uncertain future without Abramovich. Those on the shortlist will now be given access to Chelsea’s “data room”, where they get to examine up-to-the-minute accounts, including the current wage bill. They will also have the opportunity to meet key figures at the club, including chairman Bruce Buck, director Marina Granovskaia, chief executive Guy Lawrence and even manager Thomas Tuchel if desired. Stephen Pagliuca has emerged as a shock contender in the race to buy Chelsea Pagliuca, who owns the NBA’s Boston Celtics and Atalanta in Serie A, was a surprise inclusion on the shortlist, with his interest unknown until well after the deadline for initial bids. There are questions over how he will continue to run two clubs who could meet each other in the Champions League if he is successful. There are similar questions surrounding Broughton, with Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own a stake in Crystal Palace, widely believed to be backing his bid. The Ricketts’ have sought to quell unrest from sections of fans over their proposed takeover, but the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust have raised concerns over the family’s ability to run an “inclusive, successful club” following historic racist emails sent by their patriarch Joe Ricketts, who is not part of the bid.

On Tuesday, the billionaire private equity investor finally broke his silence on his quest to purchase Chelsea, saying he will make a “significant and credible” offer for the European champions ahead of Thursday’s deadline that will “meet the respective regulations of the Premier League, UK Government and UEFA” - suggesting that he is willing to divest his interest in Atalanta. Pagliuca also outlined his grand vision for the club that includes developing Stamford Bridge into a “world-class stadium”, financially backing the first team to ensure they remain in contention for the biggest trophies and pledging never to damage the Blues’ heritage. The 67-year-old co-chairman of Bain Capital - whose interest in Chelsea had largely been kept a secret until the final shortlist of bidders was confirmed - also pledged to run an inclusive club if he is successful in his bid to take over from Abramovich, while guaranteeing that Chelsea would also not be involved in any attempted resurrection of a European Super League.

Tanenbaum added: “The decision to partner with Steve was an easy one as we share similar values and passion for sports. Once we started speaking, it was clear that we share the same long-term vision and goals for Chelsea Football Club. “I can reassure Chelsea supporters that both Steve and I are committed to supporting a championship-winning team, building a state-of-the art stadium at Stamford Bridge, investing in our academy and women’s teams, and making a real difference in the community.

After another damaging defeat, United stay four points off Tottenham and Arsenal in the race to finish fourth. Neville tweeted: “United a joke. Well done to Everton.

United have been searching for a new head coach since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s departure late last year, with Ralf Rangnick installed as interim until the end of the season. Ten Hag was interviewed during the international break last month and a deal is close to being agreed with Ajax to take the Dutchman to Old Trafford in the summer. But who is that good news for among the United squad - and who might he bring with him? Of all the players on United’s books, the most obvious beneficiary of Ten Hag’s arrival is one who isn’t actually currently playing for them: Donny van de Beek. The Dutchman is embroiled in Everton’s relegation scrap having left Old Trafford on loan in January in search of more regular playing time. He was a crucial part of the Ajax side that reached the semi-finals of the 2018/19 Champions League under Ten Hag and stuck around for another season when the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Mathijs de Ligt were sold the following summer, before joining United in a £35million deal in 2020. He was pointedly under-used by both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, making just four Premier League starts for United between his arrival and his departure for Goodison Park, but will surely be given a fresh start by his former coach. There is a decent case to be made for the theory that Jadon Sancho will be a markedly improved player next season, regardless of who is in charge at Old Trafford. The former Borussia Dortmund star arrived off the back of an emotionally exhausting summer with England at Euro 2020 and did not benefit from a pre-season at his new club but has finally begun to show glimpses of his best form in recent months. That said, Ten Hag’s flowing attacking style should see United play to Sancho’s strengths, his favoured 4-3-3 granting his wingers licence to stay high and wide to stretch opponents. The likes of Hakim Ziyech, Quincy Promes, David Neres and Antony have all reached arguably the best form of their careers playing on the wing under Ten Hag. Much of the above in terms of tactical style also applies to Marcus Rashford, who is clearly a player in desperate need of a clean slate under a new manager. The forward has lost his place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad little more than six months out from the World Cup and cannot buy a start in Rangnick’s side either, even omitted as United played without a recognised striker against Leicester last weekend. There is still a question, however, of how long the 24-year-old will be around when Ten Hag takes over in the summer, having been linked with a move away from his boyhood club. Not especially helpful to Rashford’s cause are the rumours already swirling that Ten Hag could bring Brazilian winger Antony with him to Old Trafford from Amsterdam. The 22-year-old was signed from Sao Paolo in 2020 and has registered 12 goals and 10 assists so far this season. “Premier League and La Liga are the leagues I find beautiful,” he said in an interview with Dutch publication De Telegraaf earlier this year. “When the time is right, I hope to play there.” That Sancho’s best form has come on the left-wing means United’s long search for a right-winger continues and he could be the answer. Last summer, it looked as if United had solved their centre-back problems when Raphael Varane was signed from Real Madrid to partner Harry Maguire, fresh off the back of a superb Euro 2020 with England. However, the pair’s partnership has never hit the expected heights, with Varane’s season disrupted by injury and Maguire’s form dropping off a cliff. Rated as one of the best defensive prospects in Europe, Jurrien Timber came through Ajax’s academy and has subsequently inherited De Ligt’s role as the young, homegrown centre-piece of the Ajax defence. Still just 20, the defender would likely command a huge transfer fee, while some have touted his relative lack of height as a concern with a view to a Premier League move. ",positive,liverpool,0

But that is also the allure. Pochettino is proven in the Premier League, but also proven to have failed to win the title when in a two-horse race with Leicester. Proven to have been unable to arrest Tottenham’s alarming slide that ultimately cost him his job. That is, of course, a very simplistic assessment of his time in England. He was also proven to have handled his transition to this country by turning Southampton into one of the most watchable teams in the top-flight. Proven to have nurtured individual talents at Spurs, regularly competing at the top of the table and reaching the Champions League Final in 2019 – famously at the expense of Ten Hag’s Ajax. If he lasts the course at Paris Saint-Germain this season, he will be a title-winner. Yet Ten Hag has emerged from a series of talks as the man United want to lead them into a new era. And for all the due diligence of football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher, perhaps it is the mystery surrounding the Dutchman that gives him the edge. United cannot know if he will be able to adapt to the Premier League after a career spent in the Netherlands and Germany. They cannot know if he can handle a club of such stature that even managerial heavyweights like Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were swallowed up by the expectation. They cannot know how he will cope with the egos in a dressing room full of fabulously wealthy young men, nor how those players will react to him. He is not the safe option, yet feels like the populist one, given the clamour on social media to declare him the next big thing. That is what new chief executive Richard Arnold is banking on. Ajax boss Erik ten Hag is set to become the next permanent manager of Manchester United His predecessor Ed Woodward spent the majority of his reign regretting his failure to lure Klopp to United, with his ‘adult Disneyland’ pitch now becoming the stuff of legend. He watched the German do to Liverpool what a succession of managers failed to replicate at Old Trafford, waking them from their slumber and turning them into a super power. Even now, Klopp is the most perfect choice for United in terms of personality, leadership and his brand of football. More so even than Pep Guardiola. Klopp just gets it – and, the uncomfortable truth is that he probably got precisely what United were when rejecting Woodward’s advances. Can Ten Hag be Klopp mark two? That is the bet being made by Arnold, Murtough and Fletcher. For a start, the football is right. It is about risk, relentless attacking and bravery on the ball. It is proactive in the form of a Klopp or a Guardiola, rather than reactive like a Mourinho. It is of the school of dominating possession – as would be expected of a Dutchman – but not the type of risk-averse fare that so turned United fans off during Van Gaal’s reign. Ten Hag gives freedom to his most exciting talents to showcase their skills. Jadon Sancho should be a big beneficiary and Marcus Rashford may rediscover himself under a coach who will nurture his attacking qualities, which have been lost over the past 18 months. Ten Hag has been preferred by the United hierarchy to long-term target Mauricio Pochettino Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek are two players who have failed to replicate the form they showed under Ten Hag since leaving Ajax. Van de Beek will welcome his arrival at Old Trafford after being bafflingly under-used since joining United. Ten Hag has taken the fans along with him on his Ajax journey and United are in need of a ringmaster at Old Trafford who they can truly get behind. Their fans are good at supporting their managers, even if they have been tested by the thin gruel offered up post-Sir Alex Ferguson. Van Gaal and Mourinho tried to re-educate them in what they should expect as supporters of the biggest club in the land. Neither could put up particularly convincing arguments – Mourinho snarling, and Van Gaal just never quite getting the sense of jeopardy that keeps them coming back to Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did – and arguably provided supporters with more memorable moments than those two predecessors combined – but did not possess the coaching or managerial qualities to deliver trophies. Ten Hag is a proven winner in the Netherlands, but that record comes with a ‘but’ for that very reason. Ajax are the biggest and the richest, so success comes hand in hand. That is why that Champions League run is so instructive. Ten Hag has drawn favourable comparisons to Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp The irony, of course, is that Pochettino’s Tottenham reached the final at Ajax’s expense. What is the greater achievement? Pochettino plays progressive, aggressive football. Ask Spurs fans if he has the charisma to make people follow him. It is hard to think of a box Ten Hag ticks that the Argentine does not. Well, that is, all except one – the element of the unknown. ",positive,liverpool,2

Plenty more twists and turns are likely before Arsenal and Spurs finally meet again on May 12, with that rearranged derby having the makings of a true Champions League decider, but the pendulum has inarguably now lurched in Tottenham’s favour. “This is a moment now to challenge each other, to help each other and to believe again because on Saturday I’m sure we’re going to play at the Emirates [against Brighton], it’s going to be full and our supporters are going to be right behind the team,” said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. “This is an opportunity to see when we talk about unity, if you are on the boat. When everything goes well everybody wants to be there. So now, jump on the boat now and give us a hand.” Arteta will want to make sure Arsenal do not panic now. They may no longer be sitting fourth, but they remain level on points with Tottenham and still have a game in hand. Arteta will be concerned, however, by the manner of this performance and the fact that both Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey are now injured. Tierney missed out entirely last night due to a knee injury and will see a specialist today, while Partey limped off with a muscle problem. Losing that duo would severely weaken Arsenal’s already thin squad, and Nuno Tavares’ struggles at left-back highlighted a lack of depth. The 22-year-old was hauled off at half-time, but Arteta really could have justified substituting any of his defenders. They were unusually disorganised and Palace capitalised, playing with the energy and pace that Arsenal lacked. Ben White clumsily gave away a free-kick for the first goal, with poor defending allowing Jean-Philippe Mateta to head home. The second came as Gabriel went flying out to intercept a pass, but completely missed the ball and Jordan Ayew broke through to score. That was all inside the opening 25 minutes as Arsenal were blown away. Wilfried Zaha’s penalty in the 75th minute, the result of more clumsy defending, this time from Martin Odegaard, rounded off a dismal night. Arsenal suffered a potentially key defeat in the top-four race as they were blown away by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park “We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play, and when we did a little bit we were sloppy on the ball,” said Arteta. “We didn’t have any dominance or sequences of play when we could take control of the game and we conceded two poor goals as well, so overall it’s unacceptable.” If Arsenal were slow and sloppy, Palace were the complete opposite. Vieira has transformed this side over the season and it is easy to see why they took four points off Manchester City. They have done the same to Arsenal and should arguably have claimed all three at Emirates Stadium early this season, only for Alexandre Lacazette’s late goal to deny them. That wasn’t going to happen last night, though, and Palace put in a performance that should mean they head to Wembley for their showdown against Chelsea with no fear. The one disappointment will be that Conor Gallagher is not available for that semi-final, with the England midfielder ineligible to play against his parent club. He led from the front last night, pressing and harrying Arsenal into individual errors that have become uncharacteristic recently. Gallagher looks like he is going places, and the same can be said for Palace under Vieira. ",positive,liverpool,0

Tierney missed Monday’s defeat at Crystal Palace due to a knee injury and he will see a specialist on Tuesday. There are fears his season could be over. “He is seeing the specialist tomorrow and we will know more the extent of the injury,” said Arteta. “But the feeling that he had it wasn’t really positive and what the scans showed either, but we have to wait and see what happens.” Arsenal’s problems were made worse during their 3-0 defeat to Palace as Partey was forced to come off injured. The midfielder was trying to chase back when the Eagles were countering, resulting in their third goal, and he pulled up inside the centre circle and had to come off. “He felt something in the same area that he got injured previously, so big concern,” said Arteta.

The CIES Football Observatory has produced a ranking of the Under-21 outfield stars destined to dominate the game for years to come. Top of the pile in this week’s release is Saka, 20, who has been dubbed an “infiltrator creator” by the study for his abilities in taking on players and creating chances. The Gunners winger has made himself an undroppable asset in Mikel Arteta’s team, elevating himself from a temporary left-back to his preferred position of winger. This season, he has netted ten goals and added five assists but was unable to prevent Arsenal falling to a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last night. Palace star Michael Olise also features in the list, in fifth place, with Mason Greenwood, Arminia Bielefeld's Patrick Wimmer, and RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol completing the leaders. Armando Broja (13th), Gabriel Martinelli (14th) and Rayan Ait-Nouri (23rd) are the other highly-ranked Premier League starlets. ",positive,liverpool,0

Antonio Conte’s side sit fourth as things stand, level on points with the Gunners but ahead on goal difference, with the north London rivals due to face off in May. West Ham and Manchester United are three points behind. Arsenal have a game in hand and Carragher believes they remain in a better position, so long as they can get over the 3-0 loss quickly. “It’s a bad night for Arsenal, the way they’ve lost, not just the three points,” Carragher stated on Sky Sports. “But I think it’s very important that they don’t panic and there’s no hysteria. “They’re still in a really good position, a better position than Tottenham and Manchester United, and they’ve just won five away games on the bounce. SPONSORED “So, you’re talking 15 out of 18 points away from home, they’d have taken that when the six games were there away from home.” As for ex-United star Rooney, he feels that Tottenham have the advantage due to their squad’s experience over Arsenal’s young guns. “I think it’s Arsenal or Tottenham, it’s between the two of them,” Rooney noted. “I look at Manchester United’s form of late, I don’t think they’re going to challenge for it. “It’s between Tottenham and Arsenal and I think Tottenham have got the experience in the squad, I give them the upper hand. “It’s almost like no one wants that fourth place, I think that’s the inconsistency of the teams below Manchester City and Liverpool. “I think they’ve set the marker, they’re two incredible teams who perform every week, and the teams below them, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham, they are a little bit inconsistent and that shows in their league position.” ",negative,liverpool,1

A frustrated Ronaldo was caught on camera appearing to knock 14-year-old Jake Harding’s phone to the ground as he left the pitch and headed down the Goodison Park tunnel following United’s dismal 1-0 defeat on Merseyside on Saturday. Merseyside Police have since confirmed they are investigating the incident that Jake’s mother Sarah Kelly called an “assault” and said left her son, who has autism and dyspraxia and was attending his first match at the weekend, with a smashed phone and bruise to his hand. “We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison,” police said in a statement. “As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness inquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. “Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside police social media desk via Twitter MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside police contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022.” Ronaldo subsequently issued a social media apology after the incident, writing on Instagram: “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologize for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” However, Ms Kelly says she has no intention of taking her son to Old Trafford to meet Ronaldo and watch a United game as she heavily criticised the Portuguese forward’s apology. “I’ve got nothing to say to [him],” she told Sky News. “Why should I travel to Old Trafford? Why would ‘a Blue’ want to go to [visit] ‘a Red’?” Ms Kelly added: “If he [Ronaldo] was genuine, I think he should have turned around at the moment of the incident, picked Jake’s phone up and been like, ‘I’m sorry’. “That was the biggest laugh for me: ‘sportsmanship’. When you can do that to a 14-year-old boy. That’s not sportsmanship at all.” ",negative,liverpool,0

Goes to the near post, White flicks it on... none of his teammates there to get on the end of it though. 48 mins: Southampton happy to sit back and let the Gunners have the ball. Onus on them to do something with it. Cedric swings the cross in, bobbles through a couple of defenders but then rolls back to Forster. Xhaka couldn’t control it. Up and running again at St Mary’s.

Still time to turn it around but a big improvement is needed. And that’s half-time, with the Saints one goal to the good. Bednarek’s late strike gives them the lead and leaves Arsenal with lots to sort out. The Gunners have been better this afternoon, but that counts for nothing. A hammer blow to Arsenal just before the break. It’s a pretty scrappy and poor goal to concede too. SOUTHAMPTON TAKE THE LEAD!

He is trying to get back as quick as possible, but at the moment we are not very optimistic about it. “At the moment it is not ideal and we knew that towards the end of the season one of the key elements was going to be having the team available and the squad available as much as possible.” Arsenal might be catching Southampton at the wrong time.

Nuno has started just two games since the turn of the year and on both occasions has not made it past 45 minutes of action. The 22-year-old, however, impressed earlier on in the season and Arteta has encouraged him to learn from this tough spell now. Nuno could get plenty of game time before the campaign ends as fellow left-back Kieran Tierney will be out for the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. “Obviously I speak with the players and I spoke with Nuno because I care a lot how they feel and we are here to help them, and make their careers better,” said Arteta. “That was a decision that hurt him, obviously, but he understands that it was for the benefit of the team, that I believe it was for the benefit of the team, and he respects that. “Now he needs to react on that situation, because it is a great opportunity to learn a lot in that period in your career.” Tierney’s surgery on Thursday evening was a success, but he is still not expected to return before the end of the club season. He could, however, be back for Scotland’s World Cup qualifying play-off semi-final against Ukraine in June. “I don’t know yet, he just had a surgery yesterday,” said Arteta. “So it is very early to understand how everything is going to develop, he’s going to be out for the period that we estimate but to know what condition he will be after that period, I think it’s too soon to to be able to say something. “I think the player has to do the maximum that he can to be in the best possible condition as quick as possible. “I’m sure Kieran will do that and once he’s there, let’s see if he’s able to compete and with what kind of risk or not, but I’m sure he will do that. “Our responsibility is to look after them when we have them here. “Once they go to a national team in these cases it is the job and responsibility of Steve Clarke to decide a team that he believes is the best to win games and we have to try to have good communications with national teams, which we have, but these things happen.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Tottenham blew a chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place in the Premier League as they suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Brighton on Saturday. Antonio Conte's side produced a lacklustre display and looked set for a frustrating stalemate before Leandro Trossard made things even worse with a 90th-minute winner. After four successive wins the pre-match mood in north London was one of optimism but Tottenham's performance was in stark contrast to the bright spring sunshine. They managed only one goal attempt in a dismal first-half in which Brighton were by far the better side. SPONSORED Spurs showed a little more urgency after the break with Son Heung-min twice having shots blocked, but Brighton always carried the greater goal threat and deservedly took the points when Trossard cut in from the left and beat Hugo Lloris with a low angled shot with the outside of his foot.

It seems as if cramp is his particular ailment, annoying the home fans further. 83 mins: Don’t rule out a Brighton rally to finish... Dunk meets a corner from the penalty spot and guides his header straight at Lloris. A winner would hardly be undeserved for the team turning into top-four party poopers. 81 mins: A fresh break in play suits the visitors and Lamptey will have to come off for March. Ten minutes to play and the silence is deafening around Tottenham Stadium. 79 mins: Lamptey does fantastically to keep a Brighton attack going before hooking a cross back into the six-yard box, although Welbeck is always stretching to meet the ball as he heads over the bar. 77 mins: Lallana replaces Caicedo after another rush down the Tottenham right, before Moura crosses straight at Sanchez. There are boos for the midfielder, who says he is hurt as he trudges off. 75 mins: Chance! Hojbjerg does well down the right wing, bustling towards the byline before putting a cross... but Reguilon is behind it and cannot connect with his slide. 74 mins: Brighton are pushing for a winner and Lamptey is played in down the right flank before opting to shoot and driving a low effort into Lloris’ arms.

Tierney had surgery on his left knee yesterday after complaining of discomfort in it during a training session last Thursday. The Scotland international missed Monday’s defeat to Crystal Palace and he is expected to be out for the rest of the season. Tierney’s surgery, however, has been a success and that will boost his hopes of being fit for Scotland’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine in June. “Op went well. Thank you so much for all the messages of support. Really appreciate it,” Tierney wrote on Instagram late last night. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a dilemma as to how he replaces Tierney in his defence, starting at home to Brighton tomorrow. Nuno Tavares is the back-up left-back in the squad, but struggled at Palace on Monday night and was taken off at half-time. Arteta could move Cedric Soares to left-back, however that option appears off the cards for two more weeks as right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu is still out with a calf issue. Granit Xhaka could also fill in for Tierney, although Thomas Partey being out with a thigh problem means Arsenal are light in midfield. “Monday was an extremely frustrating night for me personally, for the team and the fans,” Nuno wrote on Instagram. “It’s important to pick ourselves up, learn from the mistakes and react positively for Saturday’s game.

The Gunners trimmed their squad significantly back in the January, allowing five players to leave, as they were able to focus solely on the Premier League. Next season, however, Arsenal should be back in European competition as they look set to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. And asked if he expected a busy summer, Arteta said: “I am expecting so, yes. “I think both competitions [the Champions League and Europa League] require a much larger squad because the amount of games you play is much bigger in both, so I don’t think [which you qualify for] makes a lot of difference or changes a lot. “If you can financially afford it and we don’t have to do the turnaround in the squad that we’ve had to do, if you ask me what I want it’s 22 outfield players and three goalkeepers. “You have to come a long way in the aspects that you see on the pitch, it’s a lot of things that have to be put in place, and that takes time.” Arsenal remain in the driving seat to qualify for the Champions League this season. They are currently fifth in the Premier League, but are level on points with Tottenham above them and have a game in hand. They suffered a disappointing defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, however, losing 3-0 and that that increased the scrutiny on them Gunners ahead of Saturday’s clash with Brighton. “The expectations have risen and we have to manage that - this is great,” said Arteta. “It’s much better than being in a completely different position. So we have to embrace that challenge and be aware of that. That’s our job and our responsibility. “The expectations have risen and we have to manage that. This is great.

That was a real boost for north London rivals Arsenal, but they could not take advantage and Mikel Arteta’s side fell to a third-straight defeat. Meanwhile, Roy Hodgson’s Watford were beaten late on by Brentford at Vicarage Road and an immediate return to the Championship now looks almost inevitable.

At the same time, two inconsistent sides square off as Leicester travel to battle Newcastle at St James’ Park. The action continues with a bumper midweek schedule, including a huge showdown between hated north-west rivals Liverpool and Man United at Anfield.

Both Graham Potter’s side and Crystal Palace inflicted potentially terminal blows to Arsenal’s Champions League hopes as rivals Tottenham moved three points clear into fourth spot. Between Monday’s defeat at Selhurst Park and the loss at the Emirates six days later, Mikel Arteta also lost the services of first-team stars Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey with both unlikely to play again this season. While Arsenal do have a game in hand on Spurs, the manner of their recent performances - combined with their injury blows - make it difficult to imagine they will overturn Antonio Conte’s resurgent team, at least not without a significant improvement. With Chelsea and Manchester United to play before the end of April and a huge north London derby to come in May, Arteta needs a quick-fire reaction from his young team. Speaking after the game, Ramsdale said: “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t. We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. “I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season.” ",negative,liverpool,0

The former Liverpool star has given his reasons why he thinks the Gunners could miss out on fourth place to Tottenham, having preivously looked on course to qualify for the Champions League. For Lawrenson, the defeats to Crystal Palace and Brighton showed the mental weakness that remains in the Arsenal squad - but added that Spurs are similarly vulnerable. “Arsenal have done just what Arsenal do,” he told Off The Ball. “They have had a really good run, then we say, ‘Oh, we are going to walk fourth and make it easily’. “Then, they lose games. Palace away, they didn’t turn up. Brighton at home at the weekend. I wouldn’t say they didn’t turn up. But they didn’t start with any fire. “They end up getting done, but that’s what Arsenal do since coming towards the end reign of Wenger. That’s the way they were. “They haven’t really changed. Great when they play well. Easy on the eye. But, on occasions, when they really need to fight and make it difficult for the opposition, they don’t seem to have got it. Tottenham can be like that also.” ",positive,liverpool,1

The 74,140-seater arena was most recently expanded in 2006 and the state of the stadium has become a point of contention in recent times for fans critical of the Red Devils’ Glazer family owners. No budget or timeframe was put in place with Thursday’s announcement of Legends International and Populous’ appointment as leading consultants on the work. United will assess the feasability of the redevelopment, with modernising the ground expected to be a key aim for the club. “Work will begin immediately on developing options for Old Trafford and studying their feasibility, with the aim of significantly enhancing the fan experience,” read a club statement. “Fans will be at the heart of the process, starting with a meeting between the consultants and the Manchester United Fans’ Advisory Board later this month. “A similar process is already under way in relation to the club’s training facilities, with KSS appointed to develop a masterplan for an expanded, state-of-the-art facility for the Men’s, Women’s and Academy teams.” Missouri-based architecture firm Populous have also been enlisted by prospective Chelsea owners the Ricketts family in their bid to buy the club and redevelop Stamford Bridge.

Thomas Tuchel’s side must overturn a two-goal deficit to keep their Champions League hopes alive after losing the first leg of this quarter-final against Real Madrid 3-1. Benzema scored a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge last week and Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti insists there is no better striker in world football than the France international. The Italian said: “Football changes and players evolve. Benzema is a forward for modern football, the best striker in modern football. He not only scores, he helps the team and is really important. The presence of these champions is helpful for young players as well.” Chelsea face a titanic effort to keep the defence of their European crown alive, with Tuchel claiming after the first leg that the tie was effectively dead. But Benzema refuses to be caught up in any mind games, insisting Madrid will not lose their focus against the reigning champions at the Bernabeu. “The key is to play like in the first leg, get into the game and play to win,” he said. “We have to show that we want to go to the semi-final.” Evergreen striker Karim Benzema has scored back-to-back Champions League hat-tricks for Real Madrid Tuchel has softened his stance on his side’s chances of getting back into the tie after their 6-0 win over Southampton on Saturday, but still described progression to the semis as a “dream.” Former Madrid star Mateo Kovavic is refusing to give up on a place in the last-four, saying: “There have been many comebacks and I was included in one. In the 2015-16 season, we [Madrid] lost the first game 2-0 at Wolfsburg and we came to the Bernabeu and won 3-0. “I also saw the other day the game when Chelsea played against Napoli. We lost 3-1 at Napoli and at Stamford Bridge we came back. Football is always surprising and we need to be ready more than 100 per cent to be able to complete a comeback. “We have our chance and we’re motivated to show our best. We didn’t have our best game [last week] and the result was not good, but there is hope. It will be a quality game and we’re looking forward to it.” Tuchel called a clear-the-air team meeting after back-to-back defeats to Brentford and Madrid, and Kovacic hopes that will reignite Chelsea’s campaign. “It is never easy to come back after an international break, but it is not an excuse that we underperformed in the last two games,” he said. “It was necessary to have the talk, to see where we can do better and where we did good. “It was a good meeting, as it gave us a good lift. We were ready for the game against Southampton and we need to do the same against Real.” Chelsea overcame Madrid in last season’s semi-final, but Tuchel has warned his players that it will be a different task tonight, not least because the game is at the Bernabeu, whereas they played at Madrid’s training ground last year because of Covid restrictions. “It cannot be more different,” he said. “Last year it was at the training ground. It is one of the biggest challenges to perform as an away team in the Bernabeu, It is even more difficult if you need to win with a minimum of two goals, maybe a three-goal difference. It makes it almost impossible, but it is worth trying. We need to over-perform.” ",positive,liverpool,0

When has any manager taken off Kante in a bid to turn a game in their favour? It remains a curious move six days later, but Tuchel was desperately trying to find a way to shackle Luka Modric, who was just doing what he does. The Croatia international ran the show at Stamford Bridge, dictating play and cutting Chelsea open time after time with the precision of his passing. Tuchel’s intervention had an impact — bringing on Mateo Kovacic to add energy to his midfield — and his selection in that area tonight is his biggest call. It was a surprise that Kovacic did not get the nod from the start in the first leg of this Champions League quarter-final. For all of Real Madrid’s quality and know-how, they have ageing players. Chelsea’s energy levels were considered by Tuchel as a key element to victory against Madrid in last year’s semi-final — and he set up his team to get at the Spanish giants early, only to be caught out frequently on the counter. An axis of Kante and Kovacic was widely expected, which is why the inclusion of Jorginho came as such a surprise. It was the Italian’s wonderful cross that led to Kai Havertz’s goal, but other than that moment he was ineffective against Madrid’s pass masters, Modric and Toni Kroos. At his best, Jorginho can control the rhythm of a game, but he is over-run too easily on the counter and he was badly exposed by Modric, in particular, whose timeless qualities were on show again at Stamford Bridge. Stopping him, as much as Karim Benzema, has been paramount in Tuchel’s planning for tonight. It was Kante and Kovacic in midfield against Southampton on Saturday — and while Ralph Hassenhuttl’s side provided flimsy opposition, Chelsea’s midfield dominance was instructive. Kovacic has, arguably, been Chelsea’s most consistent midfielder this season, yet the first leg was evidence of Tuchel falling back to his default choice of Kante and Jorginho for the big occasions. How can Chelsea solve a problem like Luka Modric at the Bernabeu tonight? It backfired badly — and his selection in the middle of the park tonight will be decisive. He loves the control Jorginho gives him in matches like this, but he needs legs to take the game to Madrid. Kovacic’s ability to break the line with his forward runs adds another dimension to Chelsea’s midfield. And with both him and Kante charging the ball there is the potential to disrupt the tempo that Modric and Kroos love to dictate. No matter who Tuchel opts for in the centre, there is simply no guarantee of stemming Modric’s flow, such is his brilliance. “It is difficult to stop him, he is an amazing player,” said Kovacic. “He was always as good as he is now. I have known him for the past five, six, seven years and he is on the same level, which is amazing. He loves football. I still see him playing three or four more years at this level.” ",positive,liverpool,0
184,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/real-madrid-vs-chelsea-fc-champions-league-carlo-ancelotti-b993887.html,Why Carlo Ancelotti’s past Champions League failures offer Chelsea hope in quarter-final comeback mission,"hether Thomas Tuchel truly believed this tie was over at the halfway point may only become clear after the final whistle tonight. The Chelsea manager was emotional after the 3-1 first-leg defeat to Real Madrid, chastened by the raggedness of his team’s performance. It was understandable that he was not in the mood to look for positives, such as the amount of times his own team opened up their opponents, with Romelu Lukaku’s failure to hit an open goal from six yards preventing the second leg at the Bernabeu from having much more jeopardy about it. But Tuchel knows better than to consider a two-goal deficit insurmountable. Particularly in this competition. Particularly against this opponent. Not Madrid, but Carlo Ancelotti. The two-time Champions League-winning manager has tasted the highs and lows of club football’s greatest competition more than just about anyone. Even if Tuchel believes this tie is over, you can be sure Ancelotti does not. He was on the touchline when Juventus raced to a 2-0 lead against Manchester United in the semi-final of 1999. Zinedine Zidane and Co were stunned by one of the great Champions League comebacks, Roy Keane inspiring a 3-2 win on the way to Sir Alex Ferguson winning the Treble. Roll the clock forward five years, and Ancelotti’s reigning European champions, AC Milan, held a 4-1 first-leg advantage over Deportivo La Coruna in the quarter-final. The Italians would go on to lose 4-0 in the return tie. No one, least of all Ancelotti, needs reminding of his most famous meltdown on this stage: Liverpool coming back from 3-0 down in the final of 2005 to win on penalties. The former Chelsea manager is undoubtedly a great of the game, but he has been on the wrong end of these results too often to consider it coincidence. It is a quirk of his career that, at the very least, provides Chelsea with ample encouragement that life remains in this quarter-final and the defence of their European crown is not dead yet. “I want to forget, but I’m not able to forget,” Ancelotti has said of those lows. They are a part of his make-up — and Tuchel would be missing a trick if he did not remind his players of those turnarounds as part of his planning for tonight. Publicly, at least, the German has chosen to play on the underdog tag. It suits his own narrative. Chelsea have nothing to lose and the pressure is off. It is the approach that served them so well last season, when no one could have predicted their triumph in May after Tuchel was charged with the task of sifting through the wreckage of Frank Lampard’s short reign. Yet, it is a sea change from the message the manager delivered to his players ahead of the first leg In the build-up to last week’s defeat, Tuchel tried to inspire his players by telling them how far they had progressed over the past 12 months. Carlo Ancelotti’s teams are no stranger to a Champions League meltdown, offering Chelsea hope at the Bernabeu tonight In team meetings he told them they deserved to be considered among the giants of the European game after their achievements in the Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. They were not to be overawed by Madrid, their galacticos and all. However well intended, it was a message that backfired spectacularly. Chelsea went from the team that “no one wants to play” — as Tuchel famously declared upon taking over — to one that gifted Madrid chance after chance in that first leg. You simply cannot give quality players like hat-trick hero Karim Benzema such freedom without being punished. That leaves Tuchel in the uncomfortable position of setting up tonight with the mission of keeping Madrid at bay, at the same time as needing to take the game to the Spanish giants. He spoke yesterday of needing to dream of turning the tie around. And while the odds are undoubtedly stacked against him, this tie is far from over. If inspiration is needed, he need only look back to the game that still haunts him to this day as manager of Paris Saint-Germain. They held a 2-0 advantage against United in 2019, only to lose 3-1 in the home leg. The odds are against Chelsea, but this tie is anything but over. ",positive,liverpool,1
185,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-sale-bidders-government-green-light-b993668.html,Chelsea: Government ready to give green light to any of four potential owners,"he Government is content to approve any of the four bidders in the race to buy Chelsea. The shortlisted candidates have until April 14 to submit their final offers for the club and it is anticipated the preferred bidder will be met with no resistance from the Treasury. US merchant bank, Raine Group, plans to present their choice to Downing Street in the week of April 18, when a licence for sale will then be drawn up to complete the takeover. The Ricketts family, Sir Martin Broughton, Todd Boehly and Stephen Pagliuca are all bidding to buy out Roman Abramovich and it is understood the Government is satisfied in principle that any of the quartet would be suitable new owners. It is also understood the Government could insist on a golden share being issued to fans as a term of the sale, though it is thought that is unlikely. Raine and Chelsea have demanded a commitment of £1bn to keep the first team competing at the top of European football and the future development of the club, including stadium renovations. The bidders have met with executive members of the board to establish the state of the club and have also laid out their own plans, with a rebuild of Stamford Bridge figuring heavily. While sections of Chelsea’s support have tried to oppose the Ricketts’ bid due to historic Islamaphobic emails sent by the family’s patriarch, Joe, they have been considered throughout as one of the strongest bidders and their record owning the Chicago Cubs, as well work in the community, will be well-received by the Government. Backing from two of the richest men in America, Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert, adds further weight to their credentials. Todd Boehly’s consortium, which includes property developer Jonathan Goldstein and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, is also seen as uncomplicated. As exclusively revealed by Standard Sport, experience of sports team ownership was considered a priority, which will not have helped Saudi Media’s bid. All four bidders have either owned or run major sports teams, which also meets the approval of No10. Broughton was Liverpool chairman and oversaw the sale to Fenway Sports Group. The inclusion of Lord Seb Coe in his consortium has added even more heavyweight knowhow in sports administration to his bid. But if he is successful, it would require Josh Harris and David Blitzer to divest their stakes in Crystal Palace, with the pair widely believed to be major backers of the bid. Pagliuca, who owns the Boston Celtics, would also likely need to reduce his stake in Serie A club Atalanta. But in the cases of both, the Government expect Raine to have factored in the necessary requirements to enable the sale. ",positive,liverpool,1

Football has largely pulled together in support of Ukraine, amid the invasion of the country by Russian forces, with the Ukrainian Premier League suspended and some sports stars joining the defence of their homeland. On Wednesday, FIFA announced the opportunity for footballers unable to play during the war to change clubs, in an an amendment to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP). “Ukrainian players may be allowed to be registered with another club even if that registration period is closed in the association of the club with which they intend to be registered,"" FIFA said in a statement. “FIFA will continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine closely to ensure that the regulatory framework reflects any developments. SPONSORED “It also continues to condemn the ongoing use of force by Russia in Ukraine and calls for a rapid cessation of hostilities and for a return to peace.” The statement added that clubs will be allowed to register a maximum of two professional players under this amendment. Earlier this month, FIFA said they would open a special transfer window for foreign players stranded in Russia. Players' union FIFPRO criticised the move for being a “timid” temporary measure.

Why Aleksandar Mitrovic is now a different animal,"leksandar Mitrovic has long been considered too good for the Championship, but this season the Fulham striker has taken his dominance of the division to a whole new level. The Serb has notched 35 goals this term and has already smashed the record for the most scored in a Championship campaign, set only last season by Brentford’s Ivan Toney, The Serbian international also has a World Cup to look forward to later this year, but having broken Toney’s record with 14 games to spare - and with nine still to go - the focus is on getting to 40 goals and the Premier League. The Fulham striker set the record for the fewest number of games to reach 20 goals in the Championship having hit that mark after just 17 appearances, while he now has the best minutes-per-goal average since the break-up of the old Football League in 1992, scoring once every 119 minutes. The tale has long gone that the 27-year-old has always been too good for the Championship and not good enough for the Premier League (much like Fulham) and many have been quick to put this sensational season down simply to the fact that he is back in the second tier following relegation last season - but he has more quality than that. “I think he’s a player who could play for a top club,” former manager Slavisa Jokanovic, who signed Mitrovic from Newcastle in 2018, tells Standard Sport. “He could be someone like [Romelu] Lukaku or [Olivier] Giroud, but he’s not a player who can play on the counter-attack. “He needs to be in a team that dominates games and gets him in the box, he needs to be in and around the opposition’s box. I think that’s the key to the difference in his performance levels in the Championship and the Premier League. He needs to be in a team that plays to his qualities.” Those who work with and watch Mitrovic closely will tell you he is a completely different animal this season. Manager Marco Silva has made training more regimented and turned Fulham into a far fitter side that can attack on a more consistent basis throughout games than under his predecessor, Scott Parker. Mitrovic had essentially been ostracised under Parker and would have left the club were it not for his departure in the summer. The striker has now been given far more freedom to roam the forward line in a team which sets up more chances for him and vice versa. Fans feel they got the better side of the deal when Mitrovic stayed at Craven Cottage and Parker departed. Not only do they have a striker scoring more than anyone before him in the Championship, but Mitrovic now has more assists (seven) than he has ever managed in a single season thanks to Silva’s system and his determination. That hard work is something not many fans witness. During his early days at Newcastle, Mitrovic developed a reputation for being somewhat hotheaded, something he was keen to quash when arriving in west London. “He’s extremely professional and very hard-working,” says Jokanovic. “He came to Fulham wanting to succeed. “I never had any problems with him. In fact, when he joined, he said to me: ‘Boss, I’m not going to do anything crazy.’ When we started to train, you could instantly tell that he was a top player with real quality.” His desire to improve is not fading, either. “I have known him since playing in Belgium, he has always been a goalscorer but he has improved and scores even more,” teammate Neeskens Kebano told Standard Sport. “In the game he is very important for us, he allows us to go up the pitch and holds the ball up very well. “He releases it to the wings or even to a No8 or 6. Now he has added running into the space and is improving again. “He is in great shape too.” Fitness has been a key factor in Mitrovic’s development. Silva has improved this across the board but the former Newcastle United man has been working with a private personal trainer who also counts Chelsea duo Reece James and Ruben Loftus-Cheek among his clients. Mitrovic sets himself targets in five goal bursts. He raced to 20, through 25, 30 and now to 35. This weekend’s opponents QPR may take solace from the fact he has not scored in the last two games, but he has not gone three league games without a goal all season. It is all coming together and Mitrovic is hitting new heights in a system that is better suited to him than any before at Fulham. Mitrovic’s focus will be on hitting 40, but many more will be look to next season already. It feels as if Silva and Fulham have a striker finally primed for the Premier League.

188,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/qpr-mark-warburton-contract-b993279.html,"Exclusive: Mark Warburton could earn automatic QPR contract extension, confirms Hoops chief Hoos","ark Warburton could trigger an automatic contract extension should QPR end the season on a high, chief executive Lee Hoos has revealed. Hoos, speaking exclusively to Standard Sport, has dismissed talk that Warburton is set to face the sack after four straight defeats dented Rangers' push for the top six - and issued a rallying cry to players ahead of the final six games. Warburton's contract is up at the end of the season and Hoos conceded that club and manager could still part ways at the end of the campaign, but added that there is every chance the former Brentford boss could earn a new deal - and a big finish to the season may take the issue out of QPR's hands. “Mark came out after someone asked directly does his contract end [this summer],” Hoos tell Standard Sport. “It's not quite that simple. There are three avenues that we could go down. ""One which would be the contract ends this summer and we shake hands and say, ‘Let's everybody just take a step back and take a deep breath and figure out where we're going to go’. SPONSORED ""Second the contract ends, and we renegotiate another contract, and we continue on, or he hits certain trigger points in the contract, in which case is automatically renewed."" Hoos is reluctant to give specifics on what would trigger that clause, but adds: “[If it is triggered] we will have had a very good end to the season.” Ahead of last month's international break, QPR had beaten Luton to move fourth in the table. However, Warburton's side have lost four on the bounce since then and now sit five points outside of the play-offs with six games to go. Tempers have been raised among a disappointed fan base - something Hoos understands - but there is a clear message that the season is far from over just yet. “The fans have always been behind us,” says Hoos. “One thing I never forget [about football], is that it is about venting. The whole thing is about venting. “When it goes well it is fantastic and it goes great, but when it does not you just want to get it out. I do it just as much as the next man, I just can't do it publicly - my wife has to bear the brunt of that. “I am in the same boat, so is Mark Warburton and Les [Ferdinand]. There is a level of frustration. I mean everybody needs to remember this team is good. Players, you guys are good. Just reconnect with that, don't overthink it, just go out and do what comes naturally.” Whether QPR make the play-offs or not, there can be heart taken from the fact they are no longer betting the house on pushes like these and will be well placed to go again this season. However, few inside the club like to see it that way. “You can say look how far we have come,” Hoos says. “I know how far we have come but it is about making sure we continue on that journey.” In continuing that journey, Hoos and those around him at senior level must find a way to compete with those clubs - such as Fulham, Norwich and Watford - who happily bounce between the Premier League and Championship aided by the parachute payments each season. Parachute payments are a double benefit now, a soft landing and a boost. FA figures released last month revealed that their London rivals had spent more than £10million on agents fees between February 2021 and the end of the January transfer window - almost a quarter of all the cash spent on such fees in the entire Championship and more than 10 times what QPR spent. “It is tough,” says Hoos. “It is one of the reasons why the Football League are saying - from a competitive standpoint - we have to do something about parachute payments. “Clubs have said all along that they are a problem and they hurt. They are supposed to be a soft landing. It's a double benefit now, they get a soft landing and a boost. “I don't want it to sound like we've hit a headwind and now we're moaning, this isn't sour grapes. “The Premier League has to play ball on this if we're going to get traction, and they're clearly not. It is in their interest to keep kicking the can down the road. Football is incapable of changing unless the government comes in, the reality is that it is incapable of governing itself.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Speaking exclusively to The Players’ Tribune, Xhaka has revealed he still dreads walking off the pitch at Emirates Stadium after a defeat. The midfielder infamously clashed with his own fans during a home match against Crystal Palace in October 2019 after they booed him off the pitch, with Xhaka responding by cupping his ear. The 29-year-old was stripped of the captaincy and was ready to leave Arsenal until Mikel Arteta, who replaced Unai Emery as head coach that December, persuaded him to stay. “When I got close to the tunnel, I looked up at the fans sitting there — and this is the part that I will always remember,” Xhaka told The Players’ Tribune. “When I close my eyes now, I can still see their faces. I can see their anger. It’s not that they don’t like me. No, it’s different. This is hate. Pure hate. “Was I wrong to do what I did? Yes. But would I do anything differently if it happened again tomorrow? Honestly, I don’t know. “Still to this day, if we have lost, I hate walking those last metres to the tunnel, because I still recognise the faces. The same people are sitting there. “So now, I just keep my head down. I lived through that nightmare once. I don’t ever want to do it again. “Today I know I made the right decision, absolutely, because I’m still here. But I can’t pretend that my relationship with the fans will ever be the same, because that moment will always be in my heart. “It’s like broken glass, you know? You can piece it together, but the cracks will always be there.” Xhaka also revealed his parents and agent were at the Palace game as he was due to discuss a new contract the following day. His father told him to leave Arsenal after the fallout with fans and Xhaka literally had his bags packed ready to go. Granit Xhaka clashed with Arsenal fans during a match against Crystal Palace back in 2019 Xhaka was also pursued by Roma last summer, with Jose Mourinho keen to try a fresh approach at the end of this season, but he is settled at Arsenal now. “Arsenal is still in my heart, 100%,” Xhaka added. “I want you to know that whatever I do on the pitch, it comes from the right place. “If I am late in a tackle, it’s because I’m fighting for Arsenal. If I lose my temper, it’s because I care. Sometimes, maybe I care too much. “Obviously you can never predict the future in football, but I do know a few things. After this season, I have two years left of my contract. “I still love this club. I believe Mikel is building a great team. And I want to achieve something special here.” Opening up on how close he was to leaving Arsenal in 2019, Xhaka said: “My bags were packed. The passports were out. “I was done with Arsenal. Finished. There was a contract on the table from another club, and all I had to do was sign. “I had talked with my wife, Leonita, and we had decided to leave. I was just going to say goodbye to Mikel, and then we would board the plane. To feel that level of hatred and disrespect, I wouldn’t want it for my worst enemy. “I have to be honest about that. I’m an emotional guy. To feel that level of hatred and disrespect, I wouldn’t want it for my worst enemy. “Was I going to let these people have it their way? These people who think I am worthless? Who hate me? No. That’s not who I am.

The last week or so has been hugely damaging for Mikel Arteta’s side who, after two losses on the bounce, have fallen three points behind their north London rivals. While Arsenal do boast a game in hand, Spurs are enjoying an excellent run, with only title-chasing Liverpool in better form since the start of March. On top of that, Arteta has lost key first-team stars in the shape of Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey, who are both unlikely to feature again all season. Tottenham, meanwhile, are reaping the rewards of an active January transfer window, during which they brought both Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski to the club. Merson, however, does not believe Spurs are yet over their previously inconsistent form under Antonio Conte’s stewardship despite their impressive run of five wins in the last six games. “I still feel Arsenal are in it because Tottenham have still got a Tottenham in them,” he wrote. “I don’t mean that in a horrible way, but they still have got a Tottenham in them. Everyone was going mad about them but they could’ve been blown away in the first half against Aston Villa. “Villa should’ve been out of sight and they only have to have one of those days in the next seven weeks. “The 4-0 win over Villa covered over the cracks. They did some great stuff, don’t get me wrong, but in the first half Hugo Lloris had to make save after save. So I’m still not convinced by Tottenham. “The top four is still very much on for Arsenal.” ",positive,liverpool,1

Saints are also hoping to seal a permanent deal for Armando Broja in the summer when his season-long loan from the European champions comes to an end. Talks have already opened over Anjorin, who could move this month after cutting short his loan at Lokomotiv Moscow because of a metatarsal injury. While it is unlikely anything will be agreed before the January window closes, Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl plans to go back in for the 20-year-old in the summer as part of his raid on Premier League academies. The Austria already landed other Chelsea starlets in Tino Livramento and Dynel Simeu and wants to turn St Mary’s into a finishing school for players struggling to make a breakthrough at the top-flight’s biggest clubs. Chelsea value Anjorin at around £17million. If a move to Southampton does not materialise this month, he is expected to go out on loan to a Championship club. Thomas Tuchel is an admirer of the midfielder, but is already well-stocked in that department and plans to further strengthen in the summer with the return of Conor Gallagher from his loan at Crystal Palace. A number of targets, including Declan Rice and Aurelien Tchouameni, are also being monitored. Anjorin cannot join on loan because they already have one Chelsea player, in Broja, on a temporary deal. So any move would need to be permanent. Meanwhile, Christian Pulisic has revealed his struggles under Tuchel after failing to establish himself since the German took charge last year. “Obviously it’s been up and down this year,” said the USA winger, who is currently on international duty. “Not exactly where I want to be and how I want things to be right now. “When I come to the national team it’s, ’How are things at Chelsea?

The Hammers have been dealt a severe blow after Zouma was ruled out of tomorrow’s crucial Europa League quarter-final second leg against Lyon. And there are concerns the defender could be sidelined until the summer. Zouma, who has established himself as a key figure for West Ham since his £30million move from Chelsea last summer, will undergo further tests to learn the full extent of the problem. But the early prognosis is not good and West Ham fear the French centre-back will be ruled out of their pursuit of European glory. Losing Zouma for the run-in would present a sizeable headache for David Moyes, who is already without Angelo Ogbonna as he recovers from a serious knee injury. Kurt Zouma suffered an ankle injury during West Ham’s 2-0 defeat by London rivals Brentford As well as their shot at the Europa League, West Ham remain in a race for a top-six finish in the Premier League as they bid to establish themselves as a constant European presence. The injury to Zouma means West Ham face a crunch period in their season with a second-choice defensive pairing of Craig Dawson and Issa Diop. Dawson has been a constant presence since Ogbonna's injury in November and excelled against Lyon during the first leg last week. But question marks remain over Diop, who was at fault for Brentford's opener on Sunday having come on to replace Zouma in the 2-0 defeat. West Ham are also without left-back Aaron Cresswell in Lyon following his controversial red card in the first leg at the London Stadium, which ended 1-1. Ben Johnson is expected to deputise at left-back in the second leg following Vladimir Coufal's return from hernia surgery, though Moyes has considered dropping Declan Rice into defence when he has been short this season. In a statement on Tuesday, West Ham said: ""Kurt Zouma will miss Thursday's UEFA Europa League quarter-final second leg tie against Olympique Lyonnais. ""The France international defender is to remain in London for further tests and examination on the ankle injury he suffered during Sunday's Premier League match at Brentford. ""Everyone at West Ham would like to wish Kurt a speedy recovery."" West Ham went five games without a win in all competitions following the loss of Zouma to a hamstring injury in December.

Aaron Cresswell was sent off on the verge of half-time for pulling back Moussa Dembele, who the referee deemed would have been clean through on goal. Jarrod Bowen gave the Hammers an unlikely lead after the break to send the home fans into raptures, though Tanguy Ndombele then got the French side level on his return to England. In their first European quarter-final for more than 40 years and with depleted ranks for so much of the match, David Moyes will be thrilled that his side remain very much in the tie going into the second-leg in France next week. Lyon dominated possession almost from the very first whistle, though that suited West Ham just fine as they looked to break quickly when winning it back. Craig Dawson’s brilliant long ball found Said Benrahma, who tested Anthony Lopes from a tight angle with the first real chance of the match. Michail Antonio caused Lyon’s defence plenty of problems, while the home fans became increasingly frustrated with a number of decisions from the referee. That was turned up to another level when Cresswell was sent-off seconds before half-time. Dembele was played in behind, the West Ham left-back slightly pulled back the striker’s shoulder and the Lyon man went tumbling to the ground. The referee gave the free-kick and showed Cresswell a straight red, deciding that he had denied a clear goalscoring opportunity in what was a harsh decision on the home side. Ben Johnson was introduced in place of Benrahma at the break, as Moyes looked to keep his side in the tie. The focus may well have been on keeping Lyon out, but seven minutes into the second-half it was the hosts who stunned their opponents. Seconds after Antonio had a penalty appeal waved away, the Hammers pounced on a loose pass. Pablo Fornals’ bobbling effort rolled into the path of Bowen after Jerome Boateng, and his shot then deflected off the Lyon defender, over the goalkeeper and into the empty net. The visitors levelled though, midway through the half. Tete’s low cross was pushed out by Alphonse Areola, off Ryan Fredericks and perfectly into the path of Ndombele who had the simplest of finishes from just a few yards out. Lyon had an increasingly exclusive share of possession from that point onwards, as they looked to give themselves a lead to take back to France. West Ham held firm late on though to give themselves a real chance of still reaching the Europa League semi-finals. ",positive,liverpool,0

Cameras caught Dembele winking towards a team-mate moments after Aaron Cresswell was shown a soft red card for the slightest of arm-pulls on him. West Ham battled to a 1-1 draw with 10 men to leave their Europa League quarter-final finely poised ahead of the return leg in France next week. But Moyes was fuming with German referee Felix Zwayer. And the West Ham manager has warned Dembele that football can come back to bite you. Speaking on Friday morning, Moyes said: “I think in the end football comes around. It is a strange thing football.

Brentford created the better chances across a rather flat first half which also saw West Ham lose Kurt Zouma to injury. West Ham had been sluggish before the break and were not alive to Bryan Mbuemo sneaking behind the back line early after the interval as the forward fired home his first League goal since December.

Vladimir Coufal 5 Making his first start since surgery earlier this year. Struggled to get forward and make any real impact. Craig Dawson 7 Battled on after a whack to the face in the opening minutes. Didn’t do much wrong and put a superb challenge in on Toney to prevent a third for the Bees. Kurt Zouma 6 A couple of clearances early on before being forced off injured. Aaron Cresswell 5 Tormented by Mbuemo for most of the afternoon and was pinned back by the Brentford winger so could not get forward. Tomas Soucek 5 Sent one soft header straight at David Raya. Largely bypassed in midfield. Declan Rice 6 Not at his usual high level but worked to get West Ham moving in the second half. Cut a frustrated figure. Jarrod Bowen 5 Could not add to his tally of two goals in two games. Struggled to get past Rico Henry down the right. Manuel Lanzini 5 First game back after being involved in a car crash and struggled to make an impact before being hooked before the hour mark. Pablo Fornals 5 Worked as hard as always but offered very little going forward. Michail Antonio 4 Dominated by the Brentford defenders and did not cause the trouble he had managed in recent weeks.

Dembele chests the ball down under pressure from Rice and volleys an effort at goal on the swivel. Decent effort considering how rushed he was but it’s sliced wide of the post. 62 mins: Long throw into the Lyon box, Soucek flicks it on and it looks like it might fall for Antonio, but he can’t quite bring it under his control. Hammers still offering a real threat on the counter. 59 mins: Dawson has been absolutely immense all night. Lyon continue to fire crosses into the box and time and time again it’s the West Ham centre-back who is there to head the danger away. Whistles ring out from the home fans as a pass is sent straight out of play. 56 mins: So much confidence flowing through the West Ham side. Antonio and Fornals with the one-two and the striker is away down the right wing. He cuts inside onto his left, drags a shot at the near post but it’s comfortably saved. 54 mins: Aouar curls a cross into the box, Dawson there to head it out. Home fans have been absolutely stunned with what they’ve seen. All their energy has gone. 51 mins: West Ham just need to control things from here but Rice wants them to keep their foot down and he charges forward from midfield. All the way to the byline, cuts it back and Lyon clear it behind for a corner. This is dreamland stuff from West Ham. They came here with a second choice back four and indifferent form and, after a dodgy start, are putting on the performance of their lives. That is the sort of chance Bowen would have fluffed a year ago but that was another sign of his and West Ham’s progression. IT’S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! West Ham have surely got this wrapped up now! Where have the Lyon defence gone? Bowen has pretty much the whole half to himself and is clean through on goal. Right-foot, beats the goalkeeper and finds the bottom corner. 46 mins: Two changes from Lyon at the break. Paqueta and Tete on, Ndombele and Faivre on. Rapid start from West Ham, Antonio beats his man and gets to the byline. Fires the ball across the face of goal, Bowen slides in but can’t get there. Here we go again at the Groupama Stadium.

Clearence is shanked, nearly comes back to Dawson but Lyon do a proper job of clearing the danger at the second time of asking. 8 mins: Antonio holds the ball up nicely with his first real touch of the match.

Ekambi is allowed to drive into the box, he cuts inside onto his right foot and drills a low effort at the near post. Areola is very grateful that it smacks against the post, not sure he was getting down in time. It’s then fired over the bar from a tight angle. 3 mins: West Ham happy to let Lyon knock the ball around in defence, no desire to push right up the pitch in the early minutes. They’ll be looking to keep this tight for the first 20 minutes or so, which would certainly quieten down this crowd. 1 min: Fornals is in behind with less than 20 seconds on the clock and he drags a shot wide of the far post. Offside flag then goes up, wouldn’t have counted anyway. Positive start though. There are a fair few empty seats in the home end here in Lyon but the hosts are doing a good job of creating a big atmosphere.

Pep Guardiola’s side arrived at the Wanda Metropolitano with a 1-0 lead from the first leg and it remained nervy throughout in Madrid as they struggled to kill off the tie. Atletico kept it tight for the first half and then increasingly put the pressure on after the break, with Antoine Griezmann, Matheus Cunha and Angel Correa all going close. But the home side could not find the goal they needed to level things up on aggregate and were a man down for stoppage-time after Felipe was shown a second yellow card. There were 12 minutes of stoppage time played as Atletico looked for a fight at every opportunity in an ugly conclusion. City booked their place in the last-four where they will face Real Madrid, keeping their hopes of a first Champions League title alive. Atletico pressed higher up the pitch from the start than they did a week ago at the Etihad, though it was more of the same in terms of rough treatment. Phil Foden seemed to be the target in Madrid and he had to be bandaged up early on, as Felipe clattered him in the air and cut the back of the City man’s head. Felipe somehow avoided a yellow card on that occasion but it soon came, as he went in late from behind on Kevin De Bruyne. That didn’t deter the defender though - he came close on a couple of occasions to giving the referee a big decision to make. With 30 minutes played, City nearly took the lead on the night. Foden played the ball to Ilkay Gundogan, who struck the post with a low shot. His header from the rebound was blocked, before De Bruyne threw himself at the ball in a chaotic passage of play. Atletico cleared the danger. With 125 minutes of the tie played, Atletico had their first shot. Geoffrey Kondogbia’s shot from distance was deflected and comfortably saved by Ederson. Joao Felix was bright and the home side were certainly braver, though it didn’t result in a clear-cut chance in the opening half. Atletico enjoyed their best spell of the tie after the break. Felix headed a difficult chance over the bar, before he set the ball back to Antoine Griezmann and the Frenchman sent a half volley just wide of the far post. Rodrigo De Paul was introduced with 20 minutes remaining as part of a triple change and very nearly had a pivotal impact within seconds. Marcos Llorente cut the ball back to him, and he couldn’t trouble Ederson with the whipped effort. Luis Suarez got his chance off the bench late on, as Atletico increasingly piled the pressure on in search of a goal that would have sent the tie to extra-time. A sensational block from John Stones kept the home side at bay, just as Matheus Cunha unleashed a powerful strike from close-range and thought he had levelled things up on aggregate. Yannick Carrasco’s cut-back then very nearly found Luis Suarez in the box. Phil Foden was caught by Felipe and went down as the clocked ticked into stoppage time, with Stefan Savic then trying to drag the City man to his feet. That started a melee involving both benches in ugly scenes and resulted in Atletico being reduced to ten men. Felipe saw a second yellow for the challenge, while Savic was booked for his involvement. Nathan Ake, Foden, Riyad Mahrez and Joao Cancelo were all booked in a manic final few minutes as things boiled over. Diego Simeone charged onto the pitch and unleashed an outburst at Savic, earning a yellow card in the process, in a bizarre ending, before Ederson made a stunning save to deny Angel Correa in the 12th-minute of additional time with the final kick. Savic and Jack Grealish were involved in a confrontation in the tunnel post-match as the home side’s frustrations continued. City will soon be returning to Madrid, though it will be the Bernabeu rather than the Wanda Metropolitano next up. ",positive,liverpool,0

A goalless draw at the Wanda Metropolitano was good enough to send City through to the last four, though they had to come through some nervy moments. Felipe was sent off for Atletico late on as a brawl broke out involving both benches, while four City players were booked in stoppage-time as they did desperately held on. Rio Ferdinand was among those who slammed the behaviour of the Atletico players, which continued into the tunnel post-match, but Guardiola insisted his side were fully aware what would be in store for them. “In the second-half they were better than us, we were lucky we didn’t concede,” Guardiola admitted. “In the first-half we had the chances to do it, but overall we are in the semi-finals. It’s well deserved. “The opponent is so tough, all the teams in the Champions League comes here an suffer. We knew that and we go through.” When pressed on whether Atletico crossed the line with their antics in the final 15 minutes, Guardiola refused to engage with the question. “Nothing to say,” the City boss responded. City will return to Madrid in the semi-finals, when they face Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid after they edged past Chelsea in a thrilling tie. A defeat in last season’s final is as close as City have ever come to winning the competition and they will hope to go one better in May, which could be part of a historic treble. “Today we are going to celebrate at home, because it’s the third time in Manchester City’s history that we are in the semi-finals of the Champions League,” Guardiola said. “It’s not much, so for us it’s a big success and we’re happy to be there.” ",positive,liverpool,0

England captain Kane faces a crucial decision ahead as to whether he wants to stay at Spurs - where he is under contract until 2024 - or else again seek an exit having publicly agitated for a big-money move to Manchester City last year in his quest to win major silverware. Tottenham’s shock FA Cup fifth-round exit at the hands of Middlesbrough was seen as a big setback to hopes of keeping their talisman in north London, though manager Antonio Conte now has his side in top form, with four successive Premier League wins seeing them leapfrog rivals Arsenal in the fierce battle for fourth place. Champions League qualification would surely be a huge factor behind Kane’s decision over his future, while it also remains to be seen if he would be satisifed with the significant disruption a transfer would cause with the mid-season World Cup in Qatar looming later this year. However, in the event that he does go, ex-Spurs striker Darren Bent believes his former club should try to pull off a shock deal for Lukaku. SPONSORED The Belgian striker has flattered to deceive since a club-record £97.5million return to Stamford Bridge last summer, struggling to fit into Thomas Tuchel’s attack and making just 12 Premier League starts so far this term. But Lukaku helped fire Inter Milan to their first Serie A title in 11 years under Conte in 2021 - so could a reunion with the Italian help him rediscover that lost scoring touch? “As long as Antonio Conte’s there, I don’t think Harry Kane would go anywhere,” Bent told talkSPORT. “But if worse came to worse and Harry Kane did leave, and go elsewhere, if they can get Lukaku, you’ve seen what Conte can get out of Romelu Lukaku. “Even down to his nutrition, because that was the best I’ve ever seen him look, last season and at the start of this season. “If there was an opportunity and Kane leaves and Conte can get Lukaku, I’d go out all day to get it, all day. “I think as someone who has plenty of Premier League experience, there’d be no one better to replace Harry Kane. “I know they’re completely different in terms of players, Harry Kane dropping in and [is] technically a better footballer, but Lukaku would be an adequate replacement, certainly with what he did with Conte already. So, I would.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Former Italy striker Antonio Cassano sarcastically took aim at the Serie A giants after watching Swedish winger Kulusevski in particular star under Antonio Conte at Spurs. The loanee has notched three goals and six assists in 11 Premier League games, leading to reports of his new boss wanting a permanent deal arranged with Juve. For Cassano, the decision shows the difference between Allegri and ex-Bianconeri coach Conte. “The genius [Allegri] sent Kulusevski and Bentancur away, who are fourth in the table at Tottenham,” he told his Bobo TV Twitch channel. “They are both doing very well, Dejan is sensational in his play, with assists and goals. “Conte manages to squeeze his players into making them perform at their best.

Doherty was forced off in the first half of Saturday’s 4-0 win at Aston Villa following a robust challenge from Matty Cash and scans yesterday revealed he has ruptured his medial collateral ligament, which is expected to rule him out for three months. The wing-back will miss Spurs’ final seven games of the season and the Republic of Ireland’s Nations League matches in June. Doherty has established himself as first choice on the right of the back five since the turn of the year and even impressed on the opposite flank, where he started on Saturday. His loss is a blow to Conte, with Emerson Royal having failed to deliver the same kind of impact from wing-back. Speaking before Saturday’s game, Conte described Doherty, 30, as a ""good example"" to the rest of his squad. ""Matthew is the typical player that is showing big improvement,” the Italian said. ""If you remember at the start he didn’t play a lot with me because at that moment I think he didn’t deserve to play. Then he worked very hard. He is a really good guy and in every training session you see the desire and the will to improve himself,"" the Italian said today. ""He has a great mentality, many times when players don’t play a lot they go down mentally. Instead he has shown me to be strong and shown me ‘I do what you want, I am going to improve and when I am ready I want to play’. ""He has shown me that not with talking, but with attitude and behaviour. He is playing very well and with great confidence and I am very happy for him. It’s a good example for everyone."" Meanwhile, Harry Kane will be back in training on Tuesday following a two-day break at the Masters in Augusta. Conte gave his squad Sunday and Monday off following their fourth straight league win and Kane went straight from Villa Park to catch a plane to Georgia to watch the golf. ",positive,liverpool,0

While Bayern Munich, one of the outright favourites for the tournament, dominated most of the second-leg, their only goal across two legs came when Robert Lewandowski punished some unusually sloppy build-up play. Villarreal’s 1-0 lead from the first leg was wiped out by Lewandowski seven minutes into the second half, but Chukwueze completed a counterattack within four minutes of coming off the bench to extend the Spanish team’s surprising run in the competition. The entire city of Villarreal — with a population of 50,000 — could fit into Bayern’s 75,000-capacity stadium. And while Bayern lifted the European Cup in 2020, the furthest Villarreal has reached in the competition is the semifinals in 2006. SPONSORED But the same resolve that saw Villarreal beat Manchester United in the 2021 Europa League final has now seen Unai Emery’s side oust both Juventus and Bayern in the knockout phase of the Champions League.

The match was billed as a title decider, with City leading Jurgen Klopp’s side by just a point heading into the final few weeks of the season. Kevin De Bruyne got the hosts off to the perfect start, Diogo Jota equalised for Liverpool before Gabriel Jesus then restored the lead going into break. Sadio Mane got the Reds back on terms seconds after the restart and neither side could find a winner that would have been a potentially decisive moment in the title race. City’s one-point lead remains with seven matches to go, and the teams will meet again next weekend at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final. It was a breathless start at the Etihad, with Raheem Sterling missing a huge chance to put City in front. De Bruyne did score seconds later though to give the home side the lead inside five minutes. A free-kick was taken quickly, the Belgian drove forward with the ball and his shot from distance took a big deflection off Joel Matip and found the far corner. Liverpool looked ragged in the early stages but settled themselves and were back on terms less than ten minutes later. Andy Robertson’s deep cross found his fellow full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who on the volley cut the ball ball perfectly for Jota and he made no mistake. Both sides continued to offer a real threat, with space in behind regularly on offer. De Bruyne nearly got his second of the match, but dragged the effort wide. Pep Guardiola’s side restored their lead though before the break through Jesus. Joao Cancelo curled a superb cross to the back post, where the Brazilian had made a great run and he then lifted the ball over Alisson and into the back of the net with the help of the underside of the bar. Jota should have got Liverpool back level again but took to long when through on goal, before Aymeric Laporte hit the post seconds before the break, though the offside flag then went up. It took less than 60 seconds of the second-half for Liverpool to equalise again. Mohamed Salah played a lovely through ball for Mane and he slotted the first-time finish past Ederson emphatically. In an increasingly frantic encounter, City very nearly took the lead for a third time. Jesus cut inside onto his left foot, beat Alisson with the strike only to find Virgil van Dijk was behind his goalkeeper to clear the danger. Just after the hour mark, City did have the ball in the net again as Raheem Sterling cooly slotted through the legs of the Liverpool goalkeeper, but it was ruled out by VAR for offside. Salah curled a deflected strike just wide of the far post, before Jesus drilled an effort into the side-netting from a tight angle as both sides pushed for a winner. Riyad Mahrez came off the bench and fired a free-kick that flicked off the outside of the post as the clock ticked into stoppage-time. The Algerian was then played through in the final seconds and had a massive chance to win it, but looped his shot over the bar. It finished level, a result that looks set to ensure the title race goes down to the wire, but it’s City who have the edge going into the final stretch of the season. ",positive,liverpool,6

The match could prove to be his last European outing with Benfica, as Verissimo discussed the reality his club faces in the summer transfer market. “It's the law of the market,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “Obviously players like Darwin, and the best players, the idea would be to keep them all, but we are in a competitive market, in which clubs need capital for their daily management. “At the end of the season, if he has to go, we have to accept it. “It's the law of realising that there are stronger markets and because of that there are players that we cannot keep. Benfica is no exception to that.” ",positive,liverpool,1

After a difficult start to the season, the England captain has returned to form under Antonio Conte’s stewardship. Since Bentancur’s debut against Brighton in the FA Cup back in February, Kane has scored nine times across all competitions while registering a further three assists. Keeping Kane long-term following last summer’s interest from Manchester City could well rely on qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Without that to offer a player who has long admitted his desire to challenge for the biggest trophies in the game, it does not seem unreasonable to assume Kane would once again consider his future. Bentancur himself has had a positive impact on the team since joining from Juventus during the dying embers of the January transfer window and waxed lyrical about playing with Kane when speaking to ESPN Argentina. “Technically and physically, he is an incredible player, very complete; it is an honour and a pleasure to have him as a team-mate,” he said of Kane. “(I’m) very happy and getting minutes. “It’s the best league at the moment. I’m very happy to play for Tottenham in that league and to be taking this opportunity.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Conte tested positive for Covid last weekend and has consequently been distancing from the Spurs squad, who have continued to train in his absence. Tottenham expect Conte to be symptom-free by Saturday, though, and able to take charge of the team for their lunchtime clash. The Spurs head coach is still conducting media duties this week and was due to hold his pre-match press conference on Thursday afternoon, although it will now take place online. Tottenham have been in good form recently and sit fourth in the Premier League. Victory over Brighton would enable them to stretch their lead over fifth-placed Arsenal to six points, although their north London rivals could close the gap in their 3pm kick-off at Southampton. SPONSORED Spurs, meanwhile, have announced that they will face Team K-League — a selection of the best players from South Korea’s professional league — as part of their pre-season preparations. The game will be Tottenham’s first match of their tour of Korea and will take place on July 13. Spurs currently have a huge supporter base in Korea, with their forward Heung-Min Son captain of the national team and one of the country’s most-loved players. Tottenham’s game against Team K-League will be their first in the Coupang Play Series, but they are due to play a second match and the opponents for that will be announced in the coming weeks.

With Manchester United and Arsenal both losing earlier in the day, the chance was there for Spurs to take control of the Premier League top-four race and take a big step towards securing Champions League football. They did just that, as Heung-min Son netted a superb hat-trick and Dejan Kulusevski also got himself on the scoresheet. There were plenty of troubling moments in the first-half for Spurs, but they came through them before taking complete control through their front three. It takes them three points clear in fourth, having played a game more than Arsenal. That much for the Gunners is away to Chelsea though, and the north London rivals meet at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later in the season. It took less than three minutes for Spurs to take the lead as they made the perfect start. Harry Kane’s scuffed volley bounced off Matty Cash and fortuitously into the path of Son, but there was nothing lucky about the finish as he swept the shot off the inside of the post and into the bottom corner. For the rest of the first-half, Villa were utterly dominant, but a combination of Hugo Lloris and poor finishing kept them behind. Jacob Ramsey drifted past a couple of challenges and into the box, and his shot was brilliantly tipped over the bar by Lloris. The Frenchman then kept John McGinn’s long-range strike out, before Danny Ings sent a tame volley straight at him. Ollie Watkins headed over from close range and Ings then missed arguably the biggest chance. A cross was flicked on by Tyrone Mings perfectly into the striker’s path, but he scuffed an effort into his standing foot and it dribbled wide. There was still time for Cash to have a volley saved, and Lloris to then just about stop a Philippe Coutinho free-kick crossing the line on the verge of half-time. In absolutely ruthless fashion, Spurs doubled their lead five minutes after the break to take control. Kane flicked on a long ball into the path of Kulusevski, who from a tight angle inside the box rifled a left-footed strike into the far corner. That stunned Villa, after their superb first-half showing, and it could have been three for Spurs soon after had Son not taken a heavy touch that allowed Emi Martinez to rush off his line and gather the ball. Son made up for it though with 25 minutes remaining to get his second of the match and put the result beyond doubt. As ever Kane was involved, flicking on the ball perfectly for his teammate and Son made no mistake when clean through on goal. Five minutes later, the match-ball was secured. Son flicked it through to Kulusevski, who got to the byline and played the ball back into the path of the South Korean who found the far corner with the help of the woodwork. Those first-half struggles looked a world away, as Spurs’ free-scoring nature continued and it is Antonio Conte’s side who look well on course to secure Champions League football next season.

An unforgettable 3-2 win for the hosts after extra time at the Bernabeu saw the Blues lose 5-4 on aggregate — but Tuchel insists he has no regrets. Goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner put Chelsea on the cusp of an historic Champions League comeback — but Rodrygo’s strike forced the tie into extra time, and then Karim Benzema — who else? — scored the goal that booked Real’s place in the semi-finals. Tuchel praised the courage of his players. “I think we deserved to go through,” he said. “We were unlucky, but there are no regrets. These are the kind of defeats you can take with pride and you can accept as a sportsman. “We showed a lot of courage, we showed a lot of quality — and this was the right way to do it. I’m very happy. It’s the way to go forward. We demand a lot from the players and if we have this kind of effort, we are a special team.” Thomas Tuchel insists he has no regrets after Chelsea’s heroic Champions League exit Tuchel admitted Chelsea ultimately paid the price for mistakes made in the first leg, which handed Real a 3-1 lead going into last night’s tie. “[Madrid] did not create a lot at Stamford Bridge, but they took every half-chance and converted it,” he said. “This was enough. You have to reduce your amount of mistakes — and we could not reduce it to an absolute minimum over the two legs. That is why the deficit was so high. “Then you come here and play a match like this and we have two crucial ball losses that only against very few teams end in a goal. Against Real Madrid, it is possible.” Tuchel also hit out at Polish referee Szymon Marciniak. Chelsea’s German manager was angered by the decision to allow VAR to rule out a Marcos Alonso goal for handball without the official reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor. And he also criticised Marciniak for “laughing” with Real manager Carlo Ancelotti after the final whistle. “I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague Carlo Ancelotti,” he said. “I know Carlo is a nice guy, but when I wanted to go and say thank you for the match, I saw him [Marciniak] smiling and laughing loudly with the opponents’ coach. “I think this is the wrong time to do this after a final whistle from 120 minutes, where one team gave all their hearts and fought until the last drop. You go and see the referee smiling and laughing with the other coach. I think it is very, very bad timing. I told him this.” Alonso thought he had put Chelsea 3-0 up just after the hour mark, but his celebrations were cut short after VAR spotted the merest of handballs in the build-up to his effort. Tuchel added: “If you play against Madrid, sometimes you can maybe not expect that everyone has the courage. I felt the little decisions [went against us] in the first leg and the second leg today as well. Tuchel was furious with referee Szymon Marciniak after a pulsating defeat at the Bernabeu “I did not see the goal, but I told him that I was disappointed that he does not come out and check it on his own. In a match like this, where you have a certain line to whistle, you should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair who is isolated from the atmosphere. “He has a certain style — certain things that he allows and does not allow — and he follows a certain line, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own, then he could also explain it better.” Tuchel also complained about the amount of stoppage time, saying: “I thought we deserved more minutes in the end, because it felt like we had no minutes to play in the second half of extra time. “Maybe it is too much to ask for in matches like this, against this opponent. We had it in our hands and we were not lucky enough.” ",positive,liverpool,0

However, they made the perfect start in Madrid courtesy of Mason Mount’s effort, with Antonio Rudiger later putting them level in the tie with away goals scrapped in this year’s competition. Timo Werner’s effort then looked to be sending Chelsea through against all the odds after a Marcos Alonso strike was ruled out by VAR, only for the genius of Luka Modric to tee up substitute Rodrygo for a crucial effort to force extra-time. Benzema ultimately had the decisive say with an extra-time header as the 13-time champions of Europe survived a massive scare to end Chelsea’s amazing resistance. Thomas Tuchel was hurt but proud of his players following their efforts in Madrid, though he expressed his fury at the VAR and accused referee Szymon Marciniak of “laughing” with Real counterpart Carlo Ancelotti. You can follow all the reaction from a Champions League classic with Standard Sport’s live blog below... 27 mins: More good Chelsea pressure - they’ve certainly not decided to sit on that one goal and just try to stay in the tie until late in the game. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been excellent so far. 23 mins: Vinicius Jr. passes up the chance to run at Reece James on the break, which is a little surprising given the Englishman is already on a booking. That’s not a situation Chelsea will want to see unfolding too often. 20 mins: Well, Chelsea have got the early goal that seemed crucial to their hopes of turning this around. Now do they stick or twist? They’re in the ascendancy her Game on! Perhaps a bit of good fortune about the way the ball breaks to Mason Mount off Timo Werner but my word does he take full advantage, charging onto it and lashing a terrific finish past Courtois. Real Madrid lead 3-2 on aggregate. 12 mins: Better from Chelsea. Mount’s pressure sees Valverde lose it in the middle of the park and Werner and Havertz exchange passes before the latter’s effort is deflected behind for a corner. The delivery is met by Rudiger but he’s a long way from goal and can only power way over the bar. 11 mins: Karim Benzema’s first sight of goal comes from the resulting free-kick but it’s always curling over the bar. 10 mins: Could be a long night for Reece James now. He’s in the book after only ten minutes as he’s completely deceived by Vinicius’ quick change of direction into the box and drags the Madrid man down right on the edge. 7 mins: Timo Werner’s first time to have a little dart into the box but Casemiro is alert to the danger and scampers across to make an important tackle, to huge cheers. 4 mins: A pretty positive start from Chelsea, who have lined up in a back-four as we expected. Already, though, Madrid have threatened with the pace of Valverde on the break and that is going to be the balance that the Blues have to strike tonight. We are underway in Madrid...

The striker, who been on loan with Crystal Palace since last January, has climbed the pecking order under Patrick Vieira in recent weeks and is now close to agreeing terms on a permanent deal. Mateta's original loan deal included an obligation to buy for around £13million after a certain amount of starts for the Eagles. He has not hit that mark of starts, meaning Palace have been able to negotiate a lower fee. The 24-year-old is set to agree terms on an £8m move, with his representatives having travelled from France to London over the weekend. Mateta had been earmarked as a player who could leave the club at the start of the window, but his upturn in form changed Vieira's mind. Palace had also been hopeful of adding Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek on loan until the end of the season. However, there will now be no further incomings in south London after the Dutchman decided against a move to the capital and agreed to join Everton and their new boss Frank Lampard until the end of the campaign. The Eagles have also seen approaches for Arsenal's Eddie Nketiah knocked back. ",positive,liverpool,0

Olise withdrew from the France Under-21 squad due to inflammation in his left foot, which also forced him to miss Monday’s 3-0 win over Arsenal. Palace manager Patrick Vieira said after that game that Olise was a doubt for this Sunday’s game at Leicester, but he hopes the 20-year-old will be ready to face Chelsea at Wembley. Olise has impressed for Palace since joining from Reading for £8million last summer and has made a real impact in the Premier League since forcing his way into the side. Olise, who can also represent England at international level and would have been in the England Under-21 squad had he not elected to go with France, has four goals and nine assists in all competitions this season. Asked about Olise’s availability for the Chelsea game, Vieira said on Monday: “We have to see. We have to live the week and see how he will improve.” Palace will definitely be without Conor Gallagher against Chelsea, because the midfielder is ineligible to play against his parent club. Gallagher’s absence is a blow for Palace but, six years after losing against Manchester United in extra-time in the 2016 FA Cup Final, confidence is high that they can upset Chelsea, who are struggling after back-to-back home defeats by Brentford and Real Madrid. Palace will be looking to make it eight games unbeaten on Sunday when they play at the King Power Stadium. ",negative,liverpool,0

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall proved the star of the show to send Brendan Rodgers’ side ninth. Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball in midfield and threaded a well-timed pass for winger Ademola Lookman, who fired past Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita with 10 minutes remaining in the first half to score his first goal since February. Palace defender Marc Guehi miscontrolled the ball in his own half, allowing Leicester forward Patson Daka to find Dewsbury-Hall. The midfielder curled a powerful shot from 18 yards to score his first Premier League goal seconds before halftime. Wilfried Zaha gave Leicester reason to sweat after halving the deficit in the 65th minute, heading in the rebound from his retaken penalty after his first attempt was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. SPONSORED Palace were awarded a spot-kick when Youri Tielemans tripped Jordan Ayew and Schmeichel had pushed away Zaha’s effort but the penalty was retaken following a VAR check which spotted encroachment from Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu. Leicester weathered the visitors’ attacking spells to see out the win and move into ninth in the league standings with 40 points and two games in hand over Palace, who are three points behind in 10th place.

Clearly, many would have expected the side leading the Premier League to beat one of the teams currently lying in the bottom three but, as the first-half proved, these games can be difficult. With Thomas Tuchel missing the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Mason Mount, a makeshift attack of Callum Hudson-Odoi, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz didn’t look entirely convincing. Often, they proved wasteful in good areas and, while Zyiech was unlucky not to have seen his deflected shot go in during a fast second-half start for Chelsea, it was full-back Reece James who opened the scoring in the 65th minute with a brilliant strike into the top corner from within the Newcastle box. Like Ben Chilwell on the opposite flank, James’ increasing goal threat adds a new dimension to this Chelsea team and the England star added to his tally just over ten minutes later with a rasping shot following some good work from Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Jorginho then sealed the victory with an 80th-minute penalty to send his side three points clear at the top of the league. A potentially pivotal day. ",positive,liverpool,1

Although the Eagles have won just once under Vieira ahead of Saturday’s Premier League trip to the Etihad Stadium, his freshened-up side has put in a number of good performances. Guardiola said of the former City man: “He’s changed the dynamic, the way Palace play, changing many things. They always had really good players. “I was delighted to see him again, he was here in my first season here. He was an important part of Arsenal’s history. After he went to New York, I’m happy he’s back at a high level, doing really well. “Their last games were tough. They showed their quality and I’m looking forward to seeing him. Every manager around the world has the chance to manage [in the Premier League].” Guardiola, 50, also praised former player Xavi ahead of his potential appointment at Barcelona. Ronald Koeman’s sacking in the week could herald the legend’s return, after he won several trophies under Guardiola as a player. But the City boss cautioned that he will only be able to win if he is given good players. “They have an interim manager, Sergi [Barjuan], and I wish him the best of luck, he's a close friend,” Guardiola told reporters. “[With] Xavi, I don't know what will happen. “I'm pretty sure sooner or later it will happen. I don't have any doubts that he's ready to do the job. He knows the environment which is so important in this role. He knows the game, he has passion. “He has more experience now that I had when I took over from the B-team at Barcelona. “Koeman knows and Sergi knows and Xavi knows and I know, the success depends on the quality and the commitment and the players. “People still forget we are the responsible for everything but our influence is more minimal than people believe. It's the quality of the player. The success I had was because of the quality of the players. This is the only reason, the quality of the players.” ",positive,liverpool,0

A much-changed Hammers side, missing the likes of Declan Rice and Michail Antonio, kept a laboured City at bay for 90 minutes before triumphing on 5-3 penalties at a sold-out London Stadium. “The resilience of the team over 90 minutes, even though we missed couple of decent chances, with the honesty and resilience of the team, they deserved to get over the line,” Pearce said. “It was a really good night for the club, 60,000 in the ground, you couldn’t get a ticket for the game. It’s absolutely superb and the players deserve the credit. “This is an outstanding Man City side, they came with a very strong lineup. That was potentially a mark of respect for us, knowing they were going to be in for a tough game. “Man City have the majority of the possession whenever they play anyone in the world so you have to suffer without the ball.” Pearce also paid tribute to club captain Mark Noble, who came off the bench in the Premier League meeting with Manchester United earlier this season and missed a last-gasp penalty to rescue a point, but here led by example, slamming home his spot-kick to set City on their way to shootout glory. “He’s been a wonderful captain for this club, incredible, a great role model,” Pearce added. “I know as a coach we worked together at U21 level so we’ve got a connection going back and he inspires from within. “He’s not had a load of game time but when he was asked to come in and lead the team he’s been incredible.” Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, was philosophical after seeing his side’s quest for a fifth successive victory in the competition come to an end. “It’s an incredible run so one day it had to finish,” the Spaniard said. “We finished in a good way in terms of performing, played a good game and created enough chances against a team that defended deep and well.” Guardiola’s also refused to lay any blame at the feet of substitute Phil Foden, whose miss first with City’s first spot-kick proved to be the only one of the entire shootout.

252,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-new-academy-gareth-southgate-b963212.html,Gareth Southgate confident Crystal Palace can now compete for top young stars as he cuts ribbon on new academy,"areth Southgate was on typically eloquent, self-deprecating form as he returned to Crystal Palace to open the club’s new £20million academy on Thursday, “Everything started here for me as a 14-year-old schoolboy,” he told a crowd of VIPs, former managers, club legends and current first-team players and coaches. “So hopefully that gives the lads in the academy belief that you can start here and have an international career with England. Frankly, if I can end up in charge of the national team, then anything is possible.” But beneath the humour, Southgate knew full well what a boon this first-class facility will be for his former club and, perhaps one day, an England team that will by then be someone else’s responsibility. South London’s emergence as a hotbed of footballing talent continues to be well-charted, with a documentary ‘South Of The River’ set to air on BT Sport next month, and Southgate-era England have, at various levels, already benefited from the region’s youthful riches. Jadon Sancho and Emile Smith Rowe will surely be pivotal figures in the Three Lions’ future. They lifted the Under-17s World Cup in 2017, as the age-group revolution to which Southgate was so central kicked into effect, as did Callum Hudson-Odoi, while Ademola Lookman and Ezri Konsa won the Under-20 equivalent. Hudson-Odoi could yet have his time with the senior team again and the same goes for Joe Gomez and maybe even Ruben Loftus-Cheek, though the latter already has a World Cup semi-final on his CV. Tammy Abraham could go even further should he keep his place in the squad until Qatar next year. But what do all of those sons of south London have in common? Not one of them came through at Palace. “You’ve got one of the best catchment areas in the country — but if you can’t match the facilities of some of the clubs nearby then that is going to be a barrier to recruitment,” Southgate said. “One of those differences now has changed. When young players come here they will feel just as special as they feel at any other club in the Premier League.” That is not to say Palace have been unsuccessful in producing outstanding young talent; it is only through a quirk of right-back fate that Aaron Wan-Bissaka does not have a senior England cap, while Wilfried Zaha and Victor Moses chose to pursue international careers elsewhere. Nor that Palace will be providing half of the England squad within 10 years, or that had the academy been conceived a decade earlier, Sancho would necessarily be latching onto Smith Rowe passes and knee-sliding in front of the Homesdale Road Stand. Rather that facilities will no longer be the reason they are not. The new academy, granted Category One status, boasts six full-size pitches, including an indoor one with its own sprinkler system, a restaurant, 500-seat stand and a host of classrooms and learning facilities to support young players’ development off the pitch. Eighteen months from now, the second phase of the project, featuring an expanded gym area, recovery pools and a medical rehab centre, will be completed, too. It is a far cry from the Portakabins, pies and sausage sandwiches Southgate recalled from his days at the club’s old Mitcham base. “When we were at Palace we had a resilience, but whenever we travelled to Highbury or to Tottenham, we did feel a bit inferior,” Southgate said. “We didn’t necessarily have that investment in us. We didn’t necessarily feel that we could match those teams.” In the academy stakes at least, that is no longer the case. ",positive,liverpool,0

Kovacic began the Blues’ 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat to Real on the bench before being sent on at half-time to try and wrestle back midfield control as the experienced trio of Modric, Casemiro and Toni Kroos dominated proceedings. The result means Chelsea must produce a famous comeback in the Bernabeu on Tuesday or else surrender their European crown. Asked how it felt to come up against Modric, Kovacic replied: “It was nice and also difficult because we were losing and it is never nice when you are losing a game and you have a hard time. “But it was nice to see him and to play against him. I always preferred to have him on my team but in this moment we are against each other and we are ready to show our best tomorrow and to try to go through. “It’s difficult to stop him because he’s an amazing player. Obviously, he is Croatian and I admired him when I was a child and he played for my favourite club which was in Dinamo Zagreb. “Now, when we become good friends I admire him even more - a great person, great player and I’m looking forward to to play against him tomorrow again.” Kovacic, nine years Modric’s junior, believes his compatriot could still be playing amongst the game’s elite for years to come. “He was always as good as he is now, for me as far as I know in the last five, six or seven years he’s on the same way level, which is amazing,” added Kovacic. “Why is that good? It is because he loves football so much. He lives it every day. He’s a professional and if he keeps going like this, I see him still playing three, four more years on such a high level.” Stopping Modric will go some way to giving Chelsea a slim hope of overturning the deficit in Spain - something Kovacic says the players have to believe is a possibility. “Of course we have our chances and we are motivated to show our best,” he said. “We didn’t have our best game and the result is not good in the last game but there is hope and we are motivated to try our best so it will be a quality game and we are looking forward.” Additional reporting by PA.

The Blues travel to Spain trailing 3-1 from last week’s quarter-final first leg following Karim Benzema’s brilliant hat-trick at Stamford Bridge - after which Tuchel effectively declared the tie was over. But the head coach was more optimistic this morning, encouraging his players to dream of a famous comeback while admitting they face a tall order at the Bernabeu. “[We have] not the biggest chance given the first game’s result, the competition, the opponent and the stadium we play in,” Tuchel said ahead of this afternoon’s flight. “But we never manage our input and effort, our belief by the chances we have for a result. We never did and we will not start tomorrow by giving less because it’s very unlikely that we make it. “It’s unlikely but it’s worth trying and we will try. Trying means we’ll play to our fullest limit. This is what we do. It’s a big night and a big match and we will try to be in better shape and condition than the first match. “We’re always allowed to dream, it’s important to imagine things and to dream about them. But it will not shift the focus from the fact that we need to focus and deliver tomorrow. “It’s worth trying, it’s sports, it’s a game. That’s the beauty of the game that everything is possible always. We will arrive and try everything because it’s worth trying. From there, we will see. Hopefully we have a match where belief grows within the match through our actions. Hopefully we can fulfil our dream, live up to our dream, but realistically we have to invest a lot and be at the very top level.” Chelsea were undone by two stunning Benzema headers within four first-half minutes and the Frenchman capitalised on an Edouard Mendy error to restore Real’s two-goal lead after Kai Havertz’s had pulled a goal back. Tuchel admitted he would have liked his side to be more physical against an ageing Real but said they were disadvantaged by La Liga having had five subs for the duration of the season. The Premier League is set to increase allowed substitutions from three to five for the start of next term. “We wanted it more physical. We didn’t work hard enough, we didn’t work intense enough,” Tuchel said. “First of all, we face a huge disadvantage in terms of physicality because Real Madrid has had the whole year with five changes and we play the most demanding league and the most matches throughout the season and in 2022. So it’s not easy to play a physical game.” Romelu Lukaku will not travel as he nurses a painful achilles injury, Ben Chilwell and Callum Hudson-Odoi remain sidelined and Ross Barkley is ill. Captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who missed the thumping win over Southampton on Saturday after testing positive for coronavirus, has returned to the group after returning several negative tests, however. Asked how he would want his side’s defence of the Champions League to end if they are eliminated tomorrow, Tuchel said: “By leaving everything on the pitch that we have, by showing we can work harder, play better, that we know we can take more risks, and show our true face and live up to our full potential. That’s what we should do first and then we accept what comes after.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Blues were four ahead after just half an hour as Saints imploded with Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz all getting on the scoresheet before the hosts had even turned up. Werner and Mount both grabbed a brace for themselves after the break as Chelsea continued to pile the misery on Southampton. Here is how Jack Rosser rated the Blues… Edouard Mendy 7 Made a superb second half save from Che Adams. Had very little else to do. Andreas Christensen 7 Largely untroubled by the Southampton forwards, composed on the ball. Thiago Silva 7 Could have spent the afternoon sunbathing for all the threat that Southampton posed. Antonio Rudiger 7 Recovered from a dodgy pass early on and easily contained any rare foray forward from the Saints. Ruben Loftus-Cheek 8 Played out of position at right wing-back but was a real threat in the first half. N’Golo Kante 8 Dominated midfield and looked to push forward whenever possible - got in a good position in the build-up to the fifth goal. Mateo Kovacic 7 Quicker to everything in midfield and was sharp in getting the ball up to the forward line. Marcos Alonso 8 Superb finish through the legs of Fraser Forster to get the show on the road early on. Mason Mount 9 A superb move to set up Alonso, a fantastic first goal and was quickest to the ball when getting his second. Fine performance. Kai Havertz 7 Bullied the Southampton defenders and was in the right place at the right time to take his goal. Timo Werner 8 Could probably have had more than his two having hit the woodwork three times. Southampton defenders couldn’t handle his pace. Substitutes Christian Pulisic 7 Lively in the build up to Mount’s second goal. Reece James 7 Slotted into the back three well after replacing Silva. Hakim Ziyech 6 Gave the Southampton defence something to think about but made little impact. ",positive,liverpool,0

Off the back of a damaging week following losses to Brentford and Real Madrid, the pressure was on the European champions to cement their place in the Premier League’s top four.

Gareth Southgate gave debuts to Kyle Walker-Peters and Marc Guehi, and a first start to Conor Gallagher, as England came from behind to win 2-1 in their first fixture of a World Cup year. Walker-Peters and Guehi took the number of England debuts under Southgate to 53 and, of those, 12 – or more than 22 per cent – have either come through Chelsea’s academy, or spent a significant part of their development at Cobham. No other academy can claim to have trained more than five of Southgate's debutants, making Chelsea the most influential club to England’s evolution, and chances of winning in Qatar next winter. Roman Abramovich has poured funding into the club's talent factory, with the outgoing owner said to have been committed to the idea of winning with homegrown players. Spending on academies has not traditionally counted towards Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, which has made it an easy way for oligarchs and states to funnel money into clubs while circumventing restrictions. That said, the club has also done remarkable work, and many of their graduates joined the academy at the youngest age groups. Chelsea’s Conor Gallagher - on loan at Crystal Palace - was England’s star player against Switzerland Eye-catching showings from Gallagher and Guehi on Saturday have increased the chances of a core of Chelsea-trained players making the England squad for Qatar. Mason Mount and Reece James are certain picks, along with Declan Rice, while Tammy Abraham, who withdrew from this squad through injury, and Fikayo Tomori are impressing in Italy and on Southgate's radar. Leeds’ Patrick Bamford, who never made the grade at Chelsea, is also in contention, though could miss the rest of this season with a foot injury. Gallagher, who is on loan at Crystal Palace, was England’s standout player against the Swiss, offering energy and guile from midfield. He also set up Luke Shaw’s crisp equaliser in first-half stoppage time after Walker-Peters had done well to win back possession. A big question is whether the 22-year-old can establish himself as a regular at Stamford Bridge in the first half of next season, assuming he returns to his parent club in the summer. The fates of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi, also among Southgate’s debutants, are warnings that the standard at Chelsea can harm as well as enhance international prospects. The other issue is Gallagher's position in Southgate's XI and, for all his quality, he may not be disciplined enough to work in a midfield two under such a pragmatic coach. Perhaps England would have begun with control if Southgate had swapped Gallagher and Phil Foden against the Swiss, who were the better side in the first half and led through Breel Embolo's header. Guehi, meanwhile, grew into his debut and won the second-half penalty which was converted by Harry Kane, who moved level with Sir Bobby Charlton on 49 England goals – now just four shy of Wayne Rooney's all-time record. Like Abraham, Tomori and Southampton's Tino Livramento, who is in the Under-21s, the defender is an example of how Chelsea have used their academy to fund their spending, as well as improve the first team, but he may prove to be a player sold too soon. New England cap Marc Guehi also learned his trade at Chelsea Guehi should sense an opening at centre-half but so too will the next potential England contender off the Cobham production line, Trevoh Chalobah, who has impressed in Thomas Tuchel’s defence this season. Other Chelsea prospects include England youth internationals Levi Colwill, on loan at Huddersfield, and Harvey Vale, Lewis Hall, Jude Soonsup-Bell and Xavier Simons, who have all been given debuts by Tuchel this season, suggesting the Blues' position as England's primary producer of talent is unlikely to slow soon. Whoever they are, Chelsea's new owners will not, however, be able to write off £1.5billion in debt like Abramovich and should be more focussed on turning a profit than the outgoing oligarch. That leaves the long-term status of Chelsea's academy somewhat uncertain, which may be cause for concern for both club and country. ",positive,liverpool,0

New York merchant bank the Raine Group has set that deadline for final bids to keep Chelsea on course to have new owners in May, the PA news agency understands. Chelsea’s remaining suitors will have the chance to table improved offers to buy the Stamford Bridge club, with commitments required for at least £1billion of future spending. Chelsea have instructed Raine to seek those future spending commitments in a bid to safeguard the west London club’s future at football’s elite level. Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca was the final addition to the four-strong shortlist to buy Chelsea on Friday. The 67-year-old billionaire co-chairman of Bain Capital boasts a strong offering to buy the Blues. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly are the other bidders still in the race. The Raine Group spent Thursday informing a host of unsuccessful bidders they were out of the auction before starting the process of confirming the shortlist in the race to buy the Blues. Celtics supremo Pagliuca and Cubs owners the Ricketts were understood to have been informed by Raine early on Friday afternoon in New York time. US magnate Boehly and his Eldridge Industries firm has backing from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and respected British business leader Jonathan Goldstein. Former British Airways chairman Broughton has drafted in sports business and politics heavyweight Lord Sebastian Coe, adding genuine clout to his consortium. Wall Street investment banker Michael Klein has added a major financial edge. The Cubs-owning Ricketts family boast the financial muscle of US hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin, believing their experience of renovating storied stadium Wrigley Field offers an edge in their candidacy given Stamford Bridge’s required rebuild. The Ricketts family are yet to allay supporters concerns however, but are working hard to prove their suitability to take the Stamford Bridge helm. Roman Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on 2 March, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The Russian-Israeli billionaire was then sanctioned by the Government on 10 March. The Blues must operate under strict Government licence, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. Downing Street must approve another new licence to authorise Chelsea’s eventual sale, with the money either frozen or distributed to charitable funds to aid victims of the war in Ukraine. Abramovich has pledged to write off Chelsea’s £1.5bn debt and the bidding frenzy for the club could see the eventual deal hit £3bn. Additional reporting from PA ",negative,liverpool,1

Such is the level of quality in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, swathes of the playing staff at the club are away on international duty and have had to watch the latest ownership developments at Stamford Bridge from afar. Boston Celtics owner Stephen Pagliuca has joined Sir Martin Broughton, the Ricketts family and LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly on the shortlist of preferred bidders collated by US merchant bank, Raine Group. Prospective buyers have been told a sale could be complete by the end of April, with the club, Premier League and UK Government all keen on a quick sale following the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich. Candidates will get an opportunity to speak to key figures at the club, including Marina Granovskaia, chief executive Guy Lawrence and potentially Thomas Tuchel. Speaking after England’s win over Switzerland at Wembley on Saturday, Mount revealed what he expects to happen upon his return to the club’s Cobham base. “When I go back to Chelsea next week, I’m sure we will be informed about what’s going on because I haven’t heard anything recently,” he said. “It can sometimes be hard to focus on football when a lot of things is going on around you. “But I feel like it has made it a bit easier, that there are so many games to play that we have to focus ourselves on what’s happening on the pitch. Hopefully that can continue. You don’t know what’s going on from day to day, so to focus on football is all we can do.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Gordon goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","nthony Gordon boosted Everton’s hopes of Premier League survival as his first-half strike proved the difference in a scrappy affair against Manchester United. Gordon’s deflected effort before the half hour alleviated the pressure on Frank Lampard after a 3-2 midweek defeat at relegation rivals Burnley had left Everton just a solitary point above the drop zone. This was far from a vintage display from either side but a 1-0 win for the Toffees puts daylight between themselves and the bottom three as United’s top-four ambitions suffered another untimely dent. Marcus ashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Cristiano Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon’s shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Pickford was again called upon in time added on to deny Ronaldo on the half-volley after being teed up by Maguire before the referee’s whistle for full-time was greeted by an eruption of noise. SPONSORED Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick, speaking to BT Sport, says: “If you don’t score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. “The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn’t always take the right decision. “We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring Mata and more verticality with Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. We didn’t find the right player at the right moment. We didn’t have enough players in the box when we played crosses.” Are talks about a new manager distracting? “I don’t think this should be an excuse. We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn’t be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn’t have an impact.” Fabian Delph, Everton midfielder, speaking to BT Sport: “Coming off the back of the last game there was a lot of disappointment. Heads were down, as you’d expect. We came into it with a good game plan. We had to stick together at times, but we did that and got the three points. “We expected them to have chances. They’re a top team with top players. It was about sticking together and riding the storm, and we managed to do that. It’s a massive relief for the players, management and everyone associated with Everton.” On Frank Lampard’s message at half-time: “Just to stay in the game. We finally felt compact. We knew they were going to dominate the ball, so it was about staying compact, communicating and riding that wave.” On his own performance and fitness: “It was good for me to get out there. I’m always wanting to help the lads. It was good to do that today, but I don’t think I’ll train for a week!” On the relegation scrap: “It’s a massive fight. One game at a time. We’re not going to get carried away. The next game is about getting points on the table, that’s our main focus and to stay up.” Everton’s goalscorer Anthony Gordon speaking to BT Sport: “You can see by the results we get here. We definitely feed off the fans and are a better team with them. They are a top team with top players at the front end of the pitch so we did really well to keep a clean sheet. “The gaffer always says you make your own luck by working hard and winning the ball back. I made my own luck with a bit of hard work. “I can only speak for myself but I’m really sore and have had a few kicks.” This is what it means to Everton...

The Ajax coach is set to beat Mauricio Pochettino in the race for the Old Trafford hot seat, with confirmation potentially coming within days. He has already been assured during initial talks that he will be given backing in the transfer market, with United’s recruitment team already identifying Kane and Rice as dream targets for their incoming manager. Jude Bellingham is another England star they would love to lure from Borussia Dortmund, but it is unlikely he will be allowed to go this summer. Ten Hag moved ahead of Pochettino after being interviewed by United’s football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher in recent weeks. The Dutchman particularly impressed with his vision for the club. Sources insist no agreement is in place but there are not expected to be any obstacles, with a compensation fee of just £2million due to Ajax. Ten Hag himself is understood to believe he will be the next United manager, which will come as a major blow to Pochettino. The Paris Saint-Germain coach was keen to move to Old Trafford earlier in the season and United also considered him their first choice to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Could Harry Kane and Declan Rice follow Erik ten Hag to Manchester United? But fears of protracted negotiations with PSG midway through the campaign convinced then executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to bring in Ralf Rangnick as interim until the end of the season.

Mikel Arteta’s side saw Tottenham go above them in the Premier League on goal difference on Sunday, but they had the chance to respond on Monday night in the first of their two games in hand. It didn’t happen though, as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew scored in a rampant display from the Eagles in the first 30 minutes, capitalising on a woeful showing from the visitors. Arsenal could not find a response after the break, with Wilfried Zaha putting the icing on the cake from the penalty spot. The Gunners remain level on points with Spurs, but their game in hand is away to Chelsea and they still have to travel to their big rivals later in the season. Any momentum picked up before the international break seems to have quickly disappeared. Arsenal had mixed team news, with a big boost as Aaron Ramsdale returned to start but Kieran Tierney missed out on the squad after picking up a knee injury. From the very first minute, it was Palace who displayed far more energy and purpose at Selhurst Park against a visibily rattled Gunners side. Gabriel in particular struggled to deal with the pressure being put on him. The Eagles took a deserved lead with 16 minutes played. Ben White gave away a needless free-kick, which was swung into the box and headed back across the face of goal slightly fortuitously by Joachim Andersen. Mateta was there waiting and had a simple headed finish past a stranded Ramsdale. That didn’t wake the Gunners up though and they were soon two goals down and in a sorry state. Anderson fired a pass forward, Gabriel came out of defence and slid in trying to intercept. He couldn’t cut the ball out though, allowing Ayew to nip in ahead of Nuno Tavares and finish calmly into the bottom corner. Mateta had a powerful strike saved unconvincingly by Ramsale as Palace pounced on yet another Arsenal error, with Thomas Partey giving the ball away on a number of occasions in a torrid first-half. Gabriel Martinelli was introduced at the break in place of Tavares, as Granit Xhaka shifted out to left-back. Palace had a good chance to extend their lead even further when Partey was shown a yellow card for a foul right on the edge of the box, though Andersen’s free-kick was comfortable enough for Ramsdale. Emile Smith Rowe should have halved the deficit just after the hour mark, when the ball fell invitingly to him in the box, but he sent a tame effort straight at Vicente Guaita. A couple of minutes later the Gunners wasted another huge chance, when Martin Odegaard scuffed his shot wide when completely free in the box. To cap off a painful night Partey picked up an injury, with his final act seeing Zaha charge past him and into the box. The Palace man chopped back inside and was clipped by Odegaard, and the referee eventually pointed to the spot. Zaha dusted himself off and sent Ramsdale the wrong way with the penalty to score Palace’s third. Smith Rowe was denied by a goalline clearance from Marc Guehi before Eddie Nketiah rattled the bar from distance, as Arsenal failed to earn even the slightest of consolations on what could prove to be an incredibly costly night.

The Gunners went into the game at Selhurst Park knowing a point would take them fourth in the Premier League, and ahead of Tottenham, but they failed to deliver. Palace were worthy winners against them, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew both scoring in the first-half. Arsenal were a little better after the break, but Palace remained in control and wrapped up the win thanks to Wilfried Zaha’s penalty. “We weren’t at the races today and especially in the first-half,” said Arteta. “We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play. And when we did a little bit we were sloppy on the ball. “We didn’t have any dominance, any sequences of play where we could take some control of the game. We conceded two poor goals as well. “Overall, it is unacceptable. We put our hands up, me the first one, and apologise. We regroup and tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity to prepare for the game against Brighton. “I apologise to our supporters.

First of all we need to put our hands up and get the criticism we deserve. Then we accept it, look ourselves in the mirror and look to the next game.

Mikel Arteta’s side arrived at Crystal Palace knowing that a point would take them back into the Premier League’s top four, after Tottenham had leapfrogged them on Sunday by thumping Newcastle. Arsenal needed to respond, but instead they put in one of their worst performances in recent months as they collapsed to defeat. Make no mistake, Palace were worthy winners. But they surely would not have expected to have it this easy. Jean-Philippe Mateta gave them the lead after 16 minutes and from there they never looked back, with Arsenal barely laying a glove on them. Jordan Ayew doubled the lead before half-time and Wilfried Zaha’s second-half penalty wrapped up the win. There were, perhaps, some warning signs for Arsenal before kick-off when it emerged Kieran Tierney was not fit to feature at all. The left-back has a knee injury and there are fears his season is over. Nuno Tavares was handed a start in his absence, his first since Arsenal were knocked out of the FA Cup by Nottingham Forest in January. Nuno lasted 34 minutes that day. He at least got to half-time on this occasion, but his performance wasn’t much better. In fairness, the whole of Arsenal’s defence was at sea. Gabriel, who has been a rock all season, was all over the place and that was summed up by the second goal. He went flying out to intercept a pass, but missed it and Ayew was able to steam through to score. Ben White, his centre-back partner, wasn’t much better. He clumsily brought down Zaha for Palace’s opener and from the resulting free-kick Mateta headed home. It was weak from Arsenal, soft-centred, and those are adjectives they thought they’d left in the past. Nuno was hooked at the break, however Arteta could have taken his pick of any of his starting XI. Thomas Partey’s radar was pretty scrambled and his passing completion was under 70 per cent. Martin Odegaard was equally absent and his technique left him down time and time again, which seems crazy to say given his performances recently. The fact he brought down Zaha for a penalty summed up his night. There were small improvements from Arsenal in the second-half, Eddie Nketiah was bright off the bench and Gabriel Martinelli did well too. They gave Arsenal the faint glimmer of a comeback, with Nketiah hitting the post and Smith Rowe and Odegaard fluffing their lines when good chances presented themselves. At the full-time whistle, Arsenal players headed over to their fans and apologised for the performance. They were greeted by support and their top-four hopes are, of course, still alive and in their hands. Saturday’s clash against Brighton, however, has now suddenly become a huge match and one where Arsenal must give the response they needed to tonight. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Gunners went into the match looking to respond after Tottenham leapfrogged them into fourth on Sunday. Arsenal knew that a point would put them back in the top four, but Mikel Arteta’s side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Selhurst Park after a poor performance. Jean-Phillipe Mateta opened the scoring and Jordan Ayew doubled Palace’s lead, before Wilfried Zaha wrapped up the win in the second-half with a penalty. Simon Collings was at Selhurst Park to run the rule over Arsenal... Aaron Ramsdale 5 Back in the side after injury but he had a night to forget. Not much he could do about the goals, but his passing was sloppy. Cedric 5 Had a tough first-half up against Zaha, who caused him problems. Did a bit better after the break, but was taken off as Arteta threw on another forward. Ben White 5 Marginally better than his centre-back partner, but not by much at all. Gave away a needless free-kick for Palace’s opening goal. Gabriel 4 The Brazilian has been a rock this season but this must go down as one of his worst performances. Was all over the place, particularly for Palace’s second goal. Nuno Tavares 4 A chastening night for the left-back, who was hooked at half-time after a poor performance. This was his first start since Nottingham Forest in January, when he was taken off after 35 minutes. Martin Odegaard 4 It is very rare the Norwegian is this off it, but he really struggled tonight. Uncharacteristically poor in possession and missed a good chance to score in the second-half too. Gave away a penalty to top it all off. Thomas Partey 4 The midfielder has been excellent recently, however he was really poor at Selhurst Park. So sloppy in possession. Granit Xhaka 6 Probably one of Arsenal’s better players, although that it is not much to shout about. Filled in at left-back and then played in back-three too.

CIES Football Observatory have produced the numbers behind each club’s transfer business in the big five leagues, with it emerging that the Blues racked up over £1billion from moving players on since the summer of 2012. The numbers of the trailing Premier League clubs pale in comparison, with Liverpool (£660m), Manchester City (£605m) and Tottenham (£572m) following behind. Arsenal have made the least from player sales (£377m) out of the so-called ‘Big Six’. Only Monaco (£934m) have earned anywhere near the £1.016bn pocketed by Chelsea, with Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Juventus making up the top five in Europe. On the flipside, Man City have paid the most for players over the last decade. A princely sum of £1.4bn has been forked out by the Premier League leaders, who have four league titles, an FA Cup and six League Cup trophies since the summer of 2012 to show for their expenditure. Barcelona (£1.379bn), Chelsea (£1.365bn) and Manchester United (£1.3bn) are next in the leaderboard with Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Liverpool all over the ten-figure mark. When it comes to net expenditure, with sales deducted from purchases, United are the only side lumped with a one-billion-euro loss. The Red Devils’ transfer business has lost them a staggering £909m during a decade in which they have won a single Premier League title, FA Cup, League Cup, and Europa League each. Although more successful, neighbours City are not much better with a £832m net spent on transfers, ahead of Paris Saint-Germain (£796m), Barcelona (£550m) and Arsenal (£493m). The clubs who have made the most overall profit from the market in the last ten years, according to the study, are French teams Lille (£295m) and Lyon (£209m), and Serie A side Genoa (£169m).

The match had initially been due to take place on January 16, but was postponed following a request from the Gunners due to a shortage of first-team players. It will now take place just ten days before the end of the season in what could turn out to be a Champions League play-off of sorts. Tottenham went above Arsenal on goal difference with victory Newcastle, but the Gunners have two games in hand. They are in action on Monday night against Crystal Palace. Speaking before the international break, Mikel Arteta revealed he was worried about when the match would be scheduled for. “Yes, because I don’t know and we are not going to be deciding and it’s going to be very important,” Arteta said. “That’s nothing to do with me. The club has to arrange those conversations.” However, Antonio Conte hit back at those comments by referencing the circumstances in which the initial fixture was postponed. “I only want Arteta to remember the game postponed – Tottenham-Arsenal – if we speak about unfair,” Conte said. “In general, I think my answer is enough. If someone wants to think about fair or unfair. We postponed the game, Tottenham-Arsenal if you remember. I don’t forget this. And it’s not right to speak about fair or unfair.” Arsenal’s match against Leeds will now take place on Sunday May 8, while the Gunners’s home match against Newcastle has been pushed back to a Monday night game, on May 16. Ahead of the north London derby, Tottenham travel to Anfield to face Liverpool. That match will now be a 7:45pm kick-off on Saturday 7 May, which looks set to cause Spurs fans travelling by train problems. Tottenham face Burnley at noon on Sunday 15 May. ",negative,liverpool,1

After leaving the Emirates under a cloud in January 2021, Ozil’s move to Fenerbahce has not gone to plan. Despite arriving to huge fanfare, the 33-year-old has mustered only 37 appearances across all competitions for the Turkish giants and was recently excluded from their first-team squad. Recently, the 2014 World Cup winner had been linked with a what would have been an eye-catching move to Hull, who were recently taken over by Turkish media mogul Ilicali. Both Hull and David Beckham’s Inter Miami had been touted as landing spots for the former Real Madrid playmaker, although his contract in Istanbul does not run out until the summer of 2024. Quite where Ozil goes next remains to be seen although, speaking to Hull Live, Ilicali dismissed such speculation. “No, they [Ozil and Ryan Babel, who had also been linked with Hull] are not coming,” he said. “Mesut is happy in Turkey. He’s a very good friend of mine and if he’s happy in Turkey, why should I ask him to come to England again? “He’s just gone from England to Turkey and is having a good life there with his family.

Mari is expected to attract interest this summer as Arsenal plot a major overhaul, although the terms of his loan arrangement did not include a permanent option to buy. Still, it’s difficult to see a way in which the 28-year-old works his way back into first-team contention at the Emirates next season, having only made three appearances for Mikel Arteta’s side prior to his exit. Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes look to have nailed down starting berths while Rob Holding and potentially even William Saliba can offer cover and competition in equal measure once the Frenchman returns from a loan spell with Marseille. Speaking to Italian outlet Gazetta, Mari said: “I’d like to stay in Serie A next season. I’m under contract until June 2024 with Arsenal - but I’m so happy here at Udinese.” ",negative,liverpool,0

As the striker walked off the pitch after the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park, footage seemingly showed Ronaldo slapping a phone out of a fan’s hand that left it broken on the ground. Reports after the match suggested that United were looking into the incident, and Ronaldo has now taken to Instagram to address the situation and offer the fan involved tickets to a match at Old Trafford. “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. “Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” David De Gea labelled United ‘a disgrace’ after the defeat at Goodison Park, against an Everton side that went into the match sorely lacking in form and confidence. It almost certainly brings an end to United’s hopes of Champions League football next season. They trail Tottenham in fourth by six points, with seven Premier League matches. What is less certain is what happens at United this summer - Ralf Rangnick will almost certainly not be in charge beyond the end of the current campaign, with the focus now on appointing a new interim boss.

Williamson has been captaining the side since September in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton, but was this week handed the armband for the Women’s Euros by head coach Sarina Wiegman. “I’m absolutely buzzing for her,” Wubben-Moy told Standard Sport. “Not just as a teammate but as an individual, I’ve seen her journey through thick and thin, hard and good times, and she deserves this moment. “I can’t wait to see how she’ll grow in this role. I guess she’s been leading since even before she got the armband and also learning.” Williamson, who will miss tonight’s World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia as she follows concussion protocols, is tasked with leading a side rated among the favourites to a first major tournament success. England were knocked out in the semi-finals of the last Euros in 2017, as well as the last two World Cups, and will be desperate to play a part in the final at Wembley on July 31, tickets for which sold out in less than 24 hours after going on sale last month. However, Wubben-Moy insists that the 25-year-old has the character to carry that burden ahead of what is expected to be a landmark summer. “Pressure is privilege,” she said. “She’s worked for this moment and she’ll cherish that pressure I’m sure, use it to the better. There’s no greater honour than leading your country out as a captain and I’m almost sure she’ll cherish it.” Wubben-Moy is two years Williamson’s junior and like her new captain came through the Arsenal academy. Speaking as part of Nationwide and England Football’s Where Greatness Is Made campaign, which is celebrating some of England’s most significant female captains by erecting plaques in their hometowns, the centre-back paid tribute to the influence her new national team skipper has already had on her career. “On my [Arsenal] debut at 16, just before kick-off she looked at me and said: ‘Enjoy this moment, remember it, cherish it and just be present in this moment because there’ll be no other moment like it’. “I’ll never forget that, when she passed on that nugget of wisdom and I’d like to think I can do that for younger players coming through, making debuts for Arsenal and for England.” Wubben-Moy withdrew from the England squad for February’s Arnold Clark Cup matches against Spain, Germany and Canada through injury and after being called-up by Wiegman again this month has also been forced to pull out of the trip to North Macedonia because of a thigh problem. The timing is frustrating for a player looking to cement her place at the home Euros, but the 23-year-old believes the experience of playing in the Champions League for Arsenal this season will be invaluable when the continent’s best teams arrive on these shores in July. “It’s always good to be tested at the top level,” she added. “Our league [WSL] is extremely competitive and all but one of our players is competing in our league but to then have that extra challenge of Champions League football is great for me and the other players. We can test and benchmark ourselves against some of the best players in Europe. “That Wolfsburg team last week was full of German international players and the Germans could be possible opposition in the Euros. You’ve go to beat the best to be the best so we’ll be relishing that competition.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The situation now is not quite as dire as it was in January, when Lokonga was the only fit and available centralmidfielder, but Thomas Partey’s injury this week means the Belgian must once again step up for the Gunners. Partey injured his thigh during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday and scans have shown muscle damage. The Ghanaian has not given up hope of playing again this season and, while he has a better chance of doing so than Kieran Tierney, it still looks unlikely. “It’s what we have, it’s the numbers we have,” said boss Mikel Arteta. “We’ve lost Kieran and we’ve lost Thomas now — and that’s it. With the players we have, we will keep trying like we have since the start of the season, but we never had a big squad, so we can’t find any excuses.” The situation provides Lokonga with the opportunity to finish the campaign strongly after an indifferent few months. It has been a season of two halves for the 22-year-old, who during the first five months got more minutes than he might have expected, due to Granit Xhaka being sidelined. Since the turn of the year, though, it has been a different story, and Lokonga’s only Premier League start since then was against Burnley in January. Despite his lack of minutes, the midfielder was named in Belgium’s squad last month — and that is testament to their faith in him. Arsenal have similarly high hopes for the youngster and now he has nine games to show why. A top-four finish remains in theGunners’ hands as, while they are sat fifth, they are level on points withTottenham immediately above them and have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Lokonga’s return to the team could see a shift in formation against Brighton on Saturday. Arsenal have been playing a 4-3-3 recently, but that has been reliant on Partey excelling at the base of their midfield. Trusting Lokonga to do the same would be a tall order and, instead, Arteta may look to revert to a 4-2-3-1, playing the experienced Xhaka next to the Belgian in a two-man pivot. It should give Arsenal a solid base and, at a time when their form is threatening to falter, that seems invaluable. ",negative,liverpool,0

Thrust back into the starting lineup to cover for injuries only a short time after joining Charlton on loan, Coquelin formed an impressive midfield pivot with Cazorla in particular, one that helped Arsenal beat Manchester City away from home in 2015.

Arteta said: “What happens now is we criticise ourselves a lot, get slapped again because we deserve it. “We were really poor again the first half and we need to lift ourselves up because we know that this road is taking us nowhere – especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for in the last eight games.” Goals from Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu put Brighton in control, with Martin Odegaard’s late strike sparking a fightback that was too little, too late. Arteta was withering in his assessment of his team and their failure to respond to defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday. He said: “The first half was really poor again. The reaction that we wanted to show and everything that we talked about we didn’t make it happen on the pitch. We were sloppy with the ball, we were second best again. We didn’t show any purpose or build any momentum in the game or play with speed or transform the game that Brighton proposed today. “It was not a problem of attitude, for me it was a problem of the approach and the courage that we showed and we didn’t have that purpose. I know that we didn’t have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation we want to provoke and we were looking at each other too many times instead of taking ownership and doing what we have to do. “You cannot play like that. You have to make yourself count and step in and today we didn’t do it.” Arteta also insisted his team cannot use injuries to Thomas Partey and Keiran Tierney as excuses for the collapse of their form. “With all of the team available we know how difficult the challenge is,” he added. “With those two big injuries it makes the situation more complicated. “We cannot look at that because we are going to be looking for excuses.

Criminally, they have even given Manchester United a glimmer of hope, despite Ralf Rangnick’s side picking up just one point from a possible six, including defeat to Everton earlier in the day. That result at Goodison should have been a boost to Arteta’s team before they even kicked off – knowing they could have effectively killed off one of their challengers. Instead, they produced another insipid display – hot on the heels of defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday – waiting until the closing stages to finally kick into life. Arteta said: “For me it was a problem of the approach and the courage that we showed to play and we didn’t have that purpose. I know that we didn’t have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation. “What happens now is we criticise ourselves a lot, get slapped again because we deserve it. We were really poor again the first half and have to lift ourselves up because we know that this road is taking us nowhere – especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for int eh last eight games.” This is now a severe examination of this young Arsenal team that had provided so much cause of optimism just a few short weeks ago. Against the odds, they looked on course for a place in the top four that no one predicted at the start of the season. But to blow that now would turn a largely encouraging campaign into a major disappointment. That is a measure of the job Arteta has done this term – but it is the hope that kills you. This felt like Arsenal of old. They are bottling it at a key stage of the campaign – and the damage caused by this run could be felt for a long time to come. How does Arteta lift his players, restore confidence and keep them in the battle for the Champions League places? Three of their next four games are against teams around them - Chelsea, United and West Ham. The clash with Southampton next week now becomes an absolute must win. It is up to Arteta to prove he is building something new – something different – and they can arrest a slide that threatens to completely derail their campaign. On this evidence, it is going to be a painful end to the season. They were utterly lifeless and clueless in a first half that saw Brighton take the lead through Leandro Trossard after 29 minutes. It was a superbly taken goal – but the manner in which Arsenal’s defenders were completely caught out by Enock Mwepu’s cutback was amateurish. Trossard simply checked his run to leave him completely free just inside the box and from there he picked his spot. Had Gabriel Martinelli’s header on the stroke of half time stood – rather than being ruled out for offside after a lengthy VAR check – it would have flattered Arsenal. While the home team improved after the break, they created virtually nothing for the majority of the half and went 2-0 down with similarly flimsy defending. Once again, they were caught out by a cutback – this time Moises Caicedo pulling the ball to the edge of the box where Mwepu advanced untracked and controlled a beautiful volley into the bottom corner. Anger filled the air inside the Emirates as the fans vented their fury at the limp display in front of their eyes. Perhaps more frustrating was the joy Arsenal eventually had when they woke from their slumber. It was too little, too late – even with six minutes of added time – but in that period of frenzied pressure saw them hit the bar twice, score and force Robert Sanchez into action more often than at any point earlier in the match. Martin Odegaard’s free kick hit the bar at the death and from the rebound Eddie Nketiah did likewise. With the ball still in play and Arsenal keeping the pressure on, Odegaard’s deflected effort from 30 yards dipped past Sanchez. The Emirates believed a comeback was on. Nketiah forced a flying save – then Gabriel came close. Brighton were against the ropes – but an equaliser did not come. Even salvaging a point could have made all the difference in terms of the narrative surrounding Arsenal at the moment. Instead defeat feels like this story is set for a miserable ending.

United’s Premier League fixture against Liverpool on May 2 was postponed following furious fan protests, with supporters gaining access to the Old Trafford pitch to vent their anger about the Glazers’ ownership of the club and their controversial European Super League plans. Supporters were back in the stands on a more positive note on Tuesday though, with 10,000 supporters allowed back in with tickets to see United’s clash against Fulham. It was the first time in 14 months that United fans have been back at Old Trafford to watch a game, though little of the anger at the Glazers seems to have dissipated since those protests earlier this month. The socially-distanced crowd was away with green and gold scarves - the colour of United fans’ long-time protest against the Glazers since their arrival in 2005 - while fans had placards reading: “Go - Glazers Out’. As Bruno Fernandes led United out as captain, hundreds of supporters held the placards aloft, leaving the Glazers under no doubt that as far as match-going fans are concerned - even at a reduced capacity - they want a change in ownership.

The owners of the Chicago Cubs have put a new stadium at the heart of their bid for the European champions. And they believe the construction process could be completed in five years, with developers looking to renovate on a stand-by-stand basis. Standard Sport can also reveal that the Ricketts consider a new stadium critical to the future of Chelsea, have already enlisted architects so they can “hit the ground running”, are convinced they can keep the club competing for the biggest honours during the rebuild and are more focused on making the new Bridge the “best” stadium in the Premier League, even if not the biggest. Eric Nordness headed up their £760million redevelopment of the iconic Wrigley Field in Chicago without re-homing the Cubs — and is determined to repeat that feat with Chelsea. He had already carried out extensive research on the Bridge as part of the Ricketts’ last attempt to buy out Roman Abramovich four years ago. The US family are convinced they are better qualified than any of their rival bidders to successfully deliver a state-of-the-art stadium, given their experience with Wrigley Field, which was granted National Monument status. “We have the template,” Nordness told Standard Sport. “I see so many eerie similarities, including the ground being next to the railway line, an urban, dense neighbourhood. “It’s a stadium that holds about the same amount — we’re 41,500, they’re about 42,000. Stamford Bridge was first built in 1876 (the ground was completed a year later), the Cubs were formed in 1876.” It took five years to renovate Wrigley — and the Ricketts family were determined to play at the stadium throughout. They are just as committed to keeping Chelsea at the Bridge during any planned works. “It would have been easier [for the Cubs] to leave and play baseball somewhere else” said Nordness, who has been in London this week to carry out further research. “And it would have been less expensive. “But we knew the connection the fans had to Wrigley Field, we understood what kind of pain this would be. We started construction in 2015. We won the World Series in 2016. Fans would have missed seeing it at Wrigley. Fans waited years for this. Generations. How horrible would that have been? “Unequivocally, we do not want to leave Stamford Bridge. We think it is super important. It is going to be extremely hard, but we have done this before. Our priority and desire is to play every season at Stamford Bridge. We are the only ones (out of the bidders) that have done this and we know what the challenges are. I feel like we can do it.” The Ricketts family will immediately move to redevelop Stamford Bridge if they win the race to buy Chelsea Rival consortiums fronted by Sir Martin Broughton and Todd Boehly are also looking at plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge without knocking down the entire stadium. Stamford Bridge will be one of the main topics of discussion when the four shortlisted groups meet Chelsea executives this week. A deadline of next Monday has been set for improved and final offers. Chelsea and Raine Group, the US bank in charge of the sale, will then spend next week deliberating on which group to present as the preferred buyer to the Government in the week beginning April 18. Opinions of fans and the local community will be sought by the Ricketts’ before any plans for Stamford Bridge are drawn up, but it is almost certain the rebuild will not follow the proposals for the 60,000-seater stadium laid out by Abramovich in 2015 and later abandoned. As a Chelsea fan of 20 years, Nordness is adamant the Bridge must retain its character. “What I do know is we have to be at Stamford Bridge,” he said. “We have to respect the things that are really interesting and special about it. It has to be an intimate environment that has to be close to the pitch. It has to be unique compared to anything that has been done at Spurs or Arsenal — or Wrigley Field, or anywhere. “You need the best experience — and size isn’t the ultimate arbiter of best. I think, particularly, intimacy to the pitch is important. You get the physicality of the game. The idea that you get as many people as close to the pitch as possible is really important. The Ricketts’ spent £760m to renovate the iconic Wrigley Field, home of baseball’s Chicago Cubs “Looking at the stadium, we think it is critical that we redevelop Stamford Bridge. Our plans are to redevelop Stamford Bridge. We know what that road map looks like and we will go fast... and we will deliver. There is a path to five years and there is a path to double that, depending on how everyone wants to proceed. “As soon as we can, like the minute, if we were to win this [bid], we would be on the ground to be moving forward and do all the things we need to do on the prep. We will hit the ground running fast. It is our job to be really efficient to get it to people as soon as possible.” Crucially, Nordness and the Ricketts’ believe construction costs do not have to come at the expense of success on the pitch. “We have a history of doing something very complicated and playing while under construction,” he added. “And while we did [it] we had the best success on the pitch we’ve ever had as a club. “Not only did we end the World Series drought, we had the best five-year run of player and team performance having been in the play-offs in those five years in a row. We undoubtedly had the best performance ever while we played in it.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Romelu Lukaku was sidelined for Saturday’s 6-0 thrashing of Southampton in the Premier League due to an Achilles issue and has not travelled to Spain for this evening’s second-leg clash at the Bernabeu. However, Blues captain Cesar Azpilicueta makes the bench after he missed the St Mary’s thumping due to Covid-19. “Romelu will not travel with us due to his pain in the Achilles,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel on Monday. “Azpi is in the group. He has tested negative several times.” Lukaku missed several good chances when he came off the bench in the first leg and it is unlikely he would have started in Madrid, but his absence is still a blow for Chelsea.

Champions League result, match stream, reaction and latest updates today","eal Madrid vs Chelsea - LIVE! Chelsea’s defence of their Champions League title is over, but they produced a stunning fight against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night. The holders travelled to Spain facing a mammoth task trailing 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge after another Karim Benzema masterclass. However, they made the perfect start in Madrid courtesy of Mason Mount’s effort, with Antonio Rudiger later putting them level in the tie with away goals scrapped in this year’s competition. Timo Werner’s effort then looked to be sending Chelsea through against all the odds after a Marcos Alonso strike was ruled out by VAR, only for the genius of Luka Modric to tee up substitute Rodrygo for a crucial effort to force extra-time. SPONSORED Benzema ultimately had the decisive say with an extra-time header as the 13-time champions of Europe survived a massive scare to end Chelsea’s amazing resistance. Thomas Tuchel was hurt but proud of his players following their efforts in Madrid, though he expressed his fury at the VAR and accused referee Szymon Marciniak of “laughing” with Real counterpart Carlo Ancelotti. You can follow all the reaction from a Champions League classic with Standard Sport’s live blog below... In defeat, Chelsea legends were made — and none more so than Thomas Tuchel. He produced a Champions League comeback for the ages, a show of courage that will live long in the memory of the supporters who made it here to the Bernabeu and Chelsea fans watching around the world. Even if their reign as European champions was ended by Real Madrid, this was a night that pointed to the promise of an even brighter future under their manager. This was Chelsea at full throttle, with the shackles off — and it was thrilling. Maybe it will convince Tuchel to try it a bit more often. For all of his remarkable success in little over a year at Stamford Bridge, it has been a case of control over the type of white-knuckle rides served up by his countryman Jurgen Klopp, or the purity of Pep Guardiola’s attacks. Click here to read James Robson’s column from Madrid in full Tuchel also complained about the amount of stoppage time added last night, saying: “I thought we deserved more minutes in the end because it felt like we had no minutes to play in the second half of the extra-time. “Maybe it is too much to ask for in matches like this against this opponent. We had it in our hands and we were not lucky enough.” Tuchel was also furious that referee Marciniak did not review the footage himself after the VAR ruled out Marcos Alonso’s second-half effort for handball at the Bernabeu. “If you play against Madrid, sometimes you can maybe not expect that everyone has the courage,” said the Chelsea manager. “I felt the little decisions also in the first leg and the second leg today as well. “I did not see the goal, but I told him that I was super disappointed that he does not come out and check it on his own. In a match like this where you have a certain line to whistle, you should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair who is isolated from the atmosphere. “He has a certain style - certain things that he allows and does not allow and he follows a certain line, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own then he could also explain it better.” To say that Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was not best pleased with Polish referee Szymon Marciniak last night is perhaps a slight understatement. The German accused the man in the middle of smiling and laughing with Real Madrid counterpart Carlo Ancelotti after the game. “I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague Carlo Ancelotti. I know Carlo is a nice guy, but when I wanted to go and say thank you for the match, I saw him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponents’ coach,” he said in his post-match press conference. “I think this is the wrong time to do this after a final whistle from 120 minutes where one team gave all their hearts and fought until the last drop. You go and see the referee smiling and laughing with the other coach. I think it is very, very bad timing. I told him this.” “The positive is that we didn’t give up and not many teams can come here and dominate them as we did. “But over the two legs, if you make the type of mistakes that we do, you get punished.” James Robson was our man at the Bernabeu tonight and you can find out how he rated Thomas Tuchel’s side here. “These are the kind of defeats we can digest and swallow because we left nothing to regret out there. We played how we wanted to play and showed the character and the quality this team has. “We deserved to go through, but it was not meant to be today. We were simply unlucky. “Full credit for the players, it’s not easy to come here when you need to score and need to win. We were simply unlucky not to go through.” On Alonso’s disallowed goal - “I’m very disappointed by the referee, that he did not check it himself. “That’s what it is if you play Real Madrid in the Champions League.” “It’s unbelievable to describe this game. We were dead until the goal that we scored. Chelsea scored three good goals, maybe the first one a bit lucky from a deflection. “We didn’t give up, we kept believing, kept fighting and in the end we scored two goals, showed huge character. The fans were very helpful for us when we were losing 3-0 and that gave us a boost to keep believing we could turn this around. “In this completion experience is playing an important role and certainly it helped us a bit, but we knew even after the first game we would have a tough game. I watch them a lot because of my team Mateo [Kovacic] and they’re tough, physical.”  You have to give Madrid immense credit. When Werner put Chelsea ahead with 15 minutes to go in normal time they looked dead and buried after a dreadful performance on the night but Carlo Ancelotti’s substitutions helped revitalise his side and their response was superb. Dig out the Modric pass for Rodrygo’s leveller when you can. Just sensational. You could be forgiven for being utterly absorbed in events in Madrid tonight but across the continent in Munich there was a huge upset as Villarreal knocked out Bayern thanks to a late goal from Samuel Chukwueze.

Former FIFA president Blatter, 86, and ex-France star turned UEFA chief Platini, 66, were indicted on fraud and other charges in November, particularly involving a payment from the football governing body to Platini in 2011. Both deny the allegations. Prosecutors allege Blatter improperly arranged the payment to Platini for consulting work although the pair claim it was instead covering backdated salary. The trial before the Swiss Federal Criminal Court is due to start on June 8 and last until June 22, the court said on its website. Blatter, who led FIFA for 17 years, resigned in 2015, followed by Platini in 2016. Both were handed six-year bans for ethics violations. SPONSORED The office of Blatter's attorney declined comment.

Sheffield United beat QPR 1-0 at Bramall Lane, with Northern Ireland midfielder Ollie Norwood scoring the winner after just nine minutes. QPR have lost six of their past seven games and sit ninth in the Championship after previously being in the play-off places. They are three points off sixth-placed Middlesbrough but have played two games more than Chris Wilder’s men as things stand. Warburton, who is out of contract at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium at the end of the season, said: “The second half was much better but we lacked that bit of guile you need to open them up. “But there are still 18 points on the table. Everyone will drop points. We have to stick together for Preston on Saturday.” SPONSORED After a trip to Deepdale to meet Preston this weekend, QPR face Huddersfield, Derby, Stoke and Sheffield United again before finishing the season away at Swansea next month.

The Italian side tried to sign Xhaka last year, but were unable to agree a fee. He ended up penning fresh terms at Arsenal instead and has been a regular under Mikel Arteta this season. Xhaka has rebuilt his Gunners career since falling out with fans during a match against Crystal Palace in 2019 and has hinted he wants to stay beyond this summer, when Jose Mourinho’s Roma are expected to make a fresh bid. “Arsenal is still in my heart, 100%,” Xhaka exclusively told The Players’ Tribune. “My challenge was never to change people’s opinions about me, but to help the team. And then after that, if someone did change their mind because of that, then great. “I understand that we will never be best friends, but I hope we can treat each other with honesty and respect. “I want you to know that whatever I do on the pitch, it comes from the right place. “If I am late in a tackle, it’s because I’m fighting for Arsenal. If I lose my temper, it’s because I care. “Sometimes, maybe I care too much. Obviously you can never predict the future in football, but I do know a few things. After this season, I have two years left of my contract. “I still love this club. I believe Mikel is building a great team. And I want to achieve something special here.” ",positive,liverpool,0

He had made his first-team debut the previous season and joined the squad - then under Unai Emery - as they travelled to the Nou Camp for the Joan Gamper Trophy exhibition match against the Catalan giants. Speaking in an interview with GQ magazine, Saka recalled: “The way [Busquets] just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ He is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.” During the same interview, Saka was also asked which goal from football history he would love to have scored and again looked to Barcelona. “Because of the moment, I think I would say Lionel Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club [in 2015],” he said. “The one where he dribbled everyone. “Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. People are trying to kick him, to bring him down in the process, and he just keeps going, and he still scored in the final, as well. I was just like, wow. When he says he’s going past you, you’re not stopping him!” ",positive,liverpool,0
305,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-reinvigorate-spurs-top-four-fight-b993876.html,Tottenham: How showing his softer side helped ‘big brother’ Antonio Conte reinvigorate Spurs in top-four fight,"ddly, perhaps the most important juncture for Antonio Conte’s Tottenham was the Covid outbreak which struck down the squad in December. Spurs were forced to call off their final Europa Conference League group game against Rennes and UEFA subsequently handed the French side a 3-0 win, eliminating Spurs from the competition. Conte was furious when he learned of the situation, storming through the corridors at Hotspur Way, cursing UEFA and demanding an appeal. The head coach, not unreasonably, believed Spurs were among the favourites to win the competition and were being robbed of their only realistic route to silverware this season, given the difficulty of beating Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea to one of the domestic cups. The club told Conte they would explore an appeal but, privately, the view from the boardroom was that it would be pointless. Some senior figures were also conscious that the ruling, while frustrating, could be a blessing in disguise, given they had hired one of the world’s foremost training-ground coaches. It has taken a while, but that is now proving the case, with Spurs having won seven of their past nine League fixtures and Conte adamant that having more time between matches is the biggest reason for their turnaround. “To have more days to prepare the games for me was really important,” Conte said, not for the first time, after Saturday’s 4-0 win over Aston Villa. “Because, don’t forget, I arrived at Tottenham in November and during the season you have to bring your idea of football and at the same time you have to play for three points.” In other words, Conte was initially faced with trying to teach his players his philosophy and get them up to speed physically and tactically all while they recovered from and prepared for high-pressure matches every few days. With more time between games, Conte has been able to steep his players in his brand of football and there is a sense that something clicked around the end of February, when Spurs’ schedule eased. Conte is renowned for knowing how to use the stick, but the new schedule has enabled him to employ the carrot, too. Before the Villa game, for example, the Italian promised his players an extra day off — yesterday as well as Sunday — if they won, prompting Harry Kane to confidently arrange a whistle-stop trip to the Masters. Kane positively bounced out of Villa Park to catch a direct flight to Georgia following Spurs’ fourth consecutive win. Rewarding his players in this way has taken the edge off Conte’s demanding training sessions and allowed the 52-year-old, who has said he wants to be like a “big brother” to his players, to show his squad a softer side. Tottenham are now the clear favourites to win the battle for fourth place in the Premier League this term With more time at Hotspur Way, Conte has increased video analysis sessions with his squad, typically holding one every day for around 20 to 30 minutes. When Spurs had a midweek fixture, he would try to cram in one video session between games, usually lasting over an hour and far harder for the players to digest. Among the issues Conte has addressed in these seminars, as well as on the training pitch, is set pieces, the head coach having finally lost patience with his side’s Achilles’ heel following the 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, when Cristiano Ronaldo’s winner came from a corner. It was notable how much more solid Spurs were at repelling set pieces at Villa Park, reflecting the meticulous work of Conte and his coaches behind the scenes. If there was another big turning point for Spurs, it was the 1-0 defeat to Burnley, which prompted Conte to suggest he may not be the right man to take the club forward. He has since insisted the comments were part of a “strategy” to send a message to his players and, although it hardly felt that way at the time, the results are undeniable. Spurs’ only blip since was the defeat at Old Trafford, when they were the better side, and they have put five goals past Everton and Newcastle, four past Leeds and Villa, three past West Ham and two past United and Brighton. Antonio Conte finally has Spurs clicking, with his comments after the defeat at Burnley acting as a wake-up call Conte’s comments at Turf Moor were the wake-up call his players needed, and he was so encouraged by their reaction, he finally challenged them to finish fourth ahead of the 5-0 win over Everton a fortnight later. They have risen to that challenge impressively and although Spurs are still not capable of playing Conte’s football for a full 90 minutes, the fingerprints of one of the world’s best coaches are now all over the team, from their steely defending to rapid, structured attacks. It was not so long ago that it was easy to wonder if Conte was fundamentally ill-suited to the task of rebuilding Spurs, but now he is presiding over a team who are improving with every performance and should be well-placed to kick on if they maintain their grip on fourth. Conte has not forgotten the perceived injustice of UEFA’s decision, but it is doubtful that Spurs would be in such a promising position if they were still trying to navigate their way through Europe.

306,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-dejan-kulusevski-premier-league-front-three-b993652.html,"After Dejan Kulusevski signing, Tottenham front three might just be Premier League’s most dangerous","n the morning of January 28, Daniel Levy called Tottenham’s managing director Fabio Paratici, who was away on the continent, in a fury. Overnight, Liverpool had gazumped Spurs’ move for Porto’s Luis Diaz after Levy and Paratici had laid the groundwork for an eye-catching deal. Spurs had already been blown out of the water by Barcelona for wing-back target Adama Traore, and were facing a late scramble to improve their squad - and appease head coach Antonio Conte - in the final hours of the window. Paratici turned to Dejan Kulusevski, who had first been mooted as a target at the start of the month and Conte believed could be an option both in the front three and at right wing-back. The signing of Kulusevski in a double deal with his Juventus teammate Rodrigo Bentancur had a whiff of desperation, with Paratici seemingly calling-in an eleventh-hour favour with his former club. At 21, Kulusevski is four years Diaz’s junior and was expected to take time to find his feet in English football, a view supported by two clunky appearances from the bench before his first start in February’s defeat to Wolves. Two-and-a-half months later, there are few January signings, let alone Plan Bs who have worked out so impressively. If Spurs finish in the top four - and they moved three points clear of Arsenal with Saturday’s 4-0 win at Villa Park - Kulusevski and Bentancur should go down as two of the best mid-season signings since the introduction of transfer windows. In the steely win at Villa, Tottenham’s fourth victory on the bounce, Kulusevski was decisive again, delivering the crucial sucker-punch at the start of the second half with a brilliant finish, before setting up Heung-min Son’s hat-trick goal. Since his debut, no-one in the Premier League has more assists than Kulusevski’s six and his strike at Villa was his third goal. He looks ideally-suited to English football and there is now genuinely a case that Spurs have the most dangerous front three in the Premier League, along with Son and the peerless Harry Kane. Kulusevski has not only proven effective in the final third, he has also quickly established himself as the link between attack and midfield, helping to knit together the rapid attacks which are the hallmark of a Conte team. Deceptively strong and fast, he is already adept at using his body to shield the ball and capable with both feet, best illustrated by a brilliant right-footed cross to assist Son against Newcastle. For the second game running, Kane did not score on Saturday but his influence was everywhere, not least in Kulusevski’s goal, an instinctive shift-and-shoot effort which nutmegged Tyrone Mings and whizzed across goalkeeper Emi Martinez, bearing all the hallmarks of a trademark Kane finish. Kane won the flick-on in the build-up to Kulusevski’s strike and his second headed assist was sublime, the England captain glancing over his shoulder before deftly angling Cristian Romero’s pass into the channel for Son, who completed his hat-trick. Kane, who was once all about goals, is now dominating games without scoring, or even having significant chances, and increasingly he is almost redefining the role of centre-forward. He is neither false nine nor true nine, but both, a kind of paradox nine, two players rolled into one. Son, by contrast, has gone the other way to Kane, and is now less of an all-action winger than a lethal goalscorer. Two of the South Korean’s finishes were unstoppable first-time strikes off the post, and in between he finished coolly one-on-one with Martinez. His hat-trick took him to 17 goals this season, the most from open play in the Premier League and just three shy of Mohamed Salah who is currently leading the race for the Golden Boot. Of all the impressive stats about Spurs’ front three, the most striking is that since Kulusevski’s debut, the trio rank first, second and third for combined goals and assists in the Premier League, with Kane on 13, Son 12 and Kulusevski nine. Liverpool and Manchester City clearly have more options in attack, evidenced by the substitutes in yesterday’s 2-2 draw at the Etihad, including Diaz. The Portugal forward has settled quickly at Liverpool but, as it stands, no-one at Spurs would swap him for Kulusevski, who has elevated Spurs’ attack to new levels. ",positive,liverpool,3

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona.

Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings.

Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us.

Thomas Tuchel has struggled to get his attackers firing in either his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation or in the occassionally-tested 4-3-3. For the American, that has meant moving around the pitch and even popping up at wing-back and as a false nine. That has contributed to a return of just three goals this season, and Pulisic has discussed his situation ahead of two crucial World Cup qualifiers with the United States national team. “It is tough,” he told reporters. “I haven’t always been playing in the positions I want to play in. “But I think it is a good quality to be versatile and able to play in all kinds of positions and have different strengths on the pitch. I’ve learned a lot and I’m ready to hopefully be in a spot over the next few games that I’m more comfortable in.” El Salvador and group leaders Canada are up next for the USMNT, who are looking good to qualify for Qatar 2022, with the Club World Cup on the horizon for Chelsea. “I would say there’s two sides to me, especially when people ask you how you are,” Pulisic added. “There is the soccer side and the person side. The person side is even more important to me and I’m doing alright in that sense. It is a lot sometimes. “When I come to the national team it is, ‘How are things with Chelsea?’ and ‘What’s this’ and ‘What’s that.’ It’s tough.

Hayes gives her a huge hug as she heads to the bench. 73 mins: Kirby hasn’t shaken off that knee injury despite just hitting the post and she’s going to head off here. Pernille Harder is on. 72 mins: Woodwork! Kirby races forward unchallenged and crashes an explosive strike against the post with Wubben-Moy backing off and Zinsberger beaten. 70 mins: A second change from Arsenal sees Beattie make way for Caitlin Foord. Arsenal are essentially playing with five across the front now. Nothing to lose of course trailing 2-0 with 20 minutes to go, but Chelsea will fancy there are more goals in this for them on the counter. Kirby was in some discomfort with that knee issue, but thankfully she’s now back on and moving well. 68 mins: Wubben-Moy has just gotten away with making contact with a boot to the face of Kirby, who looked to sprint clear from the halfway line and is now down holding her knee. But referee Helen Conley had already blown her whistle with Chelsea ‘keeper Berger down after an unconvincing punch, but she just seems to have cramp. 63 mins: Danger for Chelsea as Miedema delivers a low ball into the box that is thumped clear by Cuthbert, who collided heavily with Bright. Arsenal utterly waste their set-piece delivery however and McCabe is booked for cynically bringing down Kirby on the break. ",positive,liverpool,0

Follow Women’s FA Cup final reaction with Standard Sport’s LIVE blog below, including expert analysis from Simon Collings at Wembley! 61 mins: Eidevall reacts to that second goal by making his first change of the afternoon. Lia Walti is replaced by Japanese forward Mana Iwabuchi. That’s the second goal Chelsea deserve and, surprise, surprise, it’s Kerr who gets it. If Kirby doesn’t get you, she will. 57 mins: Chelsea finally have a second! Kerr shows good anticipation and strength to collect a low, long ball forward. She then fires a shot through the legs of Wubben-Moy and in at the near post, with the unfortunate Zinsberger unsighted. The (delayed) domestic treble is in sight. 55 mins: Chelsea are beginning to turn the screw again here as Cuthbert shows super feet out on the right flank and delivers an enticing cross that is headed straight at Zinsberger by Kerr. She just struggles to generate the necessary power on that header, with the ball slightly behind her. But another key chance nonetheless. 53 mins: Arsenal concede possession cheaply and Kirby looks to set Chelsea on another attack. A brilliantly arrowed cross towards Fleming at the back post is watched and headed behind by Catley.

Cuthbert has come off worse and will need to go off for treatment. Three minutes of stoppage time signalled at the end of this first half. 42 mins: Arsenal are enjoying by far their best spell of this first half, but a free-kick is driven into the wall and Chelsea then defend resolutely to snuff out the danger. A mix-up between Beattie and Zinsberger then spells big danger for the Gunners, but they get away with it. That’s the second decent penalty shout we’ve had today. The calls for VAR in the women’s game are only going to grow. 39 mins: Arsenal are looking much better going forward now with the wide players swapped and Stephanie Catley playing in a more advanced role. Another big shout for a penalty, this time for Arsenal, as Cuthbert slides in on Mead and the ball clearly hits her hand. That looks like another stonewall spot-kick, but again nothing is given. 37 mins: Some work to do for Berger in the Chelsea goal as she confidently punches clear an in-swinging free-kick from the left-hand side.

Given her small stature and excellent ball control, comparisons with Argentina great Diego Maradona were easy for Japanese journalists to make, blown away by Iwabuchi’s swift rise. Before she had turned 20, Iwabuchi had won the Women’s World Cup and a year later she claimed silver at the London Olympics. Now the forward is back in London, but this time for good, after joining Arsenal last summer. She knows what it’s like to be a runner-up in this city and is determined for that not to be the case again as the Women’s Super League (WSL) hots up and the Champions League returns tonight when the Gunners host Wolfsburg. “It was difficult to accept silver rather than gold,” Iwabuchi tells Standard Sport, reflecting on London 2012. “When I played in the Olympics I was only 19 and it was a great experience. Everything was really fun for me. “It was a good experience and we got a silver medal, but it made me think I wanted to develop as a player and get better.” Iwabuchi likes life in London and enjoys the “freedom” she has in the city, given how often she is recognised back home in Japan. It has not been an easy move, though, not least because she is still learning English. The fact that she speaks German, thanks to three years with Bayern Munich, has helped with settling in to Arsenal’s squad. Iwabuchi has also been aided by fellow Japanese player Takehiro Tomiyasu being in the same situation after joining Arsenal’s men’s team last summer. “We go for meals together sometimes,” she says. “He is really super helpful and I like the fact I am able to speak to him in Japanese. “It’s easy to talk in your own language and it makes you feel comfortable. We both help each other, we cheer for each other and understand each other more. It’s very helpful to have Tomi here.” Iwabuchi has come a long way since those Maradona comparisons, forging a career in her own name by excelling in both Germany and England. “Obviously Maradona was a superstar and known by everyone around the world,” she says. “Our style is maybe similar and it is flattering for me. Mana Iwabuchi is targeting a WSL and Champions League double with Arsenal this season “It might sound a bit cliché but I am who I am, I am myself as well. It’s good to be recognised in this way, but I don’t take too much notice of it.” People are taking notice of Iwabuchi and Arsenal, though. The Gunners have excelled under Jonas Eidevall this season and they face Wolfsburg in the first leg of their Women’s Champions League quarter-final tie tonight. It is the first of two games at Emirates Stadium this week, with Arsenal also hosting north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday as they look to stay top of the WSL. “We are striving to get both the Champions League and League title,” says Iwabuchi. “As a player there is nothing better than playing in great stadiums, so I am really excited about being at the Emirates. “I expect Wolfsburg to play physical football. It is definitely not going to be a beautiful style of play. It will be aggressive and a lot of battles. We will just look to play our style of football, and try to win the game.” And what about Tottenham? Over the course of this season they have developed from noisy neighbours to a side with aspirations of one day playing in the Women’s Champions League, as shown by their draw with Arsenal in November. “I am personally not too familiar with the derby over here,” says Iwabuchi. “But obviously it is going to be a very big match. “In the first game we got a draw late on, so this time we will definitely win in front of the fans. We want to show who is stronger.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Moyes recently held discussions with the West Ham board over their plans for the next transfer window as they try to remain in the conversation for Europa League and Champions League football in the years ahead. Botman, 22, matches the profile of a left-sided centre-back that Moyes feels is needed to bolster his squad and is among a number of defenders being monitored ahead of the summer. The Dutch youth international started all but one of Lille’s Ligue 1 matches as they won the title ahead of Paris Saint-Germain last season. West Ham pushed to sign Marseille's Duje Caleta-Car in the January window but could not strike a deal with the Ligue 1 club. The Croatian is a player they could return for in the summer. Should they move for Botman, who has signalled his desire to depart Lille this summer, West Ham are likely to face significant competition from Newcastle and AC Milan. Moyes may need more than one central defender in the summer window. Angelo Ogbonna is set to recover from his ACL injury at the end of this season but, at 33, it is unclear at what level the Italian will be able to return. A striker remains another priority and West Ham could return for Benfica's Darwin Nunez having seen a club-record £50million bid rejected in January. Competition for Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek in central midfield is needed. Mark Noble will retire at the end of the season while Alex Kral is likely to return to Spartak Moscow. Moyes has warned that change is coming at the London Stadium this summer as the former Manchester United boss looks to prevent things from going stale after two remarkable years. The Hammers manager has shown a deft touch in the transfer window since his return to West Ham and while additions such as Kral have not paid off, the success of Kurt Zouma, Jarrod Bowen and Soucek cannot be understated. It is players of that level, or above, that Moyes is now looking to add. Speaking in a recent interview with Standard Sport, Moyes said: “I see new players, I see a stronger squad, I see a change of the guard in some places because of what’s happening at the club.

When the 32-year-old walks out at the London Stadium, it will be his 38th appearance of the season, matching his highest-ever tally in one season for West Ham, with almost two months of the campaign still to run. Hamstring injuries and muscle problems have dogged his time at the club, but now Antonio finally has confidence in his body to compete at the highest level, despite the gruelling schedule brought about by European and international commitments. “It has been amazing,” Antonio tells Standard Sport. “I’ve loved every minute of it. Setbacks are hard to take, especially when you are trying your hardest and feel like you are doing all the right stuff. This season, throwing in even international games, with no real breaks, my body has managed to stay together.” It is quite the difference from the days he would hold back from giving his all through fear of another injury. “It was difficult,” he says. “I wasn’t really sprinting 100 per cent. There were certain things in the back of my mind, where I was thinking, ‘My hamstring is going to go, it’s going to go’. Mentally, it was a battle. Now, being able to play freely, it is a huge weight lifted off of me.” Many people, including manager David Moyes, held concerns over what this season could do to Antonio’s body, given the relentless schedule European football brings. But a grounding in non-League with Tooting and Mitcham and years in the Football League with Reading, Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday and Forest meant he was ready for the challenge. “Having come through non-League, my body is used to playing this amount of games,” says Antonio. “I told the manager and physio that I am used to playing week in, week out. In the Championship it was Saturday, Tuesday, Saturday, Tuesday. My body did that for seven years before coming to the Premier League. “Going Thursday-Sunday now, I feel like I am used to it. You don’t train as much, all you do is prepare for games. My body is always able to play in the games. Michail Antonio feels he is now able to play freely at West Ham “I am going for it now. The beginning of the season I was holding back a bit, but as time has gone by I’ve been getting stronger and stronger as the season has gone on. I managed to play 120 [minutes, against Sevilla], then played against Spurs on the Sunday — and there was no complication. These are the things that kept me going and made me believe that my body can be alright.” Antonio had the support of friends, family and the medical staff at West Ham during those times, but he has worked hard to put them behind him. A tailored gym routine focused on his hamstrings has helped; so, too, after some experimentation, an overhauled diet. “I’ve tried to change it multiple times,” he says. “I gave up alcohol, tried to be vegan for a week — I couldn’t do it —but now I don’t eat red meat. It’s just chicken, fish and I have loads of vegetables. Veg is an alkaline and it helps to combat ninflammation in the muscles.” Those changes are working, and Moyes talks of a more mature player to the one he has worked with in the past. The Scot now has so much faith in Antonio that he has been confident to turn down signings to support his only striker for more than a year, preferring to stick with him over a gamble in the market. The Jamaican international was previously dogged by hamstring trouble But their relationship has not always been so straightforward. During Moyes’s first spell at West Ham, he dropped Antonio from a squad after he was late to a team meeting — a clear line in the sand. “When he came the first time, there was a bit of a fall-out between me and him,” Antonio concedes. “We moved on from that quite quickly and finished the season quite well. “One thing with the gaffer is that even if you’ve had a falling-out, he will easily forget. You can go in and have a full-on row with each other, but from that row we both respect each other as player and manager.” That does not mean there is no longer the need for choice words to be exchanged every now and then. “There are definitely some voices being raised and digging people out,” he says. “Scary? Yeah. It is needed. People need to be lifted and know if they’re not doing well. That is one thing we get from him and from player to player. Everyone demands the best from each other; the coaching staff and players, we all demand it and we will keep pushing each other.” Antonio has not always seen eye-to-eye with West Ham manager David Moyes That collective drive has taken West Ham to the dizzying heights they are now experiencing and enjoying. “I have been here a long time and four out of the seven seasons I have been here we’ve been in relegation battles,” says Antonio. “I love that we are looking up, instead of looking back. “The pressure of relegation is awful. It is a completely different pressure now. It is good pressure, because it shows that we are doing well.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Hammers face Ligue 1 side Lyon at the London Stadium on Thursday night in the first leg of their quarter-final tie. West Ham or Lyon have been drawn to face either Barcelona or Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-final as they bid to reach the final in Seville. Fans in east London have been chanting about a tie with Barcelona since the start of the season, but Moyes insists that those within the club are keeping cool heads. “[We're] not thinking beyond Lyon at the moment,” said Moyes. SPONSORED “We take every competition seriously, treat them all with the same importance. This one obviously is more special, to be among teams we've not had for years is really important. Two years ago they were in a Champions League semi-final. We'd be crazy to think any further than this first game. “We have not even talked a minute more than Lyon. How could we dare? We wouldn't. It is too big a game, too big a club that we are playing. “We're playing a really strong team in Europe over many years so we find that we wouldn't even think about it. None of us have considered it. One game at a time, it is sad but that is it.” West Ham are in their first European quarter-final since 1981 and, with UEFA having recently approved new rules to allow historic performance in Europe to influence qualification (a backdoor for big clubs fallen on hard times) Moyes is delighted to see his side upsetting the usual order of things. “I bet you UEFA were not expecting West Ham to be in this position,"" said Moyes. ""But that's what happens. “And that's why we need to keep encouraging UEFA to bring in other teams. Look how well we've done. Maybe we might not have got in this competition if there were different rules. “From that point of view, I really think that we want to show that we can challenge. And if we're at our best, we're a match for most teams and we can be.” ",positive,liverpool,0

A record-breaking home crowd pushed David Moyes's side to a historic last-16, second-leg win over Sevilla last month and tickets for this evening’s encounter, a first European quarter-final for 41 years, sold out in days. After all the tumult of the move from Upton Park to Stratford and the 3-0 defeat to Burnley which saw fans storm the pitch four years ago, the London Stadium now feels like a very different place. ""Yeah it has [changed],"" said West Ham defender Cresswell. ""There is no beating around the bush, we've had some hard years there fighting relegation. ""I've been there at Upton Park where the atmosphere was frightening at times and it doesn't matter what team we're playing, we felt we were in a game. ""The progression the club's made over the last two years, it's kind of our fortress now and teams have found it hard to play there. ""Certainly the atmosphere against Sevilla was special, and hopefully we can replicate that again."" Hammers team-mate Michail Antonio added: ""The Sevilla game just felt like they [the fans] were sucking the ball into their net. ""Sevilla are a very composed team, play great football. But you could see it. They couldn't play, couldn't deal with the pressure and the atmosphere. The fans were all over them and then we were because the fans were pushing us."" A record-breaking London Stadium crowd witnessed West Ham’s last-16 win over Sevilla Despite being novices at this level, Lyon's struggles in Ligue 1 mean West Ham go into the tie as favourites to make the semi-finals, where a potential meeting with Barcelona awaits. Cresswell has shrugged off the favourites tag but says West Ham go into the match full of confidence. ""We don't want to be looking from the outside at what odds we are or who's favourite,"" he said. ""We've got to concentrate on our game. We're in the quarter-finals of the Europa League, it's not going to be easy. At this stage teams don't get there by luck and we've certainly earned the right to get there. We've not got many players that have got this far but we are fully focused. ""I wouldn't say we feel established, but we've earned the right to be there over the last two seasons with how we've played in the Premier League. In the competition this year we've done fantastic, coming up against arguably the favourites [Sevilla], who've won it six times. To overcome that, we are going well."" ",positive,liverpool,0

The Hammers full-back was shown a straight red in injury time at the end of the first half for pulling back Moussa Dembele as he raced forward. It was a soft decision, especially considering Dembele was moving away from goal, and Moyes was also booked by the referee for his protests at the break. The West Ham manager pointed to a challenge on Jarrod Bowen in the build-up to the move which produced the red card - with Hassouem Aouar barging the forward to the ground. ""The only thing I’m going to say is the tackle in lead up to it on Jarrod was a foul in the same phase of play so I expect that to be bartered into it,"" said Moyes. ""That’s the disappointment for me. ""The only thing I want to focus on is if it’s a free kick on Jarrod. If it is I’d have expected VAR to check that. That’s what we do in the Premier League. It’s in the same phase of play."" West Ham responded to the second half with a goal through Bowen, before Tottenham loanee Tanguy Ndombele pulled one back for the visitors. Moyes was also bemused as to why a supporter charged onto the pitch as West Ham were breaking forward at 1-1 looking to find a winner and take a lead to Lyon for the second leg. ""I was [baffled],"" said Moyes. ""This is a really good football club, doing so many good things to improve but those things tonight certainly didn’t help the team. We were on a counterattack at the time with an opportunity to score."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Aaron Cresswell was shown a soft red card on the brink of half time and would have been fearing the worst as he trudged off. But his teammates stood up and showed a defiant response, taking the lead through Jarrod Bowen. Tottenham’s Tanguy Ndombele, on loan with the Ligue 1 club, levelled but West Ham stood firm and refused to collapse despite their disadvantage. It now all hangs on next week’s second leg in France. The Hammers had reached this point - their first European quarter-final in 41 years -thanks to a momentous evening at the London Stadium against Sevilla, overcoming a first leg deficit in superb style. This would be a different challenge. Not only was it a first leg but the Hammers were fancied as favourites given Lyon’s indifferent form domestically. It is only two years since the French side were in the semi-finals of the Champions League, however, and they are well versed in what makes the difference at this level. It was ahead of Sevilla that Moyes had warned of being drawn in by the dark arts, but the same could have applied here. A first half dominated by the visitors, making the most of small challenges, came to be defined by just that as a fine effort from West Ham was completely undone on the brink of the interval with Cresswell given his marching orders. After Moussa Dembele broke through the West Ham rearguard, Cresswell came flying back and, just as the former Fulham man poked the ball away from goal, he laid a soft hand on his shoulder, allowing the Frenchman the chance to go tumbling down and give German referee, Felix Zwayer, the chance to show a direct red. Cresswell, who on Wednesday said this was the biggest game of his 14-year professional career, slapped his hands across his face as Dembele sent a Cristiano Ronaldo style wink in the direction of a teammate. Moyes takes pride in his side having a backbone these days and they were able to show it here. The Scot earned himself a booking for venting his frustrations at Zwayer at the break but his team responded in a much better manner. With Lyon pushing forward Michail Antonio broke away and dragged them forward. Lyon recovered but gave possession up cheaply to Pablo Fornals on the edge of the box. After exchanging passes with Antonio the Spaniard moved to slip the ball into Bowen. Jerome Boateng, a World Cup winning defender, made a hash of intercepting, allowing Bowen to turn back and fire goal-ward, his shot deflecting past Anthony Lopes and in. It was scrappy, but after a first half in which they felt a sting of injustice - no one cared. Moyes raced onto the pitch in celebration rather than remonstration, pumping both fists back towards the main stand. The home fans partied as they had here last month against Sevilla, chants of “West Ham are massive” once again echoing around. This was not following quite the same fairytale script, though. Lyon were pinning West Ham back, looking to exploit their advantage, and quickly found the only defensive crack of the evening. Tete, the Brazilian signed from Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk last week, skipped past Ben Johnson - sent on after the red card - and crossed low. A slight touch from Alphonse Areola sent it into Ryan Fredericks, who blocked and could only watch as the impressive Tottenham loanee Ndomele poked home a leveller. From there, West Ham were resolute and determined to go to France with it all to play for. Areola saved from Lucas Paqueta and Emerson Palmeri while Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson were robust in dealing with Dembele. Perhaps the biggest frustration for Moyes, Cresswell’s sending off aside, would have been towards one of his own supporters. West Ham were not just resting on their laurels but looking to break and cause Lyon trouble too. They were doing just that, Fornals fizzing a ball to the feet of Declan Rice, as one idiotic supporter burst onto the pitch and into the Lyon box, stopping proceedings. Moyes and his players were dumbstruck. The hosts had to quickly refocus, Areola palming away more efforts during eight minutes of added time and Antonio back putting his body on the line to block the rebound. That was not the home advantage they were looking for, especially as they look ahead to a second leg in front of a hostile crowd. West Ham do, however, go there with everything in the balance. Moyes will have his complaints over the sending off but he can have few about the response to it - this was another test passed by his side. ",positive,liverpool,0

Aaron Cresswell was sent off in the first half stoppage-time for a tug on Moussa Dembele when the left back was deemed to be last man, infuriating David Moyes who was booked as he headed down the tunnel. Despite being a man down, the Hammers took the lead seven minutes after the restart, Bowen pouncing on a defensive error to score from close range. But Spurs loanee Ndombele ensured the tie will be finely poised in France next week when he finished from six yards after sloppy defending. Dan Kilpatrick was at the London Stadium to rate the West Ham players... Alphonse Areola 6 His faint touch on Tete’s cross wrong-footed Fredericks for Ndombele’s equaliser. Twice tested by Lyon in the final 15 minutes but stood tall. Ryan Fredericks 5 Made a mess of the cross for Lyon’s equaliser, atlhough Areola’s touch made it tough for him. Bravely saw out the game with a stitched up eyebrow after a nasty clash of heads. Craig Dawson 8 Sprayed a stunning diagonal to release Benrahma for a first-half chance and typically no-nonsense defensively. Kurt Zouma 7 Uncharacteristically sloppy on occasions but defended well when he had to, and arrowed some dangerous long balls towards Antonio as West Ham went direct. Aaron Cresswell 5 Red card was harsh - but arguably fair. Dembele went down easily, but Cresswell gave him the option by briefly grabbing his upper arm. Declan Rice 7 Always in the right place to snuff out Lyon attacks and drove forward well from midfield. Had to be more reserved in the second half. Did well to avoid the booking which would have ruled him out of the second leg. Tomas Soucek 6 Disciplined and hard working in the midfield but lacked his usual threat in the final third. Jarrod Bowen 8 Pounced on Jerome Boateng’s mistake to score and should have had an assist for Antonio with a fine run and cross. Another standout display from the Hammers’ in-form player. Said Benrahma 6 Can feel hard done to be the fall guy at half-time after a lively 45 minutes. Breached Lyon’s back line after a superb first touch from Dawson’s pass but his effort was saved. Pablo Fornals 8 Won possession in the build up to the goal and slipped the ball through to Bowen. Earlier made a chance for Antonio. Never stopped running. Michail Antonio 7 Hold up play with feet, chest and head was excellent and repeatedly stretched Lyon on the counter. But was a fraction slow the pull the trigger after being put through by Fornals, allowing the defender to block, and did not connect with Bowen’s cross when he might have shot. Subs Ben Johnson (Benrahma 46’) 6 Had no chances to get forward but put in a disciplined and composed display as an auxiliary left-back. Not used: Fabianski, Randolph, Coufal, Yarmolenko, Vlasic, Noble, Diop, Masuaku, Kral, Alese, Parkins. ",positive,liverpool,0

The striker scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as the Bees completed a League double over London rivals West Ham yesterday. The result moved Thomas Frank’s side 12 points clear of the bottom three with six games left to play in their maiden Premier League season. Toney set up Brentford’s opener as he flicked Kristoffer Ajer’s throw-in into the path of Bryan Mbuemo before heading his strike partner’s cross past Lukasz Fabianski to make sure of the result. Frank and his side celebrated with a traditional lap of the pitch and, asked if they felt safe, Toney told Standard Sport: “Yeah, 100 per cent. “I felt like we were safe before, the players we have got in the team, I feel like we’ve got more than enough to stay in the League. We were feeling closer and closer and better. “I think I was more happy for Bryan to score than myself. That is the partnership we have. We know each other’s game, he knows the runs I will make and I do his, he puts it in the danger zone and I’ll be there.” Eriksen once again put on an exhibition in midfield, constantly looking to get the hosts on the front foot and creating chances for Frank’s side. “With a player like that in the team then you are going to have the quality,” said Toney. “He sets a certain standard for himself and the team and we have to come up to that and play above that so with him coming in it is great for all of us.

The Hammers defender limped off after half an hour with an ankle injury, following a challenge by Brentford’s Christian Norgaard. Zouma, 27, was sent for a scan on Monday, ahead of Thursday’s crucial Europa League quarter-final, second leg, against Lyon on Thursday. West Ham are level in the tie at 1-1 but will already be without left-back Aaron Cresswell following his controversial red card at the London Stadium last Thursday. “Kurt has twisted his ankle,” said manager David Moyes. “We don’t know how bad it is. “We’ll get him checked. Coming off is not a good sign but hopefully it’s not too bad.” The Hammers were on the back foot from the off against the Bees, with Moyes conceding that the taxing Europa League schedule was taking its toll on his thin squad. “Maybe Thursday-Sunday caught up with us a little bit today,” said the Scot. “We lacked the intensity we’ve got in our general performances. We hardly made any chances.” West Ham switched off in allowing Bryan Mbuemo to open the scoring from a throw-in routine minutes into the second half, before leaving the Bees forward free to tee up Ivan Toney to double the lead soon after. West Ham were at least able to welcome back Vladimir Coufal for his first start since undergoing surgery for a hernia earlier this season. The Czech full-back has revealed he had been battling the injury since last summer’s European Championship. ""I was struggling since the start of the season,"" Coufal told Standard Sport. ""It started in the Euros but I didn’t pay attention because I thought it would pass. After it was more serious and more serious and I was still playing. ""I worked really hard for six weeks. ""The first prediction was to return after six weeks. After five weeks I was ready to play. Professor Ernest Schilders did an amazing job with the surgery. Rich and George looked after me and did an amazing job. I need to thank them because they looked after me like their kids."" After Arsenal and Manchester United lost on Saturday, West Ham missed chance to take advantage in the race for Europe, but Coufal insists they won’t give up their fight. ""Top four is more of a dream than a goal,"" said Coufal. ""Our real goal should be top six or to get into Europe next season, whichever way we can do that. It doesn’t matter how we reach it but our goal is to reach European football. [The Brentford defeat] doesn’t change our confidence. ""We have a good squad, a very strong squad.

After nine years with the club, the 36-year-old confirmed he will return to Brazil at the end of the season upon the expiration of his contract. While once a key part of City’s side, Rodri’s vast improvement on a difficult first season in England, coupled with Fernandinho’s advancing years, has naturally lessened his importance to the cause. This season, the 36-year-old has been limited to only 12 starts across all competitions, although teammate Ederson had previously suggested City were working towards keeping the midfielder at the club in some capacity. Fernadinho, however, confirmed his desire to leave when speaking ahead of City’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. “I have decided with my family that we will go and that is the most important thing,” he said. “I want to continue playing first-team football. “I will go back to Brazil for sure.” The news appeared to have some as a shock to Guardiola when, after being informed of his player’s comments, replied: “Sorry?

Though having long since ceased being a regular starter at City, Fernandinho remains an influential figure in the dressing room as the club target a treble of major trophies this term. But asked if he expected to stay put for next season, the 36-year-old told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: “No, I want to play regularly. I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important for me.” That revelation was news to Guardiola, who addressed the assembled media slightly after Fernandinho in advance of City’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie against Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium on Wednesday night. “Oh!

Both Manchester United and Arsenal lost earlier in the day, and Spurs took full advantage as they beat Aston Villa 4-0 and moved three points clear in fourth. Heung-min Son scored a hat-trick in the ruthless win, with Dejan Kulusevski also on the scoresheet, and Conte hailed his side’s killer instinct in seizing the moment. “We have to look at ourselves - a strong team doesn’t depend on others,” Conte said. “We have to understand the moment to kill the opponent. Today was an important moment, especially because other results were good for us. “It was good because we won. If we don’t win, it’s not useful to look at the results of the other teams. “The winner has to feel when there is the blood of your opponents and then you have to try to kill them.” Tottenham were sensational in the second-half at Villa Park but they had to ride out some tricky moments in the first 45 minutes, with the home side well on top during the opening period. A combination of Hugo Lloris and some poor finishing meant Villa trailed at the break, and Conte was impressed with the resilience his side displayed. “I have to be pleased to see this commitment, this attention and this accuracy in every situation,” Conte said. “The first half was very tough because Aston Villa brought high intensity and tried to put a good pressure on us. We showed a great consistency to be solid and at the same time, when we were in possession to score goals. “For sure a good moment for us. The hard work that we did this month was important.

Ominously for Spurs’ rivals, both for this season’s top four and long-term, this is still not a team capable of playing Conte’s football for a full 90 minutes but when they do turn it out, they are near enough unstoppable, thanks to a clinical front three of Son, Harry Kane and Kulusevski who are increasingly making a claim to be the League’s most dangerous trio. Villa did not do much wrong, and played some intricate, high-tempo football at times, but Spurs’ were simply too good in the final third. As in the 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle, Kane did not score but was nonetheless hugely influential, assisting Spurs’ second and third goals at the start of the second half with brilliant headers. The first was a brave win in the air against Ezri Konsa, with Kulusevski then arrowing a super finish into the far corner for the real sucker-punch. The second was a superb flick into the channel for Son to run clear and beat Emi Martinez one-on-one with a cool finish. Kulusevski also assisted Son’s third with a neat cutback. What a signing the Swede is proving to be. But as well as another demonstration of their firepower, this win was also a test of Spurs’ mettle as they withstood a ferocious spell of Villa pressure, which lasted from Son’s stunning third-minute strike until the final seconds of the first half, when Lloris clawed away Philippe Coutinho’s free-kick. While Spurs rode their luck, they also fought determinedly and showed no signs of the soft underbelly which characterised the squad before Conte’s appointment. Their defending of set pieces was also impressive and notably better than at the start of the year when they were susceptible from corners and free-kicks. Arsenal’s defeat to Brighton, their second loss on the bounce, and Everton’s win over Manchester United made this a huge opportunity for Spurs to put themselves firmly in control of their own destiny but they showed no indication they were feeling the pressure. Spurs should now be considered firm favourites for the last Champions League place and, encouragingly, it still feels as though they are just getting started. Lloris stands up It was easy to overlook another Lloris mistake after Tottenham’s devastating second-half display in last weekend’s hammering of Newcastle. The goalkeeper weakly allowed Fabian Schar’s freekick to sneak inside the post, continuing a spell of poor form since he agreed a new contract in January. So perhaps Spurs were overdue a big performance from their captain, who was as important to this victory as Son with an inspired performance. The Frenchman made seven first half saves, including spectacular one-handed stops to deny Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn. According to Opta, it was the most saves by any goalkeeper in the first half of any Premier League match since 2006-07, reflecting Villa’s dominance and Lloris’ brilliance. He finished the first half by clawing Coutinho’s opportunistic free-kick off the line, summing up the first 45 minutes. Villa were the better side but could not beat Spurs’ final line of defence. Lloris has been guilty of errors in important matches but this was a big performance from the goalkeeper when it mattered, ensuring his team went in ahead at half time and could ultimately capitalise on Arsenal’s defeat. Furious Hojbjerg relishes the battle Tottenham’s unsung hero in the middle of the park was Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. The Dane can scarcely have taken such a kicking in his career, with Villa’s ultra-physical press especially targeting him in the first half. But he stood up to the challenge magnificently, riding challenge after challenge, even as he appeared to grow increasingly furious with the lack of protection from the referee. Hojbjerg has struggled for consistency this season but he has been excellent for Spurs in the last few games, and after last week’s win over Newcastle Conte singled him out for praise unprompted in his post-match press conference. His performance here was even better than against the Toon, particularly as Rodrigo Bentancur struggled with Villa’s intensity before the break. Conte continues to be frustrated by the absence of Oliver Skipp but Hojbjerg’s form is ensuring Spurs remain strong in the middle of the park without the England U-21 international.

Son’s third-minute strike put the visitors ahead but Villa dominated the rest of the first-half, pegging Spurs into their third and peppering Hugo Lloris’ goal with efforts. Villa were made to pay for their profligacy, however, as Spurs stepped up a gear in the second half, Dejan Kulusevski scoring five minutes after the interval before Son completely his treble with two cool finishes to move Spurs three points clear in fourth place. Dan Kilpatrick was at Villa Park to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 9 Magnificent display to keep out Villa in the first half, making seven saves in total, including spectacular one-handed effors to deny Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn. Nearly punished for a sloppy late pass out but had done his job. Cristian Romero 8 Relished the physical battle, particularly his duels with Brazilian Philippe Coutinho. Much improved at defending set pieces in last few matches and made the third goal with an angle pass for Kane. Eric Dier 8 Under the cosh in the first half but helped Spurs come through unscathed with some brave blocks and challenges. Ben Davies 8 Played his part in a committed rearguard, and appeared particularly vocal when Spurs when were under pressure. Emerson Royal 6 Had a tough job against Lucas Digne, Ollie Watkins and Coutinho, who drifted to the left in the first half. Committed but unpolished, particularly on the ball. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Uncharacteristically flustered in the first half in the face of Villa’s onslaught but more composed after the break, as Spurs turned the screw. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 8 Rarely can he have taken such a kicking! Coped well with Villa’s physical approach in another impressive display, particularly as he picked up an early booking and had to walk a tightrope to avoid a second. Matt Doherty 5 Tried to play on after a crunching early challenge by Matty Cash but eventually forced off. A shame for him given his recent resurgence. Dejan Kulusevski 9 Another goal -- a brilliant low finish for the sucker punch -- and assisted Son. Decisive. Hard to think of many better January signings in Premier League history. Heung-min Son 10 Scored a clinical hat-trick of sublime finishes, each one in the corner and unsavable. On this form, he is one of the League’s most dangerous and instinctive finishers. Harry Kane 9 Just as against Newcastle last weekend, he didn’t score but was the creative hub for Spurs, finishing with two great headed asssists. The first was a great win in the air against Ezri Konsa, the second a sublime into the channel for Son. He was also involved in the first goal with his blocked shot falling for Son. Subs Sergio Reguilon (Doherty 21’) 7 Got stuck in and defended well but did not have many chances to get forward. When he did, at the end of the first half, nearly forced Tyrone Mings into an own goal. Lucas Moura (Son 78’) 6 Gave Son a breather -- and a standing ovation -- and helped Spurs to see out the game. Steven Bergwijn (Kulusevski 84’) 6 Had a couple of glimpses in the box but could not score from the bench again. ",positive,liverpool,0

The two will meet on Sunday in what is surely one of the biggest Premier League games in history. City’s lead has been cut down to just one point and a win for either side would put one hand on the title at this stage of the campaign. Throughout the respective spells of both Guardiola and Klopp in England, their sides have redefined what it takes to win a title. City have broken the 100 point barrier and the 2018-19 season saw Liverpool finish on 97 points, only to end up second. Klopp’s own Premier League victory saw his team amass 99 points and the German is the manager to have beaten Guardiola the most over the course of his career, with 9 wins in 22 matches. The City chief managed Barcelona during a time in which battles with Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid were legendary, though looks upon this challenge as even greater. Speaking ahead of their game at the Etihad Stadium, Guardiola said: ""I admire what they do, how good they are. I enjoy this challenge. ""When I retire and watch and play golf I will remember the biggest rivalry was Liverpool.” ",positive,liverpool,3

City’s lead has been cut down to only one point and any victor on Sunday would surely be considered as favourites to win the title. While the rivalry arguably lacks some of the needle the battles Manchester United and Arsenal had at the turn of the millennium, the overall quality of both City and Liverpool has rarely been matched by other English sides. Guardiola and Klopp, however, do not appear to have the kind of fiery relationship Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger - or Jose Mourinho and Rafa Benitez - were embroiled in with the Liverpool boss hailing his City counterpart as “the best coach in the world.” Speaking at his press conference, Guardiola distanced himself from such comments but moved to praise Klopp in return. “I didn’t become a manager to be the best. I’m not. Thank you so much, but I’m not. I’d like to say I’m the best, but I’m not. “I’d say incredible things about my team. My team are the best. I like to admit my players are exceptional. ""Jurgen makes world football a better place to live. He’s a huge competitor. He’s a good guy and I don’t have any problems with him.” Guardiola did not want to comment on the publication of further accusations about the club’s final affairs this week. He said: ""I cannot control the people from where it comes. It has come from outside and when you understand the important win we had a few days ago, and the games we have ahead of us this week, I don’t spend one second... in fact I am 50 seconds talking about it now, so next question.""

There are still eight matches to play in this league season, almost a quarter of the campaign, a period in which some of the most iconic Premier League title races have produced their most dramatic twists and turns. But this feels different, the latest instalment of a rivalry that has raised the bar, between two teams so good they really ought to be peerless. Instead, they have each other. For Liverpool in particular, defeat would surely be terminal, the gap widening to four points and meaning Manchester City would have to slip up twice even if Jurgen Klopp’s side are flawless. City, though, will be equally wary of ceding ground to a team who have been just that since mid-January, winning ten on the bounce in the league. The level of excellence required just to keep pace in this race, let alone win it, has brought back memories of three years ago, when 98 points played 97 and Liverpool closed out the season with nine straight wins but were still pipped by City, who racked up 14. Statistically the highest-quality title race in top-flight history might have lacked some of the slip-ups and swings that have punctuated its greatest, but it was also missing this kind of business end head-to-head, the fixture computer conspiring to throw up their league second meeting as early as the third day of the New Year. Both head to the Etihad in prime form, big guns firing and - with the exception of Ruben Dias’ continued absence - full-strength teams. That this could yet prove the first of a season-defining trilogy is lost on no one either, as talk of trebles and quadruples abounds. The FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United and Arsenal in 1999 is often credited with having indirectly determined the Premier League and European champions as well, but Liverpool and City might yet have one another’s fate in their hands on all fronts, all the way to the line. They meet again at Wembley in the FA Cup next weekend and, after each taking significant strides towards the Champions League semi-finals in midweek, remain on course for a showdown in Paris at the end of it all. But for now, all that matters is Sunday: whichever name is on top of the Premier League table by the end of the weekend will likely be the same one on the Premier League trophy by the end of May.

The Hammers offered a fee of £50m with £10m in add-ons but have seen the bid rejected, while Nunez would prefer a move to a Champions League club. West Ham are making a late push to bolster David Moyes’s forward line before the 11pm deadline on Monday evening. Nunez is the top scorer in the Portuguese league so far this season but the club are reluctant to sell. Any move is further complicated by the forward being away on international duty in South America. Manager David Moyes is keen to add top level forwards to his squad as cover for Michail Antonio this month, but the Hammers have also seen Leeds United snub an approach for Brazilian Raphinha. Moyes is being backed financially as the Hammers look to strengthen their squad for a Champions League push, as well as a run in the Europa League knockout stages, but face a battle to land late any late deals. There is an acceptance that any deal for Nunez is highly unlikely given the hurdles faced by the East Londoners. An attacker and defender remain high among Moyes’ priorities as the Hammers look to compete in the FA Cup, Europa League, and push for a top-four finish in the Premier League in the coming months. Marseille defender Duje Caleta-Car is a target to bolster the defence. West Ham are chasing a loan move for the Croatian, while his club are only interested in a permanent transfer at this stage.

Arsenal are in the driving seat to qualify for next season’s Champions League with a three-point cushion over fifth-placed Tottenham and a game in hand over their nearest rival. But Spurs and Manchester United are still in the mix, even West Ham are not totally out of the picture, and it is all to play for when the Premier League resumes after the international break. Will Arsenal finish the job and get back into the Champions League for the first time since 2016/17? Can Harry Kane inspire Tottenham to overtake their north London neighbours? Will Cristiano Ronaldo help United salvage their season? Here, our writers predict who will round off the top four behind Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea... Dan Kilpatrick: Tottenham Antonio Conte has acknowledged that Arsenal are further along than his Tottenham squad, whose wildly inconsistent form makes them a risky bet for fourth place. But look a little closer and Spurs have won four of their last five League games, including Sunday's impressive 3-1 victory over West Ham. Conte's side put four past Leeds and five past Everton, and would have beaten Brighton and the Hammers by similar margins with better finishing. Problems remain – notably their finishing and defending set-pieces – but there is a feeling inside the club that something has finally clicked under Conte, while in Kane they have the best No10 and No9 in the Premier League, rolled into one player. Spurs' squad depth remains flimsy – an injury to anyone in Conte's current XI would be bad news – but Kane is being supported ably by Heung-min Son and impressive January signings Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, and Oliver Skipp and Ryan Sessegnon should be fit for the run-in. Spurs can also take optimism from their nine remaining fixtures, with a chance to close the gap to Arsenal with a home north London derby and only one other match against a side in the top eight, Liverpool. James Robson: Arsenal Arsenal are actually making believers of people, which might be Mikel Arteta’s greatest achievement of all so far. That is always a dangerous position for the Gunners, who know a thing or two about false dawns – but something feels very different about this current team. Arteta has put his faith in youth and produced a team that has grown in confidence as the season has progressed. Who would have thought that after the opening weeks of the campaign? It will take a little while longer to truly shake the “flaky” tag they have so often been labelled with – but looking at the teams they are competing with for top four, they seem the most consistent of all. Tottenham have beaten Manchester City, but lost to Burnley and Middlesbrough in recent weeks. Manchester United have won one of their last five in all competitions and Ralf Rangnick admits they cannot afford to drop another point if they want Champions League football. Arsenal are in pole position and have no reason to worry about what is behind them. Simon Collings: Arsenal The scenes at Villa Park on Saturday said it all really. While Arsenal will not be thinking they’ve qualified for the Champions League yet, that win felt like a huge result given they had lost to Liverpool just three days before. Arsenal needed to respond and they did so in a fashion that suggests they have the heart and grit to get over the line in the race for the top four, which is not something you would have said about them in the past. Crucially, Arteta’s side look the most consistent out of all the contenders and their starting XI is also very settled. As long as injuries and illness don’t strike, Arsenal look well placed. The Gunners have a nice run after the international break and then face a crucial week later in April, where they face Chelsea and Manchester United in the space of four days. It is another tight turnaround - something Arteta is not happy about - but if Arsenal come through that then a fourth-place finish should be within their grasp. Jack Rosser: Tottenham Conte feels his side have turned a corner of late and ending their boom-bust cycle against West Ham could prove decisive. The Italian spoke of a determined dressing room which is only improving following Sunday's win and it is hard to argue with his take. After a woeful start to the season, Kane is back to his peak as a No9-and-a-half, tormenting defenders and midfielders alike with his movement and ability on the ball. Meanwhile, Son is back in the goals again after a frustrating run having bagged a brace against West Ham, while Kulusevski has added energy and an unpredictability to the forward line. With Skipp set to return soon, Spurs are certainly on an upward curve. The Gunners may have the game in hand but, regardless of form, that is never a guarantee that the gap will be extended. Both sides are still in the early stages of their development but if the north London derby were to be played next week, I would back Spurs, who have the stronger mentality under Conte.

Although the hiatus threatens to disrupt Spurs’ rhythm, Conte is one of the world’s best training ground coaches, so an uninterrupted two-week period will give him the chance to drill and improve his remaining players. Here are three jobs for Spurs and Conte during the next fortnight… Get Skipp fit Conte has said he is hopeful of having Oliver Skipp available after the break, and possibly even in time to face Newcastle on April 3. Elsewhere at the club, that is considered hugely wishful thinking, with Skipp having been told to rest by specialists due to a difficult pelvic issue. Even if a return in the next few weeks is unlikely, Spurs will be hoping Skipp is free to play some part in the run-in, with Conte desperately short of trusted first-team players, particularly in midfield. The club will also be hoping to use the break to get Ryan Sessegnon closer to a return from his latest hamstring problem. Work on defending set-pieces Four of the last nine League goals Spurs have conceded have come from set-pieces, including Said Benrahma’s effort for West Ham on Sunday, which bore a worrying resemblance to Morecambe’s goal against Conte’s side in early January. Conte has been aware of the problem for weeks but Spurs are showing few signs of improvement, and the head coach is likely to use the break to scrutinise the issue and find a solution. Part of the problem is surely that Spurs simply do not have many aerially dominant players, with none of their three regular centre-backs especially imposing in the air. Hope and pray International breaks have not been kind to Spurs this season. Conte’s predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo, found his positive start derailed by a disastrous spate of injuries in September’s break, while the following month’s was also disruptive. Conte then lost key man Cristian Romero for three months in November’s break, so will be praying for no injuries this time around. With squad depth an issue at Spurs, Conte can scarcely afford to lose a single member of his current XI, least of all Harry Kane, Heung-min Son or Romero. The Argentina defender has joined up with the national squad, despite being suspended for both their World Cup qualifiers which must have frustrated Conte. ",positive,liverpool,0

Dier was not named in Gareth Southgate’s initial 25-man squad for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast, with the England boss keeping faith with out-of-form Harry Maguire and handing a maiden call-up to Crystal Palace’s Marc Guehi. Southgate was, however, mulling over a number of potential changes on Monday morning, raising the possibility that Dier could still play a part in the friendlies. Antonio Conte, the Spurs manager, has said the 28-year-old could become one of the best players in the world in his position – at the heart of the back three – and has tipped him to return to the England set up for the Qatar World Cup, if he maintains his current form. Conte has also said that Dier, who began his England career as a midfielder, can still improve. Dier was a key part of Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs side which pushed for the title in 2015-16 and the following season, largely as a midfielder, but he says he has never been as consistently good as this season. “I feel for me this is consistently my best season I have had so far at Tottenham, not just as a defender but overall,” Dier told Standard Sport after Sunday’s 3-1 win over West Ham. “I don’t think I’ve ever shown the consistency in the performances that I have shown this season and I feel like my football is the best it has been in my opinion. “It is always very nice when a manager, especially one like him, says those things, it gives me a lot of confidence, but the thing I pay most attention to from his words are that I have a lot of space for improvement and I think that is really the thing he says that I focus on the most. “I want to fill that space, fill that potential, as much as possible, as much as he thinks possible.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The club have built a sizeable fanbase in the country, thanks in no small part to the performances of Heung-min Son, who captains the South Korean national team.

Conte, whose side visit Aston Villa on Saturday, has a reputation as a taskmaster, demanding his players “suffer” during his gruelling training sessions. The head coach has sought to change various aspects of his squad’s lives, including what they eat and their sleeping patterns, and at the start of his tenure in November he made headlines by reportedly banning ketchup and fatty foods from the players’ canteen. His methods have worked, with an improving Spurs back in the top four after five wins from their last six. “I’ve tried to bring my experience as a player to my players,” Conte told Standard Sport. “When I was a player, I made many mistakes, so I try to give the right advice to my players, like a big brother, because I want the best for them. “When you get older, you’re more experienced and you start to understand situations that in the past you thought weren’t useful. In my experience, only after 30 years old I understood the importance of food. “I understood that to eat well was good for injuries, to recover well. And to sleep eight hours was important. When you become older, you can add experience in your talent, your quality, your professionalism.” One player Conte has not had to advise on his lifestyle is Harry Kane, who has employed his own chef since 2017 and is renowned for his professionalism. Conte says Kane is “the right age” to become one of the best strikers in history and believes his approach will ensure he keeps getting better, like Karim Benzema, 34, and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo, 37. “We’re talking about a player [Kane] who has already shown to be a top-class striker,” Conte said. “In the past he scored fantastic goals. He was younger, but despite this he scored in a fantastic way in every season. “When you grow older, you gain experience and understand your body much better, you improve your mentality. Players like them [Benzema and Ronaldo] have great professionalism. Ronaldo — why has he arrived at his age with this mentality and type of performance? Because he takes care of himself, and if you take care in training sessions, about your food, you become more complete. “And we’re talking about a player [in Harry] who in every training session wants to push himself, wants to improve himself. For him, it will be very easy to find the right way to continue to develop and find the best of him, absolutely. “Harry also has the right age to show that he can be one of the best [not only] in the world, but in history. I think he’s already in history because he scored a lot of goals for the club and scored a lot of goals for the national team. He’s the captain. He has the right age to consolidate and be one of the best in the world.” Conte is set to welcome back wing-backs Sergio Reguilon and Ryan Sessegnon, but Oliver Skipp remains sidelined after an injury setback. Spurs could go in to the match outside the top four, with Arsenal hosting Brighton at 3pm, but should move back into the Champions League places with a win, after a seven-goal swing over their rivals last weekend.

Ndombele scored on his return to London on Thursday night as loan club Lyon held West Ham to a 1-1 draw in the Europa League quarter-final first leg. The maverick Frenchman returned to his former club on a deal until the end of the season on deadline day in January and Lyon have the option to re-sign him permanently for £54million in the summer - roughly the same fee Spurs paid them in summer 2019. However, neither Spurs nor Ndombele expect Lyon to exercise the option given the prohibitive sum involved, leaving the 25-year-old’s future uncertain. Head coach Antonio Conte sees no future for Ndombele at Spurs, where he will still have three years on his contract in the summer, but the hope is that his performances back at Lyon will prompt interest from other clubs. Ndombele is not the only expensive Spurs signing to have impressed on loan this week, with Giovani Lo Celso named man of the match in Villareal’s 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Conte says he is happy for Lo Celso but suggested the Argentine was not suited to English football and insisted the decision to loan him back to Spain until the end of the season was still the right one for Spurs. ""I’m really happy for his great performance,"" Conte said. ""He needed to play with regularity, with continuity. For this reason he went to Spain in a league he knows very well because he played very well and Tottenham bought him when he played in that league. ""To go back there and show he’s in good form is good for everybody, especially because Tottenham paid a lot of money for him. I am very happy because he is playing every game, he’s showing he’s a good player. ""I never said he’s not a good player.

Kane has been in sensational form since Conte joined the club at the start of November, and has directly contributed to seven goals in his last five appearances as Spurs have climbed into the top four. Conte was at Stamford Bridge to witness Karim Benzema’s sublime hat-trick against the Italian’s former club Chelsea on Wednesday and was asked where he ranked Kane, 28, among the world’s best centre-forwards. ""He deserves an important position in the world of football,"" Conte said. ""I think Harry also he has the right age to show that he can be one of the best, best in the world but especially in history, no? I think he’s already in the history because he scored a lot of goals for the club and scored a lot of goals for the national team. He’s the captain. ""He has the right age to consolidate and be one of the best in the world. His role, he’s a number nine but at the same time he can be a number 10 because of his quality. He’s very good to make assists and to put the ball where he wants. We try also to exploit this aspect and give the ball to him. ""About our team, I’m trying to improve not his quality but to be more effective, to be in the box and a striker. ""I repeat we’re talking about a fantastic player, so it’s very difficult to improve him but we’re trying to work, to push him to have the top ambition to become the best striker."" Conte welcomed Sergio Reguilon and Ryan Sessegnon back to training on Thursday, with the pair in line to return to the squad against Aston Villa on Saturday. Matt Doherty deputised at left wing-back in Sunday’s 5-1 win over Newcastle, finishing with a goal and assist, and Conte said the Republic of Ireland international is an ""example"" to the rest of his squad. ""Matthew is the typical player that is showing good improvement,"" Conte said ahead of the trip to Villa Park. ""At the start he didn’t play a lot with me because at that moment I think he didn’t deserve to play. ""But then he worked really hard. He’s a really good guy. In every training session, you see the desire, the will to improve himself, the tactical and technical aspect. He’s got a great mentality. He’s strong. ""Many times when players don’t play a lot, they go down mentally. But he’s shown me to be strong, to stay there. He showed me, ‘I can do what you want, I am going to improve and when I am ready I want to play’. He showed me not with talking but with his attitude and his behaviour and for this reason he is playing, he is deserving to play and he is playing very well. He has great confidence and I am very happy for him, because this is a big example for the other players. I want to win and I don’t care if I play one player or another player, I decide the player when I see that this player gives me great attitude."" Spurs’ loanee Giovani Lo Celso was named man of the match as Villarreal beat Bayern Munich 1-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday night. Conte revealed he was happy for the Argentine midfielder but said the club made the right decision to allow him to leave in January, and suggested he was not suited to the Premier League. ""I’m really happy for his great performance,"" Conte said. ""He needed to play with regularity, with continuity. For this reason he went to Spain in a league he knows very well because he played very well and Tottenham bought him when he played in that league. ""To go back there and show he’s in good form is good for everybody, especially because Tottenham paid a lot of money for him. I am very happy because he is playing every game, he’s showing he’s a good player but I never said he’s not a good player. ""I said this league is a very difficult league because it is not enough to have great quality and it’s important to play with great intensity and strength. But now he is playing with regularity and I am very happy for him, also Gil, they are playing very well in Spain. Also the club did the right choice, yes."" ",positive,liverpool,0
