0,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048522,Southampton 1-0 Arsenal: Jan Bednarek strike condemns top-four chasing Gunners to third straight defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted his side's form was ""a real worry"" after Southampton won at St Mary's to inflict a third successive defeat on the top-four chasing Gunners. Jan Bednarek scored the game's only goal late in the first half after the visitors had failed to adequately deal with a Saints corner. Bukayo Saka was denied from point-blank range by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with the score still goalless, but further clear-cut openings proved hard to come by for Arsenal until the closing stages of the second half. Emile Smith Rowe forced another fine save out of Forster after latching on to Yan Valery's attempted clearance, before Martin Odegaard dragged a left-footed shot wide of the near post after cutting in from the right. Forster produced yet another impressive stop to deny Granit Xhaka late on as Arsenal desperately piled forward in search of an equaliser. ""We've lost games in different ways - to lose the way we did today is difficult to explain,"" Arteta told BBC Match of the Day. ""If you saw the game, you'd say Arsenal had won comfortably. ""You have to put the ball in the net. You have to make the decisive moments count to win football matches and at the moment we're not doing that."" The Gunners remain three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who were beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - although they do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Southampton, meanwhile, climb to 12th after claiming their first league win since February. Following lacklustre displays at Crystal Palace and at home to Brighton last weekend, Gunners fans may have hoped this trip to St Mary's would prove to be an ideal fixture to reignite their top-four push. Saints had lost five of their past six games in all competitions before Saturday and conceded 19 goals in the process - including a 6-0 capitulation at home to Chelsea in their last match. They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League. The hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery. Although the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining. When Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot. Forster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide. ""It wasn't so sure he could play today,"" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display. ""He had a problem with his ankle, but we needed a goalkeeper like him in such a game today. ""The most important thing is the clean sheet after six or seven games [without one]. We've played much better games, especially with the ball, but today the target was a different one."" Arsenal still have a game in hand on Spurs in fourth but with matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham coming up in the next fortnight, this will go down as a missed opportunity for Arteta and his players.

1,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048517,Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Brighton: Late Trossard goal stuns sluggish Spurs,"Leandro Trossard's superb late goal gave Brighton a gutsy win that dealt a blow to Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the top four. Following a game of few clear-cut chances, Trossard swerved into the Spurs area in the final minute of normal time before producing a fine finish past Hugo Lloris. Steven Bergwijn then missed a chance to equalise at the start of stoppage time - one of the home side's rare opportunities. Spurs stay in fourth, just ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal, while Brighton - in 10th - are on course for their highest-ever top-flight finish. Graham Potter's side enjoyed the better of a first half where Spurs looked oddly sluggish despite not having played for nearly a week, but after the hosts appeared to improve in the second half, they were undone by a combination of poor defending and fine skill from Trossard. The Belgian eluded Eric Dier before opening up his body to send a shot with the outside of his right foot low into the far corner of the net. Spurs did not look anything like the side that came into the game on a run of four consecutive wins -which had started with a 2-0 victory at Brighton, and in which they had scored 14 goals and conceded just two. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were shackled effectively Brighton, with the South Korean not managing a shot on target until nearly an hour in - with an effort that was comfortably blocked in the Albion area. They were slow out of the blocks and while more fired up after the break, presumably after manager Antonio Conte had aired his views to the team at half-time, they lacked the kind of sharpness required to unlock the Brighton defence. It was an opportunity missed for Spurs, as rivals Arsenal lost at Southampton later on Saturday, while Manchester United moved above the Gunners and just three points behind in fifth with a win against Norwich. Spurs face Liverpool on 7 May and then their north London rivals five days later in games that could decide whether they play in the Champions League next season. Brighton's two wins in north London in a week will have banished memories of a worrying slide down the table caused by six straight defeats through February and March. Trossard had put Albion on the way to a memorable win at Emirates Stadium seven days earlier, and the 27-year-old's sixth goal of the season ensured his side will also have the best-ever haul of away points in the Premier League. They have earned 25 of their 40 points so far on the road, and they pulled together impressively to execute Potter's plan to frustrate and ultimately deny Spurs. Their 29 goals scored so far is the lowest of any team in the top half of the table, but they seem on target for the club's best-ever finish in the top flight - and with games to come against Manchester United and West Ham, they could still have a say on how the European places pan out.

2,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048519,Watford 1-2 Brentford: Jansson grabs Bees win late on,"Pontus Jansson's last-minute header broke Watford hearts and gave Brentford a third successive Premier League win for the first time. It looked like Emmanuel Dennis' powerful strike after the break had secured a point for Watford, but the final result pushes them even closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Christian Norgaard had put the Bees ahead inside 15 minutes. It was a game of small margins as moments before Jansson's strike, Imran Louza had missed a chance to win with the goal gaping. The result leaves Watford in 19th, six points adrift of safety having played two more games than Everton. Brentford took the lead through Norgaard; Kristoffer Ajer flicked on Ethan Pinnock's long throw, and the Dane was there to apply the close-range finish. There was a stagnant feel to the game for much of the first half. Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves. But the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1. Initially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus. The home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail. There was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues. Boss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position. In Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded. They hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again. Hodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side. ""Someone up there doesn't like us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have. ""We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw. I didn't think we deserved to be contemplating another home defeat; taking the second half, that is probably the best we've offered our home fans. That doesn't say much."" Relegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season. Christian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed. Thomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again. ""[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,"" he said. ""The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'. ""I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic. Pontus [Jansson] has been very dangerous, big determination, very disciplined. I'm very happy he got this goal.""

3,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048518,Manchester United 3-2 Norwich City: Cristiano Ronaldo nets superb hat-trick,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second hat-trick in three Premier League games to boost Manchester United's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League at the expense of relegation-threatened Norwich at Old Trafford. Knowing victory would take them within three points of the top four, Ronaldo appeared to have put United in control when he scored twice in the opening 32 minutes. However, appalling defending from the hosts either side of the interval allowed Norwich to equalise through Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki and for a while Dean Smith's side looked the more likely winners. But after Ralf Rangnick had abandoned his bold tactic of playing without a recognised ball-winner in midfield and replaced Paul Pogba with Juan Mata, Ronaldo drove a free-kick home off the inside of a post 14 minutes from time to secure victory. The 37-year-old is now on 15 Premier League goals for the season, trailing only Mohamed Salah and Son Hueng-min in the standings. He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals. United can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday. For Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it. It is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution? On this occasion, he was certainly the latter. Not that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish. Ronaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul. The winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post. It was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet. The celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith. They also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest. Norwich's opener was a case in point. Pukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards. Pukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level. Milton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards. Ronaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.

4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61120882,FA Cup semi-final: Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Sadio Mane double helps Jurgen Klopp's side through,"Liverpool survived a late scare to remain on course for an historic quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final with victory over Manchester City at Wembley. If last Sunday's Premier League meeting between the clubs was a classic, this semi-final was effectively decided in a one-sided first 45 minutes, in which a mixture of ruthless finishing and Manchester City mistakes saw Liverpool take a 3-0 lead. A reshuffled City side were unable to recover as Liverpool, having won the Carabao Cup, are now in the FA Cup final too - as well as the last four of the Champions League, while sitting second in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was unable to start Kevin de Bruyne and had Kyle Walker out injured, preferred Zack Steffen to Ederson in goal, a move that back-fired spectacularly. Ibrahima Konate had already headed Liverpool in front after nine minutes when Steffen, trying to repeat the feats of Ederson in the league game between these two clubs, miscontrolled in his six-yard area, allowing Sadio Mane to pounce. Mane beat Steffen with a crisp volley at the end of a superb Liverpool build-up to put Jurgen Klopp's side in complete command at the break but Jack Grealish pulled one back early in the second half and keeper Alisson twice saved crucially from Gabriel Jesus as this semi-final sprang to life. Bernardo Silva pulled another back for City at the start of a tense period of stoppage time but Liverpool survived to face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet at Wembley on Sunday, in the final on 14 May. Liverpool's win keeps them in contention to make history - as no team in English football has won the league title, the two main domestic cup competitions and become champions of Europe in the same season. This was a win built on the foundation of a first half in which their intensity and ruthlessness proved too much for City, whose revamped side looked off the pace and unable to cope with the power of Klopp's side. Konate's power in the air saw him score his third header in his past three starts and Mane's alertness was never going to allow Steffen to get away with his hesitation as he attempted to keep possession in the six-yard area. Ederson had the calmness and expertise to escape almost on his goal-line as Diogo Jota bore down on him during last Sunday's 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium but Steffen showed no such expertise or composure, and paid a heavy price as he was caught. Mane led the Liverpool charge while Thiago was imperious in midfield, his clever pass allowing Mane to volley past Steffen at his near post in the closing moments of the first half for what eventually proved to be the winner. Klopp was elated with his team's performance at the conclusion, although he will have concerns about how they allowed City back into the game through Grealish's goal, conceded two clear chances to Jesus then had to survive the anxiety of four minutes of stoppage time after Silva struck. In the final reckoning, however, Liverpool deserved to reach the final and will present a formidable barrier to either Chelsea or Crystal Palace once the winner of the second semi-final is decided. This was not a good day for Manchester City. It started with a section of their support chanting through the minute's silence to commemorate the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, with City issuing a formal apology to Liverpool after the match had started. In the football context, Guardiola and City were left to regret injuries, a team selection that did not work out and a horribly laboured first 45 minutes that left them with too much to do, despite the brief hope offered by Silva's second goal. City missed the invention of De Bruyne, only fit enough for the bench after suffering an injury in the stormy Champions Leaque quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, and the experience of defender Walker, who was ruled out completely. And Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his FA Cup keeper was not rewarded as the American made that crucial error that allowed Liverpool to build on their fast start. Guardiola will be disappointed but this is a quality side who will now refocus and set sights on the Premier League, where they lead Liverpool by one point, and the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He will hope to have De Bruyne and Walker back fully fit soon because, despite this loss, there is still so much at stake for Guardiola and Manchester City as they remain in a position to achieve stellar things this season.

5,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61029757,Erik ten Hag: What can Man Utd expect if they appoint Ajax boss as their new manager?,"Erik ten Hag was never really one of those people who made it clear he had massive ambitions to be one of the world's top coaches. He is a very humble man and a modest coach. That has a lot to do with his background. He comes from the east of the Netherlands where there's a very down-to-earth mentality and where people speak with a very strong accent. They are a bit less flash there and they look up to those from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, the places where the big offices, industry and the country's parliament are. But despite that background - and he does have a strong accent - Ten Hag's situation is different. Financially there is no motivation and no need to go for the big jobs at any stage in his career because he comes from a very rich family, and his father and brothers are multi-millionaires. They own a real estate company and other financial firms. His father wanted him to go into that company but from a young age Erik was such a brilliant footballer - he was a star for FC Twente as a defender - that he made it clear he had no interest in pursuing that line of work. However, that family wealth means he doesn't need the big jobs. He knows he doesn't need football to survive so he can follow his own principles, where other managers might compromise to stay in their jobs. His football philosophy has always been like Pep Guardiola's and Johan Cruyff's. He likes to attack, to create things on the pitch. I followed PSV Eindhoven for some time when he was the assistant manager there, just as he was Steve McClaren's assistant at FC Twente. He was instrumental at those clubs. He never tried to push in but the managers were so reliant on him because he was tactically so strong. It was a joy for them to have him and that says a lot about him. When he was at Bayern Munich as their reserve-team boss he loved it. It was almost like a dream come true for him to have a manager in Guardiola who was working the same way he wanted to work. He said to me once that he loved spending time with Guardiola, loved talking to him. He had to produce players ready for the first team as the reserve manager so that's why the whole set-up worked for him. Players can find it hard with him because, like Guardiola, he comes across as a bit obsessive. To get a style like you do at Ajax - Dutch Total Football, basically - it needs lots of work and lots of attacking players. It leaves a lot of space and you want your defenders playing really high up. It entails a lot of risk and you have to be a bit of a maniac to instil in your players that every pass has to be just right, that there can be no mistakes. But his man management is excellent and all his players say they have learnt so much from him. Whereas many coaches focus on the first XI, Ten Hag will spend an incredible amount of time on the training pitch. At Manchester United he won't just pay attention to the star players like Cristiano Ronaldo or Harry Maguire, he'll also go to the 19th or 20th most important player. He's taken on players with different characters and he doesn't mind how many hours he has to spend with them, he will give all his time to them. That's where he gets the respect from the players because they see the effort he puts in to improve them individually. Even with those who have the most difficult background - some kind of baggage, maybe - if he thinks the talent is there he'll make sure they fit in. He is not scared to take on the Manchester United job. But he will want to be in a tracksuit many hours a day. He doesn't consider himself an office man - if he did he'd have gone in to his dad's company. He would hate to constantly be on the phone to agents, and I have a feeling that is one of the main discussion points about his potential appointment. That's where he'll want a sporting director or an assistant with the ability to do that. For me, it would be a mistake for him to go down the route of thinking part of his job is fitting into the traditional English way of management. He will not want to go in there thinking he has to take on the whole of Manchester United. He will want to focus on giving the club an identity again - and he will do that best by putting on a tracksuit. Another potential issue is that Ten Hag has never felt that comfortable in front of the camera. That will be a challenge and he might find it difficult to get his message across. If he went to a German club - and there is serious interest there - he'd be totally in his comfort zone because where he lives is on the German border. Everyone in that area has German as a second language. English, however, is anything but his comfort zone and in my opinion a manager who takes charge of one of the biggest clubs in the world based in the UK, with all the publicity and media around him, should be able to command the English language really well. It won't stop him from being successful but it would help enormously if he improved. I understand he's been practising his English a lot. At the beginning of his time with Ajax my own newspaper was very critical of him because of certain tactical choices and the players found it hard to get used to his very long training sessions and long talks on the pitch. Yes, he built a good team but by Dutch standards he was given good players. Immediate success was demanded of him but what bowled people over was how Ajax played in the Champions League in 2018-19 against Real Madrid, winning 4-1 at the Bernabeu to knock them out, and against Juventus in the quarter-finals. But perhaps what impressed the most was that when Ajax sold their best players, Matthijs de Ligt to Juve and Frenkie de Jong to Barcelona, he had given the club and the team such an identity that it was easy for new players to fit in. If United fans want to know about his approach then one reflection from the man himself might be illuminating. His idol was Dutch international Epi Drost, who came from the same area and same club as Ten Hag and was his coach at FC Twente. ""Epi had a soft spot for me because I was by far the youngest in the squad,"" Ten Hag recalled. ""He let me play in the U23 team as a 15-year-old. He was a mega fan of skilful and adventurous football. He would stimulate creativity because that was the most important aspect of the game. I learned so much off him."" If I have to compare him to someone I'd liken him to Ronald Koeman. They both played as central defenders, leaders at the back who oversaw the game and the team from that position. As managers both are massive fans of Total Football but Koeman has never wanted to be as adventurous as Guardiola. If there is one big difference between the Manchester City boss and Ten Hag, it is that the Dutchman has that same slightly more realistic approach that Koeman does. They have one more eye on the defence than Guardiola would. If he does go to Manchester United then the people he works with will quickly learn that he is a very loyal person - that is one of his key characteristics. When he started out in the FC Twente academy at around the age of 14, he was quickly moved up to the U18s and he played for many years with the same guys, most of whom stayed mates with him and still are. But while he was there two of his best friends died, one in a plane crash in Suriname. Andy Scharmin, a boy who was destined to play for the Netherlands,external-link was selected for an exhibition game by Suriname, who didn't have a formal national team, and he chose to go. The plane he was on crashed and killed a large number of the team. He was one of Ten Hag's closest friends - they did everything together. That was a massive upset in his life. Another friend took his own life, and a third suffered a horrific injury. All three had looked destined for an international career. That affected him quite a bit and he did draw inspiration from wanting to succeed where his friends never got the chance to. A lot came from the heartbreak of losing his friends. That still drives him on, even now. ",positive,liverpool,0
6,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61120882,FA Cup semi-final: Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Sadio Mane double helps Jurgen Klopp's side through,"Liverpool survived a late scare to remain on course for an historic quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final with victory over Manchester City at Wembley. If last Sunday's Premier League meeting between the clubs was a classic, this semi-final was effectively decided in a one-sided first 45 minutes, in which a mixture of ruthless finishing and Manchester City mistakes saw Liverpool take a 3-0 lead. A reshuffled City side were unable to recover as Liverpool, having won the Carabao Cup, are now in the FA Cup final too - as well as the last four of the Champions League, while sitting second in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was unable to start Kevin de Bruyne and had Kyle Walker out injured, preferred Zack Steffen to Ederson in goal, a move that back-fired spectacularly. Ibrahima Konate had already headed Liverpool in front after nine minutes when Steffen, trying to repeat the feats of Ederson in the league game between these two clubs, miscontrolled in his six-yard area, allowing Sadio Mane to pounce. Mane beat Steffen with a crisp volley at the end of a superb Liverpool build-up to put Jurgen Klopp's side in complete command at the break but Jack Grealish pulled one back early in the second half and keeper Alisson twice saved crucially from Gabriel Jesus as this semi-final sprang to life. Bernardo Silva pulled another back for City at the start of a tense period of stoppage time but Liverpool survived to face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet at Wembley on Sunday, in the final on 14 May. Liverpool's win keeps them in contention to make history - as no team in English football has won the league title, the two main domestic cup competitions and become champions of Europe in the same season. This was a win built on the foundation of a first half in which their intensity and ruthlessness proved too much for City, whose revamped side looked off the pace and unable to cope with the power of Klopp's side. Konate's power in the air saw him score his third header in his past three starts and Mane's alertness was never going to allow Steffen to get away with his hesitation as he attempted to keep possession in the six-yard area. Ederson had the calmness and expertise to escape almost on his goal-line as Diogo Jota bore down on him during last Sunday's 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium but Steffen showed no such expertise or composure, and paid a heavy price as he was caught. Mane led the Liverpool charge while Thiago was imperious in midfield, his clever pass allowing Mane to volley past Steffen at his near post in the closing moments of the first half for what eventually proved to be the winner. Klopp was elated with his team's performance at the conclusion, although he will have concerns about how they allowed City back into the game through Grealish's goal, conceded two clear chances to Jesus then had to survive the anxiety of four minutes of stoppage time after Silva struck. In the final reckoning, however, Liverpool deserved to reach the final and will present a formidable barrier to either Chelsea or Crystal Palace once the winner of the second semi-final is decided. This was not a good day for Manchester City. It started with a section of their support chanting through the minute's silence to commemorate the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, with City issuing a formal apology to Liverpool after the match had started. In the football context, Guardiola and City were left to regret injuries, a team selection that did not work out and a horribly laboured first 45 minutes that left them with too much to do, despite the brief hope offered by Silva's second goal. City missed the invention of De Bruyne, only fit enough for the bench after suffering an injury in the stormy Champions Leaque quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, and the experience of defender Walker, who was ruled out completely. And Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his FA Cup keeper was not rewarded as the American made that crucial error that allowed Liverpool to build on their fast start. Guardiola will be disappointed but this is a quality side who will now refocus and set sights on the Premier League, where they lead Liverpool by one point, and the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He will hope to have De Bruyne and Walker back fully fit soon because, despite this loss, there is still so much at stake for Guardiola and Manchester City as they remain in a position to achieve stellar things this season.

7,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970965,Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool: Top two draw to maintain pulsating title race,"Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top. Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game. City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.

8,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048518,Manchester United 3-2 Norwich City: Cristiano Ronaldo nets superb hat-trick,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second hat-trick in three Premier League games to boost Manchester United's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League at the expense of relegation-threatened Norwich at Old Trafford. Knowing victory would take them within three points of the top four, Ronaldo appeared to have put United in control when he scored twice in the opening 32 minutes. However, appalling defending from the hosts either side of the interval allowed Norwich to equalise through Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki and for a while Dean Smith's side looked the more likely winners. But after Ralf Rangnick had abandoned his bold tactic of playing without a recognised ball-winner in midfield and replaced Paul Pogba with Juan Mata, Ronaldo drove a free-kick home off the inside of a post 14 minutes from time to secure victory. The 37-year-old is now on 15 Premier League goals for the season, trailing only Mohamed Salah and Son Hueng-min in the standings. He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals. United can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday. For Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it. It is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution? On this occasion, he was certainly the latter. Not that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish. Ronaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul. The winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post. It was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet. The celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith. They also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest. Norwich's opener was a case in point. Pukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards. Pukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level. Milton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards. Ronaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.

9,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048517,Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Brighton: Late Trossard goal stuns sluggish Spurs,"Leandro Trossard's superb late goal gave Brighton a gutsy win that dealt a blow to Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the top four. Following a game of few clear-cut chances, Trossard swerved into the Spurs area in the final minute of normal time before producing a fine finish past Hugo Lloris. Steven Bergwijn then missed a chance to equalise at the start of stoppage time - one of the home side's rare opportunities. Spurs stay in fourth, just ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal, while Brighton - in 10th - are on course for their highest-ever top-flight finish. Graham Potter's side enjoyed the better of a first half where Spurs looked oddly sluggish despite not having played for nearly a week, but after the hosts appeared to improve in the second half, they were undone by a combination of poor defending and fine skill from Trossard. The Belgian eluded Eric Dier before opening up his body to send a shot with the outside of his right foot low into the far corner of the net. Spurs did not look anything like the side that came into the game on a run of four consecutive wins -which had started with a 2-0 victory at Brighton, and in which they had scored 14 goals and conceded just two. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were shackled effectively Brighton, with the South Korean not managing a shot on target until nearly an hour in - with an effort that was comfortably blocked in the Albion area. They were slow out of the blocks and while more fired up after the break, presumably after manager Antonio Conte had aired his views to the team at half-time, they lacked the kind of sharpness required to unlock the Brighton defence. It was an opportunity missed for Spurs, as rivals Arsenal lost at Southampton later on Saturday, while Manchester United moved above the Gunners and just three points behind in fifth with a win against Norwich. Spurs face Liverpool on 7 May and then their north London rivals five days later in games that could decide whether they play in the Champions League next season. Brighton's two wins in north London in a week will have banished memories of a worrying slide down the table caused by six straight defeats through February and March. Trossard had put Albion on the way to a memorable win at Emirates Stadium seven days earlier, and the 27-year-old's sixth goal of the season ensured his side will also have the best-ever haul of away points in the Premier League. They have earned 25 of their 40 points so far on the road, and they pulled together impressively to execute Potter's plan to frustrate and ultimately deny Spurs. Their 29 goals scored so far is the lowest of any team in the top half of the table, but they seem on target for the club's best-ever finish in the top flight - and with games to come against Manchester United and West Ham, they could still have a say on how the European places pan out.

10,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048522,Southampton 1-0 Arsenal: Jan Bednarek strike condemns top-four chasing Gunners to third straight defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted his side's form was ""a real worry"" after Southampton won at St Mary's to inflict a third successive defeat on the top-four chasing Gunners. Jan Bednarek scored the game's only goal late in the first half after the visitors had failed to adequately deal with a Saints corner. Bukayo Saka was denied from point-blank range by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with the score still goalless, but further clear-cut openings proved hard to come by for Arsenal until the closing stages of the second half. Emile Smith Rowe forced another fine save out of Forster after latching on to Yan Valery's attempted clearance, before Martin Odegaard dragged a left-footed shot wide of the near post after cutting in from the right. Forster produced yet another impressive stop to deny Granit Xhaka late on as Arsenal desperately piled forward in search of an equaliser. ""We've lost games in different ways - to lose the way we did today is difficult to explain,"" Arteta told BBC Match of the Day. ""If you saw the game, you'd say Arsenal had won comfortably. ""You have to put the ball in the net. You have to make the decisive moments count to win football matches and at the moment we're not doing that."" The Gunners remain three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who were beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - although they do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Southampton, meanwhile, climb to 12th after claiming their first league win since February. Following lacklustre displays at Crystal Palace and at home to Brighton last weekend, Gunners fans may have hoped this trip to St Mary's would prove to be an ideal fixture to reignite their top-four push. Saints had lost five of their past six games in all competitions before Saturday and conceded 19 goals in the process - including a 6-0 capitulation at home to Chelsea in their last match. They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League. The hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery. Although the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining. When Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot. Forster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide. ""It wasn't so sure he could play today,"" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display. ""He had a problem with his ankle, but we needed a goalkeeper like him in such a game today. ""The most important thing is the clean sheet after six or seven games [without one]. We've played much better games, especially with the ball, but today the target was a different one."" Arsenal still have a game in hand on Spurs in fourth but with matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham coming up in the next fortnight, this will go down as a missed opportunity for Arteta and his players.

Leandro Trossard's curling first-half finish - after a fine assist by the impressive Enock Mwepu - gave Graham Potter's side something to build on. And after Gabriel Martinelli appeared to have headed Arsenal level moments before the break - only for a four-minute VAR check to rule him offside - Brighton remained solid before doubling their lead with a superb Mwepu finish. The Zambia midfielder side-footed home with power from the edge of the box to cap a rounded individual display and produce a look of disbelief on the face of Arteta. ""We made it really difficult for ourselves,"" Arteta told BBC Sport. ""We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward. ""There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half."" Arteta's side rallied late on with Martin Odegaard firing home from range via a deflection but they stay fifth - three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 4-0 at Aston Villa later on Saturday - while Potter's Brighton move up to 11th after just a fourth win in 26 league games. Were it not for their fine start to the season, Brighton might well have been worrying about escaping the bottom three, such has been their recent run of results. Potter's side had scored just one goal in their previous seven league games and failed to find the net with 31 attempts in last week's 0-0 draw with Norwich. This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to ""hang on and suffer"". Arsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an ""unacceptable"" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace. It took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages. Lewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward. Mwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch. Potter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably. The game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum. When they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved. Odegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve. They saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win. Arsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.

12,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048517,Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Brighton: Late Trossard goal stuns sluggish Spurs,"Leandro Trossard's superb late goal gave Brighton a gutsy win that dealt a blow to Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the top four. Following a game of few clear-cut chances, Trossard swerved into the Spurs area in the final minute of normal time before producing a fine finish past Hugo Lloris. Steven Bergwijn then missed a chance to equalise at the start of stoppage time - one of the home side's rare opportunities. Spurs stay in fourth, just ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal, while Brighton - in 10th - are on course for their highest-ever top-flight finish. Graham Potter's side enjoyed the better of a first half where Spurs looked oddly sluggish despite not having played for nearly a week, but after the hosts appeared to improve in the second half, they were undone by a combination of poor defending and fine skill from Trossard. The Belgian eluded Eric Dier before opening up his body to send a shot with the outside of his right foot low into the far corner of the net. Spurs did not look anything like the side that came into the game on a run of four consecutive wins -which had started with a 2-0 victory at Brighton, and in which they had scored 14 goals and conceded just two. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were shackled effectively Brighton, with the South Korean not managing a shot on target until nearly an hour in - with an effort that was comfortably blocked in the Albion area. They were slow out of the blocks and while more fired up after the break, presumably after manager Antonio Conte had aired his views to the team at half-time, they lacked the kind of sharpness required to unlock the Brighton defence. It was an opportunity missed for Spurs, as rivals Arsenal lost at Southampton later on Saturday, while Manchester United moved above the Gunners and just three points behind in fifth with a win against Norwich. Spurs face Liverpool on 7 May and then their north London rivals five days later in games that could decide whether they play in the Champions League next season. Brighton's two wins in north London in a week will have banished memories of a worrying slide down the table caused by six straight defeats through February and March. Trossard had put Albion on the way to a memorable win at Emirates Stadium seven days earlier, and the 27-year-old's sixth goal of the season ensured his side will also have the best-ever haul of away points in the Premier League. They have earned 25 of their 40 points so far on the road, and they pulled together impressively to execute Potter's plan to frustrate and ultimately deny Spurs. Their 29 goals scored so far is the lowest of any team in the top half of the table, but they seem on target for the club's best-ever finish in the top flight - and with games to come against Manchester United and West Ham, they could still have a say on how the European places pan out.

13,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048519,Watford 1-2 Brentford: Jansson grabs Bees win late on,"Pontus Jansson's last-minute header broke Watford hearts and gave Brentford a third successive Premier League win for the first time. It looked like Emmanuel Dennis' powerful strike after the break had secured a point for Watford, but the final result pushes them even closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Christian Norgaard had put the Bees ahead inside 15 minutes. It was a game of small margins as moments before Jansson's strike, Imran Louza had missed a chance to win with the goal gaping. The result leaves Watford in 19th, six points adrift of safety having played two more games than Everton. Brentford took the lead through Norgaard; Kristoffer Ajer flicked on Ethan Pinnock's long throw, and the Dane was there to apply the close-range finish. There was a stagnant feel to the game for much of the first half. Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves. But the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1. Initially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus. The home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail. There was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues. Boss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position. In Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded. They hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again. Hodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side. ""Someone up there doesn't like us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have. ""We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw. I didn't think we deserved to be contemplating another home defeat; taking the second half, that is probably the best we've offered our home fans. That doesn't say much."" Relegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season. Christian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed. Thomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again. ""[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,"" he said. ""The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'. ""I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic. Pontus [Jansson] has been very dangerous, big determination, very disciplined. I'm very happy he got this goal.""

14,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61048518,Manchester United 3-2 Norwich City: Cristiano Ronaldo nets superb hat-trick,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second hat-trick in three Premier League games to boost Manchester United's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League at the expense of relegation-threatened Norwich at Old Trafford. Knowing victory would take them within three points of the top four, Ronaldo appeared to have put United in control when he scored twice in the opening 32 minutes. However, appalling defending from the hosts either side of the interval allowed Norwich to equalise through Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki and for a while Dean Smith's side looked the more likely winners. But after Ralf Rangnick had abandoned his bold tactic of playing without a recognised ball-winner in midfield and replaced Paul Pogba with Juan Mata, Ronaldo drove a free-kick home off the inside of a post 14 minutes from time to secure victory. The 37-year-old is now on 15 Premier League goals for the season, trailing only Mohamed Salah and Son Hueng-min in the standings. He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals. United can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday. For Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it. It is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution? On this occasion, he was certainly the latter. Not that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish. Ronaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul. The winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post. It was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet. The celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith. They also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest. Norwich's opener was a case in point. Pukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards. Pukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level. Milton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards. Ronaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.

15,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61120882,FA Cup semi-final: Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Sadio Mane double helps Jurgen Klopp's side through,"Liverpool survived a late scare to remain on course for an historic quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final with victory over Manchester City at Wembley. If last Sunday's Premier League meeting between the clubs was a classic, this semi-final was effectively decided in a one-sided first 45 minutes, in which a mixture of ruthless finishing and Manchester City mistakes saw Liverpool take a 3-0 lead. A reshuffled City side were unable to recover as Liverpool, having won the Carabao Cup, are now in the FA Cup final too - as well as the last four of the Champions League, while sitting second in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was unable to start Kevin de Bruyne and had Kyle Walker out injured, preferred Zack Steffen to Ederson in goal, a move that back-fired spectacularly. Ibrahima Konate had already headed Liverpool in front after nine minutes when Steffen, trying to repeat the feats of Ederson in the league game between these two clubs, miscontrolled in his six-yard area, allowing Sadio Mane to pounce. Mane beat Steffen with a crisp volley at the end of a superb Liverpool build-up to put Jurgen Klopp's side in complete command at the break but Jack Grealish pulled one back early in the second half and keeper Alisson twice saved crucially from Gabriel Jesus as this semi-final sprang to life. Bernardo Silva pulled another back for City at the start of a tense period of stoppage time but Liverpool survived to face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet at Wembley on Sunday, in the final on 14 May. Liverpool's win keeps them in contention to make history - as no team in English football has won the league title, the two main domestic cup competitions and become champions of Europe in the same season. This was a win built on the foundation of a first half in which their intensity and ruthlessness proved too much for City, whose revamped side looked off the pace and unable to cope with the power of Klopp's side. Konate's power in the air saw him score his third header in his past three starts and Mane's alertness was never going to allow Steffen to get away with his hesitation as he attempted to keep possession in the six-yard area. Ederson had the calmness and expertise to escape almost on his goal-line as Diogo Jota bore down on him during last Sunday's 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium but Steffen showed no such expertise or composure, and paid a heavy price as he was caught. Mane led the Liverpool charge while Thiago was imperious in midfield, his clever pass allowing Mane to volley past Steffen at his near post in the closing moments of the first half for what eventually proved to be the winner. Klopp was elated with his team's performance at the conclusion, although he will have concerns about how they allowed City back into the game through Grealish's goal, conceded two clear chances to Jesus then had to survive the anxiety of four minutes of stoppage time after Silva struck. In the final reckoning, however, Liverpool deserved to reach the final and will present a formidable barrier to either Chelsea or Crystal Palace once the winner of the second semi-final is decided. This was not a good day for Manchester City. It started with a section of their support chanting through the minute's silence to commemorate the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, with City issuing a formal apology to Liverpool after the match had started. In the football context, Guardiola and City were left to regret injuries, a team selection that did not work out and a horribly laboured first 45 minutes that left them with too much to do, despite the brief hope offered by Silva's second goal. City missed the invention of De Bruyne, only fit enough for the bench after suffering an injury in the stormy Champions Leaque quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, and the experience of defender Walker, who was ruled out completely. And Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his FA Cup keeper was not rewarded as the American made that crucial error that allowed Liverpool to build on their fast start. Guardiola will be disappointed but this is a quality side who will now refocus and set sights on the Premier League, where they lead Liverpool by one point, and the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He will hope to have De Bruyne and Walker back fully fit soon because, despite this loss, there is still so much at stake for Guardiola and Manchester City as they remain in a position to achieve stellar things this season.

16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61116929,Burnley sack manager Sean Dyche with eight games left of Premier League season,"Burnley have sacked manager Sean Dyche with eight games left of their season in the Premier League. The Clarets, who have lost five of their last six top-flight games, are 18th and four points from safety. Dyche was the Premier League's longest serving manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012. Burnley chairman Alan Pace said it was ""an incredibly difficult decision"" to part company with the 50-year-old, but ""we feel a change is needed"". Dyche's last game in charge of Burnley saw them lose 2-0 to Norwich City, who are bottom of the Premier League. Assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have also left the club. ""Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,"" said Pace. ""During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. ""However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. ""Under-23s coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee have been asked to take charge of the team for Sunday's game with West Ham United. ""The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course."" Dyche had signed a new four-year contract until 2025 with Burnley in September last year. During his spell at the club he guided them to two promotions from the Championship and two top-half Premier League finishes. He also helped Burnley achieve their first European qualification in 51 years courtesy of leading them to a commendable seventh place in the Premier League in 2017-18. However, the Clarets have won just four Premier League games this season, the worst win record in the league. ""It's massive news, no one really expected it,"" reacted former Burnley midfielder Paul Weller. ""He has been backed by the board for so long, so to do it so late in the season is a really big surprise. ""To do it so late in the week is leaving it really tight because there's a massive game coming up against West Ham on Sunday. There's a big eight games left and we need somebody in there quick."" Weller added: ""Sean has had to take the ultimate punishment. ""What he has done at Burnley is unbelievable, he has done it on a shoestring [budget]. He's not been supported by any of the chairmen financially like other Premier League managers have been. ""It's been a really difficult season and I think that's why everybody is so surprised because the fans love him. ""Even though we are struggling, we are down at the bottom and it's looking like relegation, Burnley fans were still loyal to him."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Burnley are in their sixth successive season in the Premier League, which is their longest run in the top flight since their heydays in the 1960s. It is a brave owner of any football club who just accepts relegation without doing something to stop it. Alan Pace, the owner and chairman of Burnley, is a relatively new owner and he has decided to act. The impact has to be absolutely immediate and I guess that means Burnley picking up points immediately. They start against West Ham on Sunday, then Southampton and Wolves. Sean Dyche is highly employable. Any like-minded club such as Burnley, Dyche will be top of the people who will be to be favourites to take over that job. He has been linked with many Premier League jobs over the years. He has always responded to those rumours by saying he was at Burnley - now he is not. I don't think it will be long until he gets another job. Clearly the problem for Burnley is getting another manager for themselves. ",negative,liverpool,0
17,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033835,Leyton Orient 3-0 Scunthorpe United: Iron relegated after 72 years in EFL,"Scunthorpe United's 72-year spell in the English Football League will come to an end as a 3-0 loss at Leyton Orient confirmed their relegation from League Two. Paul Smyth cut in from the right wing, skipped past Ryan Delaney and arrowed a low shot past Rory Watson's near post to put the O's in front early on. Orient doubled their lead six minutes later as Theo Archibald curled a left-footed effort into the far corner of the net from the corner of the 18-yard box. Ruel Sotiriou found himself unmarked at the far post to head in Jordan Brown's deep cross for Orient's third as the Iron's will buckled. Sotiriou almost got his second seven minutes after the break, but he hit the post after Brown's through ball, while Watson did well to deny Archibald after an hour and Hector Kyprianou crashed an effort off the Scunthorpe crossbar six minutes later. The loss - Scunthorpe's 26th in 42 league games - leaves the Iron 16 points from safety with 12 left to play for. Scunthorpe manager Keith Hill, who has seen his side win just two games in the 28 he has taken charge of since November, said he is upset that his side will be playing in the National League next season. ""I'm really sad. I am angry. I don't want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it's not stood me in good stead, but I'm very, very disappointed,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. ""I've been disappointed a lot of times, but I've got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. ""It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn't been good enough. ""Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you're staring down the barrel of relegation. ""We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don't think we've been competitive enough throughout the course of the season."" In truth the writing has been on the wall for the North Lincolnshire side for the majority of a campaign where they have won just four league matches. Since beating fellow strugglers Oldham 3-1 at Boundary Park on 26 December the Iron have won just once - a 1-0 win over Walsall on 8 February - and this loss at Brisbane Road was their seventh successive defeat. They finished just one place above the League Two relegation zone in 2020-21 and their cause this campaign was hindered when they were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer. Boss Neil Cox was sacked in November with the club bottom of League Two and replaced by former Rochdale, Barnsley and Bolton manager Hill. Hill lost just one of his first seven matches in charge but they never built up any momentum, and last spent a day outside the bottom two on 28 December. Relegation out of the Football League will be hard to swallow for Iron fans, who saw their team play in the Championship in 2011 and compete in the League One play-offs as recently as 2018. However, they were then relegated to League Two in 2018-19 and finished 20th in their first season back in the fourth tier. With hopes of EFL survival drifting badly, boss Hill said after a home defeat by fellow strugglers Barrow on 15 March that he had to change ""the culture"" at the club. ""I'm trying to navigate this football club through some stormy moments to where I can build a positive future in a positive environment,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. Though there is now certainty of what level the Iron will be playing in next season, the club's next move behind the scenes is unknown. Owner Peter Swann resigned as chairman last month and has acknowledged he is looking for someone to buy the club from him.external-link Lee Turnbull has returned to the club in the role of chief operating officer and Hill will now hope that he is given the chance to turn the club's fortunes around. BBC Radio Humberside's Mike White It's a sad, miserable, heart-breaking day for Scunthorpe United. A club with a storied history that can list legendary England internationals like Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan among its most notable former players, in addition to club icons such as Jack Brownsword and Barrie Thomas, and even dual-sport star Ian Botham. In recent times, the Iron punched above their weight in the Championship in the mid-to-late 2000s and flirted with it again under the management of Graham Alexander. Many fans believe his 2018 sacking was the start of the decline that's brought them to this point. Recruitment has been questioned in the past few years too, with many fans suggesting now-former chairman - but still club owner for the time being - Peter Swann had too much input, something he has refuted on several occasions. Whilst some fans are angered by the current state of the club and this situation, many almost seem numb to it now and were resigned to their fate a long time before the dreaded 'R' was placed next to their name on the league table. And despite the consistent positivity from manager Keith Hill about the future of the club, I'm not sure the majority of Iron supporters share that sentiment as they've seen that the National League can quite easily turn into a giant abyss that has swallowed up clubs without a hint or whisper of a return to the Football League. Maybe recent talk and suggestion of a takeover could provide the required impetus needed to at least provide the right resources to Hill and his team - and breathe new life back into a club in desperate need of it - but that will have to wait for another day.

18,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.

19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61067661,Real Madrid 2-3 Chelsea (Agg: 5-4 aet): Blues suffer agonising Champions League exit,"Chelsea's reign as European champions came to an agonising end despite beating Real Madrid on a night of high drama at the Bernabeu Stadium. In a Champions League epic, Mason Mount's wonderful finish and Antonio Rudiger's powerful header wiped out Real's 3-1 first-leg advantage and brought the quarter-final tie level in Spain's capital. Thomas Tuchel's side were outstanding throughout and Timo Werner's clever finish from an angle put them ahead for the first time on aggregate and within sight of a place in the semi-finals. But substitute Rodrygo - after a stunning pass by Luka Modric - forced extra time with a volleyed finish before Karim Benzema, a hat-trick hero in the first leg at Stamford Bridge six days earlier, headed the decisive goal in the 96th minute to send Real through 5-4 on aggregate. Benzema, who had earlier headed against the bar on a rollercoaster night, was unmarked when he scored to break Chelsea's hearts after Rudiger slipped inside the box. Even after what turned out to be the clincher, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho went close to forcing a penalty shootout. In the end Chelsea, who played superbly, were made to pay for their first-leg performance as Tuchel's side fell just short of producing one of the great comebacks in the competition. Many of Chelsea's players slumped to the ground at the end of 120 gripping minutes after pushing record 13-time winners Real - who will face Manchester City or Atletico Madrid in the last four - all the way. Tuchel had said on the eve of this game that Chelsea's progression into the semi-finals would be akin to the best Hollywood script. His players came close to producing a blockbuster in their first game at the Bernabeu in European competition as they showed incredible fight and belief - ingredients which were missing from their poor performance in the first leg. This breathless game had everything and more, including a Marcos Alonso goal at 2-0 ruled out by the video assistant referee for handball. While Tuchel will be delighted with the way his players responded, there will be concern at how much the energy-sapping 120 minutes has taken out of them. Chelsea do not have long to recover from going out of Europe as they prepare to make a second visit of the season to Wembley. They face Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST) - a competition that offers them their last chance of landing a major domestic trophy. Despite enjoying success in the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup, they lost a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in the Premier League with just eight matches left.

20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963798,Southampton 0-6 Chelsea: Saints blown away by devastating Blues display,"Chelsea put a terrible week behind them to return to winning ways in devastating style with a six-goal demolition of Southampton. Having been beaten 4-1 at home to Brentford in the Premier League and then suffering a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid, Chelsea bounced back in a manner that will give Thomas Tuchel encouragement his side can salvage their Champions League tie in Spain next week. Tuchel said before kick-off that ""things are upside down"" after two damaging results but his players responded by hitting the woodwork three times and scoring four in an astonishing first half at St Mary's Stadium. Timo Werner hit the post and then headed against the bar inside the opening seven minutes before Marcos Alonso fired the visitors ahead after Mason Mount's assist. England midfielder Mount's clean finish from outside the box doubled the lead and then Werner was thwarted by Fraser Forster's fine save as Southampton unravelled in front of their own fans. Werner was soon celebrating his first Premier League goal for six months after bursting through and finishing before Kai Havertz made it 4-0 with a tap-in after Germany team-mate Werner hit the woodwork for a third time. Southampton were blown away and it required a remarkable one-handed stop by Forster to prevent an own goal by Mohammed Salisu before half-time. However, the Saints did concede a fifth in the 49th minute, Werner tapping home his second after N'Golo Kante had been thwarted. Mount made it six from close range on an embarrassing afternoon for Ralph Hasenhuttl and his Southampton players. This was Chelsea back to their clinical best as they took the Saints apart in destructive fashion. Yet Tuchel will be just as pleased with the clean sheet after Chelsea conceded seven times in the previous two games to leave confidence on the floor. Despite the absence of £97.5m forward Romelu Lukaku because of injury and captain Cesar Azpilicueta after a positive coronavirus test, they got back on track before another big week that will help shape their season. They face a huge challenge to turn around their Champions League quarter-final with Real in the Bernabeu on Tuesday before heading to Wembley to face Crystal Palace in next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final - their most realistic hope of a major domestic trophy as it stands. Werner could yet play a big part in how Chelsea's season finishes. Without a Premier League goal since scoring against Southampton last October, he was back to his very best against Saints and should have finished with a hat-trick. The first of his two goals was magnificent with the former RB Leipzig player having too much pace for the chasing Jan Bednarek before going round Forster and finishing. This was a sorry performance by Saints on an afternoon which revived painful memories of those two 9-0 defeats against Manchester United in February 2021 and Leicester in October 2019 under Hasenhuttl. From the opening minute it was far too easy for Chelsea and but for Forster, who produced a string of fine stops as Chelsea peppered his goal with 14 attempts on target, they would have suffered an even more embarrassing defeat. The Saints fans who stayed to the bitter end made their feelings known after this utter capitulation signalled a fourth straight home defeat in all competitions. Fortunately Southampton appear safe in the table. They are 12 points clear of the relegation zone after enjoying several highs this season, including twice coming from behind to win at Tottenham and holding leaders Manchester City home and away. But this was definitely a day to forget as they surrendered without a fight.

21,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970968,Brentford 2-0 West Ham United: Hosts deliver huge blow to Hammers' top-four hopes,"Brentford delivered a huge blow to West Ham's top-four hopes as the Bees moved further clear of the relegation places with victory in west London. Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney saw Thomas Frank's side climb to 13th in the table, 12 points clear of the bottom three, to all but confirm their Premier League safety. Mbeumo fired in from Toney's pass shortly after half-time, before turning provider for his team-mate as Toney headed in after 64 minutes. ""I'm very proud. It was a top performance against a very good side who are in the quarter-final of the Europa League and fighting for a Champions League spot,"" said manager Frank. ""It was close to a complete performance. The way we did it shows how far we've come. It's a combination of a top performance and a good win."" He added: ""Of course I looked at the table, but I want to focus on the next game."" The hosts had appeared the more likely to break the deadlock before half-time, but the heavily involved Mbeumo headed at Lukasz Fabianski and also saw a powerful strike pushed away by the West Ham goalkeeper. The visitors managed only one shot on target - a first-half Tomas Soucek header - in a subdued display, while Kurt Zouma was forced off early with an ankle problem ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg in Lyon. The Hammers remain sixth, six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football, having also played a game more than Spurs. There was no shortage of motivation for West Ham, after defeats for fellow top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Manchester United on Saturday left the fight for the European positions wide open. But, with the game falling between two huge meetings with Lyon, the Hammers struggled against a Brentford side full of confidence following their memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea last week. Instead, it was the hosts who maintained their fine form at the end of their first Premier League season, deservedly securing a fourth win in five league games. That upturn in results has coincided with the signing of Christian Eriksen, who once again produced a superb midfield display to offer the base for Brentford's superior attacking output. The hosts had been by far the more fluent in the final third in the opening 45 minutes, recording nine shots to the Hammers' two, but Mbeumo in particular was unable to capitalise with any of his five attempts. They made their chances count in the second half, though, as the 22-year-old Mbeumo seized his first opportunity after the restart, before his looping cross allowed Toney to put the game beyond West Ham. David Moyes called on Said Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic from the bench in the hope of inspiring a fightback, with Benrahma seeing a deflected effort drop on to the roof of the net. Brentford had further chances to extend their advantage too, Mbeumo notably shooting over at close range, but their misses did not prove costly as another excellent result was secured. It is now all eyes on Lyon for West Ham, who must rest up and regroup quickly as they attempt to reach the club's first European semi-final since 1976. ""I don't have any complaints at all, we weren't really at it from the start,"" said West Ham boss Moyes. ""There are mitigating circumstances. We had a tough game on Thursday and the Thursday-Sunday schedule is not ideal. For the most part this season we've been very good but today felt like one too many.""

22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963791,Everton 1-0 Manchester United: Anthony Gordon strike boosts Toffees' survival hopes,"Everton secured what could prove a priceless victory in their battle to avoid relegation as lacklustre Manchester United were beaten at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard's side were plunged into even deeper crisis when they lost at fellow strugglers Burnley in midweek to leave them facing the prospect of dropping into the bottom three this weekend if results went against them. In a game low on quality but high in tension, Everton's victory came courtesy of Anthony Gordon's 27th-minute drive, which took a heavy deflection off United captain Harry Maguire to leave keeper David de Gea wrong-footed. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford made two important early saves from Marcus Rashford and a vital late block from Cristiano Ronaldo, but there was rarely any sense of siege as United lacked urgency, failing to break through in another blow to their hopes of making the Premier League's top four. This could be a huge result in Everton's season, stopping the rot and lifting some of those dark clouds that were starting to gather over Goodison. Everton's win was as far from a classic as it is possible to be but in the wider context it could mean more than so many others this season. Frank Lampard's side remain in trouble but the psychological lift provided by this victory, which removes the prospect of dropping into the bottom three for now at least, saw an explosion of joy around this famous old stadium when referee Jon Moss blew the final whistle. Everton dug deep for victory and had several figures who personified exactly what they will need if they are to maintain their Premier League status. It was fitting that Gordon was the match-winner, the local hero loved by Everton fans for his tireless energy and invention. The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward. Richarlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium. And, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break. The deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued. Manchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them. United's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles. It seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans. Everton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season. The passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance. It was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it. Ronaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance. If, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on.

23,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970974,Leicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall stars in hard-earned win,"Leicester continued their fine run of recent form as homegrown talent Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall played a starring role in a hard-earned win over Crystal Palace. The Foxes started slowly at the King Power Stadium but Dewsbury-Hall carved Palace open with a superb ball for Ademola Lookman to fire home, before whipping his own finish high into the net six minutes later. ""It means so much,"" he said of his first Premier League goal. ""It's a dream come true to score in the Premier League. I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today."" The 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week. Palace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match. Zaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound. It prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors. A closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes. Leicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign. Throw in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy. And Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited. But the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second. The 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints. ""Since he's broken into the team I felt throughout the season it was what we were missing,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of Dewsbury-Hall. ""The team was missing intensity and pressure and he has brought that. He typifies everything we want to be. He has good industry, a cultured left foot and he's very honest."" Palace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in. Dewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up. When they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final. After scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.

24,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970969,Norwich City 2-0 Burnley: Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki keep Canaries' hope alive,"Bottom club Norwich City kept alive their slim hopes of avoiding a quick-fire return to the Championship and dealt a blow to fellow strugglers Burnley with a crucial win at Carrow Road. Pierre Lees-Melou's first goal since signing from Nice last July and Teemu Pukki's 86th-minute finish settled a tense relegation scrap - and earned the Canaries only their fifth Premier League victory since winning promotion last season. French midfielder Lees-Melou's ninth-minute deflected shot, which went in off the post, put the hosts on their way before Pukki drilled home the second to give Norwich a glimmer of hope of staying up, with Dean Smith's side now seven points from safety with seven matches left. Burnley had their moments, with Maxwel Cornet, the match-winning hero against Everton in midweek, missing a glorious chance from three yards out. In what was a must-win game, Norwich's defence came under relentless pressure at times but recorded back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time since October. ""We know it's hard and still a mountain but we have seven games to go now, so if you put a few wins together the table looks different,"" said Norwich boss Smith. The result leaves the Clarets 18th in the table, four points from safety with eight matches remaining. ""It's still the same challenge but a game down,"" Burnley manager Sean Dyche said. With struggling Everton beating Manchester United on Saturday, Norwich started Sunday's game 10 points from safety with eight matches left. But Smith's side passed the pressure test in style with a first win in nine league games. It will still require a monumental effort for them to survive. Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away). ""We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,"" added Smith. ""Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results."" Even before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs. Just as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back. Norwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley. In the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win. Cornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton. He looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season. ""We can't miss chances like that,"" Dyche said. ""He's done well for us this season. But we have to take the game on and be better than that in the front third."" Earlier, Cornet was denied by Tim Krul, but the Norwich keeper was not tested nearly enough in what was a high-stakes game. Dyche will still believe his side can climb out of trouble in the closing weeks, and they still have to meet fellow strugglers Watford on 30 April. But despite beating Everton on Wednesday, Burnley's task has become more difficult after this defeat at Carrow Road. ""It was a huge setback after a huge step forward,"" added Dyche. ""It might come easier in a strange way when people write you off. Virtually everyone will think we're done, but we don't think that.""

25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60950088,Newcastle 1-0 Wolves: Chris Wood penalty earns key win for Eddie Howe's side,"Newcastle took a huge step towards Premier League survival as Chris Wood's penalty proved enough to beat a blunt Wolves side at St James' Park. The January signing slammed home the second-half winner at the Gallowgate End after being fouled by Wolves keeper Jose Sa at the end of a flowing team move. VAR checked if Sa had made adequate contact, after an earlier review had denied Wood in the first half, when he saw a goal chalked off because team-mate Bruno Guimaraes was narrowly offside in the build-up. Wolves failed to touch the ball in the Newcastle area in a dire opening half and manager Bruno Lage will wonder why it took until the 80th minute for his side to work home keeper Martin Dubravka when Fabio Silva forced a diving save. Newcastle - who saw Allan Saint-Maximin fire over the bar before Wood's goal and Guimaraes go close to adding a second - thoroughly deserved to end a run of three straight defeats with this win. It moves them 10 points clear of the relegation zone - though 18th-placed Burnley have two games in hand - while Wolves stay eighth and lose crucial ground in their push for a Europa League spot. ""It has put us in a stronger position but I still think we have work to do,"" boss Eddie Howe told BBC Sport. ""The home games are key for us but we want to pick up points wherever we go. ""At this stage of the season, it is about results. We are well aware we need to continue to get points. I think it's results over performances at the moment. There will be a time when we can evolve."" Howe had reason to be ecstatic, having taken over a side who were 19th in the table and five points from safety in November. The Newcastle boss has a quote which reads ""make each day your masterpiece"" on a wall in his office. This display was by no means joyful or pretty in its crafting, but it was one where Newcastle were always the likelier winners thanks to their consistent effort and sporadic quality across the 90 minutes. Wolves were fortunate when VAR chalked off Wood's close-range finish in the first half. Guimaraes raced on to a superb flick by substitute Miguel Almiron - on for the injured Ryan Fraser - and was fractionally offside. In the aftermath, Wolves captain Conor Coady could be seen screaming at team-mates in a bid to rise some kind of energy and application. It never really arrived and, gradually, the home side started to create half-chances after the break until Saint-Maximin and Joelinton combined to send Wood clear in the game's key moment. Wood's finish ensured Newcastle beat a side in the top half of the table for the first time this season and also carried them to a fourth successive home win - their best run since March 2019. Lage was left wondering how his side - with eight away wins to their name this season - could be so poor, particularly in the first half. ""In the second half we had clearer ideas,"" said Lage. ""The first five minutes of the second half, we were more aggressive in the final third than in the first 45 minutes. I think we missed a big opportunity."" Wolves are one win away from equalling their record mark of 16 victories in a Premier League-era top-flight season - set in 2018-19 - but their first-half display here set the tone for a night of despair. They delivered one cross in the first 45 minutes, compared with 14 after the break. In the opening half they completed 31% of their passes in the final third compared to 74% in the second period. It was a bemusing showing. A Europa League campaign is still well within reach but Wolves will need to find much more than they did here on a night where Newcastle took advantage to earn a key win in their bid for survival.

26,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963795,Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Son Heung-min hat-trick keeps Spurs on track for top four,"Son Heung-min's hat-trick kept Tottenham's Premier League top-four destiny in their own hands as Spurs produced a masterclass in clinical finishing to thrash Aston Villa. After the South Korea striker steered the visitors into an early lead, Spurs withstood a Villa onslaught to remain ahead at the interval with veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris making a string of superb saves. But they cruised to victory with a breathtaking, counter-attacking second-half performance as Son swept home two more fine finishes, either side of an equally elegant strike from Dejan Kulusevski. A fourth-successive win moved Antonio Conte's side three points above north London rivals Arsenal - beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - in the race for the fourth Champions League spot. Villa, meanwhile, were left to reflect on a fourth-straight defeat, despite dominating long spells of the first half, as returning striker Danny Ings wasted two glorious chances to bring them level. While the scoreline failed to reflect the overall balance of play - or chances created - in the West Midlands, it was Spurs who possessed the difference-making individual talents. Chief among them, of course, was Son, who seemingly never ceases to amaze - his first and third goals beautifully struck first-time efforts that both went in off the post, with a composed one-on-one finish to beat Emi Martinez in between. On-loan Juventus midfielder Kulusevski again impressed, teeing up Son for his hat-trick after firing an accurate finish through the legs of Tyrone Mings and past Martinez to put the result beyond doubt. Harry Kane took a back seat but was still involved in three of the goals, flicking on headers in the build-up to two, but Lloris was arguably Spurs' stand-out performer. The France goalkeeper made excellent first-half stops to thwart Jacob Ramsey's solo run and shot, John McGinn's 25-yard thunderbolt and Philippe Coutinho's cheeky near-post free-kick. Only three weeks ago, Spurs sat eighth, six points off fourth place - a position they now proudly hold, even if Arsenal do have a game in hand. Tottenham, though, have a superior goal difference - boosted by this win - and an easier run-in on paper with Brighton, Brentford, Burnley and Norwich among their final seven opponents, while Arsenal meet Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham among their next four. Tottenham are very much becoming Villa's bogey side - they have won 14 of the past 18 Premier League meetings between the sides and this was their seventh-straight success at Villa Park. Despite Son's early opener, it did not look like ending that way for the majority of the first half though as Villa laid siege to the visitors' goal. While Lloris deserves the plaudits for his impressive display, the hosts were also guilty of profligate finishing, with Ings - still yet to truly find his feet at Villa with just five goals since his £25m summer move from Southampton - the chief culprit. Twice he was afforded excellent chances on the volley - one from a dinked Coutinho set-piece and then an Ollie Watkins flick-on - but he scuffed both, one straight at Lloris and the other badly wide. Watkins also sent a free header over from six yards as Steven Gerrard suffered his heaviest defeat as Villa boss.

Spurs lost for the fourth time in five Premier League games as Ben Mee's 71st-minute header boosted Burnley's battle against relegation. At the final whistle, a disappointed Conte, 52, headed straight to the dressing room on his own. And he said: ""I came here to help the club and if the problem could be the coach I'm ready to go, no problem."" Conte emerged for his post-match media engagements, but refused to talk about the game and instead spoke about his current plight. ""I am not used to this situation. I am trying everything but the situation is not changing,"" added the Italian. ""I am available and open with the club to do what the club wants. ""I want to help the club, I work a lot, I work very hard. I am giving 20 hours a day to Tottenham and the other four hours I sleep but it is not enough. ""The performance can be good and the commitment was good but we lost. For me the situation is unacceptable. To lose four of five [games] for Tottenham has to be a disaster. ""I came in to try to improve the situation. Maybe in this moment I am not so good to improve the situation. I am too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way. ""For sure we are to speak and have a conversation with the club to try and find the best solution to help the team not have this type of situation. ""It is the right moment to make assessment.

But with Spurs in eighth place and seven points off fourth, his future is now uncertain. When asked specifically by another media outlet whether he would still be in charge for Saturday's game at Leeds, Conte walked away from the interview without answering the question. ""In the last five games, we are playing like we are in relegation [trouble],"" he said. ""This is the reality. Maybe there is something wrong. ""I want to take responsibility.

28,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61002171,Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Benzema hat-trick puts Spaniards in charge in Champions League last eight,"Chelsea's hold on the Champions League hangs precariously after Karim Benzema's hat-trick put Real Madrid in a position of power following the quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti made a winning return to the club where he won the Premier League and FA Cup double after veteran France striker Benzema delivered his latest masterclass. Benzema, 34 and fresh from the treble that sunk Paris St-Germain in the last 16, punished holders Chelsea with two magnificent headers in the space of three minutes midway through the first half. Kai Havertz's header gave Chelsea hope before the break but keeper Edouard Mendy's poor clearance seconds after the restart gifted Benzema his third to put Real in command of the tie before the second leg at the Bernabeu next Tuesday (12 April). Chelsea battled to the end of this first leg but were always fighting an uphill task after they were hit by Benzema's brilliant one-two and then saw their hopes of mounting a comeback wrecked by a self-inflicted wound. Real had already delivered a warning about the danger they posed when Vinicius Junior hit the bar but that went unheeded as he provided the cross for Benzema's flying headed opener. And once Benzema had confirmed his aerial threat with a second, Chelsea were always vulnerable against a side who are the masters of these Champions League situations. Havertz, the match-winner in last season's Champions League final win against Manchester City, gave a subdued Stamford Bridge some hope but the entire destiny of the tie may have turned in the opening 40 seconds after the interval. Mendy, normally so reliable, made an expensive misjudgement when he raced from goal only to send a weak pass in the direction of Antonio Rudiger. The defender was unable to gain control and the predatory Benzema was in like a flash to roll the ball into the unguarded net with Mendy looking on in anguish. It came just after Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel had introduced Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech at the start of the second half to build on Havertz's goal, but the changes were undermined before they had any chance to take effect. Tuchel later brought on Romelu Lukaku in a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation but his struggles were summed up when he sent a weak header wide with one of Chelsea's best chances of the night. Chelsea have demonstrated an ability to overcome adversity in the past but with Real holding a two-goal advantage going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, it would rank as one of their finest achievements if they were to reach the last four from this position. Real Madrid may be runaway leaders in La Liga but Carlo Ancelotti's side were regarded as rank outsiders as they chase a 14th triumph in this competition in its guises as the European Cup and Champions League. Yet, after the dramatic comeback against the odds to knock out Paris St-Germain in the last 16, with this show of experience and class at Stamford Bridge they demonstrated once again that their credentials are dismissed at your peril. And in Ancelotti, for all the speculation surrounding his long-term future at the Bernabeu, they have a leader who has demonstrated his expertise by winning this trophy three times with AC Milan and Real. The coach and Real's players showed they are old hands at this and how they punished Chelsea, with Benzema and the 36-year-old Croatia maestro Luka Modric at their heart, to take a giant stride towards the semi-final. Benzema gets better with age, scoring two headers of the highest class before poaching a third goal, while Modric retains that priceless ability to control the tempo of games, retain possession and always make the right choice from the options available.

29,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883946,Chelsea 1-4 Brentford: Christian Eriksen scores first Bees goal in comeback win,"Christian Eriksen scored his first goal for Brentford as they closed in on Premier League safety by outclassing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Brentford produced a magnificent display to record their first win over Chelsea since 1939 as they came from behind to stun Thomas Tuchel's side with three goals in 10 minutes in the second half before adding a fourth late on to humiliate the Champions League holders. The Bees enjoyed the better of the first half but were punished for not taking chances when Antonio Rudiger flashed a brilliant 30-yard finish past David Raya three minutes after the restart. Brentford's response was instant and spectacular as Vitaly Janelt hammered home the equaliser two minutes later before the golden moment in the 54th minute as Bryan Mbeumo squared a pass for Eriksen to score in front of the joyous visiting support. And Brentford were not finished there, Janelt breaking clear again on the hour to beat Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy before substitute Yoane Wissa completed their glory day in the closing moments. Brentford are now on 33 points, 11 clear of Watford, who are third from bottom, and can now surely contemplate Premier League football again next season. Eriksen provided the story of this truly remarkable Brentford win with that first goal for the club since making his comeback with the Bees after suffering a cardiac arrest playing for Denmark against Finland at Euro 2020 in June. It was a wonderful moment but was simply the flourish on a quite brilliant team performance from Brentford, who thoroughly deserved one of the greatest victories in the club's history. The margin of the scoreline did not flatter them. Thomas Frank's side took the fight to Chelsea from the first whistle, with striker Ivan Toney having three presentable chances as they went right on the front foot. If there was any disappointment, it was the fact they did not cash in on that superiority, and they paid for it when Rudiger fired Chelsea in front. Brentford's response was truly outstanding, giving them the result that surely means they will stay in the Premier League next season. And there is no doubt Eriksen's presence has lifted those around him. Brentford have won all three games he has started since making his comeback as a substitute against Newcastle United in late February. Eriksen may be the star name but this was the complete all-round display, with Toney giving Chelsea's vulnerable defence a torrid time and Janelt providing the cutting edge. Brentford were also resolute in defence, with Frank and his players fully deserving the huge ovation they received from their ecstatic fans after the final whistle. Chelsea can have no complaints about this defeat or the embarrassing scoreline as they were abject in a performance that was completely out of character with their recent efforts. Tuchel's side won their six matches in March but were never fully switched on from first to last and paid the price. If there is any consolation for Tuchel - and he will have to search very hard to find any - it is that this did not come in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. If they repeat this horrible defensive performance, and indeed their entire shambolic effort, their hopes of retaining the trophy they won last June might be over. Despite the usually reliable presence of Rudiger and Thiago Silva, Chelsea were never unable to control Brentford, who ran them ragged and actually should have scored more than four goals. Chelsea must hope this is a blip, rather like their 5-2 home loss to the eventually relegated West Brom last season, because they cannot afford this when Real Madrid come here this week. The likes of Karim Benzema would have been licking their lips watching this defensive fiasco.

30,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48859847,Joao Felix: Atletico Madrid sign forward from Benfica for £113m,"Atletico Madrid have signed Portugal forward Joao Felix for 126m euros (£113m) from Benfica in the fifth most expensive transfer in history. Benfica have confirmed Atletico will pay the fee in instalments, after bidding 6m euros more than the 19-year-old's 120m euro release clause. Only Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele have moved for more money. Felix has signed a seven-year deal with Atletico. He made his senior debut in August and scored 15 goals last season as Benfica won the title. Felix is now the second-most expensive teenager following the 180m euros paid to Monaco by Paris St-Germain for France forward Mbappe in 2018. The former Porto youth player made his international debut against Switzerland in the Nations League semi-final in June. He scored a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League in April, becoming the youngest Benfica player and the youngest Portuguese footballer to score three goals in Europe and the youngest player ever to do so in the Europa League. Atletico striker Antoine Griezmann has confirmed he will leave the club this summer, with Barcelona expected to pay his buyout clause of 120m euros. On Wednesday, Atletico also confirmed the signings of two players from Porto. Mexico midfielder Hector Herrera, 29, has signed a three-year deal after moving on a free transfer, while Brazil centre-back Felipe, 30, has joined for 20m euros (£17.9m). The club also confirmed the sale of Spain midfielder Rodri, 23, to Premier League champions Manchester City in a £62.8m deal. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

31,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60988011,Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid: Kevin de Bruyne goal gives hosts a slender lead,"Kevin de Bruyne's second-half goal gave Manchester City victory as they overcame Atletico Madrid's typically fierce resistance in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Etihad Stadium. Diego Simeone's side performed with their trademark defensive discipline, restricting City to very few opportunities until De Bruyne pounced to make the breakthrough with 20 minutes left. Phil Foden, on as a substitute, produced the moment of magic to unlock Atletico with a perfect pass through the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to slot past goalkeeper Jan Oblak. It was the decisive moment in the tightest of games but City manager Pep Guardiola's wild celebration illustrated just how much it means to take a lead, even if slender, to Madrid for the second leg on 13 April. It was clear from the opening moments this was going to be a night for patience from City as Atletico, to no-one's great surprise, strung a bank of five defenders across the pitch and invited Guardiola's side to break them down. For the first 45 minutes it worked to perfection as the hosts barely laid a glove on the Spanish champions, who protected keeper Oblak with the diligence and desire Simeone demands. It was actually Atletico who threatened with a couple of breaks early in the second half, but City eventually managed to impose themselves and become more of a threat. De Bruyne saw a free-kick well saved by Oblak and Aymeric Laporte headed over from a good position following a corner. But it was the introduction of Foden that finally allowed City to spread some stardust on proceedings. He showed glorious control and vision to nutmeg Reinildo, allowing De Bruyne to fire low past Oblak to ignite what had been a tense, largely subdued atmosphere inside Etihad Stadium. City could not add a second with De Bruyne denied by a block on the line from Stefan Savic, but any lead is precious against an Atletico side who have made a speciality of frustrating Premier League giants in the past. Liverpool found that out in 2020 when they lost both legs as holders in the last 16, while Manchester United were also eliminated at the same stage this season. ""We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face, but it is a good result,"" said Guardiola. ""We had chances to score a second and third. It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try to win again."" Simeone marched off in defiant fashion at the final whistle and the Argentine will rightly feel Atletico are still in this tie - it would be folly to dismiss Simeone or his durable Champions League campaigners. The onus though, is now on them to attack in the return leg. ""It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win,"" Simeone said. ""It is clear we were playing against an extraordinary opponent. The numbers and statistics speak for themselves and they play in a very dynamic way. We had to suffer but we have to go to Madrid now and use the tools we have at our disposal. ""We need to be better but we are still in the tie. Let's see if we can have the ball more in the second leg and create more difficulties for our opponents but that comes with being calm and having the collective defensive effort."" However, alterations to Atletico's approach may well suit City more than having to break down the red and white wall of resistance that made their lives so difficult until that important De Bruyne strike on his 50th Champions League appearance for the club.

32,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60482881,Atletico Madrid 1-1 Manchester United: Anthony Elanga's late goal boost visitors' hopes of Champions League progression,"Anthony Elanga says he has ""dreamt of moments"" like his late equaliser in the the first leg of Manchester United's Champions League last-16 draw at Atletico Madrid. The 19-year-old had been on the pitch less than six minutes after replacing Marcus Rashford, when he raced onto Bruno Fernandes' perfectly-weighted pass to roll the ball past home goalkeeper Jan Oblak with his first touch to earn his side a 1-1 draw. ""I told you how calm and cool I am and whenever I am given a opportunity. I want to repay the manager and give 150% every time I step onto the pitch,"" Elanga told BT Sport. ""I just do what I can do, I want to be the best player on the pitch and I appreciate the boss. ""He [Ralf Rangnick] said to me to make the defenders scared and run in behind when I get the opportunity. ""I have dreamt of moments like this, scoring in the Champions League against top European teams like Atletico Madrid, [it is] a dream come true."" Until that point it appeared as though Diego Simeone's Spanish champions were going to take a narrow advantage to Old Trafford after delivering a masterclass in controlling the game without the ball. Joao Felix's early header from Renan Lodi's inviting cross gave the hosts a dream start with United looking ragged on their right, where interim boss Rangnick's deployment of Victor Lindelof at full-back failed badly. Rangnick later conceded that his plan ""was in the dustbin"" after seven minutes with the Swedish central defender, who was uncomfortable throughout, being booked for a tug on Felix before his second-half withdrawal. By then Atletico should have been two goals ahead with Sime Vrsaljko heading the ball off Lindelof and onto the United bar in the closing moments of the first half after some more dismal defending. While Rangnick's side enjoyed plenty of the ball, they were slow and indecisive in possession and barely looked capable of carving open their well-drilled opponents who repeatedly picked off every sloppy United pass in midfield. Atletico were also unlucky to not score late on themselves when Antoine Griezmann rattled the visitors crossbar. However, Elanga, who missed the crucial penalty when Rangnick's side lost in the FA Cup to Middlesbrough earlier this month, followed up his goal at Leeds on Sunday with another important intervention to change the complexion of the tie before the second leg in Manchester in three weeks time. ""He is playing as though it is a dream come true,"" Rangnick added. ""It is a joy and fun to watch him play, I wish a few other players would take him as an example and as a role model."" For long periods of this encounter United served up the sort of fare that has typified Rangnick's three-month reign as boss. Disjointed in possession, misplaced and overhit passes were produced with alarming frequency as Fred, Paul Pogba and Fernandes failed to impose themselves on the game and the athleticism of Scott McTominay was sorely missed in midfield. There were also several elementary mistakes at the back, such as Fred's charge out towards the ball and the lack of communication as Felix stole past Harry Maguire to head the opening goal. Lindelof's unfamiliarity with his adopted position hardly helped and it was notable that United's main improvement came after the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Alex Telles and Elanga were introduced. Elanga in particular provided the pace to run in behind - an option that had barely been utilised with the visitors until then. And it reaped immediate dividends, with the Sweden under-21 international registering United's first shot on target with his goal to become the club's youngest goalscorer in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It was exactly what I have been saying [all night]. Elanga has come on and made runs off the ball and probably for the first time all evening long Bruno Fernandes gets his pass right. ""For 75 minutes of this game you felt that Manchester United would have been happy to take a 2-0 defeat back to Old Trafford but they hung in there and those substitutions gave them that bit more control and Elanga got the goal."" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport: ""Man United would have taken your hand off for that result. They were lucky tonight and were poor tonight. ""David de Gea did not have much to do [but] you are looking for a better performance."" Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes: ""Ralf Rangnick's record is very good and his subs have been very good. It is not strange for me, it is a typical Manchester United performance under this manager."" Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves: ""Anthony Elanga gave them some urgency, young kids are fearless and he galvanised United.

33,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52072592,Didier Drogba: How Ivory Coast striker helped to halt civil war in his home nation,"Al-Merrikh Stadium, in Sudan's second largest city of Omdurman, is not one of the world's great gladiatorial arenas. Yet this small ground - known as the Red Castle - became the setting for one of football's most extraordinary tales. The date was 8 October 2005. The mathematics of qualification for World Cup 2006 were simple. A win for Cameroon against Egypt would see them reach their sixth tournament. Anything less would allow Ivory Coast, playing in Sudan and just a point behind, to leapfrog them and qualify instead - for the first time. The tag ""golden generation"" can be a substantial yoke to bear, but the Ivorian squad in 2005 was just that. They were led by the artfully bruising Didier Drogba, with Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Eboue and Didier Zokora all also shining in the Premier League, a world away in London. Yaya Toure, then with Greek side Olympiakos and still considered raw, was waiting in the wings. This was a squad that could match anything on the African continent. Despite having lost twice to Cameroon in qualifying, they remained agonisingly close as they took to the pitch in Sudan that evening. Yet, while Ivory Coast's footballing stars stood on the verge of history, back home the country teetered on the edge of something dark. A civil war that began in 2002 had divided the country, with President Laurent Gbagbo's government controlling the south and a rebel faction known as The New Forces of Ivory Coast, led by Guillaume Soro, controlling the north. Fighting broke out on 19 September 2002 with rebels attacking various cities across the country. Sebastien Gnahore, an ex-footballer who fled Ivory Coast, recalls those times. ""It was awful. When I called my sister I could hear the shooting outside the house,"" he says. ""They all hid under the bed for four days, and only came out to find food. ""All I cared about was whether my family was going to be OK. That's the only worry I had each morning."" The initial violence was fierce but short-lived, as both sides became quickly entrenched along a north-south divide. Much of the fighting had ended in 2004, but tensions were rising once again in 2005. The future of the West African country looked bleak. Modern footballers can seem a world away from the everyday man and woman. The money involved can catapult them into a different realm, and the results can be unpalatable. But the Ivorian players that evening, despite their multi-million-pound lives in Europe, knew much more was at stake. And nobody encapsulated this quite like the man who led their line, and who was about to take centre stage. Didier Drogba had arrived at Chelsea in 2004 for a reported fee of £24m. His nine-year stay in the Premier League was synonymous with a number of things - including a brutally effective, bulldozing style of centre-forward play and accusations ranging from unsportsmanlike behaviour to outright cheating. Love him or hate him, his achievements in west London were unquestionable. Four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and a Champions League winner's medal. Arsene Wenger, whose Arsenal side frequently found themselves on the wrong end of Drogba's brutal style, said of him: ""He is a winner and he will be like that until the end of his life."" Drogba was indeed a serial winner, but the pressure on that  October night in Sudan was entirely different. Cameroon's match against Egypt in Yaounde and Ivory Coast's fixture with Sudan kicked off simultaneously. Ivory Coast, knowing nothing less than a victory would do, made short work of a Sudanese side second-bottom in the group. In the 73rd minute, Aruna Dindane tucked away his second goal, and the team's third. An 89th-minute Sudanese strike was no more than a consolation. Events were unfolding relatively straightforwardly - but nearly 1,600 miles away in Yaounde, the picture was very different. Cameroon took the lead in the 20th minute, but the game was tight. A 79th-minute equaliser, bundled in by Mohammed Shawky, brought Egypt level and swung the tide back into the Ivorians' favour. A draw - so long as they beat Sudan - would see them qualify. With just seconds remaining in Yaounde, and with the score locked at 1-1, Ivory Coast looked set for their maiden trip to the World Cup. Their match in Sudan had finished. Drogba was standing, surrounded by his team-mates. They were all listening to the radio and waiting. Then the crushing news filtered through. Cameroon had been awarded a soft penalty in the fourth minute of injury time. For every tale of heartbreak, there must be one of joy. Pierre Wome's spot-kick crashed against the left-hand post and flew wide. The Cameroon players gathered, dazed and despondent in the penalty area, some pulling their shirts over their eyes. On the other side of the continent, Ivory Coast erupted. For the first time in their history, they would compete at the highest level of international football. ""The whole country - every person, every house - was happy. That day we all forgot the country was still divided,"" says Hassane Omar, a 20-year-old student in Abidjan at the time. For all the breathless footballing drama that took place that night, the most seismic event did not occur on the football pitch, but in the cramped away dressing room at the Al-Merrikh Stadium. A post-game prayer led by Drogba had become something of a ritual, but this would be different. With the celebrations unfolding, a TV camera was ushered into the changing room. The players huddled before it, their arms draped across each other's shoulders. Standing in the centre, microphone in hand, was the imposing figure of the Chelsea striker. ""Men and women of Ivory Coast,"" he began. ""From the north, south, centre, and west, we proved today that all Ivorians can coexist and play together with a shared aim - to qualify for the World Cup."" ""We promised you that the celebrations would unite the people - today we beg you on our knees."" On cue, the players sank to their knees. ""The one country in Africa with so many riches must not descend into war. Please lay down your weapons and hold elections,"" Drogba urged. The clip, available on YouTube, is barely a minute long and ends with the players on their feet once more. ""We want to have fun, so stop firing your guns,"" they sang joyously. Back home, the party had already started. There were reports of a conga line outside the Egyptian embassy as Ivorians showed their appreciation for the draw in Cameroon. Even the rebel capital of Bouake bounced to the beat of victory that night. For all the revelry, and for all the 'Drogbas' - bottles of beers renamed in the striker's honour - Ivory Coast still woke up the following morning in the same situation, as a deeply divided country. Yet something was stirring and the following weeks and months were to see a dramatic change. The video clip played relentlessly on television as if the sheer force of media exposure might be enough to enact change. And change did follow. Both sides moved closer to the negotiating table and a ceasefire was finally signed. While any Hollywood scriptwriter would have been proud of this ending, the story was not quite finished. At the 2006 World Cup, Ivory Coast had been knocked out at the group stage, losing to Argentina and the Netherlands before beating Serbia & Montenegro. It was a respectable first performance. The following year, an extraordinary announcement was made by Drogba, while touring the rebel-held area of his homeland after claiming the African Footballer of the Year award. Ivory Coast's home match and Madagascar, due to be played on 3 June 2007, would not be played in Abidjan as scheduled, he said, but instead in Bouake, the symbolic centre of the rebellion. This would have been unimaginable just two years before. Whether presidential permission was given for Drogba's announcement is still not entirely clear. ""Bearing in mind Drogba is from the south - from Gbagbo's area - he was just like a god at the time,"" says Austin Merril, a reporter who was in Ivory Coast working for Vanity Fair magazine. The atmosphere that day in the northern city crackled with anticipation. ""It was completely bonkers,"" adds Merrill, who drove behind the team bus on the way to the stadium with a heavy military presence. People rode on top of cars, weapons slipped from the grasp of excited soldiers. Inside the stadium itself, government and rebel troops hurled football chants back and forth. It was a marked change from the violence of the recent past. ""It felt like more than just football,"" recalls Omar, who was watching on TV in Abidjan. ""Everybody had stopped work at 12 o'clock and was drinking beer or champagne. We were all so happy."" On the pitch, any notion that the script would not be a fairytale was dispelled when Salomon Kalou tapped in on 18 minutes. The goals kept coming. With just five minutes to go, and with Ivory Coast leading 4-0, the stage was set for the spectacular finale everybody had hoped for. A lofted ball from midfield dropped behind the defence, into the path of the onrushing Drogba. Delicate control and a delightful second touch took him round the goalkeeper, and he slid the ball into an empty net. The explosion of noise defied the stadium's modest capacity. The country's messiah wheeled along the running track in celebration, players and supporters streaming in his wake. Above him in the stands, old adversaries celebrated together. The final whistle brought fans rushing on to the pitch, with security personnel forming protective screens around the players, most of all Drogba. The symbolic gesture of the game in Bouake seemed to have united a country once again. ""It was euphoria across the whole country, everybody came together,"" says Gnahore. ""We had so much hope in Drogba and his team. The Toures from the north, Drogba from the south. It was a true Ivorian mosaic."" However, what followed was sadly very different. With divisions running deep, and memories short, the euphoria surrounding those two matches began to fade. Just five years later, violence again gripped the country after disputed elections, resulting in the deaths of 3,000 people and culminating in the arrest of President Gbagbo and his eventual trial at the Hague for crimes against humanity. In January 2019, he was acquitted on all charges. One year on, he remains in custody in Belgium,external-link pending the outcome of an appeal, with Ivory Coast still in a delicate political state. Ivory Coast's 'golden generation' never truly fulfilled their potential, losing on penalties in the final of the African Cup of Nations in both 2006 and 2012. Their star power dwindled in response. Perhaps it was simply impossible to follow on from the seismic events of 2005 and 2007. Drogba retired from football in 2018 after a glittering career that saw success in six countries, with a place in the pantheon of African greats - if not world greats - already assured. But he and his team-mates were responsible for something far bigger than just footballing glory. ""They showed that we could still live together, that we could be the Ivory Coast that we had been before. It wasn't about football, but rather the unification of a country,"" says Omar. Drogba and his team-mates didn't single-handedly stop the civil war. But over the course of two football matches, they did at least give their beleaguered country a reason to hope.

A reshuffled City side were unable to recover as Liverpool, having won the Carabao Cup, are now in the FA Cup final too - as well as the last four of the Champions League, while sitting second in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was unable to start Kevin de Bruyne and had Kyle Walker out injured, preferred Zack Steffen to Ederson in goal, a move that back-fired spectacularly. Ibrahima Konate had already headed Liverpool in front after nine minutes when Steffen, trying to repeat the feats of Ederson in the league game between these two clubs, miscontrolled in his six-yard area, allowing Sadio Mane to pounce. Mane beat Steffen with a crisp volley at the end of a superb Liverpool build-up to put Jurgen Klopp's side in complete command at the break but Jack Grealish pulled one back early in the second half and keeper Alisson twice saved crucially from Gabriel Jesus as this semi-final sprang to life. Bernardo Silva pulled another back for City at the start of a tense period of stoppage time but Liverpool survived to face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet at Wembley on Sunday, in the final on 14 May. Liverpool's win keeps them in contention to make history - as no team in English football has won the league title, the two main domestic cup competitions and become champions of Europe in the same season. This was a win built on the foundation of a first half in which their intensity and ruthlessness proved too much for City, whose revamped side looked off the pace and unable to cope with the power of Klopp's side. Konate's power in the air saw him score his third header in his past three starts and Mane's alertness was never going to allow Steffen to get away with his hesitation as he attempted to keep possession in the six-yard area. Ederson had the calmness and expertise to escape almost on his goal-line as Diogo Jota bore down on him during last Sunday's 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium but Steffen showed no such expertise or composure, and paid a heavy price as he was caught. Mane led the Liverpool charge while Thiago was imperious in midfield, his clever pass allowing Mane to volley past Steffen at his near post in the closing moments of the first half for what eventually proved to be the winner. Klopp was elated with his team's performance at the conclusion, although he will have concerns about how they allowed City back into the game through Grealish's goal, conceded two clear chances to Jesus then had to survive the anxiety of four minutes of stoppage time after Silva struck. In the final reckoning, however, Liverpool deserved to reach the final and will present a formidable barrier to either Chelsea or Crystal Palace once the winner of the second semi-final is decided. This was not a good day for Manchester City. It started with a section of their support chanting through the minute's silence to commemorate the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, with City issuing a formal apology to Liverpool after the match had started. In the football context, Guardiola and City were left to regret injuries, a team selection that did not work out and a horribly laboured first 45 minutes that left them with too much to do, despite the brief hope offered by Silva's second goal. City missed the invention of De Bruyne, only fit enough for the bench after suffering an injury in the stormy Champions Leaque quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, and the experience of defender Walker, who was ruled out completely. And Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his FA Cup keeper was not rewarded as the American made that crucial error that allowed Liverpool to build on their fast start. Guardiola will be disappointed but this is a quality side who will now refocus and set sights on the Premier League, where they lead Liverpool by one point, and the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He will hope to have De Bruyne and Walker back fully fit soon because, despite this loss, there is still so much at stake for Guardiola and Manchester City as they remain in a position to achieve stellar things this season.

35,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970965,Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool: Top two draw to maintain pulsating title race,"Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top. Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game. City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.

36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048518,Manchester United 3-2 Norwich City: Cristiano Ronaldo nets superb hat-trick,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second hat-trick in three Premier League games to boost Manchester United's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League at the expense of relegation-threatened Norwich at Old Trafford. Knowing victory would take them within three points of the top four, Ronaldo appeared to have put United in control when he scored twice in the opening 32 minutes. However, appalling defending from the hosts either side of the interval allowed Norwich to equalise through Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki and for a while Dean Smith's side looked the more likely winners. But after Ralf Rangnick had abandoned his bold tactic of playing without a recognised ball-winner in midfield and replaced Paul Pogba with Juan Mata, Ronaldo drove a free-kick home off the inside of a post 14 minutes from time to secure victory. The 37-year-old is now on 15 Premier League goals for the season, trailing only Mohamed Salah and Son Hueng-min in the standings. He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals. United can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday. For Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. The Canaries are now seven points behind fourth-bottom Everton, having played two games more and with only six matches to do something about it. It is a question without an answer, but it keeps being posed nevertheless: is Ronaldo the cause of United's problems or the solution? On this occasion, he was certainly the latter. Not that he had to do much for his first goal. Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish. Ronaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul. The winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post. It was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet. The celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith. They also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest. Norwich's opener was a case in point. Pukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards. Pukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level. Milton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards. Ronaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues. But the odds against them being successful are growing.

37,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048522,Southampton 1-0 Arsenal: Jan Bednarek strike condemns top-four chasing Gunners to third straight defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted his side's form was ""a real worry"" after Southampton won at St Mary's to inflict a third successive defeat on the top-four chasing Gunners. Jan Bednarek scored the game's only goal late in the first half after the visitors had failed to adequately deal with a Saints corner. Bukayo Saka was denied from point-blank range by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with the score still goalless, but further clear-cut openings proved hard to come by for Arsenal until the closing stages of the second half. Emile Smith Rowe forced another fine save out of Forster after latching on to Yan Valery's attempted clearance, before Martin Odegaard dragged a left-footed shot wide of the near post after cutting in from the right. Forster produced yet another impressive stop to deny Granit Xhaka late on as Arsenal desperately piled forward in search of an equaliser. ""We've lost games in different ways - to lose the way we did today is difficult to explain,"" Arteta told BBC Match of the Day. ""If you saw the game, you'd say Arsenal had won comfortably. ""You have to put the ball in the net. You have to make the decisive moments count to win football matches and at the moment we're not doing that."" The Gunners remain three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who were beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - although they do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Southampton, meanwhile, climb to 12th after claiming their first league win since February. Following lacklustre displays at Crystal Palace and at home to Brighton last weekend, Gunners fans may have hoped this trip to St Mary's would prove to be an ideal fixture to reignite their top-four push. Saints had lost five of their past six games in all competitions before Saturday and conceded 19 goals in the process - including a 6-0 capitulation at home to Chelsea in their last match. They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League. The hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery. Although the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining. When Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot. Forster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide. ""It wasn't so sure he could play today,"" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display. ""He had a problem with his ankle, but we needed a goalkeeper like him in such a game today. ""The most important thing is the clean sheet after six or seven games [without one]. We've played much better games, especially with the ball, but today the target was a different one."" Arsenal still have a game in hand on Spurs in fourth but with matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham coming up in the next fortnight, this will go down as a missed opportunity for Arteta and his players.

38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048519,Watford 1-2 Brentford: Jansson grabs Bees win late on,"Pontus Jansson's last-minute header broke Watford hearts and gave Brentford a third successive Premier League win for the first time. It looked like Emmanuel Dennis' powerful strike after the break had secured a point for Watford, but the final result pushes them even closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Christian Norgaard had put the Bees ahead inside 15 minutes. It was a game of small margins as moments before Jansson's strike, Imran Louza had missed a chance to win with the goal gaping. The result leaves Watford in 19th, six points adrift of safety having played two more games than Everton. Brentford took the lead through Norgaard; Kristoffer Ajer flicked on Ethan Pinnock's long throw, and the Dane was there to apply the close-range finish. There was a stagnant feel to the game for much of the first half. Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves. But the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1. Initially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus. The home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail. There was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues. Boss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position. In Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded. They hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again. Hodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side. ""Someone up there doesn't like us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have. ""We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw. I didn't think we deserved to be contemplating another home defeat; taking the second half, that is probably the best we've offered our home fans. That doesn't say much."" Relegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season. Christian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed. Thomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again. ""[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,"" he said. ""The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'. ""I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic. Pontus [Jansson] has been very dangerous, big determination, very disciplined.

39,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048517,Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Brighton: Late Trossard goal stuns sluggish Spurs,"Leandro Trossard's superb late goal gave Brighton a gutsy win that dealt a blow to Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the top four. Following a game of few clear-cut chances, Trossard swerved into the Spurs area in the final minute of normal time before producing a fine finish past Hugo Lloris. Steven Bergwijn then missed a chance to equalise at the start of stoppage time - one of the home side's rare opportunities. Spurs stay in fourth, just ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal, while Brighton - in 10th - are on course for their highest-ever top-flight finish. Graham Potter's side enjoyed the better of a first half where Spurs looked oddly sluggish despite not having played for nearly a week, but after the hosts appeared to improve in the second half, they were undone by a combination of poor defending and fine skill from Trossard. The Belgian eluded Eric Dier before opening up his body to send a shot with the outside of his right foot low into the far corner of the net. Spurs did not look anything like the side that came into the game on a run of four consecutive wins -which had started with a 2-0 victory at Brighton, and in which they had scored 14 goals and conceded just two. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were shackled effectively Brighton, with the South Korean not managing a shot on target until nearly an hour in - with an effort that was comfortably blocked in the Albion area. They were slow out of the blocks and while more fired up after the break, presumably after manager Antonio Conte had aired his views to the team at half-time, they lacked the kind of sharpness required to unlock the Brighton defence. It was an opportunity missed for Spurs, as rivals Arsenal lost at Southampton later on Saturday, while Manchester United moved above the Gunners and just three points behind in fifth with a win against Norwich. Spurs face Liverpool on 7 May and then their north London rivals five days later in games that could decide whether they play in the Champions League next season. Brighton's two wins in north London in a week will have banished memories of a worrying slide down the table caused by six straight defeats through February and March. Trossard had put Albion on the way to a memorable win at Emirates Stadium seven days earlier, and the 27-year-old's sixth goal of the season ensured his side will also have the best-ever haul of away points in the Premier League. They have earned 25 of their 40 points so far on the road, and they pulled together impressively to execute Potter's plan to frustrate and ultimately deny Spurs. Their 29 goals scored so far is the lowest of any team in the top half of the table, but they seem on target for the club's best-ever finish in the top flight - and with games to come against Manchester United and West Ham, they could still have a say on how the European places pan out.

40,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963800,Arsenal 1-2 Brighton: Gunners boss Mikel Arteta 'concerned' by performance in home defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he was ""concerned"" by his side's performance as they handed the initiative in the race for Champions League qualification to rivals Tottenham with a deserved defeat by Brighton at Emirates Stadium. Brighton - seven games without a victory before kick-off - frustrated the home side with their organisation and efficient forward play in a game where Arsenal failed to look threatening until they mustered a desperate late push. Leandro Trossard's curling first-half finish - after a fine assist by the impressive Enock Mwepu - gave Graham Potter's side something to build on. And after Gabriel Martinelli appeared to have headed Arsenal level moments before the break - only for a four-minute VAR check to rule him offside - Brighton remained solid before doubling their lead with a superb Mwepu finish. The Zambia midfielder side-footed home with power from the edge of the box to cap a rounded individual display and produce a look of disbelief on the face of Arteta. ""We made it really difficult for ourselves,"" Arteta told BBC Sport. ""We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward. ""There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half."" Arteta's side rallied late on with Martin Odegaard firing home from range via a deflection but they stay fifth - three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 4-0 at Aston Villa later on Saturday - while Potter's Brighton move up to 11th after just a fourth win in 26 league games. Were it not for their fine start to the season, Brighton might well have been worrying about escaping the bottom three, such has been their recent run of results. Potter's side had scored just one goal in their previous seven league games and failed to find the net with 31 attempts in last week's 0-0 draw with Norwich. This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to ""hang on and suffer"". Arsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an ""unacceptable"" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace. It took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages. Lewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward. Mwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch. Potter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably. The game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum. When they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved. Odegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve. They saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win. Arsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.

41,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963796,Watford 0-3 Leeds United: Visitors take huge step towards safety after comfortable win,"Leeds manager Jesse Marsch said he was ""excited"" to see his players ""emerge from a tough moment"" against fellow strugglers Watford to take a huge step towards Premier League safety. Raphinha's fierce left-footed strike from the edge of the area gave the visitors the lead after the Hornets had twice gone close through Imran Louza and Cucho Hernandez. Ismaila Sarr squandered a golden opportunity to fire Watford level in the second half, before Rodrigo capitalised on a dreadful mix-up between Hassane Kamara and Samir to double the visitors' advantage. Leeds compounded Watford's misery when Jack Harrison beat Ben Foster with a powerful shot into the far corner to complete the scoring. ""The points are massive for us and there's confidence and momentum in the group,"" said Marsch, whose side have now collected 10 points from a possible 12 in the league. ""We can see that the form of many players and the overall mentality of the group has grown so much. ""That's really helped us get to where we are right now."" The result lifts Leeds nine points clear of the relegation zone - although they have played three games more than 18th-placed Burnley, who travel to bottom club Norwich on Sunday. ""It's been a real pleasure to be their coach,"" Marsch told BBC Match of the Day. ""[The players] are obviously hungry to stay in the league, but they are hungry to try to develop and get better and be the best they can be. ""Every day we're talking about some new topics and trying to fine-tune a lot of the principles we want to put in place. We have to keep going."" Watford manager Roy Hodgson will have taken heart from his side's spirited display against Liverpool last weekend but, as was the case at Anfield, the Hornets were undone by poor finishing against the Whites and now find themselves six points adrift of safety with seven matches left to play. They had the better chances before Raphinha's well-taken opener, Louza sending a curling free-kick inches wide before Illan Meslier got his fingertips to Hernandez's inswinging cross-shot from the left. Sarr was also thwarted by Meslier after racing on to Emmanuel Dennis' raking pass, but his effort would not have counted as he was in an offside position. The Senegal winger missed an even better opportunity in the second half with the score at 1-0, sending a wild strike past Meslier's left-hand post - an effort which sums up Watford's plight. Hodgson will be furious at the manner of Leeds' second goal, as Kamara's attempted clearance was deflected into Rodrigo's path by Samir, allowing the Spaniard to round Foster and calmly slide into an empty net. The visitors, who kept their first clean sheet in 18 Premier League matches at Vicarage Road, put the seal on a vital victory five minutes from time when Harrison drilled an unstoppable shot past Foster for his third goal in as many games. The win puts Leeds within touching distance of safety, but Watford's prospects look bleak after slipping to a ninth consecutive home defeat. With trips to Crystal Palace, Manchester City and Chelsea still to come before the end of the season, the Hornets will need to improve their tally of seven points out of a possible 45 at Vicarage Road this term to stand any chance of avoiding the drop. ""I don't think the challenge has altered enormously,"" Hodgson said afterwards. ""That's a few more points that we could have had that we haven't taken, but there are seven games left - four of them at home - and the players have got to find a way of putting this game behind them. ""They haven't lost by playing particularly badly, they've lost because the other team took their chances and now we have to get back in the right frame of mind for Brentford [next Saturday].""

42,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61088177,Lyon 0-3 West Ham United (1-4 on aggregate): Hammers reach first European semi-final in 46 years,"West Ham United will face Eintracht Frankfurt for a place in the Europa League final after the Hammers secured their first European semi-final in 46 years with a stunning second-leg victory in Lyon. Having held on for a 1-1 first-leg draw in London after playing the entire second half with 10 men, David Moyes' players withstood periods of intense early pressure before sweeping their Ligue 1 opposition aside. The visitors struck twice in seven minutes at the end of the first half, as Craig Dawson met Pablo Fornals' corner with a superb near-post header before a deflected Declan Rice strike put the Premier League club in total charge. Jarrod Bowen extended the advantage within three minutes of the restart, slotting in at the end of a sweeping counter-attack, and a deflated Lyon could offer no response as West Ham comfortably saw out a memorable win. The statement victory set up the biggest match in the club's recent history, against Bundesliga side Frankfurt, who upset Spanish giants Barcelona 3-2 at the Nou Camp to win 4-3 on aggregate. Frankfurt were also the opposition in the last four of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup, in West Ham's last major European semi-final. The Hammers prevailed 4-3 on aggregate on that occasion and it is the German side they must once again overcome if they are to reach the final in Seville next month, as their hugely impressive Europa League journey continues. Moyes and his players could already be immensely proud of their European run this season, having topped their group before eliminating Sevilla - among the favourites for the competition - on a memorable night at London Stadium in the last 16. But the manner of this latest victory, against a club who were Champions League semi-finalists two years ago, means they will rightly believe they can go even further. Karl Toko Ekambi had struck the post inside the opening five minutes and it required last-ditch defending to deny Houssem Aouar, but West Ham successfully weathered the hosts' dominant start. That was despite missing left-back Aaron Cresswell, after his first-leg red card, and injured centre-back Kurt Zouma, as the visitors fielded what Moyes described before kick-off as a ""patched up"" defence. Bowen volleyed wide on the stretch from Michail Antonio's cross as West Ham began to assert themselves, though, and Lyon were simply left shell-shocked by sucker punches from Dawson and Rice. A brilliant pass from Fornals picked out Bowen for his 15th goal of the season to move the away side within reach of the semi-finals, but there was still work to be done as Lyon racked up the attempts, to no avail, in the closing stages. Lyon, 10th in Ligue 1, had not lost in nine Europa League games this term despite their domestic struggles - but their defeat was greeted by unsavoury scenes at full-time as supporters attempted to get onto the pitch, while violence was reported among the home fans in the stands.

The first half-hour saw Exeter dominate possession but create nothing in the way of chances before they went ahead with their first attempt on 32 minutes. Former Colchester man Jevani Brown played an inch-perfect pass into the path of Jack Sparkes and the Grecians academy graduate fired a low shot across goal into the corner to send a sold-out crowd into a frenzy. Archie Collins then struck the outside of the post from 20 yards as Exeter grew in confidence and held a narrow lead at the break. The second half continued in the same vein, with Tim Dieng denied by a brilliant Shamal George save, and Exeter got their second on 63 minutes when Collins' cross was knocked across goal by Matt Jay and Offrande Zanzala finished from close range. Substitute John Akinde had the ball in the net for Colchester but was ruled offside, while Padraig Amond forced George into another fine save at the other end. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Goals from Joe Grayson, John Rooney, Matt Platt and Aaron Amadi-Holloway put a major dent into Rovers' title bid with the Bluebirds' first home win for four months. Phil Brown's side ended their four-game losing streak in style, with Brown's first win since taking charge, as Rob Edwards' charges saw their lead at the summit cut to just two points after Exeter's lunchtime win.

Veteran striker Rooney was frustrated as his free-kick hit a post, but he made no mistake seven minutes before half-time as he added a second from Amadi-Holloway's cut-back. Paul Farman produced a couple of fine saves to keep the hosts' lead intact. Platt powered home a header eight minutes into the second half before Amadi-Holloway nodded home in stoppage time.

Bradford, who played for more than an hour with 10 men after midfield player Elliot Watt was sent off for a second booking, were denied a win when McManaman equalised with a low drive just inside the far post. Bradford dominated the early stages and deservedly went ahead in the 19th minute when Luke Hendrie crossed from the right and Jamie Walker, on loan from Hearts, flicked a smart header into the far corner of the net. However, the Bantams suffered a blow in the 28th minute when Watt was sent off for a second yellow card in the space of three minutes, first for a foul on Elliott Nevitt and then on Lee O'Connor. Walker came close to increasing Bradford's lead, but was denied by a fine save from keeper Joe Murphy who turned his 20-yard shot over the bar. Tranmere hit back strongly and Sam Foley headed narrowly over the bar before Josh Dacres-Cogley saw his header bounce inches wide of the post. However, Murphy came to Tranmere's rescue in first-half stoppage time when he turned Andy Cook's goal-bound shot round the post for a corner. Both sides went close in an evenly contested second half with Murphy saving well from Yann Songo'o and home keeper Alex Bass keeping out a downward header from Peter Clarke.

On-loan Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson drove in low at the near post on 75 minutes for his fifth league goal of the season after being set up by a fine pass from substitute Luke Thomas.

Rovers substitute Antony Evans hit the crossbar in the second half, but the strike from Anderson, who has made a huge impression during his loan spell, eventually made the difference.

Luke Armstrong grabbed the hosts' consolation in the fourth minute of stoppage time, but the victory kept Ben Garner's men, who had gone into the game without a win in three games, on the coat-tails of the top seven. Harrogate, meanwhile, have still not mathematically secured their Sky Bet League Two status for next term following a seventh defeat in nine contests. Swindon totally dominated a one-sided first half, with Jack Payne seeing a deflected edge-of-the-box effort hit an upright before Barry opened the scoring in the 24th minute. The on-loan Aston Villa teenager was left unmarked at the far post to head in Mandela Egbo's right-wing cross from three yards out. He then added a second on the half-hour mark when he was left unchallenged again in the same position to meet another Egbo delivery after Louis Reed's excellent ball through the right channel. The visitors should have taken an even bigger lead into the interval as Barry fired straight at Joe Cracknell when given a clear run on the home goal and Davison side-footed wide from six yards. But Davison was more clinical in the 51st minute when he netted from eight yards after Ellis Iandolo's powerful run from the halfway line into the home box. He then doubled his personal haul for the afternoon, firing inside an exposed Cracknell's near post from 10 yards after being played through the right channel by Payne. The visitors also went close to adding a fifth when Iandolo's spectacular late strike clipped the crossbar before Armstrong pounced from close range after Jojo Wollacott had parried Simon Power's firm drive.

The Valiants have now won five of their last six games and have a five-point cushion ahead of the play-off places. Pools, ensconced in mid-table, had the better of the first half. A volley from Tom Crawford dipped wide before Omar Bogle's powerful run saw him shoot over from 20 yards. Then David Ferguson used his right foot to send a low effort into keeper Aiden Stone. But Vale were fired up after the restart and started to take control. They almost went ahead when Ferguson's wayward header back to Nicholas Bilokapic evaded the keeper, who scrambled the ball off the line. Former Pools midfielder Brad Walker drove over from long range before the promotion-chasers won it on 67 minutes. Jake Taylor's cross from the left, the ball returned to him after a corner was cleared, was headed in from an angle by centre-half Hall to send the 671 travelling fans home happy.

49,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033835,Leyton Orient 3-0 Scunthorpe United: Iron relegated after 72 years in EFL,"Scunthorpe United's 72-year spell in the English Football League will come to an end as a 3-0 loss at Leyton Orient confirmed their relegation from League Two. Paul Smyth cut in from the right wing, skipped past Ryan Delaney and arrowed a low shot past Rory Watson's near post to put the O's in front early on. Orient doubled their lead six minutes later as Theo Archibald curled a left-footed effort into the far corner of the net from the corner of the 18-yard box. Ruel Sotiriou found himself unmarked at the far post to head in Jordan Brown's deep cross for Orient's third as the Iron's will buckled. Sotiriou almost got his second seven minutes after the break, but he hit the post after Brown's through ball, while Watson did well to deny Archibald after an hour and Hector Kyprianou crashed an effort off the Scunthorpe crossbar six minutes later. The loss - Scunthorpe's 26th in 42 league games - leaves the Iron 16 points from safety with 12 left to play for. Scunthorpe manager Keith Hill, who has seen his side win just two games in the 28 he has taken charge of since November, said he is upset that his side will be playing in the National League next season. ""I'm really sad. I am angry. I don't want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it's not stood me in good stead, but I'm very, very disappointed,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. ""I've been disappointed a lot of times, but I've got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. ""It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn't been good enough. ""Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you're staring down the barrel of relegation. ""We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don't think we've been competitive enough throughout the course of the season."" In truth the writing has been on the wall for the North Lincolnshire side for the majority of a campaign where they have won just four league matches. Since beating fellow strugglers Oldham 3-1 at Boundary Park on 26 December the Iron have won just once - a 1-0 win over Walsall on 8 February - and this loss at Brisbane Road was their seventh successive defeat. They finished just one place above the League Two relegation zone in 2020-21 and their cause this campaign was hindered when they were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer. Boss Neil Cox was sacked in November with the club bottom of League Two and replaced by former Rochdale, Barnsley and Bolton manager Hill. Hill lost just one of his first seven matches in charge but they never built up any momentum, and last spent a day outside the bottom two on 28 December. Relegation out of the Football League will be hard to swallow for Iron fans, who saw their team play in the Championship in 2011 and compete in the League One play-offs as recently as 2018. However, they were then relegated to League Two in 2018-19 and finished 20th in their first season back in the fourth tier. With hopes of EFL survival drifting badly, boss Hill said after a home defeat by fellow strugglers Barrow on 15 March that he had to change ""the culture"" at the club. ""I'm trying to navigate this football club through some stormy moments to where I can build a positive future in a positive environment,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. Though there is now certainty of what level the Iron will be playing in next season, the club's next move behind the scenes is unknown. Owner Peter Swann resigned as chairman last month and has acknowledged he is looking for someone to buy the club from him.external-link Lee Turnbull has returned to the club in the role of chief operating officer and Hill will now hope that he is given the chance to turn the club's fortunes around. BBC Radio Humberside's Mike White It's a sad, miserable, heart-breaking day for Scunthorpe United. A club with a storied history that can list legendary England internationals like Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan among its most notable former players, in addition to club icons such as Jack Brownsword and Barrie Thomas, and even dual-sport star Ian Botham. In recent times, the Iron punched above their weight in the Championship in the mid-to-late 2000s and flirted with it again under the management of Graham Alexander. Many fans believe his 2018 sacking was the start of the decline that's brought them to this point. Recruitment has been questioned in the past few years too, with many fans suggesting now-former chairman - but still club owner for the time being - Peter Swann had too much input, something he has refuted on several occasions. Whilst some fans are angered by the current state of the club and this situation, many almost seem numb to it now and were resigned to their fate a long time before the dreaded 'R' was placed next to their name on the league table. And despite the consistent positivity from manager Keith Hill about the future of the club, I'm not sure the majority of Iron supporters share that sentiment as they've seen that the National League can quite easily turn into a giant abyss that has swallowed up clubs without a hint or whisper of a return to the Football League. Maybe recent talk and suggestion of a takeover could provide the required impetus needed to at least provide the right resources to Hill and his team - and breathe new life back into a club in desperate need of it - but that will have to wait for another day.

With Port Vale winning, sixth-placed Stags now have a six-point gap between them and the third automatic promotion place, although they still have a game in hand. Sutton, meanwhile, climbed up to seventh with the win as they took advantage of Newport and Tranmere dropping points. Mansfield gifted their opponent a ninth-minute lead following an error by defender Farrend Rawson. After having the ball rolled to him on the edge of the box by keeper Nathan Bishop, Rawson was dispossessed by Omar Bugiel who rounded Bishop and calmly netted. The hosts were then rocked by a second Sutton goal four minutes into the second half as David Ajiboye was allowed to turn home his eighth goal of the season from six yards, tucking away Enzio Boldewijn's cross from the left by-line. Stags were handed a lifeline in the 78th minute as a long John-Joe O'Toole ball forward saw Sutton defender Ben Goodliffe loop a header over his own keeper. But United were 3-1 up two minutes later as substitute Richie Bennett raced clear to slot past Bishop with Stags screaming for an offside flag. Mansfield pulled another goal back in the seventh of added time when Matty Longstaff saw his low 18-yard shot deflect home but it was nothing more than a consolation.

The visitors led when Kwesi Appiah's header found Ashley Nadesan at the back post to finish from close range. Crawley soon doubled their lead when a slick corner routine gave Ludwig Francillette space for a low strike. Newport improved after the break and a swift counter saw James Waite reply, but Robert Street was just wide with a header that would have rescued a point.

Oldham's Alex Hunt fired an early strike narrowly off target before Northampton replied with Aaron McGowan forcing Danny Rogers into a smart near-post save. Shortly after the half-hour mark, Cobblers keeper Liam Roberts made a superb double stop from Hunt and then Harrison McGahey.

Walsall keeper Carl Rushworth made a fine early diving save to keep out Kristian Dennis' low shot and later had to be alert to deny Omari Patrick. The Saddlers' first real chance came via a swift counter-attack as Emmanuel Osadebe teed up Tyrese Shade but his curler was straight at Carlisle keeper Mark Howard.

The visitors thought they had taken the lead after a minute but Burton skipper John Brayford produced a superb clearance off the line to deny his opposite number Joe Edwards. Burton, struggling for form, started without an orthodox striker but after seeing much of the early Argyle threat began to cause problems for the visitors.

Joe Powell twice had chances for Burton in a tense second half but the best opportunity fell to Chapman, who forced to superb save from Michael Cooper in the Plymouth goal only for the ball to ricochet onto the shin of Burton defender Tom Hamer and deflect away when it looked like it might be sneaking in the bottom corner.

After eight minutes, Sam Smith's shot from James Brophy's cross was saved by Trevor Carson. Five minutes later, Carson foiled Joe Ironside's close-range effort, again after good work by Brophy. Morecambe could have gone ahead after 15 minutes, but Arthur Gnahoua shot wide from a narrow angle. Liam Bennett made a fine double goal-line clearance to deny Cole Stockton and then Gnahoua. The home side took the lead three minutes before the interval when Smith prodded home after Harvey Knibbs' shot had been blocked by Jacob Bedeau. The visitors had a chance to equalise on the hour when Adam Phillips' through ball found Stockton, but Dimitar Mitov saved the striker's shot with his legs. Stockton levelled for the Shrimps in spectacular fashion after 68 minutes, intercepting Sam Sherring's clearance and volleying a superb strike past Mitov for his 25th goal of the season. Three minutes later, Ironside restored Cambridge's lead from the penalty spot with what proved to be the winner after Greg Leigh brought down Knibbs.

The midfielder struck in the 76th minute to earn the Robins their first-ever win over Pompey and end the visitors' faint hopes of mounting a late play-off push. Both teams had chances to take the lead before Sercombe's strike, with both goalkeepers pulling off outstanding saves in the second period. Cheltenham's Owen Evans reacted superbly to turn Michael Jacobs' effort over the bar, shortly before Gavin Bazunu pulled off a brilliant diving stop to keep out Callum Wright's 25-yard drive which had looked destined for the top-right corner. The hosts made the breakthrough three minutes later. Kion Etete held the ball up and found Wright, who supplied Sercombe and he beat Bazunu.

60,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.

The hosts had goalkeeper Alex Cairns sent off late on for handling outside the box, after which Michael Nottingham headed home Sean McConville's stoppage-time corner to hand the visitors the points. Defeat left Fleetwood with only goal difference keeping them out of the drop zone. Stanley went close early on when Tommy Leigh's close-range effort was smartly saved by Alex Cairns. Colby Bishop then found space in the Fleetwood box before smashing an angled strike just off target. At the other end Anthony Pilkington beat Stanley keeper Toby Savin to a hopeful ball forward before rolling a shot a couple of feet wide. Fleetwood took the lead in added time at the end of the first half when Ellis Harrison rose to head home Dan Batty's in-swinging corner. Stanley's John O'Sullivan drove a low shot inches past a post soon after the restart before Harrison was thwarted by a goal-line clearance from defender Jay Rich-Baghuelou. Stanley levelled when McConville side-footed home after Leigh's long throw was not cleared.

Gills goalkeeper Aaron Chapman was called upon in the early stages to palm away Garath McCleary's strike. However, constant Wycombe pressure in the early stages prevailed in the 20th minute when a pass from Brandon Hanlan found Sam Vokes inside the penalty area and his left footed strike gave the Chairboys the advantage. Daryl Horgan had an opportunity to add a second goal shortly afterwards but Chapman stood tall and gathered at the second attempt. The home side's best opportunity of the half fell to top scorer Vadaine Oliver, who headed Robbie McKenzie's cross wide. The hosts were better in the second period, enjoying more of the possession, and eventually found a deserved equaliser when Jack Tucker's stunning volley found its way beyond keeper David Stockdale with 15 minutes remaining. Neil Harris' men nearly scored a dramatic winner, but Oliver's prodded shot towards goal, with Stockdale having dropped an initial effort, was hacked off the line. A frustrating afternoon was compounded for Gareth Ainsworth and his team when Lewis Wing was dismissed for a foul with four minutes remaining. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Lang scored the first and third goals, with Will Keane netting the other for the visitors. Anthony Scully had equalised for the Imps. The game got off to a lively start with three goals in the opening quarter. First, in the eighth minute, the visitors took the lead when Josh Magennis headed the ball on to Lang, who volleyed home from close range. City levelled six minutes later when the ball broke to Lewis Fiorini on the edge of the box. His shot took a big deflection off a defender and landed at the feet of Scully, who composed himself before slotting home. Wigan restored their lead in the 21st minute when, after good work from Lang and Max Power, Keane fired into the top corner from the edge of the box. The pacesetters had chances to extend their lead in the second half but a combination of poor finishing and a stunning save from Jordan Wright kept Lincoln in the game. However, Leam Richardson's men finally added a third goal with 18 minutes remaining.

Victory stretched Sunderland's unbeaten run to seven matches, while Oxford's play-off hopes appear in tatters after three successive defeats. Both skippers scored during the first half. Black Cats captain Corry Evans pounced in the 16th minute when the home defence failed to clear a free-kick, prodding home a shot from 14 yards before centre-half Elliott Moore headed in Billy Bodin's free-kick to equalise for Oxford in the 35th minute. Both sides had early chances with visiting goalkeeper Anthony Patterson turning over Mark Sykes' shot and Nathan Broadhead seeing an effort blocked on the line by Luke McNally at the other end.

The recently won Papa John's Trophy was paraded before the match but the mood was killed by George Dobson's second-half winner. Defeat leaves Rotherham three points outside of the automatic promotion berths they have occupied for a large part of the season. Ben Wiles threatened early on for the home side with his long-range volley whistling just wide of the post. Conor Washington got through on goal for the visitors but was denied a shot on goal thanks to a great recovering tackle by Ollie Rathbone. Viktor Johansson had to get in the way of Washington's lobbed effort early in the second half but there was nothing he could do to stop them taking the lead on 55 minutes. Neat interplay around the box saw Dobson teed up and the midfielder rifled an unstoppable shot into the corner.

68,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,"Samuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. ""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. ""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy."" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""

In a Champions League epic, Mason Mount's wonderful finish and Antonio Rudiger's powerful header wiped out Real's 3-1 first-leg advantage and brought the quarter-final tie level in Spain's capital. Thomas Tuchel's side were outstanding throughout and Timo Werner's clever finish from an angle put them ahead for the first time on aggregate and within sight of a place in the semi-finals. But substitute Rodrygo - after a stunning pass by Luka Modric - forced extra time with a volleyed finish before Karim Benzema, a hat-trick hero in the first leg at Stamford Bridge six days earlier, headed the decisive goal in the 96th minute to send Real through 5-4 on aggregate. Benzema, who had earlier headed against the bar on a rollercoaster night, was unmarked when he scored to break Chelsea's hearts after Rudiger slipped inside the box. Even after what turned out to be the clincher, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho went close to forcing a penalty shootout. In the end Chelsea, who played superbly, were made to pay for their first-leg performance as Tuchel's side fell just short of producing one of the great comebacks in the competition. Many of Chelsea's players slumped to the ground at the end of 120 gripping minutes after pushing record 13-time winners Real - who will face Manchester City or Atletico Madrid in the last four - all the way. Tuchel had said on the eve of this game that Chelsea's progression into the semi-finals would be akin to the best Hollywood script. His players came close to producing a blockbuster in their first game at the Bernabeu in European competition as they showed incredible fight and belief - ingredients which were missing from their poor performance in the first leg. This breathless game had everything and more, including a Marcos Alonso goal at 2-0 ruled out by the video assistant referee for handball. While Tuchel will be delighted with the way his players responded, there will be concern at how much the energy-sapping 120 minutes has taken out of them. Chelsea do not have long to recover from going out of Europe as they prepare to make a second visit of the season to Wembley. They face Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST) - a competition that offers them their last chance of landing a major domestic trophy. Despite enjoying success in the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup, they lost a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in the Premier League with just eight matches left.

70,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36351371,Jose Mourinho: Manchester United to appoint former Chelsea boss,"Manchester United are set to appoint Jose Mourinho as their new manager, BBC Sport understands. It is believed a deal with the 53-year-old Portuguese was agreed in principle before United's FA Cup final win against Crystal Palace on Saturday. With United failing to qualify for the Champions League under Louis van Gaal, the Old Trafford hierarchy is thought to have decided a change is required. Mourinho has been out of work since he was sacked by Chelsea in December. The club plan to announce his arrival early next week after telling Van Gaal, 64, his reign has come to an end. In the post-match news conference following United's FA Cup win, the Dutchman said: ""I show you the cup and I don't discuss it [my future] with my friends of the media, who already sacked me for six months. Which manager can do what I have done?"" When pressed on whether he will be at Old Trafford as manager of United next season, he replied: ""I hope to see you. I don't want to talk about about leaving this club."" The Dutchman still has one season remaining on his three-year deal, but despite spending £250m on new players, his tenure has disappointed many fans, the club finishing fourth and then fifth in the Premier League. Van Gaal's grip on his job has seemed increasingly fragile this season, with Mourinho known to covet the task of masterminding a revival at United three years after legendary former manager Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down. He was at heavyweight boxer David Haye's win in London on Saturday evening but repeatedly declined to comment on whether he was about to succeed Van Gaal. Mourinho is one of the game's most successful coaches, winning three league titles in his two spells at Stamford Bridge, as well as guiding Porto and Inter Milan to Champions League victories in 2004 and 2010 respectively. He also led Real Madrid to the Spanish La Liga title in 2012, and his arrival will mean a mouthwatering resumption of his rivalry with former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola. The Spaniard will take over at United's arch-rivals Manchester City this summer. Having sacked previous manager David Moyes just 10 months after he succeeded Ferguson, United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was desperate for Van Gaal to see out his contract. Some senior figures at United were also known to have serious reservations about the prospect of the controversial Mourinho, with some preferring Ryan Giggs as an alternative. The Welshman, who made a record 963 appearances for the club, took over as manager on an interim basis in April 2014 following the sacking of Moyes, and was understood to be keen on the job. In February, however, BBC Sport revealed that United had held talks with Mourinho's representatives, and they have now come to fruition. Woodward - and United's American owners, the Glazer family - still hoped Van Gaal would lead the club to a top-four finish - and up until last month Mourinho's advisers were concerned the club might remain loyal to the Dutch coach. But fans were not convinced by Van Gaal's tactics. The club's 49 goals in the Premier League this season was United's lowest total since 1989-90, coincidentally a season that also ended with an FA Cup final win over Crystal Palace. There were occasional high points, not least Van Gaal's theatrical dive in front of the dug-outs during the 3-2 win over Arsenal in February as he accused the Gunners of diving. But since collecting only three points in six games at the end of 2015, Van Gaal has been under intense pressure. He has accused the media and former players of ""sacking him"", and cited injuries as the reason why United have been unable to sustain a title challenge. Nevertheless, Van Gaal's side still had Champions League qualification in their own hands 14 minutes from the end of their penultimate Premier League game at West Ham, only to concede two late goals, lose 3-2 and allow Manchester City to claim the fourth qualifying slot. And, after members of the United hierarchy suggested in December that the season was 80% about the Premier League, it is the failure to qualify for the Champions League that has appeared to seal Van Gaal's fate. Despite his track record, some will question United's decision to appoint Mourinho. He was sacked by Chelsea in December just seven months after leading them to the Premier League title, with their season overshadowed by a spectacular slump in form and issues off the pitch that included a public fallout with club doctor Eva Carneiro. Ultimately, however, United appear to have decided it is a risk worth taking. Mourinho has never hidden his admiration for United - and for Ferguson. Now it seems he will have the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. The appointment will mean some long overdue issues can be dealt with, not least whether the club's second longest-serving player Michael Carrick should be awarded a new contract. It remains to be seen what Giggs will do. Having served under Moyes and Van Gaal, the prospect of continuing his apprenticeship under a third United boss may not appeal. It remains to be seen whether the club can find an alternative role for their most decorated player. Giggs would not be short of offers if he decided to join the management ranks. But many of the Welshman's former team-mates - most recently close friend Gary Neville at Valencia - have not found management easy. Never want to miss the latest Man Utd news?

71,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806211,Manchester United 9-0 Southampton: Man Utd thrash nine-man Saints,"Manchester United equalled the Premier League record by putting nine goals past nine-man Southampton - the second time Saints have lost 9-0 in as many seasons. A red card for Saints' Alexandre Jankewitz after only two minutes triggered a complete collapse for the visitors, who were on the end of the same scoreline against Leicester City in October 2019. It is only the third time a team has lost 9-0 in the Premier League, with United also beating Ipswich Town by that margin in 1995. Aaron Wan-Bissaka opened the scoring with his first goal at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani also found the net either side of a Jan Bednarek own goal before the break. After a fairly drab start to the second half, United cut loose, scoring five times in the final 21 minutes. Anthony Martial ended an eight-match goal drought before Scott McTominay drove home from the edge of the area. Then, after Bednarek became the second Saints player to be sent off - bringing down Martial to allow Bruno Fernandes the chance to score from the penalty spot on 87 minutes - the French forward netted his second, before Dan James wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time. It was a stunning ending as United almost matched their club record 10-0 victory over Anderlecht in 1956. By the final whistle, it had been forgotten that United had come into Tuesday's game on the back of indifferent form - just one win in their last four matches. The massive impact on their goal difference means it is now bettered only by league leaders Manchester City. Martial should be particularly pleased with his contribution, even though it did not match manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's four-goal salvo as a United substitute in an 8-1 win at Nottingham Forest in 1999. At one point, it looked as though that seven-goal margin of victory was the one United would emulate. But Martial's 90th-minute second - the first time he has scored two in a game all season - took the home side beyond that, and James completed the rout in the third minute of injury time. Rashford and McTominay both produced noteworthy strikes for a United side that also had a penalty award overturned just before half-time. Making a full Premier League debut should be a cause for celebration in any young player's career. For Jankewitz, it was a catastrophic experience. His second-minute foul on McTominay was committed right in front of Saints boss Ralph Hassenhuttl, who did not require the replays which made the challenge look worse with every viewing. Hassenhuttl could only throw his arms up in the air in disbelief, knowing referee Mike Dean had no alternative other than to show the 19-year-old Swiss midfielder a straight red card. The incident came less than a week after Jankewitz's agent had started murmurings about a transfer and this sorry episode is unlikely to convince anyone the player has a future at St Mary's. After that, it was just a question of how long the visitors could survive, which turned out to be not very long, as Wan-Bissaka turned in Luke Shaw's cross at the far post from a position Jankewitz should have been defending. With Bednarek among the scorers after turning Rashford's cross into his own net for the third, and one of those marginal video assistant referee offside decisions that took away the goal Che Adams thought he had scored at the start of the second half, it really was one of those nights best erased from the memory completely. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the misery. While Hassenhuttl can rightly point to Jankewitz's dismissal as the key moment, there can be no excusing the way the team - though badly affected by injuries - had so totally collapsed by the end. Manchester United manager Solskjaer speaking to BBC Sport: ""When they had a man sent off it was up to us to get the first goal. ""You have to take your chances in tight or open games - you never know what might be the deciding factor. We know, better than anyone, what goal difference can do to you because we have lost the league on goal difference. ""Confidence is one thing but it was about the mojo and spark - the X-factor."" Southampton boss Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport: ""One man down after three minutes against this opponent - congratulations to Manchester United, they worked us off and did not stop scoring. The second red card is most disappointing - we don't have any more players. ""We tried in the second half to keep a clean sheet as much as we could, but at nine men it was too easy for them to score. ""What can I say? It is horrible. But we stood up after the first 9-0 [against Leicester] and we have to do that again.""

72,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963798,Southampton 0-6 Chelsea: Saints blown away by devastating Blues display,"Chelsea put a terrible week behind them to return to winning ways in devastating style with a six-goal demolition of Southampton. Having been beaten 4-1 at home to Brentford in the Premier League and then suffering a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid, Chelsea bounced back in a manner that will give Thomas Tuchel encouragement his side can salvage their Champions League tie in Spain next week. Tuchel said before kick-off that ""things are upside down"" after two damaging results but his players responded by hitting the woodwork three times and scoring four in an astonishing first half at St Mary's Stadium. Timo Werner hit the post and then headed against the bar inside the opening seven minutes before Marcos Alonso fired the visitors ahead after Mason Mount's assist. England midfielder Mount's clean finish from outside the box doubled the lead and then Werner was thwarted by Fraser Forster's fine save as Southampton unravelled in front of their own fans. Werner was soon celebrating his first Premier League goal for six months after bursting through and finishing before Kai Havertz made it 4-0 with a tap-in after Germany team-mate Werner hit the woodwork for a third time. Southampton were blown away and it required a remarkable one-handed stop by Forster to prevent an own goal by Mohammed Salisu before half-time. However, the Saints did concede a fifth in the 49th minute, Werner tapping home his second after N'Golo Kante had been thwarted. Mount made it six from close range on an embarrassing afternoon for Ralph Hasenhuttl and his Southampton players. This was Chelsea back to their clinical best as they took the Saints apart in destructive fashion. Yet Tuchel will be just as pleased with the clean sheet after Chelsea conceded seven times in the previous two games to leave confidence on the floor. Despite the absence of £97.5m forward Romelu Lukaku because of injury and captain Cesar Azpilicueta after a positive coronavirus test, they got back on track before another big week that will help shape their season. They face a huge challenge to turn around their Champions League quarter-final with Real in the Bernabeu on Tuesday before heading to Wembley to face Crystal Palace in next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final - their most realistic hope of a major domestic trophy as it stands. Werner could yet play a big part in how Chelsea's season finishes. Without a Premier League goal since scoring against Southampton last October, he was back to his very best against Saints and should have finished with a hat-trick. The first of his two goals was magnificent with the former RB Leipzig player having too much pace for the chasing Jan Bednarek before going round Forster and finishing. This was a sorry performance by Saints on an afternoon which revived painful memories of those two 9-0 defeats against Manchester United in February 2021 and Leicester in October 2019 under Hasenhuttl. From the opening minute it was far too easy for Chelsea and but for Forster, who produced a string of fine stops as Chelsea peppered his goal with 14 attempts on target, they would have suffered an even more embarrassing defeat. The Saints fans who stayed to the bitter end made their feelings known after this utter capitulation signalled a fourth straight home defeat in all competitions. Fortunately Southampton appear safe in the table. They are 12 points clear of the relegation zone after enjoying several highs this season, including twice coming from behind to win at Tottenham and holding leaders Manchester City home and away. But this was definitely a day to forget as they surrendered without a fight.

73,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970968,Brentford 2-0 West Ham United: Hosts deliver huge blow to Hammers' top-four hopes,"Brentford delivered a huge blow to West Ham's top-four hopes as the Bees moved further clear of the relegation places with victory in west London. Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney saw Thomas Frank's side climb to 13th in the table, 12 points clear of the bottom three, to all but confirm their Premier League safety. Mbeumo fired in from Toney's pass shortly after half-time, before turning provider for his team-mate as Toney headed in after 64 minutes. ""I'm very proud. It was a top performance against a very good side who are in the quarter-final of the Europa League and fighting for a Champions League spot,"" said manager Frank. ""It was close to a complete performance. The way we did it shows how far we've come. It's a combination of a top performance and a good win."" He added: ""Of course I looked at the table, but I want to focus on the next game."" The hosts had appeared the more likely to break the deadlock before half-time, but the heavily involved Mbeumo headed at Lukasz Fabianski and also saw a powerful strike pushed away by the West Ham goalkeeper. The visitors managed only one shot on target - a first-half Tomas Soucek header - in a subdued display, while Kurt Zouma was forced off early with an ankle problem ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg in Lyon. The Hammers remain sixth, six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football, having also played a game more than Spurs. There was no shortage of motivation for West Ham, after defeats for fellow top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Manchester United on Saturday left the fight for the European positions wide open. But, with the game falling between two huge meetings with Lyon, the Hammers struggled against a Brentford side full of confidence following their memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea last week. Instead, it was the hosts who maintained their fine form at the end of their first Premier League season, deservedly securing a fourth win in five league games. That upturn in results has coincided with the signing of Christian Eriksen, who once again produced a superb midfield display to offer the base for Brentford's superior attacking output. The hosts had been by far the more fluent in the final third in the opening 45 minutes, recording nine shots to the Hammers' two, but Mbeumo in particular was unable to capitalise with any of his five attempts. They made their chances count in the second half, though, as the 22-year-old Mbeumo seized his first opportunity after the restart, before his looping cross allowed Toney to put the game beyond West Ham. David Moyes called on Said Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic from the bench in the hope of inspiring a fightback, with Benrahma seeing a deflected effort drop on to the roof of the net. Brentford had further chances to extend their advantage too, Mbeumo notably shooting over at close range, but their misses did not prove costly as another excellent result was secured. It is now all eyes on Lyon for West Ham, who must rest up and regroup quickly as they attempt to reach the club's first European semi-final since 1976. ""I don't have any complaints at all, we weren't really at it from the start,"" said West Ham boss Moyes. ""There are mitigating circumstances. We had a tough game on Thursday and the Thursday-Sunday schedule is not ideal. For the most part this season we've been very good but today felt like one too many.""

74,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61053312,Ralf Rangnick questions whether Man Utd deserve Europe after Everton defeat,"Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United ""do not deserve"" to play in the Champions League next season if they perform how they did against Everton for the rest of the season. United lost 1-0 at Goodison Park despite Everton going into the game just a point above the relegation zone. It has harmed United's chances of finishing in the top four and securing Champions League qualification. ""If we play like we did here we just don't deserve it,"" said Rangnick. ""The players themselves should be eager to play international football, if possible Champions League.  In order to qualify for Europe you have to be able to score in 95 minutes in a game like this."" Everton came into the match following a disappointing 3-2 defeat by relegation rivals Burnley, who sit just one place below them in the table. Rangnick bemoaned his side's lack of ability to score against Everton, who he believed were low on confidence following that loss to Burnley. ""With all respect to Everton - because they have a good team - but if you don't score against a team who conceded three goals against Burnley, you cannot expect to get anything out of it,"" he added. ""The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game. We didn't even in those 25 minutes take enough advantage out of that dominating period. ""You could literally feel that Everton were crumbling after that result against Burnley. They were quite logically not full of confidence but we didn't take advantage of that."" Earlier this week, United edged closer to appointing Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager at the end of the season. They have taken several months over the recruitment process, but interim boss Rangnick said the uncertainty over the managerial situation was no excuse for their underwhelming performances. United have won just eight of the 17 Premier League games Rangnick has overseen - the lowest win percentage (47%) of any manager for the club in the competition. ""I don't think this should be an excuse,"" Rangnick told BT Sport. ""We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn't be an alibi. ""There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn't have an impact."" Goalkeeper David de Gea said Manchester United, who currently sit in seventh place, are ""not good enough"" following the defeat. United have won just once in their past five Premier League games to slip adrift of the top four in seventh. ""We're not good enough, for sure. It's going to be very difficult now to be in the top four,"" said De Gea. ""We don't score, we don't even create proper chances to score."" The Spain keeper also criticised United's lack of hunger to fight for the points, contrasting it with the Toffees' tenacious display. ""We knew before today Everton were struggling and how difficult it was going to be - they were tired, they were nervous, but they keep going and keep fighting,"" the 31-year-old told BT Sport. ""They had more desire than us, which is not acceptable. It's very sad to lose today."" ",positive,liverpool,0
75,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963791,Everton 1-0 Manchester United: Anthony Gordon strike boosts Toffees' survival hopes,"Everton secured what could prove a priceless victory in their battle to avoid relegation as lacklustre Manchester United were beaten at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard's side were plunged into even deeper crisis when they lost at fellow strugglers Burnley in midweek to leave them facing the prospect of dropping into the bottom three this weekend if results went against them. In a game low on quality but high in tension, Everton's victory came courtesy of Anthony Gordon's 27th-minute drive, which took a heavy deflection off United captain Harry Maguire to leave keeper David de Gea wrong-footed. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford made two important early saves from Marcus Rashford and a vital late block from Cristiano Ronaldo, but there was rarely any sense of siege as United lacked urgency, failing to break through in another blow to their hopes of making the Premier League's top four. This could be a huge result in Everton's season, stopping the rot and lifting some of those dark clouds that were starting to gather over Goodison. Everton's win was as far from a classic as it is possible to be but in the wider context it could mean more than so many others this season. Frank Lampard's side remain in trouble but the psychological lift provided by this victory, which removes the prospect of dropping into the bottom three for now at least, saw an explosion of joy around this famous old stadium when referee Jon Moss blew the final whistle. Everton dug deep for victory and had several figures who personified exactly what they will need if they are to maintain their Premier League status. It was fitting that Gordon was the match-winner, the local hero loved by Everton fans for his tireless energy and invention. The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward. Richarlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium. And, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break. The deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued. Manchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them. United's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles. It seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans. Everton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season. The passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance. It was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it. Ronaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance. If, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on.

76,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970974,Leicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall stars in hard-earned win,"Leicester continued their fine run of recent form as homegrown talent Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall played a starring role in a hard-earned win over Crystal Palace. The Foxes started slowly at the King Power Stadium but Dewsbury-Hall carved Palace open with a superb ball for Ademola Lookman to fire home, before whipping his own finish high into the net six minutes later. ""It means so much,"" he said of his first Premier League goal. ""It's a dream come true to score in the Premier League. I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today."" The 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week. Palace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match. Zaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound. It prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors. A closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes. Leicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign. Throw in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy. And Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited. But the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second. The 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints. ""Since he's broken into the team I felt throughout the season it was what we were missing,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of Dewsbury-Hall. ""The team was missing intensity and pressure and he has brought that. He typifies everything we want to be. He has good industry, a cultured left foot and he's very honest."" Palace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in. Dewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up. When they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final. After scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.

77,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59403645,Burnley beat fellow strugglers Everton 3-2 in Premier League with Maxwel Cornet winner,"Maxwel Cornet scored a late winner to earn Burnley a vital win over fellow strugglers Everton in their bid to remain in the Premier League. The Ivorian capitalised upon two poor errors by Jordan Pickford and Ben Godfrey in the 85th minute to earn Sean Dyche's side only their fourth league win of the season. It lifted them to within one point of safety behind Frank Lampard's fourth-bottom side. In an entertaining and feisty encounter, the hosts took a 12th-minute lead when an unmarked Nathan Collins scored at the back post from a corner. But the advantage did not last long as Richarlison stroked home the first of two penalties in the 18th minute when Ashley Westwood was adjudged to have tripped Anthony Gordon. His second came four minutes before half-time and was tinged with controversy. Despite Vitaliy Mykolenko being tripped by Aaron Lennon, referee Mike Dean did not think it amounted to a spot-kick, until he was advised by the video assistant referee to review it on the monitor and then overturned his decision. The home support showed their disgust with that call, but their mood improved after the break when a great burst by Charlie Taylor led to him crossing for Jay Rodriguez's equaliser in the 57th minute. And although Everton created the better chances as the second half wore on, Cornet's seventh goal of the season could not have been more crucial as it sent the home fans wild. By contrast, the Everton players and boss Lampard left the field dejected, with their 68-year stay in the top flight under serious pressure. The victory was as morale-boosting for Burnley as it was devastating for Everton, who have earned only two wins from nine league games since Lampard replaced Rafael Benitez in January. With wet and blustery conditions, this had all the ingredients for a relegation scrap, something Burnley have had more experience of in recent years compared to the visitors. But Everton matched their opponents for much of the game, and were on top for most of the second half as they sought to earn a success that would boost their own survival hopes. Richarlison almost had a hat-trick when his overhead kick was saved by Nick Pope. Dominic Calvert-Lewin then headed over, while Gordon had a great opportunity blocked by James Tarkowski when clean through. However, as had been the case for much of the season, Everton were undone by individual errors as their wretched away form continued. Pickford mis-kicked a clearance out of play with his right foot, which led to the throw-in from which Burnley got their winner. It was made worse when defender Godfrey also sliced a clearance from Matej Vydra's cross, allowing Cornet to finish. Everton now face a daunting task to stay in the league - and relegation would cause huge problems for a team that has registered heavy losses over the past three years. Burnley's stay in the Premier League has been less established than their opponents, but they showed the grit and determination needed to stay up. In both halves they started well and caused all sorts of problems from set-pieces, scoring for the first time in five games through Collins' early goal. They might have had cause to complain about both penalties, which the home fans certainly felt were soft. The second, via VAR, saw them vent their frustrations at referee Dean. But Rodriguez's goal was crucial in re-affirming their status in the game, and they defended well to deny Everton another. The fact they were gifted the winner will matter little to Dyche or Burnley's support, with fireworks being let off outside the stadium in celebration at the end. They also know they have a run-in which appears more favourable than that faced by Everton.

78,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970969,Norwich City 2-0 Burnley: Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki keep Canaries' hope alive,"Bottom club Norwich City kept alive their slim hopes of avoiding a quick-fire return to the Championship and dealt a blow to fellow strugglers Burnley with a crucial win at Carrow Road. Pierre Lees-Melou's first goal since signing from Nice last July and Teemu Pukki's 86th-minute finish settled a tense relegation scrap - and earned the Canaries only their fifth Premier League victory since winning promotion last season. French midfielder Lees-Melou's ninth-minute deflected shot, which went in off the post, put the hosts on their way before Pukki drilled home the second to give Norwich a glimmer of hope of staying up, with Dean Smith's side now seven points from safety with seven matches left. Burnley had their moments, with Maxwel Cornet, the match-winning hero against Everton in midweek, missing a glorious chance from three yards out. In what was a must-win game, Norwich's defence came under relentless pressure at times but recorded back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time since October. ""We know it's hard and still a mountain but we have seven games to go now, so if you put a few wins together the table looks different,"" said Norwich boss Smith. The result leaves the Clarets 18th in the table, four points from safety with eight matches remaining. ""It's still the same challenge but a game down,"" Burnley manager Sean Dyche said. With struggling Everton beating Manchester United on Saturday, Norwich started Sunday's game 10 points from safety with eight matches left. But Smith's side passed the pressure test in style with a first win in nine league games. It will still require a monumental effort for them to survive. Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away). ""We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,"" added Smith. ""Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results."" Even before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs. Just as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back. Norwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley. In the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win. Cornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton. He looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season. ""We can't miss chances like that,"" Dyche said. ""He's done well for us this season. But we have to take the game on and be better than that in the front third."" Earlier, Cornet was denied by Tim Krul, but the Norwich keeper was not tested nearly enough in what was a high-stakes game. Dyche will still believe his side can climb out of trouble in the closing weeks, and they still have to meet fellow strugglers Watford on 30 April. But despite beating Everton on Wednesday, Burnley's task has become more difficult after this defeat at Carrow Road. ""It was a huge setback after a huge step forward,"" added Dyche. ""It might come easier in a strange way when people write you off. Virtually everyone will think we're done, but we don't think that.""

79,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60950088,Newcastle 1-0 Wolves: Chris Wood penalty earns key win for Eddie Howe's side,"Newcastle took a huge step towards Premier League survival as Chris Wood's penalty proved enough to beat a blunt Wolves side at St James' Park. The January signing slammed home the second-half winner at the Gallowgate End after being fouled by Wolves keeper Jose Sa at the end of a flowing team move. VAR checked if Sa had made adequate contact, after an earlier review had denied Wood in the first half, when he saw a goal chalked off because team-mate Bruno Guimaraes was narrowly offside in the build-up. Wolves failed to touch the ball in the Newcastle area in a dire opening half and manager Bruno Lage will wonder why it took until the 80th minute for his side to work home keeper Martin Dubravka when Fabio Silva forced a diving save. Newcastle - who saw Allan Saint-Maximin fire over the bar before Wood's goal and Guimaraes go close to adding a second - thoroughly deserved to end a run of three straight defeats with this win. It moves them 10 points clear of the relegation zone - though 18th-placed Burnley have two games in hand - while Wolves stay eighth and lose crucial ground in their push for a Europa League spot. ""It has put us in a stronger position but I still think we have work to do,"" boss Eddie Howe told BBC Sport. ""The home games are key for us but we want to pick up points wherever we go. ""At this stage of the season, it is about results. We are well aware we need to continue to get points. I think it's results over performances at the moment. There will be a time when we can evolve."" Howe had reason to be ecstatic, having taken over a side who were 19th in the table and five points from safety in November. The Newcastle boss has a quote which reads ""make each day your masterpiece"" on a wall in his office. This display was by no means joyful or pretty in its crafting, but it was one where Newcastle were always the likelier winners thanks to their consistent effort and sporadic quality across the 90 minutes. Wolves were fortunate when VAR chalked off Wood's close-range finish in the first half. Guimaraes raced on to a superb flick by substitute Miguel Almiron - on for the injured Ryan Fraser - and was fractionally offside. In the aftermath, Wolves captain Conor Coady could be seen screaming at team-mates in a bid to rise some kind of energy and application. It never really arrived and, gradually, the home side started to create half-chances after the break until Saint-Maximin and Joelinton combined to send Wood clear in the game's key moment. Wood's finish ensured Newcastle beat a side in the top half of the table for the first time this season and also carried them to a fourth successive home win - their best run since March 2019. Lage was left wondering how his side - with eight away wins to their name this season - could be so poor, particularly in the first half. ""In the second half we had clearer ideas,"" said Lage. ""The first five minutes of the second half, we were more aggressive in the final third than in the first 45 minutes. I think we missed a big opportunity."" Wolves are one win away from equalling their record mark of 16 victories in a Premier League-era top-flight season - set in 2018-19 - but their first-half display here set the tone for a night of despair. They delivered one cross in the first 45 minutes, compared with 14 after the break. In the opening half they completed 31% of their passes in the final third compared to 74% in the second period. It was a bemusing showing. A Europa League campaign is still well within reach but Wolves will need to find much more than they did here on a night where Newcastle took advantage to earn a key win in their bid for survival.

80,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963795,Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Son Heung-min hat-trick keeps Spurs on track for top four,"Son Heung-min's hat-trick kept Tottenham's Premier League top-four destiny in their own hands as Spurs produced a masterclass in clinical finishing to thrash Aston Villa. After the South Korea striker steered the visitors into an early lead, Spurs withstood a Villa onslaught to remain ahead at the interval with veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris making a string of superb saves. But they cruised to victory with a breathtaking, counter-attacking second-half performance as Son swept home two more fine finishes, either side of an equally elegant strike from Dejan Kulusevski. A fourth-successive win moved Antonio Conte's side three points above north London rivals Arsenal - beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - in the race for the fourth Champions League spot. Villa, meanwhile, were left to reflect on a fourth-straight defeat, despite dominating long spells of the first half, as returning striker Danny Ings wasted two glorious chances to bring them level. While the scoreline failed to reflect the overall balance of play - or chances created - in the West Midlands, it was Spurs who possessed the difference-making individual talents. Chief among them, of course, was Son, who seemingly never ceases to amaze - his first and third goals beautifully struck first-time efforts that both went in off the post, with a composed one-on-one finish to beat Emi Martinez in between. On-loan Juventus midfielder Kulusevski again impressed, teeing up Son for his hat-trick after firing an accurate finish through the legs of Tyrone Mings and past Martinez to put the result beyond doubt. Harry Kane took a back seat but was still involved in three of the goals, flicking on headers in the build-up to two, but Lloris was arguably Spurs' stand-out performer. The France goalkeeper made excellent first-half stops to thwart Jacob Ramsey's solo run and shot, John McGinn's 25-yard thunderbolt and Philippe Coutinho's cheeky near-post free-kick. Only three weeks ago, Spurs sat eighth, six points off fourth place - a position they now proudly hold, even if Arsenal do have a game in hand. Tottenham, though, have a superior goal difference - boosted by this win - and an easier run-in on paper with Brighton, Brentford, Burnley and Norwich among their final seven opponents, while Arsenal meet Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham among their next four. Tottenham are very much becoming Villa's bogey side - they have won 14 of the past 18 Premier League meetings between the sides and this was their seventh-straight success at Villa Park. Despite Son's early opener, it did not look like ending that way for the majority of the first half though as Villa laid siege to the visitors' goal. While Lloris deserves the plaudits for his impressive display, the hosts were also guilty of profligate finishing, with Ings - still yet to truly find his feet at Villa with just five goals since his £25m summer move from Southampton - the chief culprit. Twice he was afforded excellent chances on the volley - one from a dinked Coutinho set-piece and then an Ollie Watkins flick-on - but he scuffed both, one straight at Lloris and the other badly wide. Watkins also sent a free header over from six yards as Steven Gerrard suffered his heaviest defeat as Villa boss.

81,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60012767,Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham: Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva score for Blues,"Two second-half goals, including a brilliant strike from Hakim Ziyech, helped Chelsea beat Tottenham for the third time in three weeks. After a goalless first half, Ziyech scored within two minutes of the restart, superbly curling the ball into the top corner from 20 yards after a fine run from Callum Hudson-Odoi. The hosts doubled their lead eight minutes later when defender Thiago Silva headed in from Mason Mount's excellent free-kick delivery. In the first half, Tottenham thought they had taken the lead as Harry Kane slotted past Kepa Arrizabalaga, but the goal was ruled out as the England striker was adjudged to have pushed Silva to the ground. This victory follows Chelsea's wins in both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Spurs, cruising through 3-0 on aggregate to set up a Wembley final against Liverpool. It is Tottenham's first defeat in the league since Antonio Conte, a Premier League and FA Cup winner while in charge of Chelsea, replaced the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo in November. For Chelsea this was a welcome return to winning ways in the league. They were top of the Premier League after a 2-1 win at Watford on 1 December but a run of only 11 points from their next nine games has severely damaged their hopes of becoming English champions for the first time since Conte guided them to the title in 2016-17. They remain third and are 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, although Thomas Tuchel's side will not play in the league again until 19 February as a result of their participation in the Fifa Club World Cup, following their Champions League success. Conte opted for a back four, the first time he has done so in a league game at Tottenham, as he looked to keep it tight and hit his former team on the counter attack. But the hosts nearly broke through inside the opening minute when Romelu Lukaku shot over on the turn, before Chelsea failed to convert further chances through Hudson-Odoi, Silva and Ziyech. Lukaku, who has only scored eight times in 24 appearances in all competitions following a £97.5m move from Inter Milan last summer, had another glorious chance following good work by Mount, but missed the ball when eight yards out. While Conte was unhappy with the officials for ruling out Spurs' first-half goal, Tuchel was also furious that Japhet Tanganga, who had already been booked, was not shown a second yellow card when he had a hold of Hudson-Odoi's shirt late in the first half. It was the second time Chelsea thought their opponents should have had a player sent off after Matt Doherty had earlier caught Malang Sarr by standing on his ankle - but a video assistant referee check decided it had been accidental. However seventh-placed Tottenham, who would have moved into the top four with a win, saw their resistance broken early in the second half thanks to Ziyech's wonder strike, before Silva's goal took the game beyond them. Chelsea could have won by a bigger margin as Lukaku, Mount and Cesar Azpilicueta missed chances. Tottenham scored two injury-time goals in their last match to come from behind and beat Leicester 3-2 in a remarkable match on Wednesday but there was to be no dramatic repeat at Stamford Bridge. Arrizabalaga did well to keep out Kane's powerful header late on as Chelsea maintained their clean sheet for their first Premier League win in three matches.

Uruguay midfielder Bentancur, 24, joins for an initial £15.9m - which could rise by £5m - on a deal until 2026. Sweden winger Kulusevski, 21, joins on an 18-month loan for an £8.3m fee with an option to buy for £29.2m. France midfielder Ndombele returns to Lyon for the rest of the season - three years after leaving to join Spurs. Spain winger Bryan Gil, 20 - who only joined last July - has joined Valencia on loan until the end of the season. Argentine midfielder Giovani lo Celso has also joined Villarreal on loan for the rest of the campaign. Ndombele, 25, joined Tottenham for a club record 60m euros (£53.8m). Bentancur is a former Aston Villa target and is currently on World Cup qualifying duty with his country. BBC Sport's Alex Howell It's been a busy day for Tottenham who have so far secured two signings and let Ndombele leave. However, that's not the only thing going on at Spurs at the moment. I'm outside the Tottenham Hotspur training ground where a group of around 30 supporters are protesting against the club's ownership and board.

83,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60207597,Everton transfer news: Tottenham's Dele Alli joins on permanent deal,"Everton have signed Dele Alli from Tottenham on a two-and-a-half-year deal for a fee that could reach £40m. New Everton boss Frank Lampard made the signing of midfielder Alli a priority and believes he can rebuild a career that has stalled in recent years. The 25-year-old, who has played 37 times for England, made six appearances under Spurs boss Antonio Conte after the Italian's arrival in November. The first £10m of his transfer fee will be payable after 20 appearances. ""I'm delighted to have signed for Everton, a huge club with a great fanbase and history,"" said Alli, who scored 67 goals in 269 games at Spurs. ""I'm eager to get started and can't wait for my first game in an Everton shirt. ""I'm looking forward to helping the team and the opportunity to work with the new manager Frank Lampard."" He is cup-tied for Everton's FA Cup fourth round match against Brentford on Saturday, but could make his debut against Newcastle in the Premier League on 8 February. Everton were forced to make the deal permanent because their loan quota is full after adding Manchester United's Donny van de Beek to the recent signing of Anwar El Ghazi from Aston Villa. Alli, who won the most recent of his England caps in 2019, joined Tottenham from MK Dons in 2015. He scored 10 goals in 33 Premier League games during his debut campaign before hitting 18 in the 2016-17 season, earning him two PFA Young Player of the Year awards. Having been a regular under Mauricio Pochettino, however, Alli fell out of favour following Jose Mourinho's appointment, starting only seven league games last season. The attacking midfielder started the opening six Premier League games of the current campaign during Nuno Espirito Santo's brief spell in charge, but struggled for game time under Conte. Everton Under-23s signed England Under-20 goalkeeper Billy Crellin from League One side Fleetwood Town on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Crellin, 21, was part of England's Under-17 World Cup winning side in 2017 and played 16 matches on loan at Bolton last season as they won promotion from League Two. Everton have also loaned midfielder Lewis Warrington to Tranmere until the end of the season. ",positive,liverpool,0
84,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357463,Man City 2-3 Tottenham: Harry Kane gives Spurs stunning late win over Premier League leaders,"Harry Kane's stoppage-time goal gave Tottenham a stunning victory over Premier League leaders Manchester City in a chaotic finale at Etihad Stadium. City thought they had rescued a point moments earlier when Riyad Mahrez converted a penalty awarded after a VAR review, but there was another twist to come and Kane, predictably, provided it. The Spurs striker, whom City had tried to sign in the summer, rose highest to nod home Dejan Kulusevski's cross in the 95th minute and spark wild celebrations from the travelling fans. It was a dramatic end to a pulsating match that had already seen Spurs pegged back twice, with City running out of time to find a third equaliser. Tottenham's first goal came after only four minutes, with Son Heun-min beating the offside trap and squaring the ball for Kulusevski to score on his first start for the club. City levelled when Hugo Lloris spilled Raheem Sterling's cross and Ilkay Gundogan pounced to turn in the loose ball, but they could not turn their possession into more goals. Spurs continued to threaten on the break in the second half and were back in front on the hour mark when Kane finished a move he had started, running onto Son's cross to fire past Ederson from close range. Kane was denied again by Ederson and then had another strike ruled out for offside but it appeared City would have the last word when they were awarded a spot-kick at the end of the 90 minutes. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot for a handball by Cristian Romero after a VAR review and it seemed Mahrez had salvaged a point. Kane had other ideas, and his winner means City's lead at the top over Liverpool, who have a game in hand, is down to six points. Kane has been below his best for much of the season but his performance here was a reminder of why City boss Pep Guardiola was so keen to sign him at the start of the season. The England captain did not just score twice, he was the key man in his side's gameplan, constantly dropping deep to collect the ball and finding willing runners ahead of him. It was a display that also demonstrated why Spurs chairman Daniel Levy fought so hard to keep his side's talisman. Kane was absent and seemed set on a move to the Etihad when Tottenham beat City on the opening day of the season. This time, it was the same result but he was the main man. His side's fans serenaded their captain at the final whistle, singing ""Harry Kane, he's one of our own"" as he and his team-mates celebrated a famous victory in front of the travelling supporters. Tottenham had lost their previous three league games and slid down the table, but this win reignites their bid for a top-four finish, and in style. This was City's first league defeat since October, when they lost at home to Crystal Palace, yet they did not play badly against Spurs - instead this goes down as a masterclass from Spurs boss Antonio Conte. Guardiola gambled by continuing to play with a high line against a manager known for orchestrating quick breakaways and, this time, he lost. For long spells all of City's players were camped in Tottenham's half, probing for a weakness. All it took for Tottenham was to win the ball back and, usually via Kane, they would trigger a lightning counter-attack. It was a tactic that led to Spurs' first two goals but the biggest sucker-punch was saved for last, with Conte's side finding the winner when most people in the Etihad were expecting a charge from the home side.

Spurs lost for the fourth time in five Premier League games as Ben Mee's 71st-minute header boosted Burnley's battle against relegation. At the final whistle, a disappointed Conte, 52, headed straight to the dressing room on his own. And he said: ""I came here to help the club and if the problem could be the coach I'm ready to go, no problem."" Conte emerged for his post-match media engagements, but refused to talk about the game and instead spoke about his current plight. ""I am not used to this situation. I am trying everything but the situation is not changing,"" added the Italian. ""I am available and open with the club to do what the club wants. ""I want to help the club, I work a lot, I work very hard. I am giving 20 hours a day to Tottenham and the other four hours I sleep but it is not enough. ""The performance can be good and the commitment was good but we lost. For me the situation is unacceptable. To lose four of five [games] for Tottenham has to be a disaster. ""I came in to try to improve the situation. Maybe in this moment I am not so good to improve the situation. I am too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way. ""For sure we are to speak and have a conversation with the club to try and find the best solution to help the team not have this type of situation. ""It is the right moment to make assessment. I repeat, I am really frustrated."" Conte has only been in charge for 22 games after the former Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan boss was appointed successor to Nuno Espirito Santo in November. However, he has suggested recently he is not happy with the situation he has inherited at Tottenham. Conte did try to deflect some critical comments he made  during an interview with Sky Italia, stating it was due to an incorrect translation. But with Spurs in eighth place and seven points off fourth, his future is now uncertain. When asked specifically by another media outlet whether he would still be in charge for Saturday's game at Leeds, Conte walked away from the interview without answering the question. ""In the last five games, we are playing like we are in relegation [trouble],"" he said. ""This is the reality. Maybe there is something wrong. ""I want to take responsibility. If I have that, I'm open for every decision. I have ambition, I hate to lose. To take my salary, it is not right at this moment. ""I want to help Tottenham, from the first day I arrive, but four defeats in five... This is the first time in my life this type of situation has happened.

86,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61002171,Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Benzema hat-trick puts Spaniards in charge in Champions League last eight,"Chelsea's hold on the Champions League hangs precariously after Karim Benzema's hat-trick put Real Madrid in a position of power following the quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti made a winning return to the club where he won the Premier League and FA Cup double after veteran France striker Benzema delivered his latest masterclass. Benzema, 34 and fresh from the treble that sunk Paris St-Germain in the last 16, punished holders Chelsea with two magnificent headers in the space of three minutes midway through the first half. Kai Havertz's header gave Chelsea hope before the break but keeper Edouard Mendy's poor clearance seconds after the restart gifted Benzema his third to put Real in command of the tie before the second leg at the Bernabeu next Tuesday (12 April). Chelsea battled to the end of this first leg but were always fighting an uphill task after they were hit by Benzema's brilliant one-two and then saw their hopes of mounting a comeback wrecked by a self-inflicted wound. Real had already delivered a warning about the danger they posed when Vinicius Junior hit the bar but that went unheeded as he provided the cross for Benzema's flying headed opener. And once Benzema had confirmed his aerial threat with a second, Chelsea were always vulnerable against a side who are the masters of these Champions League situations. Havertz, the match-winner in last season's Champions League final win against Manchester City, gave a subdued Stamford Bridge some hope but the entire destiny of the tie may have turned in the opening 40 seconds after the interval. Mendy, normally so reliable, made an expensive misjudgement when he raced from goal only to send a weak pass in the direction of Antonio Rudiger. The defender was unable to gain control and the predatory Benzema was in like a flash to roll the ball into the unguarded net with Mendy looking on in anguish. It came just after Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel had introduced Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech at the start of the second half to build on Havertz's goal, but the changes were undermined before they had any chance to take effect. Tuchel later brought on Romelu Lukaku in a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation but his struggles were summed up when he sent a weak header wide with one of Chelsea's best chances of the night. Chelsea have demonstrated an ability to overcome adversity in the past but with Real holding a two-goal advantage going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, it would rank as one of their finest achievements if they were to reach the last four from this position. Real Madrid may be runaway leaders in La Liga but Carlo Ancelotti's side were regarded as rank outsiders as they chase a 14th triumph in this competition in its guises as the European Cup and Champions League. Yet, after the dramatic comeback against the odds to knock out Paris St-Germain in the last 16, with this show of experience and class at Stamford Bridge they demonstrated once again that their credentials are dismissed at your peril. And in Ancelotti, for all the speculation surrounding his long-term future at the Bernabeu, they have a leader who has demonstrated his expertise by winning this trophy three times with AC Milan and Real. The coach and Real's players showed they are old hands at this and how they punished Chelsea, with Benzema and the 36-year-old Croatia maestro Luka Modric at their heart, to take a giant stride towards the semi-final. Benzema gets better with age, scoring two headers of the highest class before poaching a third goal, while Modric retains that priceless ability to control the tempo of games, retain possession and always make the right choice from the options available. Ancelotti will take nothing for granted but the veteran Italian, who flew into London on the day of the game after recovering from Covid-19, cut a highly satisfied figure at the final whistle.

The home side were superb from the outset and led inside 10 minutes when Danjuma stabbed in from close range. Francis Coquelin had a goal ruled out while Gerard Moreno hit the post as Villarreal pushed for a second. German champions Bayern were well below par and did not manage a shot on target until the second half. Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 51 goals for club and country this season, was kept quiet by a well-organised Villarreal defence as the hosts followed up their impressive win against Juventus in the previous round with another big result. But as poor as Bayern were they will feel they can turn things round against the Spanish side in the return leg on Tuesday, 12 April. They will need to play significantly better than they did in this game as they suffered their first Champions League defeat away from home since 2017. Indeed, Bayern's players will likely come away relieved that they only have a one-goal deficit as Villarreal had a plethora of chances to win by a bigger margin. Coquelin was narrowly offside before seeing his cross fly over Manuel Neuer's head and as well as Moreno's shot against the post they really should have got a second in the final few minutes when substitute Alfonso Pedraza shot wide from close range. Kingsley Coman saw an effort saved by Geronimo Rulli at his near post in stoppage time but an equaliser would have been supremely harsh on brilliant Villarreal, who understandably celebrated wildly when the full-time whistle was blown.

88,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883947,Liverpool 2-0 Watford: Diogo Jota & Fabinho secure 10th straight Premier League win,"Liverpool beat struggling Watford to complete a remarkable, albeit short, return to the top of the Premier League. The Reds trailed Manchester City by 14 points on 15 January, but a 10th straight league win in the early kick-off at a raucous Anfield took them above Pep Guardiola's side, whom they meet on 10 April. However, City won 2-0 at struggling Burnley later on Saturday to restore their one-point lead with eight games left. Diogo Jota's 20th club goal of the season and his third in as many appearances in a Liverpool shirt - 34 seconds after Alisson made a huge save to deny Juraj Kucka - helped seal a tense win. Portugal forward Jota jumped between two Watford defenders to meet a cross and head past Ben Foster as Joe Gomez marked only his second league start of the season with an assist. Fabinho's late penalty - after Kucka's rugby-style challenge on Jota - secured the points. Despite sealing a potentially significant win, Liverpool were not at their fluent best. Joao Pedro wasted a glorious chance to equalise in the second half as Watford remain third from bottom, three points from safety. Liverpool returned to the top of the table - albeit for a couple of hours - for the first time since early October, and at the start of the final push towards what would be a historic quadruple. They face Benfica in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in Portugal on Tuesday before going to City in what many are billing as the game that could decide the title. Liverpool, already Carabao Cup winners, started the penultimate month of the campaign - in which they also face City at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals - with a hard-earned win in a game where the result was more important than the performance. Alisson had already denied Cucho Hernandez when he spread himself to block Kucka, before Jota pounced moments later. Unlike team-mate Mohamed Salah, Jota will be going to the World Cup later this year after helping Portugal beat North Macedonia in a play-off in midweek. While a tired looking Salah, who was pelted with missiles and targeted by green laser pointers as Egypt missed out on the World Cup to Senegal on Tuesday, was replaced after 69 minutes, Jota could have had a hat-trick. Denied a second goal by Foster before half-time, Jota headed another chance over the bar in front of the Kop. Tension was replaced by relief when Fabinho's 89th-minute penalty - awarded after referee Stuart Attwell watched a replay on the pitchside monitor - ensured Liverpool got the job done. Despite a 20th league defeat of the season, Watford will take some comfort that Liverpool were unable to relax until Fabinho struck. However, the Hornets know they have to be more clinical in their final eight games if they are to stand any chance of staying up. While Kucka was denied by a fine save, Pedro should have equalised in the second half after Watford beat Liverpool's offside trap. Roy Hodgson's side face a difficult end-of-season run-in which includes matches at leaders City and Chelsea. Although they host Leeds on 9 April and Brentford on 16 April, they have picked up only seven points from a possible 42 at Vicarage Road this season.

89,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883948,Brighton 0-0 Norwich: Neal Maupay penalty miss costs hosts,"Neal Maupay's missed penalty summed up Brighton's frustration as they were held to a goalless draw at home by Norwich, the Premier League's bottom side. For all the chances they created, Graham Potter's side couldn't find the net - although they did end a run of six straight league defeats. Norwich, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of safety after a passive display. Maupay's big chance came just shy of the half-hour mark, after Sam Byram's handball was spotted by referee Simon Hooper. The French striker, though, shot high over the bar to mocking cheers from the travelling supporters. Brighton had created chances before that, with good play down the left from Leandro Trossard leading to a mishit shot from Maupay, before Danny Welbeck saw a close-range effort blocked. The hosts' lack of cutting edge continued to frustrate them after Maupay's spot-kick miss. Solly March and Alexis Mac Allister failed to hit the target numerous times, and the final ball was badly lacking. Trossard's attempts to spark the hosts into life led to a glorious chance for Joel Veltman 10 minutes after the restart. His quick feet won a corner, which the Dutchman headed goalwards, only to be denied by fellow countryman Tim Krul at point-blank range. Maupay and Veltman were denied by a Norwich rearguard marshalled superbly by Grant Hanley, in the face of relentless second-half pressure from the hosts. In the end, the Seagulls could find no way through, and remain goalless at home since mid-January. Indeed, Norwich almost stole victory when Milot Rashica blazed Teemu Pukki's cross over the bar inside the area. Brighton had 29 shots and more than 60% possession but crucially only hit the target four times. That has been a long-running issue for Potter's side, who again showcased their quality in the build-up, but were let down in front of goal. It simply wasn't Maupay's day, from the moment he miscued his effort with the goal gaping in the first half. Goalkeeper Krul's mind-games before his spot-kick clearly paid off before it sailed over the bar. There were bright moments from Trossard and Mac Allister, while Tariq Lamptey clearly thrives in a more advanced role on the right, but this was not the way Brighton will have wanted to end their losing run. There was plenty of commitment on show from Norwich; they battled well and remained strong in defence. Krul and Hanley in particular were superb in keeping Brighton at bay, as the Canaries ended their own run of six successive league defeats. But they remain far from safety and although there were a couple of chances to win it, they couldn't sustain an attacking threat as Brighton put them under intense pressure. While they will take a point, their long-term prospects look ominous - and it increasingly looks as if they will see a third successive Premier League stint ended after just one season.

90,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883950,Burnley 0-2 Man City: Kevin de Bruyne & Ilkay Gundogan secure win,"Manchester City made an instant return to the top of the Premier League with a comfortable win over struggling Burnley. Liverpool's victory over Watford earlier on Saturday had knocked the defending champions off the summit for the first time since 4 December, but Pep Guardiola's side responded in impressive style at Turf Moor. It took only five minutes for City to take the lead when Raheem Sterling knocked Rodri's cross into the path of Kevin de Bruyne, who time to pick his spot and fire into the roof of the net. Sterling and De Bruyne combined again for the second goal, but this time it was Ilkay Gundogan who provided the finish - a cool volley past Nick Pope after Sterling found him in space inside the area. By now, City were in complete control and could afford to see Sterling, Jack Grealish and substitute Gabriel Jesus waste excellent chances because Burnley never looked remotely capable of mounting a comeback. The home side finally managed a shot on target after 75 minutes, when substitute Jay Rodriguez brought a diving save from Ederson, but they can take few positives from a fourth successive defeat other than the fact they avoided significant damage to their goal difference. Burnley remain rooted in the bottom three, while City can head into next Sunday's top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool knowing they will stay in first place if they avoid defeat. City have got a huge week ahead, with the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, before the visit of Jurgen Klopp's in-form Liverpool next Sunday - the start of a sequence where they play both teams twice. Those are the games which will define City's season, but they needed to focus on this test first - and they passed it almost flawlessly. De Bruyne's early goal settled the nerves of the travelling fans after Josh Brownhill sent an early header flashing wide for the hosts, and the points never looked in doubt from that point. For long periods Burnley did not even get near the ball let alone City's penalty area, while City seemed content to keep possession rather than put much effort into chasing further goals. They still created a host of second-half chances, with their failure to finish them the only way their performance could be faulted, although Jesus went extremely close to a third when he cracked a volley against the post. It did not matter here, but they cannot afford to be so wasteful against Atletico or Liverpool in the days to come. Burnley also have two vital games on the horizon, with relegation rivals Everton the visitors here on Wednesday, before the Clarets travel to bottom-of-the-table Norwich next weekend. This was hardly the ideal preparation because Burnley were completely outclassed, but they at least gave their fans something to shout about in the second half when Maxwel Cornet came off the bench. Cornet added some much-needed spark to the Burnley attack and his link-up play with Wout Weghorst at last meant City's defenders were occasionally occupied, although Ederson's goal remained rarely at risk.

91,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883946,Chelsea 1-4 Brentford: Christian Eriksen scores first Bees goal in comeback win,"Christian Eriksen scored his first goal for Brentford as they closed in on Premier League safety by outclassing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Brentford produced a magnificent display to record their first win over Chelsea since 1939 as they came from behind to stun Thomas Tuchel's side with three goals in 10 minutes in the second half before adding a fourth late on to humiliate the Champions League holders. The Bees enjoyed the better of the first half but were punished for not taking chances when Antonio Rudiger flashed a brilliant 30-yard finish past David Raya three minutes after the restart. Brentford's response was instant and spectacular as Vitaly Janelt hammered home the equaliser two minutes later before the golden moment in the 54th minute as Bryan Mbeumo squared a pass for Eriksen to score in front of the joyous visiting support. And Brentford were not finished there, Janelt breaking clear again on the hour to beat Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy before substitute Yoane Wissa completed their glory day in the closing moments. Brentford are now on 33 points, 11 clear of Watford, who are third from bottom, and can now surely contemplate Premier League football again next season. Eriksen provided the story of this truly remarkable Brentford win with that first goal for the club since making his comeback with the Bees after suffering a cardiac arrest playing for Denmark against Finland at Euro 2020 in June. It was a wonderful moment but was simply the flourish on a quite brilliant team performance from Brentford, who thoroughly deserved one of the greatest victories in the club's history. The margin of the scoreline did not flatter them. Thomas Frank's side took the fight to Chelsea from the first whistle, with striker Ivan Toney having three presentable chances as they went right on the front foot. If there was any disappointment, it was the fact they did not cash in on that superiority, and they paid for it when Rudiger fired Chelsea in front. Brentford's response was truly outstanding, giving them the result that surely means they will stay in the Premier League next season. And there is no doubt Eriksen's presence has lifted those around him. Brentford have won all three games he has started since making his comeback as a substitute against Newcastle United in late February. Eriksen may be the star name but this was the complete all-round display, with Toney giving Chelsea's vulnerable defence a torrid time and Janelt providing the cutting edge. Brentford were also resolute in defence, with Frank and his players fully deserving the huge ovation they received from their ecstatic fans after the final whistle. Chelsea can have no complaints about this defeat or the embarrassing scoreline as they were abject in a performance that was completely out of character with their recent efforts. Tuchel's side won their six matches in March but were never fully switched on from first to last and paid the price. If there is any consolation for Tuchel - and he will have to search very hard to find any - it is that this did not come in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. If they repeat this horrible defensive performance, and indeed their entire shambolic effort, their hopes of retaining the trophy they won last June might be over. Despite the usually reliable presence of Rudiger and Thiago Silva, Chelsea were never unable to control Brentford, who ran them ragged and actually should have scored more than four goals. Chelsea must hope this is a blip, rather like their 5-2 home loss to the eventually relegated West Brom last season, because they cannot afford this when Real Madrid come here this week. The likes of Karim Benzema would have been licking their lips watching this defensive fiasco.

92,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883949,"Leeds 1-1 Southampton: Whites will 'only get better', says boss Jesse Marsch","Leeds boss Jesse Marsch believes his side will ""only get better"" despite them being denied a third straight win by James Ward-Prowse's free-kick in a hard-fought game with Southampton. The Whites were bright in the early stages and took the lead at Elland Road through Jack Harrison's poked finish after Saints keeper Fraser Forster had failed to claim a Raphinha cross. But their recent progress was checked when England midfielder Ward-Prowse added another superb free-kick to his ever-growing showreel to give the visitors a point that their overall performance deserved, ending a run of three straight league defeats. While making it clear that there is still much work to be done, Marsch was pleased with the performance, but not the point that leaves his side eight points above the bottom three. ""It was a real fight,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Southampton play intensely. I know the coach well and he has done a good job with his team. ""For the most part I thought we defended well. We were organised. Maybe in the last phase of the match we were unlucky not to find more. ""The group is confident. They are committed to playing the way I would like them to play. Our work every day is fantastic, I really like being here with this team. ""I think we are only going to grow and get better. In terms of tactically and how I want a game to look like, that was one of our better performances."" United were certainly assisted by the return of captain Liam Cooper, who was impressive starting at centre-back, and England midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who came off the bench in the second half. Both were playing their first matches since 5 December. There have been some superb free-kick takers in Premier League history, but Ward-Prowse is up there with the very best. He is able to make a discipline others find difficult look startlingly simplistic. Such is the England player's reputation that as soon as Kyle Walker-Peters was fouled near the edge of the Leeds box by Luke Ayling, a worried murmur spread among the home fans. They knew what was coming. Ward-Prowse duly delivered, curling the ball over the wall and past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to draw Saints level and ultimately earn them a point from an entertaining, end-to-end contest. Last season, the Saints midfielder was the only player in the Premier League to score more than one goal direct from a free-kick - managing four. This season, he leads the way with three, one more than Newcastle's Kieran Trippier. Not that they really need the points, with their tally of 36 surely enough to keep them clear of any relegation trouble, but Saints will feel they could have taken all three. But for a Meslier save and Stuart Dallas clearance off the line under pressure, Che Adams would have levelled before Ward-Prowse's moment of magic. Mohamed Elyounoussi also shot straight at Meslier from a good position in the box in the first half and they sparked some desperate last-ditch defending from the home side on a number of occasions after the break. ""It was an intense game and a bit ping pong in some moments,"" said Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, whose side had lost their previous four matches. ""I think in the end we had the better chances to win it. We had the better parts of our game. It was a step forward for us that in such an intense game we had the chance to win it. ""Very important result after a tough run of tight games, to come back with a draw here. ""We had a good break, we were fresh today. We have eight games to go and it is a good chance to finish the season in the top 10 but every week is a good challenge."" The visitors could easily have lost the game too, though, with Leeds comfortably the better side early on but unable to make clear openings count. Diego Llorente headed wide from a corner, Dan James saw a shot saved, Mateusz Klich had a shot deflect wide and Harrison had the ball in the net, only for it to be ruled out for a shove on a defender by Rodrigo. The home side kept going right until the end in hope of a late winner for the third game in a row, sending on Joe Gelhardt - whose 94th-minute goal gave them victory over Norwich before the international break. But it was not to be for a third time and Marsch's side were forced to settle for a point gained on their relegation rivals rather than the three that would have really given them some breathing space in the battle at the bottom. They next travel to Watford for a game that will go a long way to deciding how deep into the season Leeds' relegation concerns go.

93,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883952,Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa: Steven Gerrard unhappy as Wolves boost European hopes,"Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard warned his players they are playing for their futures after they lost at Wolves - a result that boosted the hosts' hopes of playing in Europe next season. Wolves had looked in control when Spain defender Jonny struck a crisp half-volley after only seven minutes before Villa defender Ashley Young inadvertently headed into his own net to make it 2-0. A controversial 86th-minute penalty from England striker Ollie Watkins, after he was fouled by goalkeeper Jose Sa, gave Villa hope of leaving Molineux with a draw. They had a chance to grab an unlikely point, but Matty Cash's 95th-minute volley was saved by Sa. However, Gerrard, whose side have now lost three games in a row for the first time since he replaced the sacked Dean Smith in November, was unhappy with his players. ""It's a game we never turned up for,"" the former England captain said. ""We're playing Wolves, a local rival, but you can't come to derbies at half time. ""We're looking like a 45-minute team and that's on me - we gifted Wolves two goals. I've got to fix it and I will fix it. ""The players in the building have to help me fix it now. If not, we will get players in who will help me fix it."" The victory took Wolves above West Ham and five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal in the final Champions League spot - although the Gunners have three games in hand. For Wolves, it was a third victory in seven games, even if in the end it was tighter than they might have liked. They are now seventh in the Premier League and, if they stay there, will qualify for next season's Europa Conference League - as long as Crystal Palace do not win the FA Cup (in which case the Eagles would play in Europe instead). Wolves are trying to secure European football for the second time in four seasons after reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2019-20. Despite being without midfielder Ruben Neves, out for a month with a knee injury, and suspended striker Raul Jimenez after his red card against Leeds, Bruno Lage's side looked a threat every time they attacked against a surprisingly vulnerable Villa defence. Wolves went ahead after only seven minutes when Villa's John McGinn slipped and lost possession before team-mate Ezri Konsa also fell over. That enabled the hosts to counter, with Jonny scoring with a great strike after Lucas Digne had blocked Fabio Silva's shot. It was Jonny's second goal in consecutive matches in only his sixth appearance of the season, after being out for 10 months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The hosts doubled their lead in the 36th minute in fortunate circumstances when Young, on in place of the injured Digne, slipped when trying to deal with Marcal's left-wing cross and headed into his own net. Wolves threw away a 2-0 lead against Leeds before losing 3-2 on 18 March, and their fans would have been fearing a repeat late on at Molineux. Villa's best chances in the first half came from long distance, with Philippe Coutinho narrowly firing a free-kick over and Leon Bailey having an excellent effort tipped over by goalkeeper Jose Sa. Watkins, who scored for England in their 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday, twice had chances to halve the deficit before Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan almost added another for the hosts within two minutes of coming on, but shot wide. When Watkins was fouled by Sa, he converted the penalty for his eighth Premier League goal of the season to set up a frantic finale. Poland right-back Cash had the chance to equalise, but his injury-time volley was excellently saved by Sa. ""It's the same feeling we had against Leeds,"" said Wolves boss Bruno Lage. ""That's why 2-0 is so dangerous, especially in this competition. ""I'm happy because we won. We played the way we wanted to play. The game plan was perfect. ""We need that mentality to kill the game, score the third goal and not to give hope to the opponent."" Villa dropped to 10th in the Premier League but do not have much to play for, now 13 points behind Wolves and 14 clear of the relegation zone.

94,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883951,Manchester United 1-1 Leicester City: Hosts' Champions League hopes dented by Foxes,"Manchester United suffered another blow in the battle for a Champions League spot as they were held by Leicester at Old Trafford. The damage could have been even worse for Ralf Rangnick's men as Leicester were denied a potential winner 10 minutes from time when referee Andre Marriner was sent to the screen by the video assistant referee, with Marriner overturning James Maddison's effort for a foul on Raphael Varane in the build-up. United could count themselves fortunate to get a point. After a drab opening period, Kelechi Iheanacho scored a superb 63rd-minute opener when he met superb Maddison's left-wing cross with a fine diving header, which sent the ball back into the far corner. The Foxes' advantage lasted just three minutes, with Brazilian midfielder Fred on hand to convert the rebound after Bruno Fernandes' shot had been pushed into his path by Kasper Schmeichel. It was a disappointing outcome for the hosts, who are now three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, having played two games more and with a trip to the Gunners, plus encounters with Liverpool and Chelsea, still to come. It says everything about the kind of season Marcus Rashford has had that even with the ill Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood missing this game completely, the England man was only given a seat on the bench. Rashford's future has been debated long and hard over the last few weeks. With a contract that is due to expire next year, although there is an option to extend to 2024, a decision over Rashford will be one of the new manager's first tasks when he takes over. The theory is a proper break, followed by an intense pre-season and a chance to play regularly in his best position, on the left, would correct many of Rashford's problems. At the moment though, he just needs to deliver. And, asked to occupy the number nine position when he was introduced for the final 35 minutes, Rashford continued to look ill at ease. Rangnick provided detailed instructions as Rashford waited to come on and then, together with technical director Darren Fletcher, offered more as the game entered its final 20 minutes. Fleetingly, it looked like Rashford's world would turn. Deep into stoppage time, he picked the ball up just outside the box and drove at the Leicester defence. But just as space opened up to shoot, an offside Anthony Elanga got in his way and the chance was gone. Given Leicester's only hope of salvaging something tangible out of this injury-ravaged campaign comes through the Europa Conference League, starting with Thursday's quarter-final first leg with PSV Eindhoven, they could be forgiven their listless start. Brendan Rodgers was buoyed by the return of Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana, who started together in defence for the first time since last May's FA Cup final. Given the paucity of what the home side presented them with, Leicester grew in confidence and Iheanacho should really have put them in front before the break when he screwed a shot from the edge of the area wide after the Nigerian had been left totally unmarked. Victory would have been the first time Leicester had won successive away games at Old Trafford and the disappointment from Rodgers' perspective would be that his team did not hold on to their lead long enough. Yet, even after United's equaliser, they carried the greater threat. Iheanacho chipped over from an acute angle after Jadon Sancho's stray backpass had sent him through before Fofana brought a superb save out of David de Gea with a header that was bound for the top corner. Rodgers thought Maddison had won it and questioned fourth official Martin Atkinson when the goal was ruled out. He was still unconvinced even after the decision had been explained.

95,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48859841,Rodri: Manchester City pay £62.8m release clause for Atletico Madrid's Spain midfielder,"Manchester City are set to sign Spain midfielder Rodri from Atletico Madrid for a club record £62.8m after paying his release clause, say the La Liga side. Atletico said the player's lawyers and representatives from City paid the release clause to La Liga on Wednesday. Rodri, 23, has therefore terminated his contract with Atletico, which was due to run until June 2023. It will beat City's previous record of £60m in signing Riyad Mahrez in 2018. Rodri joined Atletico in May 2018 after three years at Villarreal and made 34 league appearances as they finished second in Spain's top flight. He made his international debut in a friendly against Germany last year and has made six senior international appearances. City had made Rodri one of their main targets this summer, with manager Pep Guardiola keen to sign a defensively minded player to bolster the Premier League champions' squad. On Wednesday City announced that they have brought full-back Angelino back to the club from PSV Eindhoven. The 22-year-old Spaniard left City for PSV Eindhoven in 2018 after failing to make a Premier League appearance in his six years with the club. City inserted a £5.35m buy-back clause in the deal, a figure far below the Spaniard's market value given his form at PSV last season. Guardiola has decided to activate the clause in order to bolster his options at left-back, which also include Oleksandr Zinchenko, who signed a long-term contract earlier this summer, and Benjamin Mendy, a £52m arrival from Monaco in 2017. Angelino has signed a four-year deal which will keep him at Etihad Stadium until 2023. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page. ",positive,liverpool,0
96,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61005187,Man City 1-0 Atletico Madrid: 'Brilliant' Phil Foden shows there are no limits to his potential,"In a crucial week for Manchester City they need their star players to stand up. Kevin de Bruyne and Phil Foden did exactly that on Tuesday as the two combined to give Pep Guardiola's side a narrow 1-0 Champions League quarter-final lead over Atletico Madrid heading into next week's second leg in Spain. Though the Belgium international scored the goal, the post-match analysis centred around Foden, whose impact from the bench was almost instant, creating the goal 79 seconds after coming on in the second half. It came when the 21-year-old showed quick feet and slipped the ball between the legs of Reinildo and into the path of De Bruyne to coolly slot into the corner. ""He came on with composure and had the clarity to cause havoc,"" former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport. ""He came off the bench and was bang at it. ""Ninety-nine per cent of players come off the bench and don't do anything, but the ones who do have the desire and concentration - within 80 seconds he decides the match."" City manager Guardiola added: ""Phil has a special quality [to change the game]. His space in the first steps are massive and he had the composure to make an incredible assist to Kevin. ""Phil was brilliant, we knew it in the beginning. With Gabriel Jesus and him, we needed to change the game when it was flat."" Until England international Foden's introduction in the 68th minute, City were frustrated by a well-organised and resolute Atletico backline. They had managed only one shot on target by that point - De Bruyne's free-kick pushed away by Jan Oblak. In a cagey affair, Atletico failed to muster a single shot of note to trouble Ederson in the entire contest. But the game - and potentially the tie - changed through Foden's fabulous skills to set up De Bruyne. It was his seventh assist in the Champions League, with only Cesc Fabregas (10) providing more for an English club in the competition aged 21 or younger. ""Foden came on and played like he was in a playground,"" former Premier League striker Dion Dublin said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It is like the ball is stuck to his foot. ""He is always looking forward and being positive. The sky blue shirts changed their body language and they were all making runs when he came on. ""De Bruyne scored, but it all came from Foden's vision, his pass and his quality."" Former Manchester United and City midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: ""Phil can do it as a false nine, winger or forward. He can be world class in a number of positions - that is special. ""Phil is the most unique footballer around and he is still at the beginning of his development."" Foden now has 11 goals and nine assists in all competitions and has strengthened his case to start on Sunday against Liverpool - a match billed as the biggest of the season and one that could decide the Premier League title. Despite his tender age, he has already won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup, four Carabao Cups and been a losing finalist in the Champions League and the European Championship with England. ""Phil impacts many games and is now impacting the big games,"" former City defender Joleon Lescott added on BT Sport. ""He definitely has to start on Sunday - part of the reason he did not start [against Atletico] was with that in mind. ""I know what it means for him to play for the club. If he continues at this rate, he goes down as the best English player of all time with two trophies a season. ""His mentality sets him apart. If you compare him with someone like Wayne Rooney, you can see players who are hurt when they don't win. He is obsessed. I love what I do but he needs to do it. ""We had to remove the balls from the hotel because you could not get him off the training ground as he wants to improve all the time. ""His attitude is, 'I have done this to get me here, why would I stop?' He doesn't do it for the accolades, he does it because he loves it."" ",positive,liverpool,1
97,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60986738,Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds in control of Champions League quarter-final,"Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp says his side are ""not in dreamland"" after an important victory over Benfica in Lisbon. Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos. Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half. The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest. But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments. ""Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,"" said Klopp. ""We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here. ""It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica."" This was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later. The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be ""outstanding"". Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go. Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout. He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half. Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club. The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish. Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season. That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away. But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

98,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60988011,Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid: Kevin de Bruyne goal gives hosts a slender lead,"Kevin de Bruyne's second-half goal gave Manchester City victory as they overcame Atletico Madrid's typically fierce resistance in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Etihad Stadium. Diego Simeone's side performed with their trademark defensive discipline, restricting City to very few opportunities until De Bruyne pounced to make the breakthrough with 20 minutes left. Phil Foden, on as a substitute, produced the moment of magic to unlock Atletico with a perfect pass through the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to slot past goalkeeper Jan Oblak. It was the decisive moment in the tightest of games but City manager Pep Guardiola's wild celebration illustrated just how much it means to take a lead, even if slender, to Madrid for the second leg on 13 April. It was clear from the opening moments this was going to be a night for patience from City as Atletico, to no-one's great surprise, strung a bank of five defenders across the pitch and invited Guardiola's side to break them down. For the first 45 minutes it worked to perfection as the hosts barely laid a glove on the Spanish champions, who protected keeper Oblak with the diligence and desire Simeone demands. It was actually Atletico who threatened with a couple of breaks early in the second half, but City eventually managed to impose themselves and become more of a threat. De Bruyne saw a free-kick well saved by Oblak and Aymeric Laporte headed over from a good position following a corner. But it was the introduction of Foden that finally allowed City to spread some stardust on proceedings. He showed glorious control and vision to nutmeg Reinildo, allowing De Bruyne to fire low past Oblak to ignite what had been a tense, largely subdued atmosphere inside Etihad Stadium. City could not add a second with De Bruyne denied by a block on the line from Stefan Savic, but any lead is precious against an Atletico side who have made a speciality of frustrating Premier League giants in the past. Liverpool found that out in 2020 when they lost both legs as holders in the last 16, while Manchester United were also eliminated at the same stage this season. ""We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face, but it is a good result,"" said Guardiola. ""We had chances to score a second and third. It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try to win again."" Simeone marched off in defiant fashion at the final whistle and the Argentine will rightly feel Atletico are still in this tie - it would be folly to dismiss Simeone or his durable Champions League campaigners. The onus though, is now on them to attack in the return leg. ""It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win,"" Simeone said. ""It is clear we were playing against an extraordinary opponent. The numbers and statistics speak for themselves and they play in a very dynamic way. We had to suffer but we have to go to Madrid now and use the tools we have at our disposal. ""We need to be better but we are still in the tie. Let's see if we can have the ball more in the second leg and create more difficulties for our opponents but that comes with being calm and having the collective defensive effort."" However, alterations to Atletico's approach may well suit City more than having to break down the red and white wall of resistance that made their lives so difficult until that important De Bruyne strike on his 50th Champions League appearance for the club.

99,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60482881,Atletico Madrid 1-1 Manchester United: Anthony Elanga's late goal boost visitors' hopes of Champions League progression,"Anthony Elanga says he has ""dreamt of moments"" like his late equaliser in the the first leg of Manchester United's Champions League last-16 draw at Atletico Madrid. The 19-year-old had been on the pitch less than six minutes after replacing Marcus Rashford, when he raced onto Bruno Fernandes' perfectly-weighted pass to roll the ball past home goalkeeper Jan Oblak with his first touch to earn his side a 1-1 draw. ""I told you how calm and cool I am and whenever I am given a opportunity. I want to repay the manager and give 150% every time I step onto the pitch,"" Elanga told BT Sport. ""I just do what I can do, I want to be the best player on the pitch and I appreciate the boss. ""He [Ralf Rangnick] said to me to make the defenders scared and run in behind when I get the opportunity. ""I have dreamt of moments like this, scoring in the Champions League against top European teams like Atletico Madrid, [it is] a dream come true."" Until that point it appeared as though Diego Simeone's Spanish champions were going to take a narrow advantage to Old Trafford after delivering a masterclass in controlling the game without the ball. Joao Felix's early header from Renan Lodi's inviting cross gave the hosts a dream start with United looking ragged on their right, where interim boss Rangnick's deployment of Victor Lindelof at full-back failed badly. Rangnick later conceded that his plan ""was in the dustbin"" after seven minutes with the Swedish central defender, who was uncomfortable throughout, being booked for a tug on Felix before his second-half withdrawal. By then Atletico should have been two goals ahead with Sime Vrsaljko heading the ball off Lindelof and onto the United bar in the closing moments of the first half after some more dismal defending. While Rangnick's side enjoyed plenty of the ball, they were slow and indecisive in possession and barely looked capable of carving open their well-drilled opponents who repeatedly picked off every sloppy United pass in midfield. Atletico were also unlucky to not score late on themselves when Antoine Griezmann rattled the visitors crossbar. However, Elanga, who missed the crucial penalty when Rangnick's side lost in the FA Cup to Middlesbrough earlier this month, followed up his goal at Leeds on Sunday with another important intervention to change the complexion of the tie before the second leg in Manchester in three weeks time. ""He is playing as though it is a dream come true,"" Rangnick added. ""It is a joy and fun to watch him play, I wish a few other players would take him as an example and as a role model."" For long periods of this encounter United served up the sort of fare that has typified Rangnick's three-month reign as boss. Disjointed in possession, misplaced and overhit passes were produced with alarming frequency as Fred, Paul Pogba and Fernandes failed to impose themselves on the game and the athleticism of Scott McTominay was sorely missed in midfield. There were also several elementary mistakes at the back, such as Fred's charge out towards the ball and the lack of communication as Felix stole past Harry Maguire to head the opening goal. Lindelof's unfamiliarity with his adopted position hardly helped and it was notable that United's main improvement came after the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Alex Telles and Elanga were introduced. Elanga in particular provided the pace to run in behind - an option that had barely been utilised with the visitors until then. And it reaped immediate dividends, with the Sweden under-21 international registering United's first shot on target with his goal to become the club's youngest goalscorer in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It was exactly what I have been saying [all night]. Elanga has come on and made runs off the ball and probably for the first time all evening long Bruno Fernandes gets his pass right. ""For 75 minutes of this game you felt that Manchester United would have been happy to take a 2-0 defeat back to Old Trafford but they hung in there and those substitutions gave them that bit more control and Elanga got the goal."" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport: ""Man United would have taken your hand off for that result. They were lucky tonight and were poor tonight. ""David de Gea did not have much to do [but] you are looking for a better performance."" Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes: ""Ralf Rangnick's record is very good and his subs have been very good. It is not strange for me, it is a typical Manchester United performance under this manager.""

100,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685405,Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth: Leaders win to go 25 points clear,"Jurgen Klopp said he will ""never compare"" himself to former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly after his side beat Bournemouth to take another major step towards a first league title in 30 years. The victory was Liverpool's 22nd successive Premier League win at Anfield, breaking the English top-flight record set by Shankly's team in 1972. ""We didn't think about that number before the game, but after we can,"" said Klopp. ""It's nice, it's special, but today is a very good example that we have to fight."" The hosts fell behind in controversial circumstances, Callum Wilson slotting home Jefferson Lerma's low cross after appearing to shove Joe Gomez in the build-up to the goal. Liverpool soon hit their stride, however, and Mohamed Salah - making his 100th league appearance for the club - restored parity with a low finish after Sadio Mane dispossessed Jack Simpson deep inside the Cherries' half. Mane latched on to Virgil van Dijk's perfectly weighted through-ball to complete the turnaround, but Liverpool needed a brilliant goal-line clearance from James Milner to prevent Ryan Fraser from hauling Bournemouth back on level terms in a nervy second half. ""We're not geniuses, but we can really fight and that's all we have to do until the end of the season,"" said Klopp, who confirmed captain Jordan Henderson - missing with a hamstring injury - is likely to resume full training on Sunday before the Champions League last-16 second leg at home to Atletico Madrid. ""I think he will train tomorrow. If that looks good, I have to make a decision."" The win means Liverpool could be champions by the time they play Everton in the league on 16 March - if Manchester City lose their next three games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Burnley. Eddie Howe's Bournemouth side remain in the relegation zone, level on points with Watford and West Ham but with a worse goal difference than their nearest rivals at the bottom. Klopp spoke before the game about ""getting back on track immediately"" after watching his side slip to consecutive defeats in the league and FA Cup. They made the worst possible start, however, as Bournemouth capitalised on the Reds' early nerves to take a shock lead - albeit in controversial fashion. Wilson finished off a neat move involving Lerma and Philip Billing, but Liverpool felt the goal should have been disallowed for the striker's push on Gomez. The video assistant referee saw no infringement and the goal was given. Things could have got worse for Liverpool when Nathan Ake's powerful header was unconvincingly shovelled on to the top of the crossbar by stand-in goalkeeper Adrian, although they continued to create chances and deservedly restored parity through Salah's low finish - his 70th league goal for the club. If Bournemouth fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Mane scored with a delightful dink over Aaron Ramsdale 12 minutes before half-time, Liverpool failed to carry that momentum into the second half. Chances were few and far between until Ryan Fraser spotted Adrian off his line, with the retreating Milner producing an outstanding clearance, while Mane's 25-yard strike cannoned back off the bar. Having seen his side taken a deserved early lead, Howe will be bitterly disappointed with the manner of Liverpool's two first-half goals. Simpson, who replaced the injured Steve Cook after 19 minutes, was easily dispossessed by Mane in the build-up to Salah's equaliser, before another sloppy pass allowed Van Dijk to tee up the Senegal forward for Liverpool's second. There were positives for Bournemouth, who caused Liverpool problems and were only denied a share of the spoils by Milner's superb clearance from Fraser's looping effort. Ake spurned an opportunity to equalise in the 90th minute when he opted to pass to the offside Wilson with only Adrian to beat. However, Bournemouth will need to cut out individual mistakes if they are to prolong their five-year stay in the Premier League. ""The two goals come from us having possession and they punished us on the transition,"" Howe said. ""It was a ruthless game for us today because I don't think we did much wrong."" With games against Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham and Leicester coming up, Bournemouth will be desperate to claim maximum points at home to Crystal Palace in their next league match. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: ""I know what the boys are able to do, but I am not the one that is playing - they are. We have said before, confidence is not something that you get, put in your pocket and keep for the rest of your life. It comes and goes. You need that feeling where things work out. ""You have to fight hard - that's always the main thing to do - but we have 82 points now, which is really nice.

101,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42849447,Liverpool 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur,"Harry Kane's penalty - converted with virtually the last kick of an enthralling encounter - gave Tottenham a vital point at Anfield after Mohamed Salah's brilliant stoppage-time strike looked to have given Liverpool victory. Liverpool had only seconds to survive when referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot after Virgil van Dijk collided with Erik Lamela - allowing Kane, who had missed an earlier penalty, to score his 100th Premier League goal and leave the home fans enraged. Salah's third-minute goal, scored after he intercepted Eric Dier's poor back pass, gave Liverpool a lead they held until 10 minutes from time when Spurs substitute Victor Wanyama lashed keeper Loris Karius' punched clearance back into the top corner from 25 yards. In a dramatic finale, Karius saved Kane's penalty after he brought down the striker, paving the way for Salah to weave his way into the area before lifting a finish over Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris at the start of five minutes of stoppage time. And after Moss awarded Kane a second opportunity from the spot, the England international placed his penalty into the bottom-right corner. It was a fitting end to a thriller and a result which will bring more satisfaction to Spurs as defeat would have left them five points adrift of Liverpool in the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Liverpool remain third in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Tottenham in fifth. When manager Jurgen Klopp set off on a sprint of triumph along the touchline in front of Anfield's giant Main Stand as Salah put Liverpool back in front in injury time, he thought he was celebrating a win that was opening up a crucial five-point gap between his side and Spurs. Instead, minutes later, he was left to reflect on the concession of a late equaliser that left Anfield enveloped in frustration. Liverpool's much-maligned defence had held firm for so long, but Klopp's switch to three at the back, when he sent on Joel Matip for James Milner in the final quarter of an hour, did not have the desired effect. Spurs played on Liverpool's nerves, although Karius, who remains an inconsistent presence, could hardly have expected his punch - when perhaps he should have caught - to be returned into the top corner of his net with such spectacular interest by Wanyama. Liverpool, and indeed Anfield, were suddenly on edge but relieved when Karius saved Kane's lame penalty. Then came that dramatic exchange of goals in a chaotic finale and the points were shared. Liverpool offer so much that is good when it is measured in goals and excitement, but that nasty habit of carelessness and conceding crucial goals has still not been cured. Liverpool's supporters were waiting to celebrate a vital victory after Salah's twisting, turning run into the area in stoppage time ended with a clever finish over the onrushing Lloris. It came just after Kane had missed the chance to give Spurs the lead from the spot when his uncharacteristically poor penalty was saved by Karius. And yet the cheers stuck in the throats as referee Jon Moss - who entered lengthy consultation with his assistant before finally awarding the first Spurs penalty - waited as Van Dijk tangled with substitute Lamela, looking towards his colleague once more before pointing to the spot. The Kop exploded in fury but Kane stayed calm and made no mistake the second time, beating Karius comfortably. Klopp was desolate as he was locked in conversation with fourth official Martin Atkinson. There was barely time to restart the game and Anfield instantly vented its anger on Moss after awarded Spurs two penalties in front of the Kop. Once the drama had subsided, this was a fair result between two teams who mix high quality, intensity and attacking intent with moments of vulnerability - leaving the top four chase as tight as ever. Spurs could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Eric Dier's carelessness let in Salah as early as the third minute, instantly evoking memories of their struggles when visiting other teams in the so-called ""big six"" in recent years. Mauricio Pochettino's side have not won away in the league against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United in 11 game stretching back to a 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in February 2016. And yet they can take massive encouragement away from Anfield after the manner in which they kept their composure and played their way back into contention after Liverpool dominated the first half. Spurs kept probing and even when Salah's second looked to have condemned them to certain defeat - seemingly even more of a blow after Kane's missed penalty - they gathered themselves for one late push that earned another spot-kick and a point. Pochettino's players have been accused of fluffing their lines on occasions like this in recent times. Here they deserve great credit. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""There were so many situations to talk about but the ref's decisions decided the game so I can't help but talk about them. ""I don't understand either of the penalty situations. The first one was offside and the second, I know already what the ref and his assistant will say. There was a touch, a little touch. But Lamela has jumped into him and wanted the touch and to go down. ""If the ref kept playing at that level then fine, but in the first half he wasn't giving fouls. Then for the softest touch of the whole game he decides it is a foul. ""In the second half we had to defend like crazy, they had to chase the game. We had counter-attacks, the high pressure was good and we put in some super crosses. ""We were a bit unlucky here and there but we had enough chances to win the game. And we would have if it wasn't for those decisions."" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: ""It was an amazing game to watch - two teams that always try to play exciting football. ""I was calm because the team plays so well. The feeling is we dropped two points. We were much, much, much better than Liverpool. ""Both were a penalty and it is not controversial. Sometimes people complain about the referee, but when they are right it is good to tell everyone. ""It was important, the character. When you analyse the game, it was always under control despite conceding the first goal. When you analyse the 90 minutes, Tottenham were much better. ""We always try to give our best. The team always shows personality and character. Today was a game we played for the win, and to change history you need time."" Tottenham striker Harry Kane after scoring his 100th Premier League goal: ""I was nervous before the second penalty. It was a big moment, with a lot of pressure, but I stuck to the routine. ""There was a lot of pressure, in front of the Kop. The first one, I did everything I wanted to and the keeper made the save. You've got to take the chances. I thought the second one was a penalty; the defender took out Lamela. ""The gaffer said at half-time: Play a bit quicker. We created some chances. Victor Wanyama scored a great goal, and if I scored the first penalty we probably would have won it. But there we are. I've had a good season in front of goal so let's see how many I can get now.""

102,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43353969,Liverpool 5-0 Watford,"Mohamed Salah scored four goals as Liverpool moved up to third in the Premier League table by thrashing Watford at Anfield. Salah danced through Watford's defence to score early in the game before poking home Andy Robertson's cross late in the first half. He set up Roberto Firmino's clever flick for Liverpool's third, then added two late strikes to complete the rout. Liverpool have now opened a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth. Jurgen Klopp's side also remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. It was Watford's second successive defeat, and despite chances for Roberto Pereyra and Richarlison, they never looked like getting back into the game. But the Hornets are still eight points above the relegation zone and sit comfortably in 11th position. Before kick-off, Klopp insisted his side wanted to be back ""immediately on the winning side"" following the disappointment of their 2-1 defeat at rivals Manchester United last Saturday. And it was a more familiar-looking Liverpool side who turned up at Anfield as Klopp's men put in a performance befitting their manager's urgency. They started the game with high intensity - pressing their opponents and winning the ball back in midfield to set Salah on his way. It did not take long for the Egyptian to make a breakthrough. Within four minutes he had given Liverpool the lead and taken his season's tally to 25 in the league. Salah continued to cause Watford's defence problems and it always looked likely he and Liverpool would get a second, overtaking Harry Kane as the league's top scorer in the process. Robertson's inch-perfect cross from the left meant the second goal was a tap-in but Salah produced two moments of magic to dance his way to a hat-trick and fire in his fourth. Time seemed to stop as he evaded multiple challenges in the area and picked out the corner with a stabbed finish for his third before firing a strike high into the net for his fourth after Danny Ings' shot was saved. It was another masterclass from the Egyptian and his form mirrors Liverpool's as they head into the final stages of the season. The Reds are back up to third place in the table - with rivals Tottenham facing fifth-placed Chelsea in their next match. With seven games left to play, Liverpool look to have consolidated their place in the top four and can also look forward to a Champions League quarter-final with Manchester City. How Salah contributed to all five goals: His record-breaking stats: Miguel Britos scored a 93rd-minute equaliser for Watford as Liverpool were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw when these two teams met on the opening day of the season at Vicarage Road. Liverpool's defensive frailties - which allowed Watford back into the game in August - were on show against Manchester United last Saturday but there was none of the same at Anfield. The hosts never looked like throwing away the lead and, after scoring twice in the first half, controlled the game comfortably before Salah's late additions to the score. Salah's inclusion on the scoresheet comes as no surprise now but when he netted on his debut at Vicarage Road few would have predicted what success he would go on to have this season. Nor would many who saw that game have predicted a 5-0 rout for Watford in March but aside from two chances from Pereyra and Richarlison, they offered very little going forward at Anfield. Pereyra's fizzing free-kick hit the crossbar in the second half and could just conceivably have given the Hornets a route back into the game but, in truth, they never looked like matching their hosts. The determination the Hornets showed to come from behind in that opening fixture set the tone for a largely positive campaign which has seen them climb to 11th, eight points above the relegation zone but Saturday's thrashing will be a day to forget. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""It was very pleasing. It could have been really difficult tonight. We knew we had to be spot on from the first to the last second and our work rate had to be higher than 100%. ""The goals we scored were unbelievably good, and the boys didn't stop. That's how football should be, so I'm really happy with the performance. ""For Mo to be involved in five goals is fantastic but to score four is even more fantastic. His goals are so important for us. We have to hope they all come back well from the internationals. ""The clean sheet is very important. They lost a little concentration in the last few minutes but that's normal. It helps us in the goal difference."" Watford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We knew today was going to be a tough game. ""We conceded an early goal again like we did against Arsenal and after that it was difficult. We will try to do better next time. They were much better than us and congratulations to them. ""Mo Salah is one of the best players at the moment. We know we have played against one of the best teams in Europe. ""There are positives we can take, but we will try to do better next time."" Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 31 March (12:30 BST) hoping to consolidate their position in the top four.

103,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409327,Bournemouth 0-4 Liverpool,"Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick against Bournemouth to send Liverpool to the top of the table - then handed his man-of-the-match award to team-mate James Milner. Former England midfielder Milner became the 13th player to make 500 Premier League appearances when he captained Liverpool against the Cherries. When handed his award after the game, Salah opted to give it to Milner and told Sky Sports: ""I will not take it. ""Congratulations on his amazing career. He deserved it today. I hope we'll win something together."" Salah scored his second hat-trick for the club since arriving from Roma 18 months ago as Jurgen Klopp's side went one point clear of Manchester City, who later suffered their first top-flight defeat of the season as they lost 2-0 at Chelsea. Salah was in an offside position when Roberto Firmino hit a 30-yard shot that home keeper Asmir Begovic carelessly pushed out in the direction of the Egypt forward. He finished clinically and his eighth top-flight goal of the season was allowed to stand to break the deadlock in a game the visitors dominated from the start. There was nothing fortuitous about the Liverpool forward's second though, a composed finish after driving at the Bournemouth defence, before Steve Cook backheeled the ball into his own net while attempting a clearance to make it 3-0. Salah then completed his hat-trick after rounding Begovic, cutting back to beat the Bournemouth keeper for a second time and poking the ball past Nathan Ake on the line. ""Whatever you do in a football game, you need somebody to finish it off and what Mo did with his two goals in the second half was exceptional,"" said Klopp after his side's fifth straight league win. Liverpool have taken 45 points from the past 51 on offer and are unbeaten in 17 league games in a run that stretches back to last season. The wins keep coming for Liverpool - and the goals are flowing once again for Salah. Having successfully negotiated a bruising night at Burnley on Wednesday, Klopp's side started a huge week by ruthlessly dismantling Bournemouth. Salah goes into Tuesday's Champions League must-win group game with Napoli having marked his return to the starting line-up by emphatically ending a three-match run without a goal. Bournemouth have every right to feel disgruntled about the former Chelsea player's first, with television replays clearly showing Salah was offside when Firmino struck the shot that Begovic spilled into his path. Yet the hosts can have few complaints about his second or third. Despite Cook's attempt to bring him down, Salah stayed on his feet to drive at Bournemouth's defence before producing a neat finish into the corner via a slight deflection off Ake. Cook's troubled game continued when the Bournemouth defender inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net following a cross by Andy Robertson, before Salah completed the rout. After shrugging Cook off the ball following substitute Adam Lallana's long punt forward, Salah dribbled into the box before tormenting Begovic and slotting home. After the game, Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Salah as ""one of the best in the world"". ""Salah looked very good, razor sharp and we struggled to handle him. He played more centrally and did well from that position,"" he said. While the headlines belong to Salah, Liverpool overcame the absences of injured defensive trio Joe Gomez, Dejan Lovren and Nathaniel Clyne to record a 10th Premier League clean sheet of the season before next Sunday's visit of Manchester United to Anfield. Bournemouth started the weekend seventh in the table - level on points with sixth-placed Everton - and with plaudits ringing in Howe's ears. Their climb from League Two to the fringes of European qualification in 10 seasons is nothing short of phenomenal, but the Cherries were second best all over the pitch against Liverpool. This scenario is becoming a familiar story for the Dorset club against the league's leading sides. Howe's team are regularly praised for producing attractive, progressive football - but their record against the top-six teams is extremely poor. Since the start of 2017-18, Bournemouth have lost 15 times in 17 games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United. The bad news is they still have to face Tottenham and United - both away - in the league this month. They were not helped by the absence of leading scorer Callum Wilson because of a hamstring injury, but the England striker would not have helped their defence - now without a clean sheet in seven league and cup games - contain Liverpool. This was a momentous day for Milner. With Jordan Henderson on the bench, Milner captained Liverpool to victory in a game in which his statistics were again impressive. Having covered 12.57 kilometres at Burnley in midweek - more than any other player on the pitch - the 32-year-old clocked up another 11.73 filling in at right-back against Bournemouth. There was one nervous moment when his misplaced first-half pass required Alisson to dash out of his goal to head clear - and in doing so, taking out Joshua King. But Milner was otherwise a reassuring presence in the back four, demonstrating his value to Klopp with his ability to move from midfield to full-back and give youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold a rest with Gomez injured. In fact the Yorkshireman found himself in the Bournemouth half as often as he was his own as he played a significant part in the 238th top-flight win of his career. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: ""I have many complaints. He [Salah] was offside [for the first goal]. It has a huge bearing on the match. We were fine until that moment. It changes the game. ""It was difficult for us losing Callum Wilson. We have to deal with players who aren't here and can't use that as an excuse. We still had a competitive team on the pitch. ""The first goal is key and then we made some mistakes at bad times. ""At half-time I thought we were well in this match. I expected a very different second half. We just had to manage the scoreline. It is a tough league. We are disappointed as it's another game that has gone away from us."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""It is clear that everyone knows about the quality of Bournemouth. ""We had to keep the ball and win the ball back as quickly as possible. We did both very often but not always as they had their moments too, of course. ""I don't know if it was offside. I've not watched it back but we improved in the second half and controlled the game. It was really nice. Mo Salah scores that goal [the second one] and I don't think many do in that situation. ""The third goal was again brilliant. It is really cool and it helps of course! We played nice football and the players we brought on did really well.""

104,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47742713,Southampton 1-3 Liverpool: Reds return to the top of Premier League table,"Mohamed Salah scored a brilliant solo goal as Liverpool came from behind to beat Southampton at St Mary's and return to the top of the Premier League. Liverpool were in danger of dropping vital points with the score level at 1-1 with 10 minutes remaining, before Salah clinically ended his run of six league games without a goal. With Southampton defenders backing off, the Egyptian ran half the length of the pitch before firing past Angus Gunn with his left foot. Liverpool substitute Jordan Henderson sealed victory late on with a close-range finish. Shane Long had handed Saints an early lead with a composed strike from inside the area but Naby Keita headed the visitors level with his first goal for the club before the break. The result sees the Reds leapfrog Manchester City yet again - the 25th time the lead has changed hands this season. Liverpool have a two-point gap at the top, although defending champions City have a game in hand with six matches left to play. Southampton remain in 16th place, just five points above the relegation zone. Jurgen Klopp's side have the best away record in the league but they got off to a poor start when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's flick-on found an unmarked Long to finish well inside the area. Southampton executed their game plan well after taking the lead by defending deep as Liverpool attempted to play through them. Their biggest threat came from wide areas and the right foot of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who delivered a sensational cross for Keita to convert off the back of Jannik Vestergaard. The Reds continued to dominate the ball after the break with 70% possession but they were limited to just one shot on target before Salah struck his 50th Premier League goal in 69 appearances. Only Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy have reached the landmark in fewer matches. Salah was influential as Liverpool secured three points in injury time against Tottenham in their last outing, and their persistence in the latter stages of matches is no fluke. Liverpool have scored 20 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season, more than any other side, and they have also won a league-leading 16 points from losing positions. If the Reds are to deliver a first league title since 1990, their undying spirit at the death could tip the balance in their favour. Southampton remain five points clear of the danger zone but they were poised to claim a surprise point against the title challengers. Ralph Hasenhuttl has turned the tide since taking charge at St Mary's and the hosts produced a disciplined defensive display to limit a side that has scored 85 goals to just five shots on target. Vestergaard and Maya Yoshida made 10 clearances apiece, while the latter epitomised the Southampton mentality when he leapt off the ground to block Roberto Firmino's shot with the goal at his mercy. However, with the game in the balance and Liverpool struggling to carve out many clear-cut opportunities, the home defence backed off and gave Salah the room he needed to strike the decisive blow. On-loan Saints striker Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, was replaced in the Southampton line-up by Irishman Long, who was making his first league start since February. Long handed his side the perfect start when he also struck his 50th Premier League goal with a cool finish as the visitors started slowly. Only five teams have scored fewer goals than Southampton this season, but with Ings set to return and Long back among the goals, they are well placed to pick up the results needed to stay in the top flight. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: ""I knew it would be difficult. Southampton have been well-organised. We scored two wonderful goals. ""The season is intense for everyone. You have an opportunity to make really good changes - Milner and Henderson helped. They were aggressive in a really important way. You could see them pushing the boys. ""Southampton had to suffer in the second half because of the first-half tempo. Difficult away game, 3-1 is a perfect result. ""What a goal [from Salah]. He couldn't pass because Firmino couldn't get into the right position. The defender could not concentrate on Mo. Wow, what a goal. A good moment. Naby Keita's first goal for the club in a crucial moment."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: ""We saw a very interesting game today. Our team scored very early so it was a long way to the end to get a point or three. ""We showed it is not so easy if we have a plan and surprise them and can cause problems against the big teams. They know this, believe in this and the guys showed up. ""There was a crucial chance for Shane Long for 2-0 and then it would be very interesting, they were struggling at that point. Then we would have had a chance for a point. ""Their first goal was offside and the second we did not react well. We cannot make such a mistake from this position. They have a counter from our shot and it was too easy. We showed in the second half we are brave and we wanted to win the game. ""We have to pay attention and not fear the moment. The team believes, that is important, and know now that teams are coming where we must take the points.""

105,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58667917,Liverpool 2-2 Man City: Mohamed Salah scores incredible solo goal,"Kevin de Bruyne's deflected late equaliser gave Manchester City a fully deserved point after a moment of genius by Mohamed Salah looked to have earned Liverpool victory in an Anfield thriller. Reigning champions City and Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool were each hoping to take over from Chelsea at the top of the table, but this result means Thomas Tuchel's side stay clear at the Premier League summit. City dominated the first half but wasted a host of chances and were punished when Sadio Mane was the beneficiary of more Salah brilliance to apply a clinical finish to put Liverpool ahead after 59 minutes. Liverpool's lead lasted just 10 minutes until Phil Foden, who tormented the struggling James Milner throughout, took a pass from Gabriel Jesus and fired a low, angled finish across Alisson at the Kop end. City manager Pep Guardiola was nursing an understandable sense of injustice after Milner somehow escaped a second yellow card for blatantly upending Bernardo Silva, before Anfield exploded in joy after 76 minutes when Salah slalomed his way beyond a succession of City defenders to power home a stunning finish. City's performance merited at least a point and secured it when De Bruyne's shot took a deflection off Joel Matip to beat Alisson with nine minutes left. The Reds should have won it with five minutes remaining but Fabinho's goalbound shot was kept out by Rodri's sensational block. Liverpool have bullied City at Anfield in the past but the tables were turned here in the first half, the champions dominating possession and pinning the hosts back in a manner rarely seen under Klopp in recent seasons. Klopp's side needed a spark to return to at least something like their normal selves and it was talisman Salah who provided it with a virtuoso second-half performance. The Egyptian first of all showed his class to set up Mane for a goal that was against the overall run of play but was the result of Liverpool increasing the pace at the start of the second half. Salah's run and pass was sheer perfection and his attacking partner gratefully accepted the invitation to finish in style. And after the excellent Foden drew City level, Salah scored a goal that will live long in the memory as he twisted and turned in between a host of City defenders before lashing an unstoppable finish past Ederson. It was a goal worthy of winning any match, but in reality Liverpool could not complain at only getting a point as they struggled to exert their authority. Salah's masterclass, however, showed once again that he truly belongs among the game's elite. Foden's importance for City was also emphasised as he gave Milner a nightmare for the 78 minutes the Liverpool veteran was on the pitch, and scored a crucial equaliser just as The Kop sensed their side had finally established supremacy. Milner, in at right-back with Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, simply could not cope with Foden, escaping with a foul on the edge of the area that was not given then being booked for hauling the youngster down in desperate fashion. City were clearly determined to probe the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence where Milner was not actually receiving too much assistance, and it was no surprise that Foden found himself in space to give Allison no chance with a fine finish to level. This was a good response from City to their midweek Champions League loss to Paris St-Germain, although once against questions will be raised about the lack of a recognised striker when a host of first-half chances were not taken. City's play was measured and, with Ruben Dias and Aymeric Laporte solid at the back, it took those two moments of rare skill by Salah to unlock them. It would have been harsh on City had they not got at least a point and Guardiola's joy was obvious when De Bruyne got the leveller, albeit he was running hot with fury at the time after referee Paul Tierney decided against giving that second yellow card to Milner - earning one himself as his vociferous protests continued after Salah had restored Liverpool's lead. City have performed impressively against the two teams widely regard as their closest Premier League title rivals in the last eight days, winning at Chelsea then coming away with a point at Anfield. Guardiola will regard four points as a reasonable return and will be highly satisfied that his team could have had the maximum, even pressing for a winner in the closing moments. The most decisive contribution in this frantic finale, however, came from Rodri as he somehow blocked Fabinho in a packed goalmouth when he looked certain to score the match-winner. He made a crucial intervention and Guardiola was all smiles again at the final whistle.

106,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048522,Southampton 1-0 Arsenal: Jan Bednarek strike condemns top-four chasing Gunners to third straight defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted his side's form was ""a real worry"" after Southampton won at St Mary's to inflict a third successive defeat on the top-four chasing Gunners. Jan Bednarek scored the game's only goal late in the first half after the visitors had failed to adequately deal with a Saints corner. Bukayo Saka was denied from point-blank range by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with the score still goalless, but further clear-cut openings proved hard to come by for Arsenal until the closing stages of the second half. Emile Smith Rowe forced another fine save out of Forster after latching on to Yan Valery's attempted clearance, before Martin Odegaard dragged a left-footed shot wide of the near post after cutting in from the right. Forster produced yet another impressive stop to deny Granit Xhaka late on as Arsenal desperately piled forward in search of an equaliser. ""We've lost games in different ways - to lose the way we did today is difficult to explain,"" Arteta told BBC Match of the Day. ""If you saw the game, you'd say Arsenal had won comfortably. ""You have to put the ball in the net. You have to make the decisive moments count to win football matches and at the moment we're not doing that."" The Gunners remain three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who were beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - although they do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Southampton, meanwhile, climb to 12th after claiming their first league win since February. Following lacklustre displays at Crystal Palace and at home to Brighton last weekend, Gunners fans may have hoped this trip to St Mary's would prove to be an ideal fixture to reignite their top-four push. Saints had lost five of their past six games in all competitions before Saturday and conceded 19 goals in the process - including a 6-0 capitulation at home to Chelsea in their last match. They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League. The hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery. Although the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining. When Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot. Forster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide. ""It wasn't so sure he could play today,"" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display. ""He had a problem with his ankle, but we needed a goalkeeper like him in such a game today. ""The most important thing is the clean sheet after six or seven games [without one]. We've played much better games, especially with the ball, but today the target was a different one."" Arsenal still have a game in hand on Spurs in fourth but with matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham coming up in the next fortnight, this will go down as a missed opportunity for Arteta and his players.

107,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048519,Watford 1-2 Brentford: Jansson grabs Bees win late on,"Pontus Jansson's last-minute header broke Watford hearts and gave Brentford a third successive Premier League win for the first time. It looked like Emmanuel Dennis' powerful strike after the break had secured a point for Watford, but the final result pushes them even closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Christian Norgaard had put the Bees ahead inside 15 minutes. It was a game of small margins as moments before Jansson's strike, Imran Louza had missed a chance to win with the goal gaping. The result leaves Watford in 19th, six points adrift of safety having played two more games than Everton. Brentford took the lead through Norgaard; Kristoffer Ajer flicked on Ethan Pinnock's long throw, and the Dane was there to apply the close-range finish. There was a stagnant feel to the game for much of the first half. Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves. But the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1. Initially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus. The home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail. There was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues. Boss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position. In Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded. They hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again. Hodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side. ""Someone up there doesn't like us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have. ""We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw. I didn't think we deserved to be contemplating another home defeat; taking the second half, that is probably the best we've offered our home fans. That doesn't say much."" Relegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season. Christian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed. Thomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again. ""[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,"" he said. ""The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'. ""I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic. Pontus [Jansson] has been very dangerous, big determination, very disciplined. I'm very happy he got this goal.""

The club are trying to win back-to-back trebles, and are one win away from their seventh consecutive title. After defeating a meek Rangers side 4-0 at Hampden, Celtic face Motherwell in the Scottish Cup final on 19 May. ""The last five [league games] will really get the players focused and ensure that we're ready,"" Rodgers said. ""The important thing now is to close up the league. We're in a really good position, [but] we've got tough games now. ""The final will be a tough game. You saw Motherwell [win against Aberdeen], a totally different type of football to what we will play, which makes it a very interesting final. They work hard, they're very honest and they won't make it easy."" If Rodgers' side defeat Hibernian at Easter Road on Saturday, they will retain their Premiership crown, and take a step closer to becoming the first side to win back-to-back trebles, having successfully defended the League Cup last November, beating Motherwell 2-0 in the final. ""I'm always looking to push [the players] and bring out that bit more from them, what makes a difference going into these big games, but they bring the real edge to it,"" Rodgers said. ""They have really inspired the supporters in my time here, the supporters feel safe that the players are going to give everything they can. We have a way of playing that we know can win games."" Rangers were passive opponents at Hampden, with Celtic quickly and effectively getting the measure of their game plan to flood the centre of the pitch. Tom Rogic and Callum McGregor scored before half-time, then penalties from Moussa Dembele and Olivier Ntcham rounded off the scoring after the break. Rangers defender Ross McCrorie was sent off early in the second half for the foul that led to Dembele's spot-kick. ""I was very proud of the team,"" said Rodgers, who remains unbeaten as a manager in 10 Old Firm games. ""It was always going to be difficult, but I thought we controlled the game well in the first half. We played around their shape. Rangers looked like they were trying to block the middle of the pitch but that allowed us to exploit the sides. ""We had fairly decent control without too much threat against us. The team was compact, defending well, counter-pressing well and we get a very good first goal that relaxes you as well, a brilliant finish from Tom, a wonderful piece of skill. From there we had really good control throughout the game. ""I said to [Rogic] he didn't start so well, a bit loose in his passing, but the goal comes from [the ball] going up to Moussa, it's played back in and then James Forrest makes a great first-time pass in to Tom, who shows his strength and skill to finish. He was very good and he scores big goals in big games, which is why you always look to him."" ",positive,liverpool,0
109,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43777981,Celtic 4-0 Rangers: Graeme Murty laments 'passive' Scottish Cup semi-final display,"Rangers boss Graeme Murty admitted he was at a loss to explain his side's limp Scottish Cup exit as Celtic eased into the final with a 4-0 victory. Murty's men were swept aside as they fell 2-0 down by half-time before Ross McCrorie's red card five minutes after the interval all but ended their hopes. Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos had two chances to grab a goal back, but Craig Gordon denied him each time. ""We were just passive; I don't know why,"" Murty said. ""I asked them to get into a shape and a structure in order to go and press. But when it comes to one against one, you have to actually get up closer to your opponent than we did in the first period. ""We didn't put them under enough pressure; we allowed them to play far too easily. All four goals were easily avoidable through just basic, good defending. ""Then in the second half, we gave them a penalty and a sending-off which makes their job far, far easier. ""We had really good opportunities to claw something back from the game and we haven't managed to do it. I said we had to be clinical in both boxes but we didn't manage that at all. ""Craig [Gordon] made a couple of good saves but we should be scoring at least one. We were not worthy of getting anything from the game."" Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday, back in the starting line-up, vented his frustration at being removed five minutes before the interval, replaced by Josh Windass. ""I wouldn't have been happy,"" Murty said. ""I completely understand his frustration. ""I was reacting to the situation in the game. We wanted to get a different shape to the team, and Josh fitted that bill. ""Andy is frustrated. But if you deal with people in an emotional state, you get an emotional response. I will speak to him in the week, we will have a chat and move forward from there."" Murty admitted there was anger and frustration - ""all the kinds of emotion you would expect from a changing room that has just gone through that"". But he urged his players to use that emotion to ensure a positive response next Sunday against Hearts, as Rangers - second in the Premiership on goal difference from Aberdeen - begin their final run of five matches, including facing Celtic again on 29 April. ""There should be disappointment and frustration and anger there,"" Murty said. ""It is about making sure they turn that into positives and energy to power us through to the end of the season, rather than allowing it to be disruptive. ""The players need to respond for themselves. It isn't just Celtic we have got to play. There are big games ahead of us and we need to make sure we get a response between now and the end of the season, if we want to finish as we should."" Murty, who refused to discuss his hopes of retaining his post beyond the end of the campaign, also apologised to Rangers supporters and asked them ""for their patience and to keep believing"". ""But it is no good to keep asking for it,"" he added. ""We have to put a performance in that is worthy of their support. ""It has been brilliant the whole time I have been at the club.

111,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963796,Watford 0-3 Leeds United: Visitors take huge step towards safety after comfortable win,"Leeds manager Jesse Marsch said he was ""excited"" to see his players ""emerge from a tough moment"" against fellow strugglers Watford to take a huge step towards Premier League safety. Raphinha's fierce left-footed strike from the edge of the area gave the visitors the lead after the Hornets had twice gone close through Imran Louza and Cucho Hernandez. Ismaila Sarr squandered a golden opportunity to fire Watford level in the second half, before Rodrigo capitalised on a dreadful mix-up between Hassane Kamara and Samir to double the visitors' advantage. Leeds compounded Watford's misery when Jack Harrison beat Ben Foster with a powerful shot into the far corner to complete the scoring. ""The points are massive for us and there's confidence and momentum in the group,"" said Marsch, whose side have now collected 10 points from a possible 12 in the league. ""We can see that the form of many players and the overall mentality of the group has grown so much. ""That's really helped us get to where we are right now."" The result lifts Leeds nine points clear of the relegation zone - although they have played three games more than 18th-placed Burnley, who travel to bottom club Norwich on Sunday. ""It's been a real pleasure to be their coach,"" Marsch told BBC Match of the Day. ""[The players] are obviously hungry to stay in the league, but they are hungry to try to develop and get better and be the best they can be. ""Every day we're talking about some new topics and trying to fine-tune a lot of the principles we want to put in place. We have to keep going."" Watford manager Roy Hodgson will have taken heart from his side's spirited display against Liverpool last weekend but, as was the case at Anfield, the Hornets were undone by poor finishing against the Whites and now find themselves six points adrift of safety with seven matches left to play. They had the better chances before Raphinha's well-taken opener, Louza sending a curling free-kick inches wide before Illan Meslier got his fingertips to Hernandez's inswinging cross-shot from the left. Sarr was also thwarted by Meslier after racing on to Emmanuel Dennis' raking pass, but his effort would not have counted as he was in an offside position. The Senegal winger missed an even better opportunity in the second half with the score at 1-0, sending a wild strike past Meslier's left-hand post - an effort which sums up Watford's plight. Hodgson will be furious at the manner of Leeds' second goal, as Kamara's attempted clearance was deflected into Rodrigo's path by Samir, allowing the Spaniard to round Foster and calmly slide into an empty net. The visitors, who kept their first clean sheet in 18 Premier League matches at Vicarage Road, put the seal on a vital victory five minutes from time when Harrison drilled an unstoppable shot past Foster for his third goal in as many games. The win puts Leeds within touching distance of safety, but Watford's prospects look bleak after slipping to a ninth consecutive home defeat. With trips to Crystal Palace, Manchester City and Chelsea still to come before the end of the season, the Hornets will need to improve their tally of seven points out of a possible 45 at Vicarage Road this term to stand any chance of avoiding the drop. ""I don't think the challenge has altered enormously,"" Hodgson said afterwards. ""That's a few more points that we could have had that we haven't taken, but there are seven games left - four of them at home - and the players have got to find a way of putting this game behind them. ""They haven't lost by playing particularly badly, they've lost because the other team took their chances and now we have to get back in the right frame of mind for Brentford [next Saturday].""

England midfielder Keira Walsh's bouncing strike from outside the area put City ahead in the second period, after major final debutants West Ham had initially defied their underdog status with an impressive first-half display. Late goals from City youngsters Georgia Stanway and Lauren Hemp completed the win, securing the club's sixth major trophy. Victory also saw Nick Cushing's side move within one match of completing an entire domestic season unbeaten, as they added to February's League Cup success. The Hammers, who reached the final in their first season as a professional side - less than a year after leaping up from the third division with a successful top-tier licence application last summer - had threatened to pull off a shock win, creating the best chance of the first half. But City - who had not conceded a goal in the FA Cup this season - showed their class and experience after the break and could have added to their tally in the final moments. The crowd of 43,264 at England's national stadium fell just short of last season's competition record of 45,423, but was nevertheless still one of the largest for a club-level women's game in Europe in the modern era. All of City's six major trophies have come since 2014 under the management of Nick Cushing and they will finish the season without losing a single domestic game if they can avoid defeat away at Women's Super League winners Arsenal next Saturday. England and City goalkeeper Karen Bardsley had produced a superb save to keep out Scotland striker Jane Ross' bouncing header from Erin Simon's right-wing cross, in the best moment of the first half, after a cagey start. The Hammers then wanted a penalty when midfielder Alisha Lehmann went down in the box under Jill Scott's challenge, but the officials felt the City midfielder had not made contact with Lehmann. But City - who won the cup for the first time in 2017 - were more energetic after the break and Scotland's Caroline Weir blazed over from inside the area shortly before Walsh opened the scoring with only her second goal of the season. The holding midfielder's swerving effort bounced just in front of goal and caught out West Ham keeper Anna Moorhouse, who later saved well from Tessa Wullaert and Nikita Parris. The Hammers' best chance of the second half came on the counter attack, but Switzerland's Lehmann fired straight at Bardsley, as City began to dominate, and 20-year-old Stanway doubled the lead with a low, deflected strike. Substitute Hemp - who turned 18 in August - then showed a calmness in front of goal that defied her youthfulness as she supplied a cool finish, and she almost added City's fourth but she struck the post late on. Despite the result, West Ham - who beat Reading on penalties in their semi-final - have impressed many during their maiden WSL campaign and appear to be building a growing fanbase, with their fans appearing to significantly outnumber City supporters at Wembley. The East London club had asked the Premier League to move the kick-off time of their men's team's league match at home to Southampton earlier on Saturday, but the plea was denied, much to the Hammers' disappointment. On the pitch, they initially surpassed the bookmakers' pre-match expectations, frustrating City early on, at odds with their 10-2 aggregate loss from this season's two league meetings, but Ross' first-half header was the best chance. Ultimately, City's clean sheet saw Cushing's side - lead by talismanic England captain Steph Houghton at the back - finish their five-game cup run without conceding a goal. Man City boss Nick Cushing told BBC Sport: ""West Ham were excellent, but I expected them to be good, play on the counter-attack and cause us problems. ""I thought we were just a little bit emotional [in the first half]. The occasion affected our offensive play. ""We asked the players to just settle down, play logically and be controlled. In the second half they looked comfortable. ""I'm so proud of the players. I hope they will go now and spend so much time with their family. They've put in so much effort to make this team successful again, they deserve everything they get."" West Ham boss Matt Beard told BBC Sport: ""It was a game of two halves, wasn't it? We created the better chances in the first half. ""The first goal changes the game. When you go behind against Manchester City, they're a very good team, and Man City deserved to win it on their second-half performance. ""But when we walked around at the end, with the fans, and you look at what we've created in such a short space of time as a club, this team is only going to get better and our fanbase is only going to grow. It's been really tough but, to be here, speaks volumes for what we're trying to do. ""We have a lot of young players who will learn from this and become better players because of it.""

113,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/54711538,Women's FA Cup final: Everton 1-3 Manchester City AET,"Late extra-time goals from Georgia Stanway and Janine Beckie settled a terrific Women's FA Cup final as Manchester City eventually overcame Everton at Wembley to lift the trophy for the third time. Substitute Stanway latched on to Jess Park's clever through ball and slotted in off the post, when a penalty shootout had been looming, and Beckie calmly netted an ever later third. United States midfielder Sam Mewis had deservedly nodded City in front from Alex Greenwood's corner shortly before half-time, but France's Valerie Gauvin headed level from Izzy Christiansen's second-half corner as Everton fought back. Played without any fans at Wembley amid ongoing coronavirus restrictions, the contest was the closest-fought the women's final has seen since the fixture was first staged at the home of English football in 2015, as last season's delayed competition came to a dramatic conclusion. Gareth Taylor's City side could have settled it earlier in the game, as Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir struck the woodwork twice in the second half before England skipper Steph Houghton saw a header tipped on to the post in extra time. That was one of a number of superb saves from Everton's 22-year-old stopper Sandy MacIver, on a day when City's 21-year-old England keeper Ellie Roebuck also impressed, adding to an entertaining spectacle. The 50th Women's Cup final had originally been scheduled for May but was delayed because of the pandemic and the cup resumed at the quarter-final stage in September, after the 2020-21 league season had already commenced. Unbeaten in their first five games of that new Women's Super League season, the Toffees arrived at Wembley in fine form, but it was still last season's WSL runners-up City who were considered the pre-match favourites and they lived up to that tag with a strong opening 45 minutes. But Everton, appearing in their first final since 2014 and trying to win their first cup since 2010, battled back strongly and the game was almost end-to-end at times in the final 20 minutes of normal time, before holders City edged clear in the latter stage of extra time to win the cup for the third time in four seasons. Sunday's result continued City, Arsenal and Chelsea's combined six-season-long dominance of the major domestic trophies in the English women's game. Not since Liverpool lifted the league title in 2014 has any club other than the modern-day 'big three' won the WSL, Women's FA Cup or Continental League Cup. City only turned professional in the build-up to the 2014 summer season but have won seven major honours since then, adding their third FA Cup to three League Cups and the 2016 league crown. They were made to dig deep against a hard-working Everton side who will feel they could have taken the lead in the second half when France's Gauvin glanced a header just wide. However few could deny that City were worthy winners - they created the greater number of chances and twice went close in second-half stoppage time, with the game stretched. On a day when both young English goalkeepers shined, Everton's MacIver won the plaudits with a series of excellent saves, with arguably the best of the lot keeping out Houghton's header.

114,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61088177,Lyon 0-3 West Ham United (1-4 on aggregate): Hammers reach first European semi-final in 46 years,"West Ham United will face Eintracht Frankfurt for a place in the Europa League final after the Hammers secured their first European semi-final in 46 years with a stunning second-leg victory in Lyon. Having held on for a 1-1 first-leg draw in London after playing the entire second half with 10 men, David Moyes' players withstood periods of intense early pressure before sweeping their Ligue 1 opposition aside. The visitors struck twice in seven minutes at the end of the first half, as Craig Dawson met Pablo Fornals' corner with a superb near-post header before a deflected Declan Rice strike put the Premier League club in total charge. Jarrod Bowen extended the advantage within three minutes of the restart, slotting in at the end of a sweeping counter-attack, and a deflated Lyon could offer no response as West Ham comfortably saw out a memorable win. The statement victory set up the biggest match in the club's recent history, against Bundesliga side Frankfurt, who upset Spanish giants Barcelona 3-2 at the Nou Camp to win 4-3 on aggregate. Frankfurt were also the opposition in the last four of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup, in West Ham's last major European semi-final. The Hammers prevailed 4-3 on aggregate on that occasion and it is the German side they must once again overcome if they are to reach the final in Seville next month, as their hugely impressive Europa League journey continues. Moyes and his players could already be immensely proud of their European run this season, having topped their group before eliminating Sevilla - among the favourites for the competition - on a memorable night at London Stadium in the last 16. But the manner of this latest victory, against a club who were Champions League semi-finalists two years ago, means they will rightly believe they can go even further. Karl Toko Ekambi had struck the post inside the opening five minutes and it required last-ditch defending to deny Houssem Aouar, but West Ham successfully weathered the hosts' dominant start. That was despite missing left-back Aaron Cresswell, after his first-leg red card, and injured centre-back Kurt Zouma, as the visitors fielded what Moyes described before kick-off as a ""patched up"" defence. Bowen volleyed wide on the stretch from Michail Antonio's cross as West Ham began to assert themselves, though, and Lyon were simply left shell-shocked by sucker punches from Dawson and Rice. A brilliant pass from Fornals picked out Bowen for his 15th goal of the season to move the away side within reach of the semi-finals, but there was still work to be done as Lyon racked up the attempts, to no avail, in the closing stages. Lyon, 10th in Ligue 1, had not lost in nine Europa League games this term despite their domestic struggles - but their defeat was greeted by unsavoury scenes at full-time as supporters attempted to get onto the pitch, while violence was reported among the home fans in the stands.

The first half-hour saw Exeter dominate possession but create nothing in the way of chances before they went ahead with their first attempt on 32 minutes. Former Colchester man Jevani Brown played an inch-perfect pass into the path of Jack Sparkes and the Grecians academy graduate fired a low shot across goal into the corner to send a sold-out crowd into a frenzy. Archie Collins then struck the outside of the post from 20 yards as Exeter grew in confidence and held a narrow lead at the break. The second half continued in the same vein, with Tim Dieng denied by a brilliant Shamal George save, and Exeter got their second on 63 minutes when Collins' cross was knocked across goal by Matt Jay and Offrande Zanzala finished from close range. Substitute John Akinde had the ball in the net for Colchester but was ruled offside, while Padraig Amond forced George into another fine save at the other end. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Goals from Joe Grayson, John Rooney, Matt Platt and Aaron Amadi-Holloway put a major dent into Rovers' title bid with the Bluebirds' first home win for four months. Phil Brown's side ended their four-game losing streak in style, with Brown's first win since taking charge, as Rob Edwards' charges saw their lead at the summit cut to just two points after Exeter's lunchtime win. Defender Grayson got the Bank Holiday show up and running with his first goal since September in the fifth minute. Veteran striker Rooney was frustrated as his free-kick hit a post, but he made no mistake seven minutes before half-time as he added a second from Amadi-Holloway's cut-back. Paul Farman produced a couple of fine saves to keep the hosts' lead intact. Platt powered home a header eight minutes into the second half before Amadi-Holloway nodded home in stoppage time.

Bradford, who played for more than an hour with 10 men after midfield player Elliot Watt was sent off for a second booking, were denied a win when McManaman equalised with a low drive just inside the far post. Bradford dominated the early stages and deservedly went ahead in the 19th minute when Luke Hendrie crossed from the right and Jamie Walker, on loan from Hearts, flicked a smart header into the far corner of the net. However, the Bantams suffered a blow in the 28th minute when Watt was sent off for a second yellow card in the space of three minutes, first for a foul on Elliott Nevitt and then on Lee O'Connor. Walker came close to increasing Bradford's lead, but was denied by a fine save from keeper Joe Murphy who turned his 20-yard shot over the bar. Tranmere hit back strongly and Sam Foley headed narrowly over the bar before Josh Dacres-Cogley saw his header bounce inches wide of the post. However, Murphy came to Tranmere's rescue in first-half stoppage time when he turned Andy Cook's goal-bound shot round the post for a corner. Both sides went close in an evenly contested second half with Murphy saving well from Yann Songo'o and home keeper Alex Bass keeping out a downward header from Peter Clarke.

On-loan Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson drove in low at the near post on 75 minutes for his fifth league goal of the season after being set up by a fine pass from substitute Luke Thomas. Joey Barton had to rejig his attack when striker Leon Clarke was withdrawn from the starting XI after getting injured in the warm-up. Sam Nicholson was brought in to replace him. But it did not stop the Gas extending their unbeaten home run to 11 league games. Matt Smith's header in the sixth minute tested Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw at his near post, while Brandon Thomas-Asante volleyed over the bar on 20 minutes. But that was as close as Salford came to scoring. Rovers substitute Antony Evans hit the crossbar in the second half, but the strike from Anderson, who has made a huge impression during his loan spell, eventually made the difference.

Luke Armstrong grabbed the hosts' consolation in the fourth minute of stoppage time, but the victory kept Ben Garner's men, who had gone into the game without a win in three games, on the coat-tails of the top seven. Harrogate, meanwhile, have still not mathematically secured their Sky Bet League Two status for next term following a seventh defeat in nine contests. Swindon totally dominated a one-sided first half, with Jack Payne seeing a deflected edge-of-the-box effort hit an upright before Barry opened the scoring in the 24th minute. The on-loan Aston Villa teenager was left unmarked at the far post to head in Mandela Egbo's right-wing cross from three yards out. He then added a second on the half-hour mark when he was left unchallenged again in the same position to meet another Egbo delivery after Louis Reed's excellent ball through the right channel. The visitors should have taken an even bigger lead into the interval as Barry fired straight at Joe Cracknell when given a clear run on the home goal and Davison side-footed wide from six yards. But Davison was more clinical in the 51st minute when he netted from eight yards after Ellis Iandolo's powerful run from the halfway line into the home box. He then doubled his personal haul for the afternoon, firing inside an exposed Cracknell's near post from 10 yards after being played through the right channel by Payne. The visitors also went close to adding a fifth when Iandolo's spectacular late strike clipped the crossbar before Armstrong pounced from close range after Jojo Wollacott had parried Simon Power's firm drive.

With Port Vale winning, sixth-placed Stags now have a six-point gap between them and the third automatic promotion place, although they still have a game in hand. Sutton, meanwhile, climbed up to seventh with the win as they took advantage of Newport and Tranmere dropping points. Mansfield gifted their opponent a ninth-minute lead following an error by defender Farrend Rawson. After having the ball rolled to him on the edge of the box by keeper Nathan Bishop, Rawson was dispossessed by Omar Bugiel who rounded Bishop and calmly netted. The hosts were then rocked by a second Sutton goal four minutes into the second half as David Ajiboye was allowed to turn home his eighth goal of the season from six yards, tucking away Enzio Boldewijn's cross from the left by-line. Stags were handed a lifeline in the 78th minute as a long John-Joe O'Toole ball forward saw Sutton defender Ben Goodliffe loop a header over his own keeper. But United were 3-1 up two minutes later as substitute Richie Bennett raced clear to slot past Bishop with Stags screaming for an offside flag. Mansfield pulled another goal back in the seventh of added time when Matty Longstaff saw his low 18-yard shot deflect home but it was nothing more than a consolation.

The visitors led when Kwesi Appiah's header found Ashley Nadesan at the back post to finish from close range. Crawley soon doubled their lead when a slick corner routine gave Ludwig Francillette space for a low strike. Newport improved after the break and a swift counter saw James Waite reply, but Robert Street was just wide with a header that would have rescued a point. The Exiles have now lost three successive home games and are a point outside the play-off places, and go to Sutton United on Monday - the side that has just replaced them in seventh. Crawley are 10 points off the play-offs with five games remaining, beginning with Monday's home game against Walsall. Newport County manager James Rowberry said: ""We weren't our usual selves in the first half and that has ultimately cost us the game. We need to be better and we will be better and we'll go again. ""I didn't think we were able to get our passing game going, it was too many turnovers in the game from our own doing, we didn't win enough second balls, didn't defend our box well enough.

Jon Brady's men moved up a place to fourth in the table while Oldham slipped back into the drop zone. Oldham's Alex Hunt fired an early strike narrowly off target before Northampton replied with Aaron McGowan forcing Danny Rogers into a smart near-post save. Shortly after the half-hour mark, Cobblers keeper Liam Roberts made a superb double stop from Hunt and then Harrison McGahey. As Oldham continued to press, Roberts also saved expertly from Davis Keillor-Dunn. But Northampton went ahead a minute before the interval when Jon Guthrie stabbed home at the far post as he met Sam Hoskins' cross. Rogers saved well from Louis Appere soon after the restart but the Cobblers doubled their lead in the 66th minute when Josh Eppiah crossed for Appere and he drove into the roof of the net from eight yards.

Cuthbert nodded home Arthur Read's corner three minutes after the interval to secure a crucial three points for the hosts. The first half offered little in the way of chances with both sides largely cancelling each other out. Ben Coker's early free-kick was well-saved by Jay Lynch and Luke Charman headed over from six yards out for the visitors while Luther James-Wildin's teasing cross evaded everyone on the stroke of half-time. Stevenage started the second half brightly and were rewarded almost immediately. Read's corner found Cuthbert six yards from goal and the Scotsman made no mistake to head hard and low into the bottom left corner. Rochdale pressed hard for an equaliser and saw most of the ball.

Jack Earing's winner just before half-time ended a run of three straight defeats for Walsall, leaving Carlisle 10 points above the bottom two with four games remaining. Walsall keeper Carl Rushworth made a fine early diving save to keep out Kristian Dennis' low shot and later had to be alert to deny Omari Patrick. The Saddlers' first real chance came via a swift counter-attack as Emmanuel Osadebe teed up Tyrese Shade but his curler was straight at Carlisle keeper Mark Howard. But Walsall led in first-half stoppage time as Howard produced a fine stop to prevent Dynel Simeu from turning into his own net only to be beaten by Earing's deflected follow-up from the edge of the box.

The result was of more use to them than their relegation-threatened hosts, who led for most of the game through captain Alex Woodyard's goal, although they closed the gap between them and safety to three points. Wimbledon took a precious lead in the 19th minute after the visitors had failed to clear Nesta Guinness-Walker's free-kick as a mishit effort by Woodyard trickled into the net. The pressure from MK Dons built as the second half wore on, with home goalkeeper Nik Tzanev making a good save from Mo Eisa's shot across goal. But there was nothing he could do with 10 minutes left when Dean Lewington picked out Parrott, who crashed in a fantastic volley off the underside of the bar from a tricky angle.

Darren Moore's visitors dominated for long periods and should have had more than Jordan Storey's 66th-minute goal to show for their control. But Wanderers have a habit of netting in the closing stages and Williams' leveller was his team's 23rd goal in the final 15 minutes of action this season. Like midfielder Williams, on-loan Preston defender Storey also registered his first goal for his current club. He converted from inches after Sam Hutchinson headed Barry Bannan's corner against a post. Wednesday should have gone on to claim a third successive win against opponents, who have won only one of their past six games to fade out of the play-off picture. Bannan, March's League One player of the month, had three chances in the opening 12 minutes and should have made it 2-0 14 minutes from time. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing had wasted another glorious first-half opportunity, though Bolton almost took the lead through Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's first-half header.

The visitors thought they had taken the lead after a minute but Burton skipper John Brayford produced a superb clearance off the line to deny his opposite number Joe Edwards. Burton, struggling for form, started without an orthodox striker but after seeing much of the early Argyle threat began to cause problems for the visitors. Cameron Borthwick-Jackson lashed a rising drive just wide on the half-hour mark and Harry Chapman was marginally unable to get his head on a teasing cross from Jonny Smith. Joe Powell twice had chances for Burton in a tense second half but the best opportunity fell to Chapman, who forced to superb save from Michael Cooper in the Plymouth goal only for the ball to ricochet onto the shin of Burton defender Tom Hamer and deflect away when it looked like it might be sneaking in the bottom corner. Former Albion loanee Ryan Broom glanced a late header towards goal to force a save from Matej Kovar but there was to be no breakthrough for either side as the spoils were shared.

Morecambe could have gone ahead after 15 minutes, but Arthur Gnahoua shot wide from a narrow angle. Liam Bennett made a fine double goal-line clearance to deny Cole Stockton and then Gnahoua. The home side took the lead three minutes before the interval when Smith prodded home after Harvey Knibbs' shot had been blocked by Jacob Bedeau. The visitors had a chance to equalise on the hour when Adam Phillips' through ball found Stockton, but Dimitar Mitov saved the striker's shot with his legs.

Gills goalkeeper Aaron Chapman was called upon in the early stages to palm away Garath McCleary's strike.

The home side's best opportunity of the half fell to top scorer Vadaine Oliver, who headed Robbie McKenzie's cross wide.

Neil Harris' men nearly scored a dramatic winner, but Oliver's prodded shot towards goal, with Stockdale having dropped an initial effort, was hacked off the line. A frustrating afternoon was compounded for Gareth Ainsworth and his team when Lewis Wing was dismissed for a foul with four minutes remaining. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Lang scored the first and third goals, with Will Keane netting the other for the visitors. Anthony Scully had equalised for the Imps. The game got off to a lively start with three goals in the opening quarter. First, in the eighth minute, the visitors took the lead when Josh Magennis headed the ball on to Lang, who volleyed home from close range. City levelled six minutes later when the ball broke to Lewis Fiorini on the edge of the box. His shot took a big deflection off a defender and landed at the feet of Scully, who composed himself before slotting home. Wigan restored their lead in the 21st minute when, after good work from Lang and Max Power, Keane fired into the top corner from the edge of the box. The pacesetters had chances to extend their lead in the second half but a combination of poor finishing and a stunning save from Jordan Wright kept Lincoln in the game. However, Leam Richardson's men finally added a third goal with 18 minutes remaining. Teddy Bishop was dispossessed inside his own half, the ball was played to Lang and he fired home via the inside of the far post. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Embleton struck just three minutes after coming on in the League One contest, firing home when Ross Stewart played the ball square to him with the home defence stretched. Victory stretched Sunderland's unbeaten run to seven matches, while Oxford's play-off hopes appear in tatters after three successive defeats. Both skippers scored during the first half. Black Cats captain Corry Evans pounced in the 16th minute when the home defence failed to clear a free-kick, prodding home a shot from 14 yards before centre-half Elliott Moore headed in Billy Bodin's free-kick to equalise for Oxford in the 35th minute. Both sides had early chances with visiting goalkeeper Anthony Patterson turning over Mark Sykes' shot and Nathan Broadhead seeing an effort blocked on the line by Luke McNally at the other end.

The recently won Papa John's Trophy was paraded before the match but the mood was killed by George Dobson's second-half winner. Defeat leaves Rotherham three points outside of the automatic promotion berths they have occupied for a large part of the season. Ben Wiles threatened early on for the home side with his long-range volley whistling just wide of the post. Conor Washington got through on goal for the visitors but was denied a shot on goal thanks to a great recovering tackle by Ollie Rathbone. Viktor Johansson had to get in the way of Washington's lobbed effort early in the second half but there was nothing he could do to stop them taking the lead on 55 minutes. Neat interplay around the box saw Dobson teed up and the midfielder rifled an unstoppable shot into the corner.

James Norwood put the visitors ahead with his sixth-goal of the season after six minutes before team-mate Cameron Burgess was shown a second yellow card on 75 minutes. That moment swung the momentum and Whalley spectacularly picked out the far corner from 25 yards.

Shortly after - in a bizarre turn of events - play was halted as one of the assistant referees suffered a leg injury and he had to be eventually replaced with the fourth official Lisa Rashid.

Phil Parkinson's side slip to 11 points adrift of leaders Stockport County, who came back from 2-0 down to beat Wealdstone. Wrexham struggled to create clear chances against a Bromley side who have been hard to beat at home this season. Andy Woodman's Ravens climb to ninth, while Wrexham stay fourth. Aaron Hayden and Max Cleworth headed over for Wrexham, while Ollie Palmer shot wide. Jude Arthurs headed off target at the other end before Rob Lainton made a fine save to deny Luke Coulson.

138,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/53546100,FA Cup final 2020: Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea - Aubameyang double secures victory,"Arsenal's talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang worked his Wembley magic once again as they came from behind to beat Chelsea and win the FA Cup for a record 14th time. Chelsea took the lead in the Heads Up FA Cup final inside five minutes through Christian Pulisic's smart finish but then fell victim to the brilliance of Aubameyang, who was also Arsenal's hero when he scored twice in the semi-final win over Manchester City. The Gabon forward drew Arsenal level from the penalty spot before the break after he was fouled by Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, then produced a moment of world-class finishing to make the defining contribution to the first behind-closed-doors FA Cup final. Chelsea were hampered by a first-half injury to Azpilicueta and were struggling even further when they lost the outstanding Pulisic to a hamstring problem after the break. As the Blues battled to overcome those setbacks, the brilliant Aubameyang was able to give Mikel Arteta silverware in his first season as the Gunners' manager. Aubameyang, who Arsenal are understandably desperate to secure on a new long-term contract, turned Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma inside out in the 67th minute before delivering the most audacious finish, chipping over keeper Willy Caballero from an angle. Chelsea's agony increased further when Mateo Kovacic was very harshly sent off for a second yellow card, awarded by referee Anthony Taylor for the most innocuous of challenges on Granit Xhaka. Arsenal closed out the win to secure a place in the Europa League next season but it was bitter disappointment for Chelsea manager Frank Lampard at the conclusion of his first campaign in charge. Arteta's delight at the final whistle was obvious as he secured his first major trophy as a manager, having only succeeded Unai Emery in December. There have been some mixed moments - but in recent weeks, Arsenal have shown their development by defeating new Premier League champions Liverpool and ending Manchester City's hopes of retaining the FA Cup by beating them to reach the final. Now the Gunners have the trophy in their hands after seeing off Chelsea. In each game they have shown character, courage and resilience - all qualities they have regularly been accused of lacking - and have a world-class spearhead in Aubameyang. A player of that calibre makes the difference in the big games. Aubameyang has shown that, making Wembley his personal playground in both the semi-final and the final. It may have been a surreal occasion, this FA Cup final played in a virtually deserted Wembley and missing so much of the traditional ceremony and atmosphere, but the joy of victory was still relished by Arteta and his players and rightly so. And when the celebrations end, Arsenal will know with even more certainty what their summer priority must be, even above any acquisitions. Arsenal must find a way to keep Aubameyang. Their cause is helped by being able to offer him European football, albeit the Europa League rather than the Champions League. He is quite simply a talent that gives Arsenal another dimension of danger. He is a match-winner - and in this instance, an FA Cup final winner. It all started so well for Chelsea and Lampard as they dominated the opening phases at Wembley and led through Pulisic's goal. The momentum changed after the first-half drinks break as Chelsea were undone by their own injuries, Arsenal's vast improvement and the dismissal of Kovacic. Chelsea lost the experience of Azpilicueta and the thrilling talent of Pulisic, who actually injured his hamstring as he raced in on goal with a very good chance, and were then fighting an uphill battle. They tried to regain that earlier supremacy but were hit by that brilliant goal from Aubameyang and the sending off of Kovacic. The Croatia international was shown a second yellow card for a challenge with Xhaka that raised questions as to whether it was actually a foul before referee Anthony Taylor eventually produced the red card. It more or less signalled the end of Chelsea's hopes. Lampard's first season, which has contained so much promise, concludes with a place in next season's Champions League but not a trophy. There has been much to admire from Chelsea as Lampard has mixed youth and experience but there is a defensive frailty he must address, having added to his attacking resources with the exciting addition of Timo Werner. Those defensive weaknesses were clear as Aubameyang preyed on them in deadly fashion. As they trooped to collect their losers' medals, Chelsea and Lampard will reflect on a day when little went right after that opening five minutes.

139,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57055571,Chelsea 0-1 Leicester: Foxes lift FA Cup for first time after Youri Tielemans stunner,"Youri Tielemans produced one of the great FA Cup final goals to give Leicester City the trophy for the first time in their history with victory over Chelsea at Wembley. The Belgian settled a closely contested encounter with a spectacular right-foot drive that flew beyond Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga into the top corner from 25 yards in the 63rd minute. It sent manager Brendan Rodgers racing down the touchline in celebration although Leicester's fans - inside Wembley as 21,000 supporters formed the biggest attendance since lockdown - had to survive a nerve-jangling closing phase before they could celebrate the win in their first final since 1969. The Foxes were indebted to two crucial saves from keeper Kasper Schmeichel, who turned former Leicester defender Ben Chilwell's header on to a post then produced an even better stop to turn Mason Mount's powerful shot wide. And in a final act of drama, Wes Morgan bundled into his own net following a last-minute goalmouth scramble before it was ruled out by the barest of margins following the intervention of VAR. Leicester closed out the win to spark emotional scenes as those inside Wembley rejoiced in a landmark victory. Foxes boss Rodgers had a smile that illuminated Wembley as he joined Leicester's players in joyous scenes of celebration after the manager and his players had written their name into the club's folklore. Gifted 24-year-old Tielemans will claim the glory for the sheer quality of the strike that won this FA Cup final and the rest of his performance oozed the quality that saw him named man of the match. The Foxes had heroes elsewhere, particularly in veteran keeper Schmeichel, who was well protected for most of the match but made a huge contribution when required. His second key save from Mount, one-handed diving away to his left, even had Rodgers turning around and blowing out his cheeks in relief and admiration. Youngster Luke Thomas was composed and Leicester even survived the premature loss of the experienced and influential defender Jonny Evans, who was a doubt before the game and suffered a recurrence of his heel injury, to keep Chelsea at bay. And for Rodgers, who cleaned up with Celtic in Scotland, this was another significant addition to his CV, as his expert guidance of Leicester - who are in a strong position to finish in the Premier League's top four and face Chelsea again at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday - now has a tangible reward in the shape of the FA Cup. This was the result of outstanding work by Rodgers and his players and the rest of the season may yet produce another high point if they can clinch a place in next season's Champions League. ""It is such an amazing feeling, in particular as a British coach,"" Rodgers told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I have grown up watching this all my life and to be eventually be here and be a winner in the FA Cup is special. ""I knew we had prepared very well. The players have shown through the season they can fight, have quality and have a desire to win. We were playing against the Champions League finalists, with quality and the level they have been at. But I thought tactically we were brilliant."" Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel revealed he was in ""angry mode"" after the surprise home loss to Arsenal suddenly put pressure on their top-four hopes in the Premier League - although the Champions League final against Manchester City could yet prove the most glittering safety net. He certainly looked an angry man throughout this final, the body language increasingly frustrated right up until that final twist when a late equaliser was snatched from Chelsea's grasp by VAR. Chelsea now face a massive game against these same opponents in midweek but they will have to recover swiftly from this disappointment and the knowledge they did not do themselves justice. They certainly had their moments and will complain of ill-fortune, about a suspicion of handball before Tielemans' goal and those magnificent saves from Schmeichel but this was a stuttering Chelsea, not the smooth machine that saw off Real Madrid with such comfort in the Champions League semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. Timo Werner seemed a particular source of frustration to Tuchel, the manager enraged when he lost a physical challenge to Tielemans, and it may be he regrets that he did not start with the improving Kai Havertz. And Chilwell, left out for Marcos Alonso, was a source of real danger when he was eventually introduced as a substitute, almost rescuing Chelsea twice. Chelsea and Tuchel now face a huge fortnight with the fight for the top four in the balance and that Champions League final to come against Manchester City - and the manager will know they will have to perform better than this. This was the day atmosphere, emotion and deafening noise returned to English football as 21,000 supporters made Wembley sound like it was playing host to a capacity crowd. Fans relished the traditional FA Cup fanfare from the Coldstream Guards and the hymn Abide With Me before throwing themselves wholeheartedly into an experience they have been largely deprived of since the first coronavirus lockdown began in March 2020. And how it showed in those final stages, with Leicester's fans suffering frayed nerves as their team held on for history while Chelsea's followers urged their side on in the hope of a comeback. At the final whistle, it was just like old times as those thousands of Leicester supporters stayed in their seats for the trophy celebration to take in scenes that will live with them forever while the Chelsea end was a scene of desolation before it became a sea of deserted red seats. It only emphasised once more that football quite simply is not the same in any form without fans. Chelsea boss Tuchel felt VAR decisions proved decisive in the game. ""The players said straight away it was a handball,"" he said of the ball appearing to hit Ayoze Perez's hand in the build up to the goal. ""So now for the second game in a row there was a handball against us, and VAR is not interfering. Against Arsenal there was one on the line, and again today, and they are very decisive. ""I'm not an expert in handball any more, I don't know when it's handball or not. ""I don't know any more when they need to punish it or it's OK to play with the hand. ""We were unlucky today. But there's never any guarantee you'll end up with a trophy.""

140,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60352740,Chelsea win Club World Cup: Kai Havertz winner sees off Palmeiras after extra time,"Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel dedicated his side's first Club World Cup triumph to owner Roman Abramovich after an extra-time win against Brazilian side Palmeiras. A 117th-minute penalty in Abu Dhabi by Kai Havertz - who also scored their 2021 Champions League winner - means the Blues have now won every possible trophy under the ownership of the Russian billionaire Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring with a header in the second half before Raphael Veiga levelled from the spot. Palmeiras defender Luan was sent off in added time as the Blues sealed victory. ""It is for him, there is no doubt that it is for him,"" said Tuchel of Abramovich. ""We met quickly on the pitch after the final, he said 'congratulations' and I said 'congratulations, it's for you, it's your club and it's your input and your passion that made this possible' and I'm happy to be part of it. ""So of course the trophy is for him."" Much like in their semi-final win against Al-Hilal, Chelsea dominated possession but struggled to create chances for much of the final in the United Arab Emirates. Their cutting edge looked unlikely to improve when Mason Mount was forced off through injury, just as he was in their FA Cup tie with Plymouth, while Lukaku continued to cut an isolated figure up front. Palmeiras were content to make the most of their threat on the counter-attack, with the pace of Rony and Dudu stretching the Blues defence, but there were very few clear-cut chances. Then nine minutes after the break, Lukaku made the breakthrough when Callum Hudson-Odoi sent in his first pinpoint cross and the Belgium striker powered a header past Weverton. Christian Pulisic, Mount's replacement, went close with a shot from distance after a smart lay-off from Lukaku as the English side looked to cement their control. But just past the hour mark, Palmeiras equalised when Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled in the area and, after a check on the pitch-side monitor, Veiga converted emphatically from 12 yards to send the game into extra time. With a penalty shoot-out looming, Chelsea secured the trophy with a spot-kick of their own. Luan's handball was also checked on the monitor before Germany playmaker Havertz fired home. Luan was then dismissed for a foul on the match winner in the final minute, after the referee was told to consult the monitor for a third time. Tuchel says he only beat his Covid isolation at the ""second-to-last chance"" to coach Chelsea to their maiden Club World Cup title in person. The Blues' German boss was frustrated by having to coach Chelsea in the FA Cup fourth round against Plymouth and the Club World Cup semi-final from his office. And, as time ticked down, he says he made several drives to the airport without even waiting for his Covid test result, such was his desperation to join the Chelsea squad in Abu Dhabi. He tested negative at the penultimate chance to reach the United Arab Emirates in time though. ""We were running out of lights, with the time difference we knew the deadline was coming,"" said Tuchel. ""So it was the second-to-last chance to make it, the last one would have been to arrive today in the morning. So I'm happy that we made it. ""I was several times on my way to the airport and several times while I was driving called back because my test was not negative. ""And finally we made it, I arrived yesterday for dinner, at 8.15 in the evening. Coaching is also about feeling, on the touchline. It's not possible to coach only from the office.""

141,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58157867,Uefa Super Cup: Chelsea defeat Villarreal on penalties in Belfast to lift trophy for second time,"Chelsea beat Villarreal 6-5 in a penalty shootout to lift the Uefa Super Cup for a second time after a draining 120 minutes in Belfast. Substitute goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga saved captain Raul Albiol's spot-kick at Windsor Park on a night that began superbly for the Blues with an excellent first-half performance before the Spaniards stormed back into the contest after the break. Hakim Ziyech opened the scoring midway through the opening 45 minutes but was then forced off with what looked like a worrying shoulder injury before half-time. The Spaniards hit the woodwork either side of the break before Gerard Moreno equalised in the 73rd minute to force extra time. Chelsea, who look set to complete a deal to re-sign striker Romelu Lukaku for a club record fee of £97.5m from Inter Milan, failed to rediscover their first-half vigour in extra time but did come close to a winner through Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount. It was the first time the Super Cup was played in Northern Ireland and 13,000 spectators generated a fantastic atmosphere in the south Belfast stadium, the highest attendance at any sports event in the country since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Kepa was brought off the bench by Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel just a few minutes before the end of extra time and dived low to his right to save from Albiol - his second save of the shootout having also denied Aissa Mandi - and spark mass scenes of celebration among the Chelsea players and supporters. Ziyech's goal arrived in the 27th minute when the lively Kai Havertz ran on to a ball into the left channel and delivered a precise pull-back, with Ziyech directing his shot in despite not getting a clean connection. Villarreal's equaliser was the result of a poor clearance out of defence by Antonio Rudiger, with Gerard Moreno feeding Boulaye Dia, whose clever flick-return to the Spaniard was clinically swept past Edouard Mendy. It was an equaliser that looked like coming after Alberto Moreno crashed a volley off the underside of the crossbar in first-half injury time and Mendy had dived superbly to tip a Gerard Moreno shot on to the post after the keeper had initially given the ball away. The opening 40 minutes were something of a stroll for Chelsea as they imposed themselves on Villarreal, not giving their Spanish opponents a glimmer of hope until just before the break. The contrasting styles of captain-for-the-night N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic in midfield provided a base from which to apply pressure on the Europa League winners, with Kovacic's diagonal balls to Callum Hudson-Odoi on the right particularly penetrating. Timo Werner had their first chance in the sixth minute, having his close-range volley well saved by Sergio Asenjo, while Kante flashed just wide from 20 yards before Zouma volleyed an excellent chance over the bar. Ziyech then clashed with Juan Foyth and went down, requiring oxygen treatment and going off the pitch with his right shoulder having to be supported amid a chaotic closing few minutes to the first half. Tuchel's side looked flat as the second half got under way and were not helped when the inevitable host of substitutions began being made, though Villarreal deserve credit for taking advantage and giving their enthusiastic supporters something to cheer on their first Super Cup appearance.

142,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59019330,Manchester City 0-2 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha & Conor Gallagher spoil Pep Guardiola's 200th Premier League game,"Wilfried Zaha became the first player to score 50 top-flight goals for Crystal Palace as 10-man Manchester City suffered a shock defeat at Etihad Stadium. Zaha struck after just six minutes when Conor Gallagher robbed Aymeric Laporte inside his own half before Gallagher wrapped up the points when he fired home two minutes from time. Laporte was red-carded by referee Andre Marriner in first-half stoppage time when he committed a professional foul by bringing down Zaha 35 yards from the City goal. Even a man down, the hosts remained a goal threat and Gabriel Jesus thought he had levelled when he turned home Phil Foden's superb far-post cross, only for video assistant referee Lee Mason to rule the England forward was offside in the build-up. City fans were infuriated by what they saw as time-wasting from Palace, which started in the opening period, and manager Pep Guardiola - marking his 200th match in the Premier League as a manager - was less than impressed with what he saw too, judging by the number of times he spoke to fourth official Anthony Taylor. But Palace were a danger on the break, with Jordan Ayew and Gallagher both wasting decent chances before Gallagher finished Michael Olise's lay-off to give Patrick Vieira's men victory and end a frustrating run of four consecutive Premier League draws. City's defence had been virtually watertight this season but there was an element of over-confidence that led to Palace's breakthrough. Laporte had lots of space and time to decide what to do with the ball as he advanced towards the halfway line. But he didn't react as Gallagher closed in and a quick exchange of passes later, Zaha was through. The contact wasn't the greatest but the accuracy was there and the shot found the bottom corner. It was the first Premier League goal City had conceded at home all season and only their fourth in the top flight in total. Laporte's dismissal made their task harder an d Bernardo Silva and Jesus both needed to be calmed down as the half-time whistle blew, even though the Spain defender's only complaint could be the distance from his own goal that the offence took place. Although Palace memorably won at this ground in December 2018, it was their only positive result in 12 trips to Etihad Stadium that otherwise yielded just two points. For Vieira, victory was particularly special, partly because of the time he spent at City as both a player and a youth-team coach, but mainly because of the nasty habit his side had developed of giving away leads late in games. Zaha's goal was the fourth time in five matches they had been in front - yet they had failed to win any of the previous three. Yet again, Gallagher was superb in midfield, his energy helping to shield a defence who, at times, did exceptionally well not to be lured into giving away a penalty, in particular by the close control of Bernardo and Jack Grealish. By the time Gallagher scored, Palace had weathered the storm as City slipped five points behind leaders Chelsea. Manchester City are next in action against Belgian side Club Bruges in the Champions League on Wednesday, 3 November (20:00 GMT).

143,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,"Samuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. ""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. ""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy."" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""

144,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34670192,Jose Mourinho: Chelsea sack boss after Premier League slump,"Chelsea have sacked manager Jose Mourinho seven months after he led them to the Premier League title. The 52-year-old Portuguese had been in his second spell at the club, taking charge in June 2013. Chelsea finished eight points clear last season and won the League Cup, but have lost nine of their 16 league games so far and are 16th in the table, one point above the relegation places. Mourinho's final match was Monday's 2-1 defeat at leaders Leicester City. Pep Guardiola, Guus Hiddink, Juande Ramos and Brendan Rodgers have all been touted as possible successors as Blues owner Roman Abramovich begins another managerial search. ""Chelsea Football Club and Jose Mourinho have today parted company by mutual consent. ""All at Chelsea thank Jose for his immense contribution since he returned as manager in the summer of 2013. ""His three league titles, FA Cup, Community Shield and three League Cup wins over two spells make him the most successful manager in our 110-year history. ""But both Jose and the board agreed results have not been good enough this season and believe it is in the best interests of both parties to go our separate ways. ""The club wishes to make clear Jose leaves us on good terms and will always remain a much-loved, respected and significant figure at Chelsea. ""His legacy at Stamford Bridge and in England has long been guaranteed and he will always be warmly welcomed back to Stamford Bridge. ""The club's focus is now on ensuring our talented squad reaches its potential. ""There will be no further comment until a new appointment is made."" BBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said he was ""shocked"" by Mourinho's departure but admitted Chelsea's form had been dreadful. ""I've never known a capitulation like it from a football club,"" the former England captain told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I have never known players to perform like they did last season and then be so bad now. It's unprecedented."" Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said he was ""shocked to say the least"", adding: ""They must already have somebody lined up to have done it now. ""I'm sad to see Jose go because I got to know him quite well and he's a great manager with great character. He's a loss to the Premier League."" Former England and Arsenal defender Martin Keown said Mourinho had ""lost the players"". ""It has imploded in front of our eyes,"" he said. ""It is astonishing. I saw players who were not giving everything. ""There is no trust there, respect is gone. Ultimately it is easier to change a manager than 22 players."" Tim Rolls, of the Chelsea Supporters Trust, told the BBC News channel that fans would have preferred to lose some of the players rather than Mourinho. ""The point he was making about betrayal was they spent hours training to stop Leicester's Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez and they both scored goals, so they betrayed his methods rather than him. ""Mourinho is one of the great managers in world football and Chelsea have let him go twice, I think that's a great shame. ""Even when we have lost matches at home the supporters have chanted his name, there has been very little dissent about him going [wanting him to go]. I would have thought there would be frustration with some of the players."" Ex-Blues defender Graham Roberts told BBC Radio 5 live: ""He came in and said he was 'The Special One'. He's not 'The Special One' any more."" ""Jose Mourinho had a meeting with the club at around 14:30 GMT, when he was told the end had come. ""He won't be paid the £40m compensation speculated. My understanding is he has been paid until the end of this season, what was left of the annual salary of £12m he receives. ""While he has undeniably enjoyed so much success around Europe, he has failed to secure a lasting legacy and enjoy success over a prolonged period of time. ""Chelsea faced a huge decision and Roman Abramovich had to make it."" Mourinho leaves with Chelsea only a point above the relegation zone and 20 points behind Leicester. Champions League qualification via one of the top four spots in the Premier League looks highly unlikely. However, the Blues are through to the last 16 of European football's biggest club competition, where they will face French champions Paris St-Germain in February and March. Mourinho only signed a new four-year contract on 7 August and is Chelsea's most successful manager. He won three Premier League titles, two of those in his first spell between 2004 and 2007. The Portuguese has also won the FA Cup, in 2007, and the League Cup three times - in 2005, 2007 and 2015. It has not only gone wrong in the Premier League for Mourinho; he has also had his issues off the pitch. A 2-2 draw with Swansea on 8 August was overshadowed by a fallout with his medical team, in particular club doctor Eva Carneiro. Carneiro had her role downgraded after Mourinho said his medical staff were ""naive"" for running onto the pitch to treat midfielder Eden Hazard. She eventually left on 22 September and is now taking legal action against Mourinho and the Blues. Mourinho also received a suspended stadium ban and £50,000 fine for claiming referees were ""afraid"" to award his team penalties in a 3-1 home loss to Southampton in October. He subsequently had to serve a one-match stadium ban and pay a £40,000 fine for his behaviour during a 2-1 defeat by West Ham, when he spoke to referee Jon Moss at half-time. It is unlikely he will be out of management for long, given his record of success at Chelsea and other top European clubs. He guided Porto and Inter Milan to Champions League glory in 2004 and 2010 respectively, then Real Madrid to the Spanish La Liga title in 2012. However, Shearer said his departure from Chelsea ""will tarnish him"". At 52, Mourinho is still some way from retirement age, but he has expressed a wish to coach the English and Portuguese national sides at some stage in his career. In fact, he claimed he turned down the chance to become England boss when Steve McClaren was sacked in 2007. Mourinho has a proven track record of bringing success over the short term but doubts will remain over his ability to build a dynasty. Will that make his candidature less appealing to the kind of club he is used to managing, such as Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain, Manchester United or Manchester City? The Blues may be struggling at the wrong end of the Premier League table, but they are still in the Champions League and the FA Cup, while achieving European qualification is not impossible. The key for any new manager is improving the morale of a talented squad that has underachieved this season. Players such as Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, Willian, and Oscar were key to Chelsea winning the league title but performances have fallen well below the heights they reached last year. After the 2-1 defeat by Leicester Mourinho said he felt his ""work was betrayed"" by his players, and midfielder Cesc Fabregas has said it is time for everyone to step up. ""If you are a big player and paid like a big player, you must play like a big player and behave like a big player,"" said the Spain international. Short term, it's looking like ex-Netherlands coach Guus Hiddink, who has already had a stint in charge of the Blues, and former Tottenham Hotspur and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos. Both are without a job at the moment so are able to slot in quickly. But will either be in charge beyond the end of the season, when the likes of Pep Guardiola might be available? The former Barcelona boss is due to make an announcement on his Bayern Munich future next week. Speculation is he will quit the Bundesliga giants when his contract finishes at the end of the current campaign. Other likely candidates are Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone, Carlo Ancelotti, who guided Chelsea to the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010, and former England boss Fabio Capello.

145,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61102195,Pep Guardiola: Man City 'in big trouble' despite 'deserved' Champions League win over Atletico,"Manchester City's superb Champions League victory over Atletico Madrid could have come at a cost, with Pep Guardiola admitting his side are ""in big trouble"" as a result of injuries picked up in the Spanish capital. Both Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker were forced off as City staged a defiant defensive display to claim a 0-0 draw at the Wanda Metropolitano, securing a 1-0 aggregate win. Guardiola did not reveal the extent of the injuries but was clearly concerned, with Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool to follow. The Reds made seven changes from Sunday's high-intensity 2-2 Premier League draw at City, as Jurgen Klopp rested a number of key players in their Champions League last-eight tie with Benfica on Wednesday. But Guardiola made just two for the tough test against the Spanish champions. ""Today we celebrate because it is the third time in Manchester City's history we are in the Champions League semi-finals,"" the City boss told BT Sport. ""But we can't forget we played three days ago, travelled, came here, have a lot of injuries now and I don't know what will happen in the next weeks. ""We cannot play all the time and score four or five goals, we are human beings - we come from a difficult game against Liverpool. ""We are in big trouble."" Wednesday's second leg in Madrid was a bruising encounter all round for City, who had to contend with an Atletico side showing far greater ambition than in a first leg where they failed to have a single effort at goal. Diego Simeone's side were also extremely physical, allowing this to spill over into ill-discipline late on, with Felipe seeing red for a dangerous follow-through on Phil Foden, having earned his first yellow card for an elbow to the same player that drew blood. The second yellow sparked an on-field confrontation between both sets of players and those on the two benches. Former City defender Stefan Savic appeared to headbutt Raheem Sterling and pull Jack Grealish's hair in the melee. There was also a suggestion Guardiola had liquid thrown at him as he headed for the tunnel, while there were reports of more clashes and police having to intervene. ""Everyone saw the action, but I have nothing to say,"" added the City boss. ""It is the champion of Spain and they played with energy and, in the second half, were better than us and we were lucky we didn't concede. In the first half we had chances, overall we are in the semi-finals - it is well deserved. ""The opponent is so tough, all the teams in the Champions League come here and suffer so it is important we go through."" Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Liverpool is the latest in a crucial run of fixtures for City as they look to claim a Treble of domestic and European trophies. Guardiola's Premier League leaders and Jurgen Klopp's second-placed Reds are separated by just one point with seven games remaining. And both are now in the last four of the Champions league, with City looking to win the tournament for the first time - and on course for a final meeting with Liverpool, who face Villarreal in the other tie. City defender John Stones was superb in Madrid, producing an intelligent and resolute display, epitomised by a block to prevent Matheus Cunha's close-range drive finding the net in the second half. He too wanted to focus less on the unsavoury aspects of the game and more on his side's achievement - one that showcased a maturity and clear growth to compete on Europe's biggest stage. ""We knew it was not an easy place to come - it is a hostile environment. It was a difficult night all round and how we defended and controlled ourselves over the two legs was incredible,"" Stones told BT Sport. ""We know that they sometimes try to make things happen like that and we dealt with it really well. ""It is not nice to talk about and I don't want to dwell on it because over the two legs we played incredible against such an experienced side in what they do; we kept our tempers."" Stones also praised Foden, who was the spark off the bench that helped fashion City's winner in the first leg and looked to be the main target of Atletico's aggression on Wednesday. ""Phil was such a threat in both games, instant impact in the first and how he drove us up the pitch tonight, gained yards and free-kicks - I think he is feeling it now,"" added the England centre-back. BBC Radio 5 Live senior football correspondent Ian Dennis: ""I don't know where to start. It was an extremely chaotic finish. That was such an ill-tempered finish in the game. ""There were periods of play in stoppage time where a game of football wasn't breaking out. The support from the Atletico fans was astonishing."" Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I don't think I have seen anything like this in all my years playing and watching football. To see a team lose at home, to get knocked out and the atmosphere is incredible. ""It turned ugly at the end, we talked about the dark arts, but City saw it through. They were pushed, they were tested all the way. ""What I would say is, second half, City didn't have the control. You felt it was building for Atletico and then Felipe cost them and it was buffoonery at the highest level. City were spooked by what happened. ""The main thing for City is they got over the line."" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport: ""Distasteful behaviour from the Atletico players, they should be embarrassed with some of the antics they have gone on with. ""You have to say, talking about football, well done to Atletico Madrid as they made Manchester City play in a way we haven't seen for a long time, took them out of their rhythm and their stride. ""But some of the stuff towards the end was not what you want to see on a football pitch."" Former England midfielder Owen Hargreaves on BT Sport: ""That, at the end, from Atletico Madrid was a disgrace. ""They played so well in the game, they don't need all that rubbish, all those antics - late challenges, yellow cards, red cards, pulling hair."" Ex-Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott on BT Sport: ""Overall, Atletico did well in the second leg, but the last 10 minutes, you can't condone that."" ",positive,liverpool,4

Goalkeeper Adrian kept out Tammy Abraham's spot kick to secure victory for the Champions League winners. Chelsea had taken the lead in the first half through Olivier Giroud's clinical strike but Sadio Mane scored twice to give Liverpool the lead. Jorginho's spot-kick took the game to penalties, where Liverpool triumphed. The win comes just two months after Jurgen Klopp won his first trophy as Liverpool boss when he led the Reds to a 2-0 win over Tottenham in the Champions League final. Games between these two sides in Europe have historically been tight affairs, with just one of their 10 previous meetings having been won by a margin of more than one goal. It was the same again on Wednesday night as the two teams tussled for 120 minutes in a game that did not finish until almost 1am in Istanbul. In the end, it came down to who could keep their cool in the sweltering heat and after nine excellent penalties, Abraham placed his shot too close to Adrian to hand Liverpool their first silverware of the season. Two weeks ago Adrian was without a club, having been released by West Ham at the end of last season. But, following Simon Mignolet's departure to Club Brugge, Klopp snapped up the 32-year-old shot-stopper to provide experienced cover for Alisson. Adrian had barely had time to get to know his new team-mates when he was called upon earlier than expected as Liverpool's first-choice goalkeeper injured his calf in the 4-1 win against Norwich in the Premier League's season-opener last Friday. With Alisson facing a spell on the sidelines, Adrian made his full debut against Chelsea. It was his first competitive start since January, but he showed little signs of nerves or rustiness, catching the eye in the first half when he sprung off his line to deny Mateo Kovacic from close range. There was little he could do about Chelsea's opener, which was a clinical finish by Giroud, although he did give away the penalty deep in extra time when he took the legs of Abraham. But that gave him the platform to produce his penalty shootout heroics, which will give him and the Liverpool fans confidence he can be an able deputy during Alisson's absence. Chelsea lost 4-0 at Manchester United on Sunday and while this was another defeat for the Blues and their new manager Frank Lampard, there were plenty of positives to be taken from Wednesday night's performance. Lampard fielded a young side at Old Trafford but turned to the older heads in his squad for this game. The added bit of experience and quality showed, particularly in a dominant first-half display. N'Golo Kante was by far the best player on the pitch in the opening 45 minutes as he pulled the strings in midfield, while Giroud showed the clinical finishing that was absent for the Blues at the weekend. Christian Pulisic also caught the eye on his first competitive start for Chelsea. The 20-year-old American provided a creative spark, while his movement and vision had more than a hint of Eden Hazard about them. One moment that caught the eye saw him run onto a through ball in the first half, cut inside before tucking a neat finish inside the near post. However, the goal was ruled out for offside following a VAR check. If Lampard is able to get the balance of youth and experience right in his first XI, Chelsea could be an exciting team to watch this season. History was made in the game as France's Stephanie Frappart became the first woman to referee a major European men's game. The 35-year-old has officiated matches in the third division of men's football in France and refereed the Women's World Cup final in France this summer. Frappart, who led a team largely made up of female officials which included assistant referees Manuela Nicolosi of France and Michelle O'Neill from the Republic of Ireland, was praised on social media for her performance. She let the game flow, while VAR was not called upon in the game to overturn any of her decisions. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BT Sport: ""It was a very difficult game for both teams. It was all about winning it and we did that in the end. ""Nobody in the stadium wanted extra time, it was a killer. I'm not sure about the penalty but who cares now. ""We started well then dropped off... we could talk about football but it's too late now. We had to fight and the boys did tonight."" Chelsea manager Frank Lampard speaking to BT Sport: ""I've got nothing but pride in the team and the performance, and confidence in what that means. ""It was a tough game against a good Liverpool team that had extra time to recover after the weekend. But sometimes football comes down to little moments of luck.""

147,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/54605829,Leicester City 3-0 Zorya Luhansk: Harvey Barnes excels in Europa League win,"England internationals James Maddison and Harvey Barnes scored their first European goals as Leicester marked their return to continental action with a comfortable home win. The Foxes had looked set to secure Champions League football for the majority of last season but set about their task in the second-tier competition with zest after a sticky start. Ukrainian visitors Zorya had their moments in the opening stages and Kasper Schmeichel was called into serious action with the score at 0-0. But even without the injured Jamie Vardy, Brendan Rodgers' side ultimately had too much. Barnes, the standout performer on the night, curled a shot against the post and when Kelechi Iheanacho flicked the loose ball out, Maddison had a simple finish. Barnes then ran through the heart of the Zorya defence to clip in a second and Iheanacho took advantage of a defensive lapse to score the third. The match was also notable as Stephanie Frappart - who became the first female referee to officiate a major men's European match when she took charge of last year's Uefa Super Cup - made an immaculate Europa League debut. With Vardy in the stands because of a calf injury, there was concern over where the Leicester goal threat may come from. But, with replacement Iheanacho tending to drop deeper and get involved in some great link-up play, it was the pace of Barnes running in behind who stretched the game. A constant threat throughout, Barnes ended the night with five shots on goal and created two chances, while his individual goal was sublimely taken. At the other end, Schmeichel was one of just two starters who played in Leicester's last game in Europe - the Champions League quarter-final of 2017 - and his early save from Vladyslav Kabaev was key. Barnes and Maddison then took charge of the game as Leicester showed enough to suggest they could go deep in this marathon competition. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers on BT Sport: ""It was a very good win, it's nice to get the points on the board and a clean sheet. We had to work hard, there's areas where we can get better. ""They play a diamond and it's a system where they can hurt you on the inside. When they had the ball they were a threat but we killed the game in the second half.

Now it has happened to Southampton twice in 16 months. Manchester United's 9-0 thrashing of the Saints on Tuesday came after Ralph Hasenhuttl's side were thumped by the same scoreline against Leicester in October 2019. United's 9-0 win over Ipswich Town in 1995 was the only other time it has happened. And, much like in the home defeat by Leicester, Southampton suffered an early setback at Old Trafford with a sending off, this time youngster Alexandre Jankewitz receiving a straight red card after only two minutes. Hasenhuttl and his side took on a recovery process after that humiliation at the hands of the Foxes, enduring reminders of the result in the build-up to a 2-1 win against the same opponent three months later, and facing up to questions on the one-year anniversary. They emerged stronger, it seemed, winning five of their first eight league games this season and being praised for their high-energy approach. Only four weeks ago they beat defending champions Liverpool 1-0. But now the rebuilding starts again. ""We lost again in a horrible way. The same story: one man down and 90 minutes can be long,"" said Austrian Hassenhuttl, who had nine players out injured against United. ""The lads had no alternatives - no players on the bench, no alternatives to defend better. In the end, it's a different situation to the first time. ""It hurts more to have this result again. But the team is a different one now and we've had a good season so far. Let's see how the season ends."" Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman, speaking on BBC's Match of the Day: ""Southampton have to get results - like they did last time [they lost 9-0]. They stuck together and galvanised the team. They need positivity back in the club. They're on a poor run."" Former England forward Dion Dublin, speaking on BBC's Match of the Day: ""I like Ralph. He is a very good manager and has a good squad of players who will stick together. It is all about managing what has happened on Tuesday in the best way possible."" BBC Radio Five Live commentator Alistair Bruce-Ball: ""I don't think the Southampton board last season, after the 9-0 loss to Leicester, were ever really minded to get rid of Hasenhuttl because they have always trusted in him and they believe in him for the long term. ""There's no worry about this latest defeat at all because they have had such a good start to the campaign and will consider the circumstances behind this latest loss."" And what about Hasenhuttl? ""Yes it hurts. It hurts me the most, but I cannot change it any more - it's happened. The only way is we are together. I sit here and answer and at the moment I've no alternatives over what I do with the team, and that's it."" BBC football reporter Simon Stone at Old Trafford Hassenhuttl was courteous in answering questions and adamant there is a big difference between this 9-0 defeat and the one his side suffered against Leicester. Then, they went on to lose three more games and draw another before he changed tactics and began a journey that took them to the top of the table earlier this season. There were some unique factors that conspired against Hassenhuttl's team at Old Trafford - a massive injury list, an early red card and a debatable second one. Faith in the Austrian to turn the situation around remains high. But having spent the summer constructing ""the Southampton playbook"", Hasenhuttl needs to ensure there is no hangover from this shuddering setback, otherwise major questions will need to be answered. The problem with producing a blueprint is that you don't have a lot of room for manoeuvre if it starts to go wrong. And if positivity saw Hasenhuttl through first time around, maybe he can take some solace from this Saints fan... ",positive,liverpool,1
149,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806218,Sheffield United 2-1 West Bromwich Albion: Blades claim important win over fellow strugglers,"Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder says his side are ""alive and kicking and fighting for their lives"" after they fought back to claim a valuable victory over fellow Premier League strugglers West Brom. Matt Phillips' first-half goal had put the Baggies in charge of the contest between the Premier League's bottom two teams. However, changes in personnel, tactics and attitude saw a rejuvenated Blades side come from behind to claim their third Premier League win in the past five games. ""We needed a big second-half performance,"" Wilder said. ""We just had to let ourselves go a little bit which we did in the second half. We were more ambitious. ""It's a big win but there is still a long way to go and we are not getting carried away at all, there is a huge challenge in front of us. Just because we have won a couple of games recently, it's the Premier League and it hurts you. ""I have a group that are alive and kicking and fighting for their lives."" Both Wilder and his opposite number Sam Allardyce had identified the importance of this fixture to their hopes of avoiding relegation. Initially the Baggies' more direct approach appeared to give them the upper hand at a rain-soaked Bramall Lane, with Phillips tapping in after home goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had parried efforts from Callum Robinson and Mbaye Diagne. However, the Blades levelled after the break when Jayden Bogle lashed a left-footed effort into the bottom right corner after being teed up by Chris Basham. Ramsdale's superb close-range save from Robinson then provided Sharp with the platform to secure the Blades' third victory of the season with a prodded finish into the bottom left corner. While Wilder's side remain bottom of the table they are now just a point behind West Brom, in 19th, and are 10 points from safety. For the first 45 minutes it had looked like being another typical hard-luck story for Sheffield United. The Blades displayed plenty of endeavour but rarely showed enough spark to break down a stubborn West Brom defence. However, the introduction of Oliver McBurnie at the break provided Wilder's side with an extra body in attack and the impetus to recover. A late first-half injury to George Baldock also inadvertently helped, with Bogle switching to the right and marauding forward at every opportunity. His impressive understanding with Basham offered a useful outlet and provided the hosts with the goal that started their comeback. After having just four attempts on goal in the first period, the hosts managed 10 in the second, which was a reflection of their dominance. And with Wilder preparing to substitute Sharp, the forward atoned for a wayward first-half header with the winning contribution. Since their Black Country derby victory over Wolves at Molineux, West Brom have collected just one point from 12 available. And with fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester United on the horizon, manager Sam Allardyce had suggested that this was a ""must-not-lose"" game. With that in mind, the former England boss said his side would revert to a ""simple"" style of football after they were completely outplayed at times in their 2-2 draw at Fulham. And he stuck to his word, with the Baggies shifting from a three-man defence to a conventional 4-4-2 formation and taking few chances by attempting to play out from the back. While neither of his deadline-day loan signings - Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Okay Yokuslu - featured, Diagne was handed a first start. And his robust presence, complemented by Robinson's running and an energetic display from Phillips set the tone for an early spell of dominance. However, that control faded and bar Robinson's chance midway through the second period, they rarely looked capable of adding to their goal tally. More disappointingly for Allardyce, they were undone by some lax defending with both Bogle and Sharp being surrounded by a posse of West Brom defenders, when they scored. ""You can't not do your job correctly, particularly when you are defending,"" said Allardyce. ""Overall, our defending today was very good. Those two moments could have been avoided and it's cost us two goals. ""It leaves us with a great gap to fill. It's simple maths. We know how many points it takes to stay in this league. What other people do and what other clubs do, we can't affect. We have to focus on getting 38 points.""

150,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806209,Wolves 2-1 Arsenal: David Luiz & Bernd Leno sent off as Gunners lose,"Arsenal had two players sent off as they threw away a lead and lost to Wolves - who won for the first time in nine Premier League games. The Gunners, who had earlier hit the woodwork twice and had a goal disallowed, went ahead when Nicolas Pepe held off two Wolves challenges and curled a fine finish into the net. But Arsenal were reduced to 10 men when defender David Luiz brought down Willian Jose, with Ruben Neves equalising with the resulting penalty in first-half injury time. Joao Moutinho scored with a brilliant strike from 30 yards out to put the hosts ahead soon after the restart. However, the Gunners were then reduced to nine men as goalkeeper Bernd Leno handled the ball outside of his penalty area after racing out trying to deny Adama Traore. This was Wolves' first league victory since a 2-1 victory at Molineux against Chelsea on 15 December, although they had also won two FA Cup ties - against Crystal Palace and National League North side Chorley - since then. Wolves remain in 14th and Arsenal - who would have gone sixth with victory - stay 10th, eight points behind fourth-placed Leicester City in the final Champions League qualification spot. The turning point came in first-half injury time when Arsenal were leading 1-0 and were dominant. Daniel Podence played the ball through to Jose and the Brazilian, on his home debut, had his heel clipped from behind by compatriot Luiz. Referee Craig Pawson decided that Luiz had made no attempt to play the ball and sent the centre-back off. It was Luiz's third red card for Arsenal after also being dismissed in the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in January 2020 and then again in the 3-0 loss to Manchester City in June. After the match, both managers had contrasting opinions with Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo saying Pawson had ""no other option"" but to award the penalty and send off Luiz. However, Gunners manager Mikel Arteta said he ""cannot tell you where the contact is"" and suggested the club may appeal Luiz's red card. Wolves, whose main threat had been restricted to set-pieces and long-range efforts, equalised with Neves' penalty, which he fired into the top corner. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta made a defensive substitution at the break as centre-back Gabriel came on for forward Alexandre Lacazette, but it only took the hosts four minutes of the second half to go ahead, through Moutinho's superb strike. The visitors brought on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for goalscorer Pepe in the 61st minute in an attempt to rescue something from the game. But Leno made a shocking decision in the 72nd minute as he sprinted out of his box, trying to reach the ball before the pacey Traore, but the goalkeeper misjudged the bounce, handled the ball and was dismissed. With Mat Ryan, who signed from Brighton last month, injured, third-choice goalkeeper Runar Runarsson was given a Premier League debut. The 25-year-old Iceland international, signed for £1.8m from Dijon in September, did well to deny Pedro Neto and substitute Vitinha as Wolves looked to finish the game off. That left Arsenal largely playing with two banks of four, in defence and midfield, with long spells of no-one playing up front before they could regain possession. Aubameyang and Hector Bellerin had shots from the edge of the penalty area blocked, but the Gunners could not force an unlikely equaliser. When these two sides met on 29 November at Emirates Stadium, Wolves won 2-1 and Arteta was facing questions over whether he would lose his job with the Gunners down in 14th. Arsenal had gone into Tuesday's game on an unbeaten run of seven Premier League matches and the Spaniard will surely be disappointed they did not extend that sequence, because they could have taken the game beyond Wolves in the first half. The Gunners nearly went ahead inside the opening 40 seconds when Saka hit the post after a fine pass from the excellent Thomas Partey. Saka then had an effort saved by Rui Patricio before the England midfielder did put the ball in the net, but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee because Lacazette was offside in the build-up. Pepe was denied when his strike was superbly pushed on to the crossbar by Patricio, but the Gunners' record signing did get on the scoresheet when he did superbly to nutmeg two Wolves defenders before curling the ball into the far corner. At that point, it looked like Arsenal would run away with the match, but the penalty and first red card on the stroke of half-time changed everything, with the Gunners unable to create any real opportunities in the second half. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said: ""Everything changes with the penalty, the dynamic of the game changes there. I think the referee doesn't have any other option in both situations [the penalty and the red card for Luiz]. ""The [Moutinho] goal is amazing. He is such a talented player and he deserves this moment. It's a very welcome win. It means a lot, we have been in a tough moment. ""We have done many beautiful things in past seasons and we want to emulate them again. The standards are very high and we have to chase them. ""We cannot allow ourselves to ever put our heads down. I will not allow our players to stop believing in themselves."" Arsenal manager Arteta told Match of the Day: ""The team was really on top of the game, we should have been three- or four-nil up and in that action [the Luiz red] the game changed completely. ""I've seen it 10 times in different angles and I cannot tell you where the contact is. If they have another 50 different angles to watch it, maybe I will be surprised. I looked at seven different angles and I cannot see any contact there. ""The team kept trying, kept playing, kept believing. At half-time, the boys were so animated because they believed they could still win the game. Obviously it was an incredible goal from long range, before that they didn't have any chances. But still we lost and we have to react. ""We hit the post, hit the bar, the keeper made a couple of great saves. We played exceptionally well, scored one goal and should have scored three or four and had more of a gap, but obviously you concede two red cards in the Premier League. I don't have any [complaints about] the second red card. ""The team is encouraging me every day to believe in them and to give me a positive feeling all the time.""

151,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806211,Manchester United 9-0 Southampton: Man Utd thrash nine-man Saints,"Manchester United equalled the Premier League record by putting nine goals past nine-man Southampton - the second time Saints have lost 9-0 in as many seasons. A red card for Saints' Alexandre Jankewitz after only two minutes triggered a complete collapse for the visitors, who were on the end of the same scoreline against Leicester City in October 2019. It is only the third time a team has lost 9-0 in the Premier League, with United also beating Ipswich Town by that margin in 1995. Aaron Wan-Bissaka opened the scoring with his first goal at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani also found the net either side of a Jan Bednarek own goal before the break. After a fairly drab start to the second half, United cut loose, scoring five times in the final 21 minutes. Anthony Martial ended an eight-match goal drought before Scott McTominay drove home from the edge of the area. Then, after Bednarek became the second Saints player to be sent off - bringing down Martial to allow Bruno Fernandes the chance to score from the penalty spot on 87 minutes - the French forward netted his second, before Dan James wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time. It was a stunning ending as United almost matched their club record 10-0 victory over Anderlecht in 1956. By the final whistle, it had been forgotten that United had come into Tuesday's game on the back of indifferent form - just one win in their last four matches. The massive impact on their goal difference means it is now bettered only by league leaders Manchester City. Martial should be particularly pleased with his contribution, even though it did not match manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's four-goal salvo as a United substitute in an 8-1 win at Nottingham Forest in 1999. At one point, it looked as though that seven-goal margin of victory was the one United would emulate. But Martial's 90th-minute second - the first time he has scored two in a game all season - took the home side beyond that, and James completed the rout in the third minute of injury time. Rashford and McTominay both produced noteworthy strikes for a United side that also had a penalty award overturned just before half-time. Making a full Premier League debut should be a cause for celebration in any young player's career. For Jankewitz, it was a catastrophic experience. His second-minute foul on McTominay was committed right in front of Saints boss Ralph Hassenhuttl, who did not require the replays which made the challenge look worse with every viewing. Hassenhuttl could only throw his arms up in the air in disbelief, knowing referee Mike Dean had no alternative other than to show the 19-year-old Swiss midfielder a straight red card. The incident came less than a week after Jankewitz's agent had started murmurings about a transfer and this sorry episode is unlikely to convince anyone the player has a future at St Mary's. After that, it was just a question of how long the visitors could survive, which turned out to be not very long, as Wan-Bissaka turned in Luke Shaw's cross at the far post from a position Jankewitz should have been defending. With Bednarek among the scorers after turning Rashford's cross into his own net for the third, and one of those marginal video assistant referee offside decisions that took away the goal Che Adams thought he had scored at the start of the second half, it really was one of those nights best erased from the memory completely. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the misery. While Hassenhuttl can rightly point to Jankewitz's dismissal as the key moment, there can be no excusing the way the team - though badly affected by injuries - had so totally collapsed by the end. Manchester United manager Solskjaer speaking to BBC Sport: ""When they had a man sent off it was up to us to get the first goal. ""You have to take your chances in tight or open games - you never know what might be the deciding factor. We know, better than anyone, what goal difference can do to you because we have lost the league on goal difference. ""Confidence is one thing but it was about the mojo and spark - the X-factor."" Southampton boss Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport: ""One man down after three minutes against this opponent - congratulations to Manchester United, they worked us off and did not stop scoring. The second red card is most disappointing - we don't have any more players. ""We tried in the second half to keep a clean sheet as much as we could, but at nine men it was too easy for them to score. ""What can I say? It is horrible. But we stood up after the first 9-0 [against Leicester] and we have to do that again.""

152,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806210,Newcastle United 1-2 Crystal Palace: Eagles fight back to beat Magpies,"Crystal Palace recorded back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since September as they kept an attack-minded Newcastle at bay at St James' Park. The Magpies had a handful of chances to add to the second-minute strike from Jonjo Shelvey, while Roy Hodgson's side made the most of their opportunities, turning the match around in a four-minute spell courtesy of goals from Jairo Riedewald and Gary Cahill. Riedewald's effort trumped Shelvey's half-volley, when his 20-yard rocket took a slight deflection off Ciaran Clark in beating keeper Karl Darlow. And then in the 25th minute 35-year-old Cahill leapt highest to flick Eberechi Eze's corner delivery past the reach of the Magpies keeper. In doing so, the former Chelsea defender became the club's oldest scorer in the competition. Andros Townsend should have made it 3-1 in stoppage time, but almost inexplicably struck his effort high and wide from four yards. The visiting backline was busier of the two defences with Vicente Guaita producing a great instinctive block to deny Ryan Fraser and making another save to deny the Scot. Victory sees Palace move level on 29 points with 12th place Southampton, while Newcastle remain in 16th and eight points above the drop-zone. Whether Hodgson's side can make it a hat-trick of successes at Leeds next Monday might depend on how serious Wilfried Zaha's injury is. The Ivory Coast winger came off in the 58th minute with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. This fourth away win of the season in the league was the product of disciplined defending, efficiency in attack and some luck. The Eagles had more than enough time to regroup after the early jolt from Shelvey and were thankful Newcastle's defending was not at the level it was during last weekend's win at Everton. Hodgson's own defence was exceptional on Tuesday. Guaita once again underlined his importance in the backline when he rushed out to get enough of a hand on Fraser's strike to push it wide. Full-back Nathaniel Clyne made a crucial challenge to deny Callum Wilson a shot on goal and Scott Dann produced a brave block to prevent substitute Allan Saint-Maximin from testing Guaita. Despite this eighth defeat in the past 11 league games, this was not a return to the bad old ways for Steve Bruce's side. They set up with a similar attacking formation which reaped rewards at Goodison Park and had Palace on the backfoot for much of the match, enjoying 61% of the possession. The only thing lacking was the same intensity they showed against the Toffees. Riedewald was given too much space to line up his shot for Palace's opener and the defence lost Cahill as he ran clear to nod in the second. Had Fraser stuck away his chance at 2-1 when he was one-on-one with Guaita then the Magpies might have got something out of this game. Bruce has got it tactically right now, he just needs his side to discover a cutting edge. Palace boss Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""We knew it wouldn't be easy, but it's good to get six points from here [and Wolves]. ""I thought we played well. Having seen the [Shelvey] goal back, it was a much better strike than I first anticipated. It was one heck of a strike really. ""We played well after that. At half-time I felt good about our play. But then you tend to be more cautious because you know they have to do something special and you perhaps stop asking questions. We really should have scored the third goal to put the game to bed."" On Zaha's injury: ""Suddenly we are looking around wondering where all our players are. It's going to be a problem trying to get these players fit again. These injuries have to be assessed. Zaha doesn't normally get injured so it's concerning he has come off. Hopefully it's nothing serious."" Newcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""Frustrated and disappointed as our performance didn't deserve for us to be beat. We had 10 minutes where we went too deep and let in sloppy goals. In this league that punishes you. ""Our performance levels have been better certainly over the last few weeks. We have tried to implement change in the last month or so and what you're looking for is a performance to go with it. As often in the Premier League, it's defining moments. Apart from that 10 to 15-minute spell, we had the better chances and should have taken something from the game.""

153,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59403645,Burnley beat fellow strugglers Everton 3-2 in Premier League with Maxwel Cornet winner,"Maxwel Cornet scored a late winner to earn Burnley a vital win over fellow strugglers Everton in their bid to remain in the Premier League. The Ivorian capitalised upon two poor errors by Jordan Pickford and Ben Godfrey in the 85th minute to earn Sean Dyche's side only their fourth league win of the season. It lifted them to within one point of safety behind Frank Lampard's fourth-bottom side. In an entertaining and feisty encounter, the hosts took a 12th-minute lead when an unmarked Nathan Collins scored at the back post from a corner. But the advantage did not last long as Richarlison stroked home the first of two penalties in the 18th minute when Ashley Westwood was adjudged to have tripped Anthony Gordon. His second came four minutes before half-time and was tinged with controversy. Despite Vitaliy Mykolenko being tripped by Aaron Lennon, referee Mike Dean did not think it amounted to a spot-kick, until he was advised by the video assistant referee to review it on the monitor and then overturned his decision. The home support showed their disgust with that call, but their mood improved after the break when a great burst by Charlie Taylor led to him crossing for Jay Rodriguez's equaliser in the 57th minute. And although Everton created the better chances as the second half wore on, Cornet's seventh goal of the season could not have been more crucial as it sent the home fans wild. By contrast, the Everton players and boss Lampard left the field dejected, with their 68-year stay in the top flight under serious pressure. The victory was as morale-boosting for Burnley as it was devastating for Everton, who have earned only two wins from nine league games since Lampard replaced Rafael Benitez in January. With wet and blustery conditions, this had all the ingredients for a relegation scrap, something Burnley have had more experience of in recent years compared to the visitors. But Everton matched their opponents for much of the game, and were on top for most of the second half as they sought to earn a success that would boost their own survival hopes. Richarlison almost had a hat-trick when his overhead kick was saved by Nick Pope. Dominic Calvert-Lewin then headed over, while Gordon had a great opportunity blocked by James Tarkowski when clean through. However, as had been the case for much of the season, Everton were undone by individual errors as their wretched away form continued. Pickford mis-kicked a clearance out of play with his right foot, which led to the throw-in from which Burnley got their winner. It was made worse when defender Godfrey also sliced a clearance from Matej Vydra's cross, allowing Cornet to finish. Everton now face a daunting task to stay in the league - and relegation would cause huge problems for a team that has registered heavy losses over the past three years. Burnley's stay in the Premier League has been less established than their opponents, but they showed the grit and determination needed to stay up. In both halves they started well and caused all sorts of problems from set-pieces, scoring for the first time in five games through Collins' early goal. They might have had cause to complain about both penalties, which the home fans certainly felt were soft. The second, via VAR, saw them vent their frustrations at referee Dean. But Rodriguez's goal was crucial in re-affirming their status in the game, and they defended well to deny Everton another. The fact they were gifted the winner will matter little to Dyche or Burnley's support, with fireworks being let off outside the stadium in celebration at the end. They also know they have a run-in which appears more favourable than that faced by Everton.

154,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59123988,Antonio Conte: Tottenham appoint former Chelsea boss as new manager,"Tottenham have appointed former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte as their new manager until summer 2023. The Premier League club sacked Nuno Espirito Santo on Monday after just 17 games, with Spurs eighth in the table. Tottenham says there is ""an option to extend"" 52-year-old Conte's deal with them. ""I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,"" said Conte. The Italian returns to London after winning the Premier League in his first season at Chelsea (2016-17) and the FA Cup in his second before being sacked in 2018. He then led Inter Milan to their first Serie A title in 11 years before leaving the club in May. Conte had been in charge for two years and Inter said it was a mutual decision to end his contract with one year remaining. The former Juventus and Italy coach was then in talks with Tottenham in the summer about becoming Jose Mourinho's successor. But negotiations were halted before Spurs appointed ex-Wolves boss Nuno at the end of June, with the Portuguese boss, 47, lasting just four months. ""I can't wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach,"" said Conte. ""Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn't yet the right time to return to coaching. ""But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of [Tottenham chairman] Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. ""Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction."" Conte's first game will be at home against Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in the Europa Conference League on Thursday before Spurs play at Everton in the league on Sunday. ""His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England,"" said Tottenham managing director of football Fabio Paratici. ""I know first hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players."" Analysis BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Antonio Conte will become one of the Premier League's highest-paid managers and adds to the list of high-profile coaches now working in the English top flight. His duels with Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel in particular will be fascinating. The speed with which this deal was done underlines the commitment managing director of football Fabio Paratici has to this working out and, while the option of an extension to Conte's 18-month contract was expected, it does suggest an element of long-term planning. Tottenham accept Conte's demanding style but Paratici in particular feels his fellow Italian is exactly what the club needs to drive them forward. The pair worked together at Juventus and Paratici is understood to have driven the process to bring Conte to Tottenham after talks in the summer failed to reach a positive conclusion.

155,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59589154,Leicester 2-3 Tottenham: Steven Bergwijn scores twice in injury time to give Spurs dramatic win,"Steven Bergwijn scored two injury-time goals as Tottenham fought back from 2-1 down to snatch an incredible victory at Leicester in a thrilling finish at the King Power Stadium. Leicester were moments away from inflicting a first Premier League defeat on Spurs since Antonio Conte took charge, before Bergwijn grabbed a 95th-minute equaliser from Matt Doherty's pass. But there was more drama to come. The Dutchman, who had only been introduced as a 79th-minute substitute, then took the ball around goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in the seventh minute of stoppage time and scored the winner with the ball going in off the post. It was a fitting finale to a brilliant match. The Foxes had taken the lead against the run of play in the 24th minute with Patson Daka's clinical finish over visiting goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with the hosts' first shot on target. But Harry Kane, who had earlier had a shot cleared off the line and also hit the crossbar, equalised just before half-time, collecting Harry Winks' ball forward, cutting inside Caglar Soyuncu and side-footing past Schmeichel. James Maddison then put Leicester ahead in the 76th minute after he had linked up well with substitute Harvey Barnes and the hosts thought they were collecting the three points before Bergwijn's dramatic double. Tottenham's win takes them above north London rivals Arsenal and up to fifth in the Premier League, while Leicester are 10th in the table. Leicester were playing for the first time in the Premier League in 2022 after games against Norwich, Everton and Burnley had been postponed because of Covid-19, while this match had originally been scheduled to take place on 16 December. The Foxes were without top scorer Jamie Vardy because of a thigh injury, while Nigeria's Kelechi Iheanacho is on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Daka was making only his third Premier League start and he took his opportunity in style, finishing well after a challenge from Tottenham's Sergio Reguilon saw the ball drop into his path. That goal came after Spurs had missed numerous chances, with two shots cleared off the line and a Kane header bouncing off the crossbar. Kane, who impressed throughout, then registered only his fifth Premier League goal of the season, although he has also netted eight times in cup games in 2021-22 as well as scoring 10 for his country. It also brought up a landmark for the England captain as the goal was his 250th in club matches. The performance of Maddison, capped once by the Three Lions in 2019 but pushing for a recall, would have also been pleasing for watching England boss Gareth Southgate. The Leicester midfielder produced two fine saves from Lloris, one in each half, before getting the goal his play deserved after he linked up with Barnes, who had only been on the field for a minute before getting the assist. In Maddison's last 11 appearances in all competitions, he has now been directly involved in 13 goals - eight goals and five assists. Spurs had not been beaten in the Premier League since they lost 1-0 at West Ham on 24 October when Nuno Espirito Santo was in charge. But Conte maintained his unbeaten league run in the most dramatic of fashions, with not one, but two goals deep into added time. The victory also set a new Premier League feat as Spurs were behind at 94 minutes, 52 seconds - the latest time a team has been behind before winning a Premier League match. The previous mark had been back in May 2012 when Manchester City were trailing 2-1 at home to QPR after 91 minutes, 14 seconds before goals from Edin Dzeko and, famously, Sergio Aguero clinched City's first Premier League title.

156,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60012766,Arsenal 0-0 Burnley: Gunners held in Premier League stalemate,"Arsenal missed out on a chance to return to the Premier League's top four after they were held at the Emirates Stadium by bottom club Burnley. Forward Alexandre Lacazette went closest for the Gunners, poking an Emile Smith Rowe cutback narrowly wide midway through the second half. Smith Rowe also forced a fine diving stop from Burnley keeper Nick Pope in the second period while Martin Odegaard was denied by the stopper's feet with a powerful effort in the first half. A draw for Burnley ended a run of three straight defeats with the Clarets now four points off safety having played four games fewer than 17th-placed Norwich City. Meanwhile Arsenal, now winless in their past five matches in all competitions, go sixth, two points off Manchester United in fourth. Arsenal will be pleased to see the back of January, so far in 2022 the Gunners have been dumped out of the EFL and FA Cups and have lost three of their past four matches. Arsenal dominated possession but were frequently frustrated in the first half by their opponent's low-block. After the break, the hosts upped the tempo, but Bukayo Saka, Smith Rowe, Odegaard and Lacazette all failed to hit the net despite finding themselves in promising positions. This season appears to be Champions League qualification or nothing for Mikel Arteta's team, making their dropped points against their injury-hit opponents all the more infuriating for supporters. A small section of home fans booed their team off at full-time, the five-game winning streak at the end of 2021 an increasingly distant memory. Burnley's game plan was obvious from the first whistle, they defended as a unit, sitting behind the ball and stifling their opponents' attacks. This was the Clarets' first match since losing to Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup on 8 January with Sean Dyche's side seeing league matches against Leicester City and Watford postponed in recent weeks. Since they last played, forward Chris Wood has moved to relegation rivals Newcastle. Jay Rodriguez and Matej Vydra started up front together in the target-man's absence, but the pair rarely received the ball in attacking positions. With Maxwel Cornet representing Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, defender Ben Mee was Burnley's leading Premier League goalscorer among the starting XI with two goals scored this season. And it was Mee who had the visitors' best opportunity, volleying a half-chance off-target from a corner in the first half. Dyche will have been delighted with the defensive performance of his side - their next fixture, at home to fellow relegation-candidates Watford, will be one in which a more attacking mindset will surely be employed.

157,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60012769,Crystal Palace 1-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp says side is too far behind for title talk,"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says it is too early to think about his side catching Premier League leaders Manchester City despite cutting the gap by mixing early class with late resilience to hold off Crystal Palace. A day after City dropped points for the first time since October, Klopp's side were sharp and ruthless early on to take the game away from Palace at Selhurst Park. However Liverpool laboured in the second half and Klopp said his side showed how ""insanely good we can be and how bad as well"", as a controversial late penalty was needed to make the win safe. The German's side are nine points behind City but have a game in hand on Pep Guardiola's team and face them in the league at Etihad Stadium in April. Klopp said it was a ""massive"" three points but when asked if his side sent a title statement to City, he told BBC Sport: ""No. The distance is too far to talk about it but we don't have to. We just need to win football matches. We will see what happens in the final few months."" The intensity of Liverpool's press and crisp use of the ball overwhelmed Palace early on and Virgil van Dijk rose to deliver a bullet header for their opener before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain finished a sweeping team move for their second. Palace, though, eventually offered moments of threat, with Liverpool keeper Alisson forced to save well from Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta before Conor Gallagher glanced a header wide at the start of the second half. They finally broke through when the ever-willing Mateta raced onto Jeffrey Schlupp's superb through ball and unselfishly squared for Odsonne Edouard to tap into an empty net. ""For 35 minutes we were outstanding,"" Klopp added. ""We looked really sharp and ready to play in small spaces then two or three sloppy passes and the stadium is back, Palace is back and we did not start well in the second half. ""We had our moments but we did not control it any more. If you lose a little bit of focus it showed how tired we could be as Palace played a really good game. We opened the door for them and they ran through."" Fabinho's 89th-minute penalty settled any Liverpool nerves and arrived after referee Kevin Friend was told by the VAR to check the pitch side monitor in order to reconsider his initial decision not to award a foul when Diogo Jota was brought down Vicente Guaita. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said the decision was not a penalty ""in a million years"" but it helped secure victory for Klopp's side, who have taken maximum league points from the fixtures missed by Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane while they play in the Africa Cup of Nations. Much was made of how Klopp's side would handle the loss of Mane, Salah and Naby Keita, who will be available again for the visit of Leicester on 10 February. In their absence the Reds have marginally improved their hopes of challenging for the title. Fans of a red persuasion will hope this tight victory coupled with the end of City's 12-game winning run leads to a momentum shift for the sides. While Klopp may downplay hopes of landing the title, the way his players set about their early business pointed to a belief that a fight back remains a possibility. They swarmed Palace to win the ball back seven times in the final third in the opening 30 minutes and had played over double the number of passes compared to their hosts in the same period. Midfielder Curtis Jones again showed poise throughout as he used the ball smartly in the final third - where he was more accurate than any Reds' player - and Andrew Robertson provided sublime crosses for both Van Dijk and Oxlade-Chamberlain to find the net. But for all their early brilliance Liverpool found themselves on the end of a marked momentum shift towards half time. Their 11 first-half shots fell to as few as four after the break as Palace began to find a footing and Alisson's saves kept the home side out until Edouard struck to reward them for their industry. Olise, signed from Reading in the summer, looks poised to prove a key force for Patrick Vieira. The 20-year-old created two chances and looked lively in advanced areas throughout, notably when he almost levelled with a deft lob late on. Vieira and Palace were aggrieved at key moments in the defeat. There was a suggestion Roberto Firmino was offside in the build-up to Oxlade-Chamberlain's goal and the penalty award for Jota was controversial. Vieira's side have just one win from their last six outings and enter the winter break on 24 points from 22 games - five fewer than they had under Roy Hodgson after as many fixtures last season. They will hope to add results to promising performances like this one, while Liverpool know they must keep churning out wins like this if they are to stand any chance of reeling in league leaders City.

158,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60012768,Leicester 1-1 Brighton: Danny Welbeck header earns Seagulls a draw,"Substitute Danny Welbeck scored a late equaliser to earn Brighton a battling point against Leicester at the King Power Stadium. Welbeck beat Kasper Schmeichel with a powerful header from Neal Maupay's cross with eight minutes remaining. Dan Burn came close to snatching a winner but his towering header was cleared off the line by Youri Tielemans, before Schmeichel made a stunning save to deny Leandro Trossard. Patson Daka had earlier fired Leicester in front 30 seconds into the second half after goalkeeper Robert Sanchez had parried Harvey Barnes' shot into his path. The draw keeps Brighton in ninth place, four points clear of Leicester in 10th. Brendan Rodgers struck an upbeat tone in the build-up to this game and said his Leicester players would ""get up and fight again"" despite the crushing nature of their midweek defeat to Tottenham, which saw them concede two goals in stoppage-time. However, despite a bright start the Foxes were nervously hanging on in the closing stages, with that Spurs defeat likely fresh in their minds. In the end they had Schmeichel to thank for preserving a point. The Denmark international made two stunning stops to deny Welbeck and Trossard either side of the equaliser. The home side had started the brighter and had the best chance of the first half when Barnes seized onto a loose pass and played in Ademola Lookman, who could only side-foot straight at Sanchez. They caught Brighton cold within seconds of the restart when James Maddison's shot deflected straight to Barnes, whose stabbed effort was then parried into the path of Daka who scored his ninth goal of an impressive first season at the King Power Stadium. But instead of building on that goal Leicester appeared to retreat in their shell and instead it was Brighton who finished the game well on top. Brighton were second-best for large parts of this game but their resilience paid off, with Welbeck's goal the eighth time they have scored in the final 10 minutes of a Premier League game this season. It is the 12th time the Seagulls have drawn in the Premier League this season and extends their unbeaten run to six games, with a top-10 finish and challenge for the European places now looking likely. They suffered a blow before kick-off when it was confirmed assistant boss Billy Reid had joined manager Graham Potter in testing positive for Covid-19, with first-team coach Bjorn Hamberg in the dugout. They recalled first-choice forward pair Maupay and Trossard after they only featured off the bench against Chelsea in midweek, but struggled to create many clear-cut opportunities. But as the nerves started to creep into Leicester's play the arrival of Welbeck and Tariq Lamptey just after the hour changed the game. Lamptey was a constant threat down the right, though it was Maupay who provided the cross from that flank for Welbeck to bury a fine header beyond Schmeichel. It could have been even better for Brighton when Trossard broke clear inside the area, but Schmeichel did superbly to parry his drilled effort.

159,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60012767,Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham: Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva score for Blues,"Two second-half goals, including a brilliant strike from Hakim Ziyech, helped Chelsea beat Tottenham for the third time in three weeks. After a goalless first half, Ziyech scored within two minutes of the restart, superbly curling the ball into the top corner from 20 yards after a fine run from Callum Hudson-Odoi. The hosts doubled their lead eight minutes later when defender Thiago Silva headed in from Mason Mount's excellent free-kick delivery. In the first half, Tottenham thought they had taken the lead as Harry Kane slotted past Kepa Arrizabalaga, but the goal was ruled out as the England striker was adjudged to have pushed Silva to the ground. This victory follows Chelsea's wins in both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Spurs, cruising through 3-0 on aggregate to set up a Wembley final against Liverpool. It is Tottenham's first defeat in the league since Antonio Conte, a Premier League and FA Cup winner while in charge of Chelsea, replaced the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo in November. For Chelsea this was a welcome return to winning ways in the league. They were top of the Premier League after a 2-1 win at Watford on 1 December but a run of only 11 points from their next nine games has severely damaged their hopes of becoming English champions for the first time since Conte guided them to the title in 2016-17. They remain third and are 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, although Thomas Tuchel's side will not play in the league again until 19 February as a result of their participation in the Fifa Club World Cup, following their Champions League success. Conte opted for a back four, the first time he has done so in a league game at Tottenham, as he looked to keep it tight and hit his former team on the counter attack. But the hosts nearly broke through inside the opening minute when Romelu Lukaku shot over on the turn, before Chelsea failed to convert further chances through Hudson-Odoi, Silva and Ziyech. Lukaku, who has only scored eight times in 24 appearances in all competitions following a £97.5m move from Inter Milan last summer, had another glorious chance following good work by Mount, but missed the ball when eight yards out. While Conte was unhappy with the officials for ruling out Spurs' first-half goal, Tuchel was also furious that Japhet Tanganga, who had already been booked, was not shown a second yellow card when he had a hold of Hudson-Odoi's shirt late in the first half. It was the second time Chelsea thought their opponents should have had a player sent off after Matt Doherty had earlier caught Malang Sarr by standing on his ankle - but a video assistant referee check decided it had been accidental. However seventh-placed Tottenham, who would have moved into the top four with a win, saw their resistance broken early in the second half thanks to Ziyech's wonder strike, before Silva's goal took the game beyond them. Chelsea could have won by a bigger margin as Lukaku, Mount and Cesar Azpilicueta missed chances. Tottenham scored two injury-time goals in their last match to come from behind and beat Leicester 3-2 in a remarkable match on Wednesday but there was to be no dramatic repeat at Stamford Bridge. Arrizabalaga did well to keep out Kane's powerful header late on as Chelsea maintained their clean sheet for their first Premier League win in three matches.

The 22-year-old has signed a deal until 2025 and the fee could rise to 70m euros (£62.8m) with incentives. Tottenham's previous transfer record was the £42m paid to sign defender Davinson Sanchez from Ajax in August 2017. Ndombele joined Lyon in 2017 and helped them finish third in the French top-flight last season. He also twice played against Manchester City in Champions League group games. In total Ndombele, who has six caps for France, made 96 appearances for Lyon and registered 16 assists. Lyon thanked the player for his time at the club, praising his ""professionalism and his performances"". Ndombele is Tottenham's second signing of the summer following the arrival of Jack Clarke from Leeds United. The winger, who was Spurs' first signing since Brazil forward Lucas Moura joined from Paris St-Germain in January 2018, was immediately loaned back to the Championship side for the 2019-20 season.

Twenty-year-old Gil, who has agreed a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee, made his Spain debut in March and is part of the squad at the Olympics. He made 14 La Liga appearances for Sevilla, all as a substitute. Argentina international Lamela, 29, joined Spurs from Roma for £25.7m in 2013. Lamela was one of seven players - along with Christian Eriksen, Roberto Soldado, Paulinho, Etienne Capoue, Vlad Chiriches and Nacer Chadli - Tottenham signed in the summer when Gareth Bale left for Real Madrid in a world record £85m deal. Lamela becomes the last of the seven to leave Spurs. He scored 37 goals in 255 games and was an unused substitute in the 2019 Champions League final defeat by Liverpool. Gil came through Sevilla's youth academy before making his senior debut in January 2019. His final appearance came in September 2020 before he joined Eibar on a season-long loan.

162,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60180217,Frank Lampard: Everton appoint ex-Chelsea manager to replace Rafael Benitez,"Former England midfielder Frank Lampard has been appointed Everton manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 43-year-old replaces Rafael Benitez, who was sacked earlier this month after one win in 13 games. It is Lampard's first job since he was sacked by Chelsea a year ago with Thomas Tuchel taking his role. ""It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club with the size and tradition of Everton,"" said Lampard. ""I'm very hungry to get started."" Lampard's first match in charge will be Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Brentford at Goodison Park. His first signing at Everton is expected to be Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek, who is set to join the Toffees on loan for the rest of the season. Former Chelsea and Manchester City player Lampard, who won 106 caps for England, is tasked with keeping Everton in the top-flight as the club are 16th and just four points above the relegation zone. Lampard said he felt the ""passion and ambition"" of owner Farhad Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright and the Everton board in talks over the role. ""I hope they felt my ambition and how hard I want to work to bring it together,"" he added. ""You can feel the passion Everton fans have for their club - that will be hugely important. ""As a team - the competitive level that the Premier League brings and the position we are in the table - we certainly need that. It's a two-way thing. ""Everton is a unique club in that you can really understand what the fans want to see. The first thing they want is fight and desire and that must always be our baseline. ""My first message to the players will be that we have to do this together. We'll try to do our job and I know the fans will be there backing us."" Lampard was one of three candidates interviewed for the managerial position with Vitor Pereira and interim boss Duncan Ferguson also up for the role. Derby manager and former Everton and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney confirmed he was also asked about the job but he turned it down. Ferguson, who was assistant manager under Benitez, and goalkeeper coach Alan Kelly will stay on as part of Lampard's backroom staff. Joe Edwards has joined as assistant manager, with Paul Clement as first team coach and Chris Jones as first team coach and head of performance. Lampard was fired by Chelsea after 18 months in charge. In his first year in the position he led the club to a fourth place league finish and the FA Cup final. But a tough spell in his second season, featuring five league defeats in eight games, saw him dismissed by the Blues. Before taking over at Chelsea he was at Derby for a season. He led them to the Championship play-off final but they lost to Aston Villa. Moshiri said Lampard will give Everton an ""immediate boost"" but admitted the fans - and himself - ""should be more patient"". ""The biggest thing for us, for me, for Bill [Kenwright], for all parts of this great and beautiful club, is to get behind this manager,"" said Moshiri. ""Let's unite behind the team, give the team the 12th man and start moving up the table. ""Our future us bright. We just need to be united. Maybe together, me and the fans should be more patient - I am also impatient."" Moshiri also defended the club's recruitment process after criticism that it lacked direction, highlighting the roles of Everton heroes Graeme Sharp and Tim Cahill, while also offering his support to Kenwright following calls from fans during the defeat by Aston Villa for the chairman to leave. ""We ensured a lot of expertise went into it,"" he said. ""We had Graeme Sharp, with his vast football experience, and our board. Tim Cahill was advising me personally and attending all the interviews. He did very diligent, serious work."" On Kenwright, Moshiri added: ""Our chairman is very important. We are keeping the chairman as long as we can. ""He manfully fulfils his functions and I really appreciate what the chairman does."" ",positive,liverpool,0
163,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60166151,Everton transfer news: Donny van de Beek joins on loan from Man Utd,"Everton have signed Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek on loan until the end of the season. Van de Beek was allowed to leave Old Trafford by interim boss Ralf Rangnick after struggling for game time. Crystal Palace were also interested in the Dutchman, and there were enquiries from clubs abroad. However, the 24-year-old has elected to link up with Frank Lampard, who was confirmed as Everton's new manager earlier on Monday. Van de Beek has started only four Premier League matches since joining United from Ajax for £35m in 2020, and none this season. Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal has told him he needs regular game time if he is to be considered for the national squad for the World Cup, which begins in November. Van de Beek will bolster the midfield of Everton's injury-stricken squad, with Tom Davies, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Fabian Delph all sidelined until March. Everton, who also signed Dele Alli from Tottenham, are 16th, just four points above the relegation zone. ",positive,liverpool,0
164,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357467,West Ham United 1-1 Newcastle United: Joe Willock earns visitors valuable point,"Newcastle continued their impressive resurgence under Eddie Howe with a valuable draw at West Ham that edged them five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone. Howe's side are unbeaten in the league since Christmas, despite this result bringing their recent three-game winning run to an end. Craig Dawson headed the opener for West Ham from Aaron Cresswell's enticing free-kick after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had earlier tipped a Jarrod Bowen effort onto the crossbar. But the visitors capitalised on a defensive lapse on the brink of half-time when Joe Willock guided a deft finish onto the far post and watched it creep narrowly over the line. Newcastle remain 17th but are now five points clear of Norwich, while West Ham missed the chance to return to a Champions League place and stay fifth. Howe only picked up one win in his first eight games as Newcastle boss, but has collected three from five league games since the turn of the year to move the club clear of the drop zone. This draw came despite the loss of Kieran Trippier, who has had an immediate impact at St James' Park since his arrival, and electric winger Allan Saint-Maximin - arguably Howe's two most important players. But the Magpies boss found Willock and Joelinton in impressive form, with the latter almost sneaking in at the back post early on during a spell of nervy West Ham defending. Despite their bright start, Newcastle looked set to enter the break a goal down, only for the usually assured Declan Rice to miscue a header into Willock's path. The 22-year-old midfielder was alert and scored his first goal of the season from a tight angle as Hammers goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski failed to scramble his shot off the line. The former Arsenal midfielder also zipped an effort wide from distance in the pouring rain in a second half that saw both sides struggle to assert themselves, and Newcastle will no doubt be the more satisfied with a point. David Moyes opted to bring Kurt Zouma back in after the defender dropped out during the warm-up at Leicester last week with illness, and with his inclusion still a talking point following the furore over the video of him kicking a cat. His early touches were booed by the visiting fans, but that was countered by a song in support from the home faithful at London Stadium, and the centre-back did not seem fazed during a physical battle with Newcastle forward Chris Wood. Another worry for Moyes is the Hammers' stuttering form, and he must have hoped their late equaliser at Leicester would give his side renewed belief and momentum. It was the man who rescued them a point in stoppage time at the King Power Stadium who put them ahead here after 32 minutes. Newcastle started confidently, but when Emil Krafth fouled Michail Antonio in a dangerous position, Moyes' eyes must have lit up. His side are renowned for their threat from set-pieces, with only Liverpool and Manchester City scoring more than their 11 goals from such situations this season. Cresswell duly delivered a superb free-kick and the diving Dawson got ahead of the Newcastle defensive line to head into the corner beyond Dubravka. Willock's leveller sparked a reaction from the home side after the interval, but they were unable to create any meaningful chances and are one point behind fourth-placed Manchester United, having played a game more and with several sides below them having a number of games in hand.

165,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357472,Arsenal 2-1 Brentford: Smith Rowe and Saka on target as Gunners close in on top four,"Second-half strikes from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka lifted Arsenal to victory over Brentford as the Gunners moved to within a point of the top four. England international Smith Rowe ran at the Brentford defence and curled a measured right-footed shot past David Raya to send his side on their way to a second successive win. His goal came following a first half in which Arsenal had two penalty appeals turned down. Bukayo Saka capped a satisfying afternoon for Mikel Arteta's side when he slotted home, although Brentford felt they should have had a free-kick for a foul on Pontus Jansson in the build-up. Brentford were superb when they beat Arsenal on the opening night of the season and, while Christian Norgaard struck an injury-time consolation, the Bees' winless run extended to seven games. Victory moves Arsenal level on points with fifth-placed West Ham, who drew at Newcastle earlier on Saturday, and within a point of Manchester United in fourth with two games in hand on the Red Devils. Having not played since beating Wolves on 10 February, Arsenal started brightly as Alexandre Lacazette had a goal disallowed for offside with Martin Odegaard and Saka both firing wide. The main talking point from the first half, however, centred on Jon Moss after the referee waved away the home side's appeals following Kristoffer Ajer's challenge on the French striker in the box. The Gunners had another shout for a spot-kick when Cedric Soares' shot struck Yoane Wissa's arm, but again it was turned down following a VAR check. But increasing frustration turned to elation three minutes after the restart when Smith Rowe collected Lacazette's pass and drove at the visiting defence before finishing confidently. After scoring twice last term, it was a ninth goal of the season - and first of 2022 - for Smith Rowe, who was recalled to Arteta's line-up to replace the suspended Gabriel Martinelli. Only Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and Raheem Sterling have scored more league goals than Smith Rowe. Needing to chase the game, Brentford improved slightly, but with top scorer Ivan Toney still injured they were unable to sufficiently trouble the home side's defence. And Arsenal punished them again when Thomas Partey found Saka, whose shot flew past Raya and went in off the post. With seconds remaining, the visitors found the target when Norgaard's strike stood after a VAR review for offside. But there was not enough time for Thomas Frank's side to push for the leveller. Brentford are now without a win since 2 January and sit 14th - six points clear of relegation and having played more games than each of the six teams below them.

""There's such a long way to go."" Incredibly, Watford's past six league away wins have come under six different managers. The managerial merry-go-round has been well reported, and Hodgson already seemed under pressure coming into this fixture after collecting just one point from an available nine since taking charge in January. As the game went on, Watford were on course to drop to the bottom of the table and looked set to equal a club record of five consecutive games without a goal. ""We're going to need strong performances,"" said Hodgson. ""[We need] people who are prepared to chase back a bit more than they're used to doing. [We need people] to put their foot into challenges a bit more than they're used to doing."" Watford soaked up plenty of Villa pressure and twice went close through Dennis and Moussa Sissoko on the break. Sarr, starting his first match since winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, created the winner, chipping the ball up for Dennis to nod in. Watford held on for their first victory in 12 matches, since beating Manchester United 4-1 in November. ""That's what we've got to do if we are to get any more points,"" said Hodgson. ""We're quite divorced from the teams above us."" Having started his reign at Villa with four wins from six matches, manager Steven Gerrard has now seen them lose four of their past eight. They are closer to the relegation zone than they are to European place. ""The results are the same. That's the reality so the feelings are the same,"" Gerrard told Match of the Day. ""I am very much aware of our recent form. We've taken one point from the last three from teams behind us."" Villa should have gone in front in the 34th minute when Danny Ings struck the base of the right post when clean through after a good move from Emi Buendia. They continued to create half-chances, with Phillipe Coutinho curling a looping effort on to the roof of the net midway through the second half. But once they fell behind the opportunities dried up. Despite coming into this fixture as one of three teams to have scored in every home game this season, Villa failed to find a leveller and stay 12th in the table. ""We just need to keep believing in ourselves and stick together,"" said Gerrard. ""We need to have more quality in the final third - that was clear today. We've only had one shot on target. That's not good enough at home."" Villa face Brighton next Saturday, while Watford will host Crystal Palace on Wednesday.

167,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357460,Brighton 0-3 Burnley: Weghorst inspires Clarets to first win since October,"Burnley boss Sean Dyche says Wout Weghorst has been a ""breath of fresh air"" after the Dutch striker scored his first goal for the club in their win at Brighton. Weghorst opened the scoring before Josh Brownhill added a second and Aaron Lennon made sure of the victory just over 20 minutes from time. Dyche praised the Netherlands international's attitude and said he wasn't concerned by the wait for him to get off the mark after arriving from Wolfsburg in January. ""Wout has come in and done fantastic for us, but others were looking a threat,"" Dyche told BBC Sport. ""I've seen him in training, I'd be amazed if he doesn't score more goals. He has been a breath of fresh air. Defensively, he works for the team. He is a top pro. ""We created chances. That's been the difference all season. There hasn't been much wrong with our defensive shape or the way we've worked as a side. The energy of the performances have been good and we looked a real threat today."" Brighton dominated possession but managed only one shot on target and struggled at the back, where they were missing the suspended Lewis Dunk and injured Adam Webster. A fast start almost saw Burnley take the lead when Connor Roberts spotted Robert Sanchez off his line and curled an effort that came back off the bar. Their purpose and energy were rewarded soon afterwards, when Weghorst fired home from Roberts' low right-hand cross, giving Sanchez no chance. It took until 10 minutes before half-time for Brighton to manage an effort on goal, and Shane Duffy's strike was held easily by Nick Pope. Adam Lallana headed wide from Tariq Lamptey's cross moments later. Weghorst turned provider with the break looming, laying on for Brownhill, whose tame effort was deflected in off Joel Veltman. The frustration continued for the hosts after the break, with Neal Maupay shooting wide from another Lamptey cross. Soon after, Lennon made it 3-0 after combining with Jay Rodriguez, who came on for the injured Maxwel Cornet, before firing into the top corner to round off a brilliant day for the Clarets. Dyche's men are five points behind 17th-placed Newcastle but have two games in hand. Brighton are ninth. Weghorst has made a really positive start to life at Burnley, and he was the difference on the south coast. Against a weakened Brighton backline without their first choice centre-backs, he made a nuisance of himself all afternoon. But everything started with a fine finish for his goal. His lay-off for Brownhill showed his technical ability as well as his physical presence, and there is now a real chance that a difficult season at Turf Moor may be about to turn. Injury to his strike partner Cornet was a blow, but he has offered real hope. Weghorst admitted it was a ""dream"" to finally open his account in English football. ""It is something you dream about as a kid, to score in the Premier League,"" he told BBC Sport. ""You want to be important and to help the team. It is a special moment."" Dunk and Webster were badly missed, but Brighton fell into old habits at the other end. They had 69% of the ball but failed to make it count, with Maupay cutting a frustrated figure up front. Keeping Lamptey relatively quiet on his return to Brighton's starting XI was huge for Burnley, but there was a general lack of intensity in Graham Potter's side's play from the start. They let Burnley take the early initiative and ultimately paid for it.

168,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357466,Crystal Palace 0-1 Chelsea: Hakim Ziyech nets last-gasp winner,"Hakim Ziyech scored a last-minute winner as Chelsea edged past Crystal Palace on their return to Premier League action. Thomas Tuchel's side last played in the top flight almost a month ago when they defeated Tottenham, and have had a week's rest since winning the Club World Cup last Saturday. It looked like they would be frustrated by their hosts but Ziyech popped up at the back post to stroke in a delightful volley from Marcos Alonso's cross. Moroccan Ziyech had converted earlier in the second half when he swept home following Jack Butland's save, but Romelu Lukaku was adjudged to be offside by VAR. Vicente Guaita had made good saves in the first half from N'Golo Kante's effort and Antonio Rudiger's long range thunderbolt, before the Palace goalkeeper was taken off at half-time because of a knee injury. The home side, meanwhile, did not have a single shot on target in the entire contest - both Michael Oliseh and Wilfried Zaha failing to work Edouard Mendy from promising positions. Winners keep going until the very end, a quality illustrated perfectly by reigning world and European champions Chelsea at Selhurst Park as they scored the decisive goal in the 89th minute. Up until that point, they had been finding it difficult to make inroads against a resolute Palace backline, with striker Lukaku particularly suffering. Without injured wing-backs Reece James and Ben Chilwell, Tuchel switched from a 5-3-2 to a 4-3-3 formation, but the Belgium international lacked any service and had just seven touches of the ball in the whole game. Lukaku netted in both games at the Club World Cup but has now netted just once in the past eight games in domestic action and question marks remain about whether he fits into the Chelsea system. He was involved in the disallowed goal on 75 minutes when a thumping shot was batted out for Ziyech to pounce on, but Lukaku failed to time his run and was caught offside. His team-mates Kante and Rudiger did force Guaita into action in the first half and substitute Butland thought he was on the way to a clean sheet before Ziyech struck for his third consecutive Premier League game. In the end, a stubborn display ended up being a disappointing day for Palace boss Patrick Vieira and there will be some concern after his side extended their winless run to six games in the league. In-form Oliseh should have done better when he screwed wide in the first half and Zaha may be left feeling he could have netted too, but the Ivorian side-footed wide and flashed a shot across goal when searching for the equaliser in injury time.

169,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357459,Liverpool 3-1 Norwich: Luis Diaz on target as Reds stage comeback win in Premier League,"Liverpool staged a second-half comeback against a resilient Norwich side to keep their Premier League title hopes alive with an eighth successive win in all competitions. The Reds had threatened the Norwich goal countless times but they were stunned into emergency action moments after the interval when Milot Rashica's deflected strike gave the Canaries hope of a first win at Anfield in 28 years. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who made seven changes to the side that won at Inter Milan in the Champions League in midweek, intervened to make attacking changes on 62 minutes and within four minutes his side had turned the game around. Sadio Mane acrobatically turned home Konstantinos Tsimikas' header and Mohamed Salah raced on to a clearance from goalkeeper Alisson Becker to round Angus Gunn and score. Salah's 17th league goal of the campaign was his 150th in all competitions for Liverpool - making him one of only 10 men to reach that figure for the club - and Luis Diaz added his first since joining from Porto with a neat, chipped finish to seal the win. Klopp's side move to within six points of league leaders Manchester City, who later lost 3-1 to Tottenham, while Norwich drop to bottom place and are five points from safety. While the stats will show a Liverpool win built from 29 shots and 70% of possession, Norwich can feel slightly hard done by after showing great character for over an hour. Their 4-3-3 system slickly dropped into a 4-5-1 out of possession and Dean Smith's side looked to play out from the back, despite the threat of a Liverpool press that managed to win the ball back six times in the final third in the first 45 minutes. An entertaining opening saw Teemu Pukki miss when one-on-one with Alisson, while Virgil van Dijk went close for the home side, Tsimikas missed from four yards, Salah saw a header cleared off the line and Diaz fizzed an effort narrowly over. Klopp's side had racked up 15 shots by the interval but their inaccuracy and saves from Gunn - whose father Bryan kept a clean sheet in Norwich's last win at Anfield - gave them a platform from which they could threaten a shock. Rashica's deflected effort from 25 yards left Alisson helpless and briefly gave Norwich hope of back-to-back away wins in the Premier League for the first time in 10 years. But Klopp moved to bring on midfielder Thiago and striker Divock Origi in place of two midfielders in Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. ""It's a coaching team effort in that we bring the boys on but change the system as well,"" Klopp said. ""It's absolutely necessary in a moment like this you throw all the knowledge you have together. ""The 4-4-2 gave them a proper challenge to deal with. All of a sudden we had better positions and were a proper threat. Our reaction was just brilliant."" The extra attacking body seemed to briefly throw Norwich out of their stride and a fine switch of play from the impressive Jordan Henderson allowed Tsimikas to tee up the unmarked Mane, who swept home. Henderson completed 97% of his 123 passes - including a sublime through ball for Diaz's late strike - but again Salah made a crucial contribution, pulling down Alisson's kick, beating Gunn and finishing past two Norwich players on the goalline. The Egyptian had eight shots and created six chances - both game highs. Only Roger Hunt - in 226 matches - has reached 150 Liverpool goals in fewer games than the 233 Salah has needed. Diaz's late finish will only add to the feel-good factor as the Reds continue to chase four trophies, while their ability to hold their nerve with so little margin for error in their pursuit of leaders City underlines the qualities Klopp's side possess.

170,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357461,Southampton 2-0 Everton: Saints maintain impressive form,"Southampton maintained their impressive form with a comfortable Premier League victory against a lacklustre Everton at St Mary's. Scotland winger Stuart Armstrong opened the scoring just after the break, curling in from 15 yards after Oriol Romeu and Che Adams combined. Shane Long's late header - also his first top-flight goal of the campaign - ensured a merited win for Ralph Hassenhuttl's side, who are now unbeaten in five matches in all competitions. Until Long struck, Everton retained a slender interest in taking a point largely because of Southampton's inability to make the most of several excellent chances. Everton began both halves brightly but quickly faded and the second-half introduction of Dele Alli was unable to provide the necessary spark. ""I did not like the reaction,"" said Everton manager Frank Lampard. ""I am here for a reason because we are down in a position we don't want to be in. In the two games at Goodison I have seen some really good thing - in the two games away, not so much. ""The players need to understand that second half is not good enough. It is not good enough to lose second balls consistently; it is not good enough to try and miss out [midfield] and play to the strikers. ""It has to be an option but it can't be the way we play. We will have days like this. It is important to learn the lessons."" Everton's failings were underlined by their inability to register a shot on target as their dismal away record continued - they have won only once in 12 games on their travels this season. Southampton remain 10th in the table while Everton sit 16th, four points above the bottom three. Southampton appear to be hitting form at the right time to push for a European place or, at worst, a first top-half finish since 2017. This result, part of an impressive sequence including victory at Tottenham and draws against both Manchester clubs that could have amounted to more, underlined their upward trajectory. Aside from the opening periods of both halves Southampton were completely dominant. Jan Bednarek and Tino Livramento drew excellent saves from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during a concerted spell of pressure in the first half, while Kyle Walker-Peters clipped the outside of a post. That largely continued after the break as Armstrong and Long gave Southampton the reward they richly deserved. Everton's high-tempo start to each half was in keeping with their victories over Brentford in the FA Cup and against Leeds last weekend. On another occasion they may have been awarded at least one penalty from two early appeals, and Richarlison was unable to turn in after losing control of the ball in front of goal. With Dominic Calvert-Lewin causing Southampton problems at the back, Everton at that stage appeared capable of securing their first back-to-back league wins since September. However, once the hosts assumed control, Donny van de Beek, Allan and replacement Andre Gomes were easily bypassed and unable to stem the flow of attacks. Van de Beek's decision to pass backwards to Seamus Coleman contributed to Southampton's opener, with Gomes played into trouble and the ball finding the back of the Everton net moments later. Andros Townsend and Alli were brought on by manager Frank Lampard to add impetus, but there was little additional thrust. Everton's haul of 22 points from their first 23 games represents their worst tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1950-51, when they also had 22 and were relegated.

171,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357463,Man City 2-3 Tottenham: Harry Kane gives Spurs stunning late win over Premier League leaders,"Harry Kane's stoppage-time goal gave Tottenham a stunning victory over Premier League leaders Manchester City in a chaotic finale at Etihad Stadium. City thought they had rescued a point moments earlier when Riyad Mahrez converted a penalty awarded after a VAR review, but there was another twist to come and Kane, predictably, provided it. The Spurs striker, whom City had tried to sign in the summer, rose highest to nod home Dejan Kulusevski's cross in the 95th minute and spark wild celebrations from the travelling fans. It was a dramatic end to a pulsating match that had already seen Spurs pegged back twice, with City running out of time to find a third equaliser. Tottenham's first goal came after only four minutes, with Son Heun-min beating the offside trap and squaring the ball for Kulusevski to score on his first start for the club. City levelled when Hugo Lloris spilled Raheem Sterling's cross and Ilkay Gundogan pounced to turn in the loose ball, but they could not turn their possession into more goals. Spurs continued to threaten on the break in the second half and were back in front on the hour mark when Kane finished a move he had started, running onto Son's cross to fire past Ederson from close range. Kane was denied again by Ederson and then had another strike ruled out for offside but it appeared City would have the last word when they were awarded a spot-kick at the end of the 90 minutes. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot for a handball by Cristian Romero after a VAR review and it seemed Mahrez had salvaged a point. Kane had other ideas, and his winner means City's lead at the top over Liverpool, who have a game in hand, is down to six points. Kane has been below his best for much of the season but his performance here was a reminder of why City boss Pep Guardiola was so keen to sign him at the start of the season. The England captain did not just score twice, he was the key man in his side's gameplan, constantly dropping deep to collect the ball and finding willing runners ahead of him. It was a display that also demonstrated why Spurs chairman Daniel Levy fought so hard to keep his side's talisman. Kane was absent and seemed set on a move to the Etihad when Tottenham beat City on the opening day of the season. This time, it was the same result but he was the main man. His side's fans serenaded their captain at the final whistle, singing ""Harry Kane, he's one of our own"" as he and his team-mates celebrated a famous victory in front of the travelling supporters. Tottenham had lost their previous three league games and slid down the table, but this win reignites their bid for a top-four finish, and in style. This was City's first league defeat since October, when they lost at home to Crystal Palace, yet they did not play badly against Spurs - instead this goes down as a masterclass from Spurs boss Antonio Conte. Guardiola gambled by continuing to play with a high line against a manager known for orchestrating quick breakaways and, this time, he lost. For long spells all of City's players were camped in Tottenham's half, probing for a weakness. All it took for Tottenham was to win the ball back and, usually via Kane, they would trigger a lightning counter-attack. It was a tactic that led to Spurs' first two goals but the biggest sucker-punch was saved for last, with Conte's side finding the winner when most people in the Etihad were expecting a charge from the home side.

But as poor as Bayern were they will feel they can turn things round against the Spanish side in the return leg on Tuesday, 12 April. They will need to play significantly better than they did in this game as they suffered their first Champions League defeat away from home since 2017. Indeed, Bayern's players will likely come away relieved that they only have a one-goal deficit as Villarreal had a plethora of chances to win by a bigger margin. Coquelin was narrowly offside before seeing his cross fly over Manuel Neuer's head and as well as Moreno's shot against the post they really should have got a second in the final few minutes when substitute Alfonso Pedraza shot wide from close range. Kingsley Coman saw an effort saved by Geronimo Rulli at his near post in stoppage time but an equaliser would have been supremely harsh on brilliant Villarreal, who understandably celebrated wildly when the full-time whistle was blown.

173,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60881797,World Cup 2022: Mane helps Senegal beat Egypt and qualify for Qatar after penalty shootout,"Sadio Mane scored the winning penalty in a shootout to send Senegal to the 2022 World Cup after Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah missed his spot-kick for Egypt. In a repeat of the Africa Cup of Nations final, Senegal were left jubilant at the final whistle after winning on penalties, with Egypt's players disconsolate and Salah - one of the world's best players - left contemplating his absence from November's tournament in Qatar. The second leg of the play-off tie in Senegal's new 50,000-seater stadium finished 1-0 to the hosts and 1-1 on aggregate after extra time, sending the game to a tense and dramatic shootout. Mane had netted the penalty which won the Nations Cup and the Reds forward notched the decisive spot-kick once again after keeper Edouard Mendy had given Senegal an advantage by saving from Mostafa Mohamed at 2-1. Egypt captain Salah was one of four players to miss the first four penalties of a shootout marked by a vast number of green laser pointers directed at the visiting players and goalkeeper. Senegal's Boulaye Dia was the scorer of the only goal in normal time - notching after just four minutes with a shot that hit the body of Pharaohs defender Hamdi Fathi. Elsewhere in Africa's World Cup play-offs, Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco and Cameroon also clinched qualification - with Nigeria, Mali, DR Congo and Algeria all eliminated. It is the second time in six weeks that Senegal have beaten Egypt on penalties to a major prize. In February it was the Nations Cup final in Cameroon. There, two Egyptian misses meant their goalscoring icon Salah did not even get the chance to take one. This time around they made sure he went first - and with an eye on securing a crucial early advantage following Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly hitting the bar with the first effort of the shootout. But Salah could do no better. Indeed he did worse, his shot going nowhere near Mendy's goal as it sailed over the bar. Neither Ciss nor Zizo could score either and it seemed clear the raft of laser pointers being directed at players from both sides - which had increased in intensity as the match drew to a close - were having an effect. Ismaila Sarr did finally find the net, but that was matched by Amr El Soleya. Bamba Dieng then struck confidently to put the Teranga Lions ahead, but when Mostafa attempted to reply for Egypt, Mendy saved well and put Senegal in command. It was a situation Mane took full advantage of, blasting his effort down the middle and sparking scenes of celebration. That the game would be settled on penalties was not the obvious conclusion given the scoreline. Dia's deflected strike was a strange repeat of the one that had given Egypt victory in the first leg in Cairo - in the same minute. It came after Egypt failed to defend a dangerous free-kick. Dia pounced on a headed clearance to shoot, but Fathi challenged at the same time and the ball went under visiting keeper Mohammed El Shenawy. In Senegal's brand new home, which unlike most major African stadiums has no running track and created a more intense atmosphere, the roof nearly came off. Egypt offered little throughout, sticking to a gameplan of maintaining a tight defence and breaking down any Senegal attacks with heavily contested challenges, But the hosts had two great chances - both of which fell to Sarr - to seal the success, before penalties decided the outcome. The first was on 82 minutes when he was put clean through, but El Shenawy made himself big to make sure Sarr's effort drifted wide. Then, presented with most of the goal to aim at from a Mane cross in extra-time, the Watford man failed to connect properly and his effort spun into the body of El Shenawy. Zizo lifted Egypt with a couple of mazy runs, but they seemed to play for penalties and ultimately paid the price. Ghana were the first side to qualify after a 1-1 draw earlier on Tuesday saw the Black Stars overcome Nigeria on away goals in Abuja. Thomas Partey's opener for the visitors was cancelled out by William Troost-Ekong's penalty, and Super Eagles fans reacted angrily at full-time after their side were knocked out, showering the Ghana players and staff with missiles. Cameroon clinched an eighth World Cup qualification - a record for an African side - following a dramatic finale in Algeria. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's first-half goal sent the game to extra time. Algeria looked to have won it courtesy of Ahmed Touba's 118th-minute header, but Karl Toko-Ekambi struck in the fourth minute of added time to stun the home crowd in Blida and win the tie on away goals. Tunisia made it back-to-back World Cup appearances after a goalless draw in Tunis saw off Mali 1-0 on aggregate, while Morocco had a comparatively comfortable evening as a 4-1 home win over DR Congo secured a 5-2 triumph over the two legs. Two goals from Azzedine Ounahi and one each from Tarik Tissoudali and Achraf Hakimi saw the Atlas Lions book their sixth trip to the finals. The African quintet now await Friday's group-stage draw to discover who they will face in Qatar. ",positive,liverpool,1
174,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883947,Liverpool 2-0 Watford: Diogo Jota & Fabinho secure 10th straight Premier League win,"Liverpool beat struggling Watford to complete a remarkable, albeit short, return to the top of the Premier League. The Reds trailed Manchester City by 14 points on 15 January, but a 10th straight league win in the early kick-off at a raucous Anfield took them above Pep Guardiola's side, whom they meet on 10 April. However, City won 2-0 at struggling Burnley later on Saturday to restore their one-point lead with eight games left. Diogo Jota's 20th club goal of the season and his third in as many appearances in a Liverpool shirt - 34 seconds after Alisson made a huge save to deny Juraj Kucka - helped seal a tense win. Portugal forward Jota jumped between two Watford defenders to meet a cross and head past Ben Foster as Joe Gomez marked only his second league start of the season with an assist. Fabinho's late penalty - after Kucka's rugby-style challenge on Jota - secured the points. Despite sealing a potentially significant win, Liverpool were not at their fluent best. Joao Pedro wasted a glorious chance to equalise in the second half as Watford remain third from bottom, three points from safety. Liverpool returned to the top of the table - albeit for a couple of hours - for the first time since early October, and at the start of the final push towards what would be a historic quadruple. They face Benfica in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in Portugal on Tuesday before going to City in what many are billing as the game that could decide the title. Liverpool, already Carabao Cup winners, started the penultimate month of the campaign - in which they also face City at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals - with a hard-earned win in a game where the result was more important than the performance. Alisson had already denied Cucho Hernandez when he spread himself to block Kucka, before Jota pounced moments later. Unlike team-mate Mohamed Salah, Jota will be going to the World Cup later this year after helping Portugal beat North Macedonia in a play-off in midweek. While a tired looking Salah, who was pelted with missiles and targeted by green laser pointers as Egypt missed out on the World Cup to Senegal on Tuesday, was replaced after 69 minutes, Jota could have had a hat-trick. Denied a second goal by Foster before half-time, Jota headed another chance over the bar in front of the Kop. Tension was replaced by relief when Fabinho's 89th-minute penalty - awarded after referee Stuart Attwell watched a replay on the pitchside monitor - ensured Liverpool got the job done. Despite a 20th league defeat of the season, Watford will take some comfort that Liverpool were unable to relax until Fabinho struck. However, the Hornets know they have to be more clinical in their final eight games if they are to stand any chance of staying up. While Kucka was denied by a fine save, Pedro should have equalised in the second half after Watford beat Liverpool's offside trap. Roy Hodgson's side face a difficult end-of-season run-in which includes matches at leaders City and Chelsea. Although they host Leeds on 9 April and Brentford on 16 April, they have picked up only seven points from a possible 42 at Vicarage Road this season.

175,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883948,Brighton 0-0 Norwich: Neal Maupay penalty miss costs hosts,"Neal Maupay's missed penalty summed up Brighton's frustration as they were held to a goalless draw at home by Norwich, the Premier League's bottom side. For all the chances they created, Graham Potter's side couldn't find the net - although they did end a run of six straight league defeats. Norwich, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of safety after a passive display. Maupay's big chance came just shy of the half-hour mark, after Sam Byram's handball was spotted by referee Simon Hooper. The French striker, though, shot high over the bar to mocking cheers from the travelling supporters. Brighton had created chances before that, with good play down the left from Leandro Trossard leading to a mishit shot from Maupay, before Danny Welbeck saw a close-range effort blocked. The hosts' lack of cutting edge continued to frustrate them after Maupay's spot-kick miss. Solly March and Alexis Mac Allister failed to hit the target numerous times, and the final ball was badly lacking. Trossard's attempts to spark the hosts into life led to a glorious chance for Joel Veltman 10 minutes after the restart. His quick feet won a corner, which the Dutchman headed goalwards, only to be denied by fellow countryman Tim Krul at point-blank range. Maupay and Veltman were denied by a Norwich rearguard marshalled superbly by Grant Hanley, in the face of relentless second-half pressure from the hosts. In the end, the Seagulls could find no way through, and remain goalless at home since mid-January. Indeed, Norwich almost stole victory when Milot Rashica blazed Teemu Pukki's cross over the bar inside the area. Brighton had 29 shots and more than 60% possession but crucially only hit the target four times. That has been a long-running issue for Potter's side, who again showcased their quality in the build-up, but were let down in front of goal. It simply wasn't Maupay's day, from the moment he miscued his effort with the goal gaping in the first half. Goalkeeper Krul's mind-games before his spot-kick clearly paid off before it sailed over the bar. There were bright moments from Trossard and Mac Allister, while Tariq Lamptey clearly thrives in a more advanced role on the right, but this was not the way Brighton will have wanted to end their losing run. There was plenty of commitment on show from Norwich; they battled well and remained strong in defence. Krul and Hanley in particular were superb in keeping Brighton at bay, as the Canaries ended their own run of six successive league defeats. But they remain far from safety and although there were a couple of chances to win it, they couldn't sustain an attacking threat as Brighton put them under intense pressure. While they will take a point, their long-term prospects look ominous - and it increasingly looks as if they will see a third successive Premier League stint ended after just one season.

176,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883950,Burnley 0-2 Man City: Kevin de Bruyne & Ilkay Gundogan secure win,"Manchester City made an instant return to the top of the Premier League with a comfortable win over struggling Burnley. Liverpool's victory over Watford earlier on Saturday had knocked the defending champions off the summit for the first time since 4 December, but Pep Guardiola's side responded in impressive style at Turf Moor. It took only five minutes for City to take the lead when Raheem Sterling knocked Rodri's cross into the path of Kevin de Bruyne, who time to pick his spot and fire into the roof of the net. Sterling and De Bruyne combined again for the second goal, but this time it was Ilkay Gundogan who provided the finish - a cool volley past Nick Pope after Sterling found him in space inside the area. By now, City were in complete control and could afford to see Sterling, Jack Grealish and substitute Gabriel Jesus waste excellent chances because Burnley never looked remotely capable of mounting a comeback. The home side finally managed a shot on target after 75 minutes, when substitute Jay Rodriguez brought a diving save from Ederson, but they can take few positives from a fourth successive defeat other than the fact they avoided significant damage to their goal difference. Burnley remain rooted in the bottom three, while City can head into next Sunday's top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool knowing they will stay in first place if they avoid defeat. City have got a huge week ahead, with the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, before the visit of Jurgen Klopp's in-form Liverpool next Sunday - the start of a sequence where they play both teams twice. Those are the games which will define City's season, but they needed to focus on this test first - and they passed it almost flawlessly. De Bruyne's early goal settled the nerves of the travelling fans after Josh Brownhill sent an early header flashing wide for the hosts, and the points never looked in doubt from that point. For long periods Burnley did not even get near the ball let alone City's penalty area, while City seemed content to keep possession rather than put much effort into chasing further goals. They still created a host of second-half chances, with their failure to finish them the only way their performance could be faulted, although Jesus went extremely close to a third when he cracked a volley against the post. It did not matter here, but they cannot afford to be so wasteful against Atletico or Liverpool in the days to come. Burnley also have two vital games on the horizon, with relegation rivals Everton the visitors here on Wednesday, before the Clarets travel to bottom-of-the-table Norwich next weekend. This was hardly the ideal preparation because Burnley were completely outclassed, but they at least gave their fans something to shout about in the second half when Maxwel Cornet came off the bench. Cornet added some much-needed spark to the Burnley attack and his link-up play with Wout Weghorst at last meant City's defenders were occasionally occupied, although Ederson's goal remained rarely at risk.

177,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883949,"Leeds 1-1 Southampton: Whites will 'only get better', says boss Jesse Marsch","Leeds boss Jesse Marsch believes his side will ""only get better"" despite them being denied a third straight win by James Ward-Prowse's free-kick in a hard-fought game with Southampton. The Whites were bright in the early stages and took the lead at Elland Road through Jack Harrison's poked finish after Saints keeper Fraser Forster had failed to claim a Raphinha cross. But their recent progress was checked when England midfielder Ward-Prowse added another superb free-kick to his ever-growing showreel to give the visitors a point that their overall performance deserved, ending a run of three straight league defeats. While making it clear that there is still much work to be done, Marsch was pleased with the performance, but not the point that leaves his side eight points above the bottom three. ""It was a real fight,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Southampton play intensely. I know the coach well and he has done a good job with his team. ""For the most part I thought we defended well. We were organised. Maybe in the last phase of the match we were unlucky not to find more. ""The group is confident. They are committed to playing the way I would like them to play. Our work every day is fantastic, I really like being here with this team. ""I think we are only going to grow and get better. In terms of tactically and how I want a game to look like, that was one of our better performances."" United were certainly assisted by the return of captain Liam Cooper, who was impressive starting at centre-back, and England midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who came off the bench in the second half. Both were playing their first matches since 5 December. There have been some superb free-kick takers in Premier League history, but Ward-Prowse is up there with the very best. He is able to make a discipline others find difficult look startlingly simplistic. Such is the England player's reputation that as soon as Kyle Walker-Peters was fouled near the edge of the Leeds box by Luke Ayling, a worried murmur spread among the home fans. They knew what was coming. Ward-Prowse duly delivered, curling the ball over the wall and past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to draw Saints level and ultimately earn them a point from an entertaining, end-to-end contest. Last season, the Saints midfielder was the only player in the Premier League to score more than one goal direct from a free-kick - managing four. This season, he leads the way with three, one more than Newcastle's Kieran Trippier. Not that they really need the points, with their tally of 36 surely enough to keep them clear of any relegation trouble, but Saints will feel they could have taken all three. But for a Meslier save and Stuart Dallas clearance off the line under pressure, Che Adams would have levelled before Ward-Prowse's moment of magic. Mohamed Elyounoussi also shot straight at Meslier from a good position in the box in the first half and they sparked some desperate last-ditch defending from the home side on a number of occasions after the break. ""It was an intense game and a bit ping pong in some moments,"" said Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, whose side had lost their previous four matches. ""I think in the end we had the better chances to win it. We had the better parts of our game. It was a step forward for us that in such an intense game we had the chance to win it. ""Very important result after a tough run of tight games, to come back with a draw here. ""We had a good break, we were fresh today. We have eight games to go and it is a good chance to finish the season in the top 10 but every week is a good challenge."" The visitors could easily have lost the game too, though, with Leeds comfortably the better side early on but unable to make clear openings count. Diego Llorente headed wide from a corner, Dan James saw a shot saved, Mateusz Klich had a shot deflect wide and Harrison had the ball in the net, only for it to be ruled out for a shove on a defender by Rodrigo. The home side kept going right until the end in hope of a late winner for the third game in a row, sending on Joe Gelhardt - whose 94th-minute goal gave them victory over Norwich before the international break. But it was not to be for a third time and Marsch's side were forced to settle for a point gained on their relegation rivals rather than the three that would have really given them some breathing space in the battle at the bottom. They next travel to Watford for a game that will go a long way to deciding how deep into the season Leeds' relegation concerns go.

178,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883952,Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa: Steven Gerrard unhappy as Wolves boost European hopes,"Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard warned his players they are playing for their futures after they lost at Wolves - a result that boosted the hosts' hopes of playing in Europe next season. Wolves had looked in control when Spain defender Jonny struck a crisp half-volley after only seven minutes before Villa defender Ashley Young inadvertently headed into his own net to make it 2-0. A controversial 86th-minute penalty from England striker Ollie Watkins, after he was fouled by goalkeeper Jose Sa, gave Villa hope of leaving Molineux with a draw. They had a chance to grab an unlikely point, but Matty Cash's 95th-minute volley was saved by Sa. However, Gerrard, whose side have now lost three games in a row for the first time since he replaced the sacked Dean Smith in November, was unhappy with his players. ""It's a game we never turned up for,"" the former England captain said. ""We're playing Wolves, a local rival, but you can't come to derbies at half time. ""We're looking like a 45-minute team and that's on me - we gifted Wolves two goals. I've got to fix it and I will fix it. ""The players in the building have to help me fix it now. If not, we will get players in who will help me fix it."" The victory took Wolves above West Ham and five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal in the final Champions League spot - although the Gunners have three games in hand. For Wolves, it was a third victory in seven games, even if in the end it was tighter than they might have liked. They are now seventh in the Premier League and, if they stay there, will qualify for next season's Europa Conference League - as long as Crystal Palace do not win the FA Cup (in which case the Eagles would play in Europe instead). Wolves are trying to secure European football for the second time in four seasons after reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2019-20. Despite being without midfielder Ruben Neves, out for a month with a knee injury, and suspended striker Raul Jimenez after his red card against Leeds, Bruno Lage's side looked a threat every time they attacked against a surprisingly vulnerable Villa defence. Wolves went ahead after only seven minutes when Villa's John McGinn slipped and lost possession before team-mate Ezri Konsa also fell over. That enabled the hosts to counter, with Jonny scoring with a great strike after Lucas Digne had blocked Fabio Silva's shot. It was Jonny's second goal in consecutive matches in only his sixth appearance of the season, after being out for 10 months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The hosts doubled their lead in the 36th minute in fortunate circumstances when Young, on in place of the injured Digne, slipped when trying to deal with Marcal's left-wing cross and headed into his own net. Wolves threw away a 2-0 lead against Leeds before losing 3-2 on 18 March, and their fans would have been fearing a repeat late on at Molineux. Villa's best chances in the first half came from long distance, with Philippe Coutinho narrowly firing a free-kick over and Leon Bailey having an excellent effort tipped over by goalkeeper Jose Sa. Watkins, who scored for England in their 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday, twice had chances to halve the deficit before Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan almost added another for the hosts within two minutes of coming on, but shot wide.

179,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970706,Man Utd's next manager: Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag to rescue the club?,"They know what's coming at Manchester United. After suffering another blow to their hopes of making next season's Champions League with a disappointing - in result and performance - Old Trafford encounter with Leicester, talk outside the club will be of a season unravelling. Having dispensed with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November, Ralf Rangnick's arrival has not really improved the situation. The German's nine from 21 win record (42.85%), is marginally better than the Norwegian's seven from 17 (41.18%). But it is not good enough. United now need 14 points from their final eight games to better the 64 during the sorry 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes which is their worst return in three decades. Inevitably, thoughts will again turn to who will take charge in the summer to try and rectify the damage of a terrible season. Manchester United are eager to assure supporters their managerial search is extensive and not just limited to two candidates, Erik ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. But there is no dispute from some within Old Trafford when it is questioned who else, realistically, could be in the frame. Luis Enrique is committed to coaching Spain at the World Cup, which rules him out until the end of the December and probably longer given the intensity of tournament football. Now the situation at Chelsea has stabilised to an extent and the search for a new owner looks like finding someone committed to keeping the Blues at the top, the idea of luring Thomas Tuchel away from Stamford Bridge is receding. United admire both men but sources admit recruiting them would be ""difficult"". Sevilla's Julen Lopetegui would be an unlikely choice and Brendan Rodgers a tough sell to United fans given the combination of his Liverpool past and an underwhelming season at Leicester. Which brings it back to Ten Hag and Pochettino, both of whom would come to Old Trafford with question marks hanging over them. Paris St-Germain chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar are both on the European Clubs' Association board. The ECA met in Vienna this week. Manchester United's managerial search was mentioned when the pair spoke informally - but neither know which way the Premier League club will go. Evidently, managing United is a challenge at present - but, BBC Sport was told, that is the attraction for someone keen to prove their abilities at the very highest level. Pochettino's Old Trafford admirers date back to his time at Tottenham. Yet the doubts about the Argentine - namely he doesn't win when it matters - remain. After all, he failed to win the title at PSG last season and the French club's elimination at the Champions League last-16 stage this term is viewed as not being good enough at the club given the huge investment in the squad. That observation probably means Pochettino will be relieved of his duties at the end of the season and football director Leonardo is also on shaky ground as PSG prepare for a major overhaul. Ten Hag's status mainly comes from Ajax's run to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2019 when, ironically, he was denied a place in the final by Pochettino's Spurs. The 52-year-old is viewed as a progressing coach. But the demands of an English season, the relentless combination of an exhausting fixture list, where difficult games pile up week after week, are an alien concept. The two Ajax managers before Ten Hag were Peter Bosz and Frank de Boer. Upon leaving Amsterdam, they didn't even make it to the end of the year in their first seasons at Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan respectively, let alone the end of their debut seasons. United are now three points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal, having played two games more. With Wolves and West Ham snapping at their heels and Crystal Palace still in the FA Cup, it is not completely out of the question a place in the dreaded Europa Conference League play-off round in August awaits. ""I am not a fortune teller,"" said Rangnick. ""I don't know where Manchester United will be next season. ""It is my job to finish this season on the highest possible note. Saying that does not mean necessarily to finish fourth. Today's result has not made the situation better obviously. ""It doesn't help at all to look at the table every weekend and speculate what might happen. Right now, we are for sure not the favourites for number four."" ",positive,liverpool,1
180,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60883951,Manchester United 1-1 Leicester City: Hosts' Champions League hopes dented by Foxes,"Manchester United suffered another blow in the battle for a Champions League spot as they were held by Leicester at Old Trafford. The damage could have been even worse for Ralf Rangnick's men as Leicester were denied a potential winner 10 minutes from time when referee Andre Marriner was sent to the screen by the video assistant referee, with Marriner overturning James Maddison's effort for a foul on Raphael Varane in the build-up. United could count themselves fortunate to get a point. After a drab opening period, Kelechi Iheanacho scored a superb 63rd-minute opener when he met superb Maddison's left-wing cross with a fine diving header, which sent the ball back into the far corner. The Foxes' advantage lasted just three minutes, with Brazilian midfielder Fred on hand to convert the rebound after Bruno Fernandes' shot had been pushed into his path by Kasper Schmeichel. It was a disappointing outcome for the hosts, who are now three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, having played two games more and with a trip to the Gunners, plus encounters with Liverpool and Chelsea, still to come. It says everything about the kind of season Marcus Rashford has had that even with the ill Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood missing this game completely, the England man was only given a seat on the bench. Rashford's future has been debated long and hard over the last few weeks. With a contract that is due to expire next year, although there is an option to extend to 2024, a decision over Rashford will be one of the new manager's first tasks when he takes over. The theory is a proper break, followed by an intense pre-season and a chance to play regularly in his best position, on the left, would correct many of Rashford's problems. At the moment though, he just needs to deliver. And, asked to occupy the number nine position when he was introduced for the final 35 minutes, Rashford continued to look ill at ease. Rangnick provided detailed instructions as Rashford waited to come on and then, together with technical director Darren Fletcher, offered more as the game entered its final 20 minutes. Fleetingly, it looked like Rashford's world would turn. Deep into stoppage time, he picked the ball up just outside the box and drove at the Leicester defence. But just as space opened up to shoot, an offside Anthony Elanga got in his way and the chance was gone. Given Leicester's only hope of salvaging something tangible out of this injury-ravaged campaign comes through the Europa Conference League, starting with Thursday's quarter-final first leg with PSV Eindhoven, they could be forgiven their listless start. Brendan Rodgers was buoyed by the return of Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana, who started together in defence for the first time since last May's FA Cup final. Given the paucity of what the home side presented them with, Leicester grew in confidence and Iheanacho should really have put them in front before the break when he screwed a shot from the edge of the area wide after the Nigerian had been left totally unmarked. Victory would have been the first time Leicester had won successive away games at Old Trafford and the disappointment from Rodgers' perspective would be that his team did not hold on to their lead long enough. Yet, even after United's equaliser, they carried the greater threat. Iheanacho chipped over from an acute angle after Jadon Sancho's stray backpass had sent him through before Fofana brought a superb save out of David de Gea with a header that was bound for the top corner. Rodgers thought Maddison had won it and questioned fourth official Martin Atkinson when the goal was ruled out. He was still unconvinced even after the decision had been explained.

181,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59918926,Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea: Kevin de Bruyne strike sends Premier League leaders 13 points clear,"Kevin de Bruyne produced a moment of world-class quality to tighten Manchester City's stranglehold on the Premier League title race with victory over Chelsea at Etihad Stadium. The former Chelsea player broke the deadlock in a tight game with a superb curling drive past keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with 20 minutes left to extend City's lead at the top of the table to an imposing 13 points. Chelsea had their chances, the best coming when Ederson saved from Romelu Lukaku in the second half but De Bruyne made the difference and City now also have a 14-point advantage over Liverpool, who have two games in hand. City deserved the win for their greater urgency and possession, Kepa keeping out Jack Grealish with a first-half save, and this represents another significant stride in their quest to retain the Premier League crown. In a game of this nature, fought out by two well-disciplined sides led by elite managers in Pep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel, it always seemed likely a mistake or a moment of the highest quality would settle it. And so it proved as De Bruyne created and finished the decisive move all on his own as City and Chelsea strived to make the breakthrough. City had not been able to impose sustained threat on Chelsea, despite having so much possession, but they have the calibre of player who can fashion a goal out of nothing. On this occasion, it was De Bruyne who stepped up, running deep into Chelsea territory in the 70th minute before curling a perfect low right-foot finish before the outstretched left arm of Kepa and into the bottom corner. Etihad Stadium celebrated in a fashion fitting for a moment of such class and importance and these three points once again give the impression that City's lead in the title race is pretty much unassailable. Guardiola has stars at the other end too and keeper Ederson played his part with a vital save from Lukaku when he was clean through. He also brought fist pumps and wild applause from his manager when he raced out of the area to head clear and snuff out Chelsea danger late on. City closed out the win without any serious alarms, Guardiola and his team striking a huge blow as they try to see off the chasing pack - which is effectively Chelsea and Liverpool - at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea for long spells looked like they might leave Etihad Stadium with some reward for a performance in which they kept Manchester City at arm's length for long periods. In the end, however, they were undone by that moment of De Bruyne genius and their own inability take the rare opportunities that came. Lukaku, who looks to be struggling for form and confidence, had those opportunities that you simply must cash in on against a team going for their 12th successive league win. He was in a good position to shoot in the first half as he broke clear but chose to pass up responsibility and play in Hakim Ziyech, who added to manager Tuchel's frustration by straying into an offside position. The biggest chance of all came when Lukaku was played through by Kovacic in the second half with the scoreline still goalless. There was not too much wrong with his finish but it lacked a little conviction and Ederson was able to make a save that proved crucial. Tuchel's discontent was clear throughout as he saw his team penned in by City but Chelsea could have got something, even if it may have been fortuitous in the context of the entire game. Once De Bruyne ended the stalemate, Chelsea had little to offer and in reality any very slim title hopes they may have had have been extinguished completely by this defeat.

182,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60986738,Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds in control of Champions League quarter-final,"Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp says his side are ""not in dreamland"" after an important victory over Benfica in Lisbon. Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos. Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half. The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest. But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments. ""Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,"" said Klopp. ""We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here. ""It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica."" This was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later. The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be ""outstanding"". Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go. Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout. He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half. Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club. The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish. Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season. That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away. But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

183,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60364587,Leeds United 2-4 Manchester United: Red Devils win Elland Road thriller,"Manchester United survived a stirring Leeds United comeback at a highly-charged Elland Road to claim a crucial victory and maintain their grip on a top-four place in the Premier League. In the first league game in front of fans between the two old rivals at Elland Road since October 2003, they produced a fitting spectacle played out in a deluge and a predictably thunderous atmosphere. Manchester United were in complete control at the break after captain Harry Maguire headed in Luke Shaw's corner, and Bruno Fernandes did the same from Jadon Sancho's cross right on half-time. Leeds, however, mounted a superb revival and were level with two goals inside a minute as Rodrigo's 53rd-minute cross drifted in behind keeper David de Gea, then substitute Raphinha sent Elland Road into raptures when he slid home a cross from Daniel James. Manchester United gathered themselves, manager Ralf Rangnick made changes, and one of his substitutes produced the rewards as Fred drove in at Illan Meslier's near post following more good work by Sancho with 20 minutes left - although Anthony Elanga was struck by objects thrown from the crowd amid the celebrations. Elanga recovered to confirm Manchester United's win with a composed finish two minutes from time from Fernandes' pass. Manchester United's victory came in three phases - the control of the first half, the shock of Leeds United's quick one-two, then the recovery to finally close out the victory they deserved. This was always going to be a test of mettle and for a spell after the break when Leeds scored those two quick goals and were winning all the 50-50s in this most raucous of environments, it looked like they would not come through the examination unscathed. Manchester United's players looked shell-shocked at the turn of events that allowed Leeds, who looked deflated at half-time, to revive themselves and even threaten a victory that would have been the sweetest of all for the home fans, who made their dislike of the visitors clear before, during and after this game. Manager Rangnick, however, deserves credit for the changes that restored Manchester United's equilibrium, Fred coming on to put them back in front and another substitute, Elanga, snuffing out any hope Leeds had of a point with the fourth. Manchester United will feel they deserved the win over the whole piece, but they were fragile at times and were rocking under Leeds attacks until Fred silenced the crowd, albeit temporarily. There were unsavoury scenes when Elanga needed to be attended to after being hit by missiles thrown from the crowd following Fred's goal, but he was able to regain his composure to such an extent that he struck the final blow in the closing moments. Manchester United enjoyed their second win in a week and sit fourth, four points behind Chelsea and four ahead of fifth-placed West Ham, but know they need to keep winning with Arsenal four points behind in sixth with three games in hand. Leeds United demonstrated every facet of exactly what they are in another Elland Road thrill ride. Marcelo Bielsa's side can be called many things but never dull. Leeds showed their defensive frailty in the first half when Diego Llorente failed miserably to mark Maguire at a corner, the situation not helped by keeper Meslier's 'in-out' hokey-cokey that left him in no man's land. They were exposed again when Victor Lindelof strode out of defence to tee up Sancho for the perfect cross on to Fernandes' head to send clouds of gloom over Elland Road, to accompany those depositing constant heavy rain on a pitch left carrying surface water. What we saw then was the bold, attacking bravery that has made Leeds, under Bielsa, one of the most exciting teams to watch since their return to the Premier League. They pulled the situation around but there was never a sense that they were in complete control, secure against an attacking counterpunch and so it proved as Manchester United inflicted further punishment. Leeds and Bielsa cannot get midfield lynchpin Kalvin Phillips, main marksman Patrick Bamford and defender Liam Cooper back quick enough, just to ease those worries of dropping into relegation trouble. And they could be without defender Robin Koch, who was taken off after suffering a head wound in a collision with Scott McTominay. They are five points off the relegation places with a trip to Liverpool on the horizon this week, so it will not get any easier for Bielsa and his players.

184,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60149753,Valerien Ismael: West Bromwich Albion part company with head coach,"West Bromwich Albion have parted company with boss Valerien Ismael. The 46-year-old Frenchman had taken Albion to fifth in the Championship - but fans voiced concerns over his style of football. Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Millwall was the head coach's final game in charge. Assistant head coach Adam Murray has also left the club, while Albion have also made a change at boardroom level, bringing in Ron Gourlay as chief executive officer in place of Xu Ke. Club owner Guochuan Lai, the controlling shareholder, will replace Li Piyue as Albion chairman. Lai is now looking for his eighth head coach since his Chinese investment group bought Albion from Jeremy Peace in September 2016 - to follow Tony Pulis, Alan Pardew, Darren Moore, interim boss Jimmy Shan, Slaven Bilic, Sam Allardyce and Ismael. Former Aston Villa and Birmingham City boss Steve Bruce is favourite to replace Ismael. The Baggies have a week before their next game against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Ismael, moved to The Hawthorns from Barnsley in June following Albion's relegation from the Premier League - but he won just 12 of his 31 matches in charge. Albion, aiming to be promoted to the Premier League for a record sixth time, made a great start under Ismael, scoring 12 goals as they won four of their first five Championship games in an unbeaten start to the season in August. But they have won just eight times in 24 games since - and have taken 14 points out of a possible 39 with goals also drying up. Their unbeaten home record (the club's longest ever unbeaten start to a season) went against Preston last week  and their 'goals against' total (24 in 29 games) is the joint lowest in the second tier - but  they will be out of the play-off positions if other clubs win their games in hand. The Baggies signed striker Daryl Dike in the January window, but the new arrival from MLS side Orlando City suffered a hamstring injury on his home debut. And, although Andy Carroll was brought in as a temporary stop-gap, the Baggies' latest defeat left them with one victory in seven league games. New CEO Gourlay has considerable experience in football, having occupied senior roles at Manchester United, Chelsea and Reading. Gourlay, who had been working for Albion as an advisor, became Chelsea CEO in September 2009, succeeding Peter Kenyon - and was there when they won the Champions League for the first time in 2012. He stayed until 2014, during which time he worked with five Chelsea managers - Carlo Ancelotti, Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, Rafa Benitez and Jose Mourinho. Gourlay took on the same role at Reading in July 2017, where he worked with two managers - Jaap Stam, who left in March 2018, and then Paul Clement, the brother of former Albion favourite Neil Clement, who was this week appointed as part of Frank Lampard's backroom team at Everton. But he left after just 16 months at the Royals, when they were 20th in the Championship, shortly followed by Clement. ""I am proud and honoured to be named chief executive officer of this historic football club,"" Gourlay said. ""I am aware of the issues we currently face, but I am not one to shy away from a challenge."" ""During my short time here as a consultant I have seen and felt the disconnect between the club and its supporters and I will work tirelessly to rectify that. ""In my conversations with Guochuan Lai during his recent visit we agreed the club needs to make significant changes in order to succeed. ""Our aim both in the short and long term is to be in the Premier League, but I recognise many of the issues at the club run deeper than which division we are playing in. ""My immediate priority is to now appoint a new head coach following the departure of Valerien Ismael. I would like to personally thank Val for his efforts and I wish him well in the future."" BBC WM's Rob Gurney We did expect this news to have occurred before. When they got rid of Darren Moore three years ago, he was gone before six o'clock that Saturday evening. But straight after the Millwall game on Saturday, we understand Val Ismael flew to Germany to be with his family. He did turn up for training as scheduled on Wednesday but Albion then released their statement at two o'clock saying he was no longer head coach. The fans had turned 'en masse' against him. For the last two games, both 2-0 defeats at home to Preston and against Millwall on Saturday, they were up in arms in considerable numbers and there was no way back for him. I said at the weekend it was inconceivable that they wouldn't act before the next game at Sheffield United and now that's what they've done. It wasn't a very happy camp. Sam Johnstone has had quite a public falling out with him a few days ago, and Robert Snodgrass had his contract cancelled. He was somebody else who behind the scenes didn't see eye to eye. Semi Ajayi was another one. And that has transmitted itself onto the field all too readily in recent weeks. ",negative,liverpool,0

The 61-year-old replaces Valerien Ismael, who left the club on Wednesday after a run of one win in seven games. Ex-Aston Villa, Hull, Sunderland and Birmingham boss Bruce left Premier League Newcastle in October, soon after their Saudi Arabia-backed takeover. He takes charge of a Baggies side who started the Championship season well, but have since slumped to sixth place. Bruce, who began his managerial career at Sheffield United in 1998 and has also been in charge at Huddersfield Town, Wigan Athletic (twice), Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday, has extensive experience in English football's second tier, having twice won promotion to the Premier League with both Birmingham City and Hull City. He brings with him his long-time assistant Stephen Clemence, Steve Agnew, who has been part of his backroom team since his Villa days, and his son Alex Bruce as coach, to supplement James Morrison and Gary Walsh who were already part of the Albion coaching staff. Having become the first appointment made by new Albion chief executive Ron Gourlay, Bruce said he did not anticipate such a quick return to management after leaving Newcastle. ""I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage a club that has such great history and tradition,"" said Bruce, whose first game will be a trip to Sheffield United on 9 February. ""It is a club I obviously know well from my time in the Midlands, and I am already relishing the challenge of taking it forward. ""I did not envisage I would return to management this quickly, but once I got the phone call from Ron, I knew I could not resist the challenge of getting this club back to where they want to be. ""I am coming in with one aim and that is to get Albion to the Premier League."" Ismael, who was appointed in June to replace Sam Allardyce, was dismissed after Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Millwall, West Brom's fourth loss in their last six Championship games. The club's stuttering form has seen them slip eight points adrift of the automatic promotion places. ""His excellent man-management skills, tactical nous, and ability to hit the ground running were among the many reasons we decided he was the man to take us forward,"" said Gourlay, who was only appointed chief executive on Wednesday. ""Promotion remains our objective for this season, and we are confident that with Steve leading the club we have given ourselves every chance of achieving that goal."" Bruce also becomes Albion's first boss to use the title of manager since Tony Mowbray left for Celtic in 2009 - after which Roberto Di Matteo became the first in a line of 12 head coaches at the club. Rob Gurney - BBC Radio WM's West Bromwich Albion reporter Albion have done a complete 180 in the space of seven months, from giving Valerien Ismael, in theory, a four-year plan to take the club forward, including the brief to create a pathway into the first team for more youngsters, to the ultimate tried and tested manager Steve Bruce. With exactly 1,000 games on his CV, the Baggies are Bruce's 11th different club, and 12th job in management. No shortage of experience. The short-term aim, already stated by him and new CEO Ron Gourlay, is immediate promotion back to the Premier League; a feat he's already achieved four times. Life at Villa Park and St James' Park was particularly bruising for him, and it'll be interesting to see just how revitalised he is, only a couple of months or so after leaving Newcastle. Talking of bruised, one or two egos in the Albion dressing room have taken a hit this season, but the likes of Sam Johnstone and Jake Livermore have played for Bruce before, and his style will be more expansive than the strait-jacketed approach of his predecessor. Progressive? No. Is it what the club needs, right here, right now? Possibly. Was the change unavoidable? Yes. Healing the fractures that have become yawning chasms at The Hawthorns of late is the first objective. Winning some matches with a smile and a bit of a swagger would be nice too.

The 40-year-old joins after the League One Black Cats parted company with Lee Johnson following their 6-0 thrashing by Bolton Wanderers on 29 January. Neil's arrival comes after negotiations ended with former boss Roy Keane. The Scot will take charge of Saturday's game at AFC Wimbledon with his new side fourth in the table. ""It is a privilege to be head coach of Sunderland AFC,"" Neil said. ""Everything that I saw from the players this morning made me really confident and gave me belief, so what we now need to do is replicate that on a matchday - when it matters - under scrutiny and under pressure. ""Our task is to try to win as many games as we possibly can and at this moment in time we are focused on this season and this season alone."" Former Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning will be Neil's assistant at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland had been second in League One after their win against Portsmouth on 22 January, but since Johnson's sacking, they subsequently lost against Doncaster and Cheltenham to drop to fourth. Neil's managerial career has seen promotions with both Hamilton and Norwich to the Scottish and English top flights. He won promotion with the Canaries to the Premier League after they beat Middlesbrough in the 2015 Championship play-off final - a win which came just five months after he took charge at Carrow Road. Having taken over at Deepdale in 2017 from Simon Grayson - who left to join Sunderland at the time - Neil oversaw mid-table stability for Preston in the Championship. He was sacked last season, however, after just one win in nine Championship matches with the club 16th and nine points off the relegation places. ",positive,liverpool,0
187,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59959292,Reading: Veljko Paunovic departs as manager with Paul Ince named as interim boss,"Reading have parted company with manager Veljko Paunovic despite a first win in 12 games and named ex-England captain Paul Ince as interim boss. The Royals won 3-2 at Preston on Saturday, leaving them five points above the Championship relegation zone. But ex-Serbia international Paunovic, 44, had won just two of his last 15 league matches in charge of the club. Former Manchester United midfielder Ince, 54, has not held a managerial role since leaving Blackpool in 2014. Academy manager and former Reading winger Michael Gilkes will assist Ince, whose son Tom also joined the club on loan last month, while the Royals embark on a search for a permanent manager. Paunovic leaves after 18 months in charge having been appointed in August 2020. Confirmation of his departure came less than 30 minutes after the club's win at Preston and Paunovic revealed in his post-match interview that he had been relieved of his duties before Saturday's game. ""We came to the point where this decision was best for the club,"" Paunovic told BBC Radio Berkshire. ""I'm pretty self-aware of the things that are happening and the negativity that was surrounding me. ""I never thought that it was fair, but I also don't think the team needs it at this point. ""I'm completely unselfish in this decision, I want the team to excel and I want the best for the club. I really have a huge respect for the opportunity and the time I've spent at this club. ""I just wanted to do the best for the club and we reached an agreement where this was the right time to make this decision for the future of it."" Reading ended a seven-game losing run in the league with a point at Peterborough on Wednesday, keeping a first clean sheet since beating bottom-of-the-table Barnsley 1-0 in mid-October. But before that game, they had conceded 28 goals in their previous nine games, including a 7-0 thrashing at home by Championship leaders Fulham and a 2-1 loss away at sixth-tier Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup third round. Former Real Mallorca and Atletico Madrid midfielder Paunovic succeeded Mark Bowen when he was handed the job on the eve of the 2020-21 season. He oversaw an impressive start to his tenure as the Royals were surprise early Championship leaders that season with an eight-match unbeaten run at the start of the campaign, winning seven and drawing the other. But they eventually missed out on the play-offs, finishing seven points adrift in seventh. This season Paunovic has had to contend with a series of on and off-field issues including a lengthy injury list, a transfer embargo, a six-point deduction enforced in November for breaking EFL financial rules and an embarrassing FA Cup third round exit against non-league Kidderminster Harriers. Before their home defeat by Coventry on 12 February, a number of supporters staged a protest against the club's owners in an attempt to overshadow celebrations of the club's 150th anniversary. Paunovic's departure is Reading's fifth managerial change in less than three years since Jaap Stam was sacked in March 2018. Former Reading midfielder and BBC Radio Berkshire summariser Jem Karacan I find it hard to get my head around the timing of the decision. The club have stuck by Veljko Paunovic all season while the supporters have been calling for his head and they've not really backed him. They hung him out to dry to an extent, letting him answer questions week after week he shouldn't have been having to deal with and didn't want to be answering. I'm speechless and I'm not sure the decision to bring in Paul Ince is the right call. The chain of events is interesting with Tom Ince having joined the club on loan from Stoke City on transfer deadline day. A week later, Paul is placed in interim charge. Michael Gilkes on the other hand knows the club inside out and I would have seen more sense in him taking the job until the end of the season. He's there inside the building already and would know better than most what's been going on with this current first-team squad. At the end of day, people who love the club just want them to stay in the Championship and it will be interesting to see who makes the decisions between Paul Ince and Michael Gilkes.

A fifth win in six games under Paul Simpson further eased the visitors' relegation fears. Dennis's 75th-minute effort added to Jordan Gibson's eighth of the campaign after 32 minutes to give Carlisle a 2-0 advantage. Barrow skipper Ollie Banks rifled home his 13th goal of the campaign to give the home side hope of a famous comeback. But the visitors held out despite late pressure to preserve their 62-year unbeaten league record over their Holker Street rivals. Carlisle's return to winning ways after a midweek home defeat to Newport leaves them 12 points above the drop zone. However, their county rivals remain deep in trouble as a two-game unbeaten run that yielded four points came to an end. Gibson and Dennis delighted more than 600 travelling fans in Barrow's biggest league attendance- 4,658 - since 1969.

In the only tie of the round that went to a replay, Barrow dominated the first half and were 2-0 up at the break through Jordan Stevens and Robbie Gotts. Stevens fired a cleverly-worked corner in from the edge of the box, via a slight deflection, before Gotts smashed home from close range. Ipswich made nine changes from the side which drew at Wigan in the league and struggled to pose any attacking threat before the break. Despite improving in the second half, with James Norwood poking wide and substitutes Sam Morsy and Joe Pigott forcing good saves from Paul Farman, Barrow were excellent value for their victory. They will now face Championship strugglers Barnsley at Oakwell on 8 January with a chance to reach round four for the first time. Defeat by lower-league opponents continues a difficult December for the Tractor Boys which has seen boss Paul Cook sacked and defender Toto Nsiala involved in an altercation with Ipswich fans after a loss at Charlton. Interim manager John McGreal could find no way to counteract an impressive Barrow performance who themselves have been struggling in League Two this season. The introduction of Morsy and Luke Woolfenden at half-time did spark some life into the visitors but Barrow defended superbly and closed out the game as Ipswich piled forward. Barrow manager Mark Cooper told BBC Radio Cumbria: ""I thought we played very well and took it to a different level in the first 45 minutes, I thought 2-0 flattered them. ""Second half, we knew there would be a reaction and they would make it a fight, but we stood up to it and we had to do what we had to do and we kept another clean sheet. ""First half, we were fantastic with the ball and didn't give them any time to settle on the ball. We said we needed to start well and manage the game properly. ""That's how I want to play, you have to have that intensity when you haven't got the ball. ""There were a couple of skirmishes and Paul Farman made a couple of saves, but apart from that we were comfortable."" Ipswich Town interim manager John McGreal told BBC Radio Suffolk: ""That first-half performance in particular hurts as it just shows the level of inconsistency in 90 minutes. ""You can argue it's quite easy to get on the ball when they back off a bit and you're 2-0 down, but at least they had a go in the second half. We had to adapt and change the shape just to get at them more. ""I'm only a caretaker, but whatever team you manage, I'm a proud man and you want your team to put on a performance. I couldn't sit there and watch that. ""Things had to be said and changed and I'm not scared of doing that. We had to go with a different type of energy and get some legs into the team and we did that more in the second half. ""I can't say right now if I'll be in charge again on Saturday. There's a lot to work with for the new guy, but there's also a lot of work to be done and I'm hopeful the fans will get behind a new manager as well.""

Ollie Banks thundered in a free-kick and Anthony Glennon levelled but Devante Cole curled in for the hosts only for James Jones to equalise. Carlton Morris made it 4-3 but Josh Kay sent it to extra time where Morris thumped home the winner for the Reds. Defeat was harsh on League Two Barrow who ended up playing for more than 80 of the 120 minutes with 10 men after Beadling was sent off for a dreadful high tackle on Romal Palmer.

Morris turned adroitly to score his second and his side's fifth in the first half of extra time and Barrow could not find a fourth equaliser to send the match to penalties.

194,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685405,Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth: Leaders win to go 25 points clear,"Jurgen Klopp said he will ""never compare"" himself to former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly after his side beat Bournemouth to take another major step towards a first league title in 30 years. The victory was Liverpool's 22nd successive Premier League win at Anfield, breaking the English top-flight record set by Shankly's team in 1972. ""We didn't think about that number before the game, but after we can,"" said Klopp. ""It's nice, it's special, but today is a very good example that we have to fight."" The hosts fell behind in controversial circumstances, Callum Wilson slotting home Jefferson Lerma's low cross after appearing to shove Joe Gomez in the build-up to the goal. Liverpool soon hit their stride, however, and Mohamed Salah - making his 100th league appearance for the club - restored parity with a low finish after Sadio Mane dispossessed Jack Simpson deep inside the Cherries' half. Mane latched on to Virgil van Dijk's perfectly weighted through-ball to complete the turnaround, but Liverpool needed a brilliant goal-line clearance from James Milner to prevent Ryan Fraser from hauling Bournemouth back on level terms in a nervy second half. ""We're not geniuses, but we can really fight and that's all we have to do until the end of the season,"" said Klopp, who confirmed captain Jordan Henderson - missing with a hamstring injury - is likely to resume full training on Sunday before the Champions League last-16 second leg at home to Atletico Madrid. ""I think he will train tomorrow. If that looks good, I have to make a decision."" The win means Liverpool could be champions by the time they play Everton in the league on 16 March - if Manchester City lose their next three games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Burnley. Eddie Howe's Bournemouth side remain in the relegation zone, level on points with Watford and West Ham but with a worse goal difference than their nearest rivals at the bottom. Klopp spoke before the game about ""getting back on track immediately"" after watching his side slip to consecutive defeats in the league and FA Cup. They made the worst possible start, however, as Bournemouth capitalised on the Reds' early nerves to take a shock lead - albeit in controversial fashion. Wilson finished off a neat move involving Lerma and Philip Billing, but Liverpool felt the goal should have been disallowed for the striker's push on Gomez. The video assistant referee saw no infringement and the goal was given. Things could have got worse for Liverpool when Nathan Ake's powerful header was unconvincingly shovelled on to the top of the crossbar by stand-in goalkeeper Adrian, although they continued to create chances and deservedly restored parity through Salah's low finish - his 70th league goal for the club. If Bournemouth fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Mane scored with a delightful dink over Aaron Ramsdale 12 minutes before half-time, Liverpool failed to carry that momentum into the second half. Chances were few and far between until Ryan Fraser spotted Adrian off his line, with the retreating Milner producing an outstanding clearance, while Mane's 25-yard strike cannoned back off the bar. Having seen his side taken a deserved early lead, Howe will be bitterly disappointed with the manner of Liverpool's two first-half goals. Simpson, who replaced the injured Steve Cook after 19 minutes, was easily dispossessed by Mane in the build-up to Salah's equaliser, before another sloppy pass allowed Van Dijk to tee up the Senegal forward for Liverpool's second. There were positives for Bournemouth, who caused Liverpool problems and were only denied a share of the spoils by Milner's superb clearance from Fraser's looping effort. Ake spurned an opportunity to equalise in the 90th minute when he opted to pass to the offside Wilson with only Adrian to beat. However, Bournemouth will need to cut out individual mistakes if they are to prolong their five-year stay in the Premier League. ""The two goals come from us having possession and they punished us on the transition,"" Howe said. ""It was a ruthless game for us today because I don't think we did much wrong."" With games against Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham and Leicester coming up, Bournemouth will be desperate to claim maximum points at home to Crystal Palace in their next league match. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: ""I know what the boys are able to do, but I am not the one that is playing - they are. We have said before, confidence is not something that you get, put in your pocket and keep for the rest of your life. It comes and goes. You need that feeling where things work out. ""You have to fight hard - that's always the main thing to do - but we have 82 points now, which is really nice. We have to carry on fighting, give everyone a proper fight - and that's what we did today."" Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: ""We gave it a go. We started really well and looked a threat on the counter-attack. Their two goals came from the transition. They punished us when it counted. ""We made a mistake for the first goal, and the second was similar - we had the ball, seconds later we are conceding. We gave everything to it but came away with nothing. ""Losing Steve Cook was a big moment, and Phil [Billing] couldn't really move at the end. We couldn't have a full assault at them.""

195,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685402,Arsenal 1-0 West Ham: Alexandre Lacazette gives Gunners victory,"Mikel Arteta says his Arsenal team are ""turning the corner"" after a narrow win over West Ham boosted their hopes of finishing in the Premier League top four. Alexandre Lacazette's goal 12 minutes from time, which was confirmed by the video assistant referee, lifted the Gunners up to ninth, five points behind Chelsea in fourth. The France forward swept a close-range effort into the bottom-left corner from Mesut Ozil's cushioned header for his third goal in four games. And it also ensured the Gunners claimed a third straight league win at home for the first time since February 2019. ""I'm happy because big teams find a way when they aren't playing well,"" Arteta said. ""We are turning the corner in terms of results, but our ship still has to turn a few times more to see what we want to see. It doesn't happen overnight."" West Ham, who have now lost their past six Premier League away games, had enjoyed the better of the scoring opportunities until Lacazette's intervention and remain 16th, above the bottom three only on goal difference. While David Moyes' side had limited possession, they took the game to their hosts, who came out of the blocks sluggishly and struggled to inject any tempo to their play. Jarrod Bowen's early shot was tipped on to a post by Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno and Michail Antonio failed to score from two clear chances either side of the interval. Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos earlier went close for Arsenal - he headed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cross against the bar - before Lacazette popped up with the winner. Since his appointment as Arsenal boss on 20 December, Arteta has lost only one league game, and appears to have injected more resilience, energy and a pattern of play into his side. However, for large parts of this encounter the Spaniard's imprint on his team was barely visible. Instead, they served up the sort of rudderless display - lacking in leadership, guile and pace - that led to the departure of former manager Unai Emery in November. While the outcome may have enhanced Arsenal's chances of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17, Arteta suggested that his side will have to improve further to make up ground in the race for a top-four finish. Leading scorer Aubameyang, was a peripheral figure throughout. Although the Gabon forward showed glimpses of his talent, laying on chances for Sokratis and Nicolas Pepe from wide positions, he touched the ball only twice in the Hammers' penalty area. In midfield, Arsenal were slow and ponderous, while a defence that included on-loan Flamengo defender Pablo Mari for the first time in the top flight was repeatedly caught out by West Ham's swift counter-attacking. The one element that pleased Arteta, is that his side found a way to grind out a victory when not at their best, with Leno excelling in goal and Ozil's intelligence coming to the fore for Lacazette's goal. ""The most important thing is to find a way to win. That is what the big clubs do,"" Arteta added. ""A lot of things need to improve. But let us just enjoy today. We have to take it game by game."" If this contest was between teams with disparate ambitions, West Ham's performance made it difficult to distinguish which side were struggling towards the bottom of the table. The Hammers' tally of five points from the past 27 available may well make for uncomfortable reading but Moyes will be delighted by the way his team carried out his instructions against Arsenal. West Ham were disciplined in defence, and the pace and power of Bowen, Sebastien Haller and Antonio ensured they carried a threat on the break. But for some errant finishing and wayward final passes, they could have claimed a notable scalp and three precious points. Bowen's early effort which grazed the right-hand post was a precursor of what was to follow, with Haller and Antonio denied by Leno when well placed and the latter also flicking a close-range shot wide just before the break. ""The opportunities were there to win and we didn't take them,"" Moyes said. ""I don't want us to be a hard luck story. I told my players I thought they played well but let's get rid of that tag. We can't let that happen again. We have got to be more ruthless. At this stage, I would rather we had not played well and won.""

196,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685401,Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford: Jordan Ayew proves the difference again for Roy Hodgson's side,"Crystal Palace recorded a third successive Premier League victory as they beat relegation-threatened Watford to climb into the top half of the table. Having scored the decisive goal against Brighton last weekend, Jordan Ayew proved the difference once more for Roy Hodgson's side as he converted his eighth league goal of the campaign with a smart finish from the edge of the penalty area after 28 minutes. Watford started much the better side at Selhurst Park but attempts by Abdoulaye Doucoure and Will Hughes failed to trouble Vicente Guaita. Palace, who also record a third straight clean sheet, went close through Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke's overhead kick during a scrappy second half which neither side was able to really seize control of. Watford captain Troy Deeney's powerful strike from outside the box forced Guaita to tip over the bar - the Palace goalkeeper also equal to Doucoure's header as the hosts held out. In a week when manager Roy Hodgson signed a one-year contract extension, Palace rise to 10th, four points behind fifth-placed Wolves. Although unable to build on last weekend's stunning 3-0 win over league leaders Liverpool, Watford remain outside of the relegation places, albeit on goal difference. Crystal Palace manager Hodgson's contract extension will see him remain at the club until the end of the 2020-21 campaign. That would see the 72-year-old enter a 45th year as a manager - and a fourth with the Eagles, whom he joined early in the 2017-18 campaign with the club rock-bottom after taking no points from their opening seven matches. Tying ex-England boss Hodgson down to an extra year was an obvious decision for Palace chairman Steve Parish, given Hodgson's consistent ability to guide the club clear of end-of-season relegation scraps, with 11th and 12th place finishes in last two years. Last season's tally of 49 points now appears a very realistic target with nine games remaining after another solid performance which typified Hodgson's spell at Selhurst Park to date and perhaps even sees Palace trade safety concerns for unlikely dreams of European football. Recent back-to-back 1-0 wins against Newcastle and Brighton epitomised the no-nonsense style with which Hodgson's Palace have repeatedly steered clear of trouble and this showing was no different as centre-backs Gary Cahill and Scott Dann protected Guaita with unrelenting determination. In an otherwise pedestrian start, Cheikhou Kouyate provided the energy in the centre to put some pressure on Watford's passing before Ayew's excellent finish kick-started the hosts. Ayew's eight league goals have been worth a significant 15 points to Palace's fight this season and, following a serious injury to loan signing Cenk Tosun, his continued contribution will prove crucial to how far Palace can go in the remaining games. Hodgson's side still face a tough run-in with six of the current top seven sides to come in their remaining games, but their recent form means they can now afford to enjoy those challenges. ""I'm delighted. We showed incredible character to dig in and defend valiantly,"" said Hodgson. ""We have every faith that this team won't get dragged in [to a relegation fight] and will maybe even start looking to push further up the table and get in behind one or two teams above us. I would be very surprised if that was to happen but I don't rule anything out because in football you're foolish to rule anything out."" Watford recorded the shock of the Premier League season so far as they produced a magnificent performance to end leaders Liverpool's unbeaten campaign in stunning style and provide a significant boost to their survival prospects last weekend. However, manager Nigel Pearson will be desperately disappointed that his side were unable to reproduce a similar level of performance against Crystal Palace to that which saw them swat the champions-in-waiting aside. The loss of Gerard Deulofeu to a season-ending injury this week comes as a huge blow to the Hornets and Watford's lack of incision against a well-organised defence only served to highlight his absence. Roberto Pereyra started on the left but failed to assert himself as the obvious replacement for Deulofeu, while Ismaila Sarr was unable to have the same devastating influence on the right as he did at Vicarage Road last week. On recent evidence, club-record signing Sarr could well be the spark of quality that pulls Watford to safety - the 22-year-old recording two goals and one assist against Liverpool - but his crosses struggled to find team-mates, while goal-scoring opportunities were few and far-between for the Senegalese winger against Palace. Deeney attempted to single-handedly pull his side level, a great strike from distance drawing Guaita into a great save, but substitute forwards Danny Welbeck, Ignacio Pussetto and Andre Gray failed to have an influence. ""We have missed an opportunity in many ways. We had lots of good situations to get shots away when we were actually trying to score the perfect goal. It's frustrating because we've played pretty well today and it's not gone our way,"" said manager Pearson. ""It is a disappointment but at least I can look back at it and know the players have been positive again. We've worked exceptionally hard. The players know they've done okay today but have not maximised the chances we had.""

197,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685404,Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City: Chris Wilder on Dean Henderson's England hopes,"Sheffield United's ""ambitious"" on-loan keeper Dean Henderson ""wants to be England's number one"", says Blades boss Chris Wilder after his three late saves secured a win over Norwich that boosts their Champions League hopes. The hosts looked in control when Billy Sharp headed in his third goal in four matches after starting only his seventh league game of the season. But with 13 minutes left Henderson had to dive bravely at the feet of Mario Vrancic to keep out a Ben Godfrey header and then blocked the rebound. The Manchester United loanee, who is yet to make his senior debut for England, then kept out a Jamal Lewis volley as the Blades made it 10 points out of 12 to go sixth in the Premier League. The 22-year-old was an unused substitute for England's Euro 2020 qualifying defeat by the Czech Republic last October. Gareth Southgate's side have friendlies against Italy and Denmark on 27 and 31 March. ""He's got enormous enthusiasm and ambition,"" said Wilder. ""He wants to be England's number one and, if he keeps playing the way he is, it gives him a great opportunity. ""I should imagine he'll be in the next England squad. He made some really important saves for us and we're delighted to have him."" While the Blades are now two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who play on Sunday, the defeat leaves Norwich still six points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table. The Canaries claimed their first win in five league games against Leicester last Friday before knocking Tottenham out of the FA Cup in midweek, but they now have just nine games to avoid an immediate return to the Championship. Both clubs returned to the Premier League this season after Norwich edged the Yorkshire club to the Championship title. While both sides have kept faith with the playing style and many of the players that got them promoted, they have had contrasting fortunes in the top flight. The Blades have been this season's surprise package in the Premier League, helped in no small part by the form of Henderson, who also spent last term on loan at Bramall Lane. The former England Under-21 keeper had no opportunity to show his England class against the Canaries until his late interventions. It seemed Norwich were destined to equalise when substitute Vrancic slid in as Godfrey headed goalwards from a corner but Henderson saved the initial effort then showed quick reflexes to palm the ball away as the prone Bosnia midfielder nudged the rebound towards the net with his knee. A combination of Henderson and David McGoldrick blocked Josip Drmic's follow-up, then five minutes from time the keeper was at his best again to block a firmly struck volley by Lewis. The saves ensured United held on for a deserved win, with Oli McBurnie and John Lundstram going close to adding to Sharp's goal, which came after Lundstram delivered a fine cross for the unmarked striker to head home. Blades boss Wilder has joked the team's end-of-season trip to Magaluf is the only continental trip he has on his mind but European football looks likely for his side next season - and before then Henderson could easily be off to the Euros with England. With 15 games left and Norwich six points from safety, boss Daniel Farke has said it would take ""maybe a miracle"" to avoid relegation. They picked up four points from their next five games thanks to last Friday's win over Leicester, and kept the feel-good factor going as 9,000 travelling fans watched them knock Spurs out of the FA Cup on penalties. Farke reverted to the side that started the Leicester win and the Canaries had a good chance to open the scoring when Teemu Pukki volleyed against the outside of the post from close range following an early corner. But it was the same old problem for Norwich as they continued to produce nice passing moves and enjoy the majority of possession without creating enough chances. The introduction of Swiss striker Drmic for Todd Cantwell at half-time saw them go more direct in the second half and that led to the late chances. It suggested the Norfolk side might be wise to continue that more robust approach in a bid to preserve their top-flight status with a late run of positive results. Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder: ""The wheels haven't fallen off again today. I don't know if they are going to in the future but they're showing no signs of it at the moment. It was a gritty performance, we just felt we were a bit better than them in both boxes. ""They played the second half with nothing to lose, a dangerous shape, and caused us a few problems. Thankfully my goalkeeper's made a couple of saves. ""Billy Sharp didn't play a lot of football before Christmas but understood there would be an opportunity for him and he kept training well. He looked after himself and he's reaping the rewards."" Norwich manager Daniel Farke: ""We should have been in the lead after Teemu's shot. Then there were 20 minutes when they put a lot of pressure on us and we reacted the wrong way. We sat deeper and deeper, and that's exactly what you can't do against Sheffield United. ""We showed great character in the second half and I still can't explain how the ball didn't go in during that situation. It's dramatic and tragic for the lads, because they tried everything. ""If there was an equaliser in the second half everyone would say 'great point away', especially after this week. It's a big setback in the fight to stay in this league but it's also important not to lose nerve and to stay calm.""

198,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685403,Southampton 0-1 Newcastle: Allan Saint-Maximin's ability is scary - Steve Bruce,"Newcastle boss Steve Bruce says Allan Saint-Maximin's ability is ""scary"" after the winger put in a match-winning performance at 10-man Southampton. Saint-Maximin scored the only goal of the game in the closing stages, pressuring Yan Valery into a mistake before tucking home beyond Alex McCarthy. The win moves Newcastle eight points clear of the relegation zone with nine games to go. ""I said when Saint-Maximin walked in he will excite people,"" said Bruce. ""His natural ability is scary. He has a bit to learn too, and if he does, if he sorts the other bits out, we have a hell of a player on our hands. ""He is always a threat, wants to get past you and that is a dying art. He has that natural ability in abundance."" Southampton had been reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Moussa Djnepro's yellow card was upgraded to a red following a VAR review of his foul on Isaac Hayden. But McCarthy had looked set to earn the Saints a battling point after making a stunning triple save to keep out efforts from Dwight Gayle and Miguel Almiron in the first half before then denying Matt Ritchie from the penalty spot. However, Saint-Maximin had the final say to secure a win that moves Newcastle up to 13th in the table, eight points clear of the relegation zone. Southampton, meanwhile, drop to 14th following a third defeat in their last four Premier League games. The win could not have come at a better time for Newcastle after a run of five games without victory in the Premier League had fans glancing nervously over their shoulder. They started the day five points above the relegation zone and in severe lack of form in front of goal after drawing blanks in their previous four league outings. It looked like that scoreless run would stretch to five games, although arguably through no fault of their own as they found Saints keeper McCarthy in inspired form in front of goal in the first half. He saved everything that was thrown at him, keeping out Gayle from close range and then two efforts in quick succession by Almiron on the follow up. Gayle was denied again with a point-blank header and when McCarthy stretched superbly to keep out Ritchie's well-hit spot-kick, it appeared that it was not going to be Newcastle's day. But in Saint-Maximin they have a player who is unpredictable but possesses explosive pace and strength and, in the closing stages, he stole the ball from Valery before placing a neat finish beyond McCarthy to ensure Newcastle escaped with three important points. Southampton have struggled for consistency this season with long periods of losing often followed by excellent winning runs. Four wins from five games in December and January had looked to have put them on course for a mid-table finish but Southampton have picked up just three points since the start of February. Their good form in the middle of the season is likely to be enough to keep them out of trouble as they sit seven points above the bottom three but they will be keen to arrest their current slide soon just to be certain. The home fans will feel aggrieved with some of the decisions that went against them in this game, although there can be few complaints about the red card for Djnepro. While his challenge was not malicious, his foot did land on Hayden's ankle and the outcome could have been much worse for the Newcastle man. Saints can take heart from how they battled for so long with 10 men and they will need to show those battling qualities once again with tough trips to relegation-threatened Norwich and Watford on the horizon. Southampton goalkeeper McCarthy: ""It's definitely a tough one to take. In the second half Newcastle didn't have many clear chances but it's a little error that has cost us a point. ""After the way the first half panned out, I thought we could stay in this. It's very disappointing to come away with nothing. It's frustrating. ""I've not had much luck with penalties but I ended up guessing. We haven't had a few results go our way lately. We have played well but it's a hard one to take."" Newcastle boss Steve Bruce, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We have a had a tough time, but it's been a good week. There is a marked improvement. ""The three players brought in in January have helped us. It has been difficult, but 35 points with eight to go is good. It's another one off, we are back running and again and it's decent.""

199,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685400,Wolves 0-0 Brighton: Hosts go fifth with dull draw,"Wolves moved up to fifth in the Premier League with a dull goalless draw against out-of-form Brighton. There was only one shot in each half at Molineux, with Brighton's Davy Propper drawing a routine save from Rui Patricio from distance. Wolves' Raul Jimenez hit a shot on the turn straight at Mat Ryan with 15 minutes to go. Leander Dendoncker went close to winning the game for Wolves late on when he shot over the crossbar. Brighton, who have yet to win in 2020, are now two points above the relegation zone. Wolves did not look their usual fluid self, although boss Nuno Espirito Santo denied that it was an indication of fatigue in their 47th game of the season. Only League One sides Oxford and Portsmouth have played more in England. Wolves would have gone fourth with victory, but fifth place could still yield a Champions League spot if Manchester City do not win an appeal against their two-year European expulsion. Most of Wolves' chances were from distance, with Ruben Neves shooting over on a couple of occasions and Raul Jimenez poking a shot wide. Jimenez had one of their best chances of the game with a fine volley from Willy Boly's long pass but it hit the stanchion behind the goal. They looked brighter when Adama Traore, who dislocated a shoulder in last weekend's win at Tottenham, came on in the second half. He had a hand in their only effort on target. Traore ran down the right and found substitute Daniel Podence. His effort was blocked by Lewis Dunk and the loose ball fell to Jimenez, whose shot took a slight nick off Adam Webster and Ryan saved. Wolves - who have only beaten Brighton four times in 32 league meetings - pushed for a late goal but none came, with Jimenez laying the ball off for Dendoncker to shoot over. This could yet prove a crucial point for Brighton, who are the only team left in the top four divisions not to win this year. This was their 10th attempt, drawing six and losing four. Graham Potter's side were well organised and kept their first clean sheet since that most recent win, 2-0 against Bournemouth on 28 December. They will need to match that resilience in their next five games, four of which are against Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City. Propper's shot from 25 yards was their only effort on goal, but they had several other chances. Yves Bissouma was especially bright with three of their four shots off target. Attacking midfielder Alexis Mac Allister made his debut in the second half - the Argentina international joined Albion in January 2019 but has spent loan spells with Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors. The 21-year-old was lively, with several dangerous set-pieces causing concern for Wolves. The visitors spent the latter stages pushing for a goal but struggled to create a clear-cut chance. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Match of the Day: ""We didn't perform so well, like we wanted. It was a tough game against a very good team. ""They were organised, but so were we. It was a game of not too many chances. ""It's about where we came from. We started three years ago and we keep on building, trying always to sustain the level of performance. I think today we didn't, and we have to improve for the next one."" Brighton manager Graham Potter told MOTD: ""It was important for us to keep a clean sheet. We took part in a game against a team with a lot of dangerous players, but we restricted them to not too many clear-cut chances. ""We did well. Defensively we're really pleased. It was a collective effort. With the quality they have they can put you in dangerous places. ""We took part in the game. We tried to play and attack when we could. We had opportunities but it wasn't to be. We move forward really positively with a clean sheet - we hadn't had one for a while. ""All the games in this league are quite brutal. We just need to keep working, fighting and preparing for the next game.""

200,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685406,Burnley 1-1 Tottenham: Sean Dyche frustrated after Clarets not given penalty,"Sean Dyche fears football is in ""dangerous territory"" after his Burnley side were denied a penalty in their draw with Tottenham. The Clarets boss felt Chris Wood should have been given a penalty after Spurs' equaliser, but the striker did not go down under Davinson Sanchez's tackle. In the end, Dele Alli's penalty after Wood's opener was enough to earn Tottenham a point. ""The game has got to be really careful now with which way it is going,"" said Dyche. ""If he [Wood] flails his arms and goes flying across the floor, I bet he gives it."" Dyche added: ""We are in dangerous territory here because if a player doesn't dramatically play act for a penalty, he doesn't get it. ""Chris did the right thing and stayed on his feet."" The Clarets took a deserved first-half lead when Wood tapped home the rebound after Hugo Lloris had spilled Jay Rodriguez's long-range shot. At that stage, Jose Mourinho's side looked completely out of sorts but the half-time introduction of Lucas Moura and Giovani lo Celso sparked the visitors. It was Lo Celso's superb through ball that forced a rash challenge on Eric Lamela by Ben Mee and Alli scored from the penalty spot for his 50th Premier League goal. In a frantic finish, Lo Celso almost scored with a curling 20-yard effort before Lloris denied Matej Vydra from point-blank range. The result means Tottenham have now gone five games without a win in all competitions - their worst run since they went seven without a victory in the autumn of 2016. Dele's goal was his first in nine matches in all competitions. The England man was used as a central striker by boss Jose Mourinho, who is trying to find a solution to the lack of striking options at his disposal following the injuries to Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Dele looked more of a threat once Mourinho changed the shape of his side at the break but he lacks the physical presence to unsettle Burnley's defensive pair Mee and James Tarkowski. Mee in particular was a commanding presence once Tottenham sorted themselves out after the break and ensured goalkeeper Nick Pope was not truly tested. The result leaves Tottenham four points behind Chelsea, having played a game more. Unless there is a swift reversal of fortunes, their four-year run of top-four finishes will come to an end this season. Predictably, Eric Dier strode into Turf Moor without a word, which was a wise choice given he still has the possibility of an FA charge hanging over him following his confrontation in the stands after Tottenham's FA Cup defeat by Norwich on Wednesday. Just as he promised, Mourinho picked the England man, who slotted into the middle of a three-man central defence that also included Toby Alderweireld and Davinson Sanchez. Equally predictable were the Burnley fans' unsavoury chants against him, or more accurately, his brother. Before and afterwards, the Tottenham fans sang in support of the 26-year-old. It was just Dier's luck that when he really wanted a quiet game, it was his clearance that resulted in Burnley's first-half goal. In fairness, Dwight McNeil's cross had to be cleared. Sadly for Dier, it went straight to Rodriguez, allowing the Burnley striker to get enough power into his first-time shot to make it awkward for Lloris, who gifted Wood his goal. Dier's evening did improve, particularly after Mourinho's double change at half-time, which involved moving him into central midfield. Had it not been for Dier's superbly-timed tackle on Burnley substitute Vydra, Tottenham may well not have come away with anything from the game. Dyche used his programme notes to add his thoughts to the general debate about the video assistant referee system. The Burnley boss is supportive of VAR, saying he is ""convinced it will become more streamlined the more the powers-that-be get used to the technology"". There will always be grey areas though. If McNeil's cross had gone straight to Wood, any goal would have been disallowed because the ball struck the winger's hand after a ricochet off Sanchez. However, because it was initially cleared, the infringement did not count. Burnley have nudged back into the top half of the table- and are unbeaten in the past 14 Premier League matches in which they have led at the break. Burnley boss Sean Dyche: ""A very rare mistake from Ben Mee and you wonder how it would affect things, but we gripped the game and I was really pleased with it. ""We build slowly, we are not the real deal yet. But I think everyone saw a good Burnley side here. ""In the second half, the referee changed his performance. Everything was given for very little, after their staff had a word coming off at half-time. Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho: ""The quality of Lucas Moura and Giovani lo Celso made a difference in the second half. I want to say but cannot say. We had something in the first half, not in the second. ""In the second we improved a lot. I think fatigue, Lucas and Lo Celso, Alli and Bergwijn had fatigue - they gave what you saw. Burnley's next Premier League game is away at Manchester City on Saturday, 14 March (15:00 GMT). Tottenham entertain Manchester United the following day (16:30 GMT) but before that, they will try to overturn RB Leipzig's one-goal first-leg advantage when they go to Germany for their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, 10 March (20:00 GMT).

201,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42940280,Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool boss fumes after Harry Kane penalty in Tottenham draw,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp claimed he would have to ""pay the biggest fine in world football"" if he vented his true feelings about Harry Kane's stoppage-time penalty that earned Tottenham a draw at Anfield. Kane - who had a penalty saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius minutes earlier - secured Spurs a point from a 2-2 draw after referee Jon Moss contentiously punished Virgil van Dijk's challenge on substitute Erik Lamela with seconds remaining. Klopp was angry at what he saw as the unjust loss of two points, after Mohamed Salah's brilliant injury-time solo goal looked to have given the Reds a win that would have taken them five points clear of Spurs. ""There were some real challenges in the first half, lots of moments when it could have been a free-kick but the referee said 'today that's the game, that's allowed' and then the softest touch in the whole game decides the game,"" he said. ""It is not a penalty, it is a situation. I am angry but I can't change things so what's my job? To create headlines? To get punished? To pay a fine? If I said what I think I would pay the biggest fine in world football. That makes absolutely no sense."" Liverpool were also angry at the first penalty award, when Kane was brought down by goalkeeper Karius, with referee Moss ruling Dejan Lovren's touch had played the striker onside in the build-up. Van Dijk, Liverpool's record signing, accused Kane of diving. ""I think it is a dive. You see him diving clearly and no-one is talking about it but I think it is a dive,"" said the Dutchman. ""There is a lot of discussion about whether it is offside, yes or no, but I think it was offside as well. ""You could just see him making that dive. The referee made his decision together with the linesman. It was good for us that it got saved."" Klopp was inconsolable as he clearly believed Liverpool had been denied the win by the late intervention of Moss and his assistant Edward Smart. ""I've heard Lamela was offside with one leg, running into Virgil van Dijk. Virgil sees him at the last moment, stops the movement but still touches him. Lamela is already on the way down,"" added Klopp. ""The referee says keep on going, and the linesman makes the decision. That's how it is. That's what everybody saw."" The second penalty was awarded by Moss on the advice of his assistant, adding to the frustration Liverpool felt after they thought Salah's second goal was going to prove decisive. Kane coolly converted his second penalty for his 100th Premier League goal. ""It's not about who is where. In the 93rd minute you whistle a penalty when you are 100% sure. There were no other incidents in the box apart from the Dele Alli situation, which was not given,"" said Klopp, after the England midfielder was booked in the second half for diving. ""It's clear in these situations the opposition wants to go down, wants to cause these type of problems. Cool down. But we have to accept it, I can't change it. But it's really hard to take."" On the second penalty, Klopp added: ""Did you see the linesman? He was immediately on his way. He was sure. I would love to blame the whole world but I can't blame Jon Moss."" It was the final act of a dramatic encounter in a thunderous Anfield atmosphere, with Liverpool holding sway and creating the better chances in the first half, leading through Salah's goal. But Spurs showed commendable resilience and calm to dominate large portions of the second half before Victor Wanyama struck a powerful equaliser 10 minutes from time, returning Karius' punch back into the top corner in front of the Kop from 25 yards. Salah's breathtaking Lionel Messi-style second looked to have settled the game until that late controversy which left Klopp cursing his luck and Spurs counterpart Mauricio Pochettino praising the character shown by his side as well as the officials. ""I congratulated the referee for showing that sort of character,"" Pochettino said. ""It was difficult to know at the time if they were right but in the dressing room I confirmed that they were right in every single decision. ""Sometimes we complain about them. I don't as I decided a long time ago to stop complaining. It's important to recognise when they are right because it's a very difficult job for them."" It was a match of high-quality between two sides swathed with positive intent and a draw was a fair outcome - although Klopp's dark mood suggested he would be very happy to have a long debate on that point. The results suits Spurs more than Liverpool because in the final reckoning the late action in front of the Kop ensured they did not fall further adrift of Liverpool. Kane's ice cool finish - testimony to his own strength of character after a poor penalty just a few minutes earlier - means the gap now stands at just two points. If the Premier League title has already effectively been decided in favour of Manchester City, then this thriller was evidence that the battle for those remaining top four places could go down to the wire.

202,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42849448,Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle United,"Manager Rafael Benitez felt Newcastle were victims of a ""soft penalty"" decision as fellow strugglers Crystal Palace came from behind to earn a draw. Mohamed Diame had turned home Kenedy's corner at the back post midway through the first half for the visitors. But Luka Milivojevic earned Palace a point with a second half penalty after Ciaran Clark was penalised for pulling Christian Benteke's shirt. ""He was pushing my player and my player was pulling,"" said Benitez. ""We cannot do it, but I can see a lot of penalties not given. We then changed everything because obviously they had more confidence and they were pushing, we knew that they have very good players up front. We needed to be strong in defence and it was difficult."" Former Newcastle striker and manager Alan Shearer also questioned the penalty decision on Twitter. ""If that's a penalty then there should be 10 penalties per game,"" he wrote. But speaking on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, former Premier League striker Steve Claridge felt the decision was much clearer. ""You can just see the shirt being pulled. Yes, it's a penalty. It's a definite pull on the shirt. Absolutely. A stupid, stupid thing for Clark to do."" The point lifted Palace up to 14th, with Newcastle remaining 16th but a point clear of 18th-placed Stoke. ""It will have to be sufficient for me,"" said Palace manager Roy Hodgson. ""The referee gave the penalty and I am just happy we scored it this time - the rules of the game prevent people from pulling shirts."" It probably should have been all three points for the home side who had more than 62% of the possession and 14 shots in the second half. Palace had also started strongly and Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow had to be alert to save from Wilfried Zaha and Benteke in the first half. But they will have to settle for a three-point cushion above the relegation zone with 12 games remaining after Milivojevic's fourth goal in eight games. ""The way we were playing in the first half I would certainly have taken (a point). After watching the second half and watching us dominate the game as we did, I feel we were unlucky not to have got all three points in the end because our second half performance merited that,"" said Palace manager Hodgson. ""It's a point that doesn't help either of us enormously but we've just got to make sure that when we can't win, we draw."" Palace have lost only three of their 17 league matches since a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle in the reverse fixture in October. And with that turnaround coinciding with Hodgson's arrival in September, it is the first time Palace have enjoyed clear daylight above the bottom three. But despite being fouled for the penalty, Benteke has now failed to score in all 11 of his league appearances at Selhurst Park this season. The Belgium striker did, though, provide a constant threat against the Magpies and was only denied breaking that home drought by Clark's 89th-minute block. Benteke also linked up well with his teammates, and with new signing Alexander Sorloth an unused substitute, the striker clearly remains a key element in Palace's survival bid having scored in the midweek draw with West Ham. Newcastle had to dig deep to avoid what would have been just a second defeat in six games, with the visitors indebted to goalkeeper Darlow and defender Clark. Clark was at fault for the penalty with a clear tug on Benteke spotted by the assistant referee, but equally his block from the Belgium striker ultimately secured what could be a crucial point at the end of the season. Newcastle's opener was slightly against the run of play as Ayoze Perez applied a crucial touch to help Kenedy's corner on for Diame to sweep home. ""We did well coming here and getting one point. We were controlling the game in the first half, the three offensive players they have, we did well in defence,"" said Newcastle manager Benitez. ""We had a couple of chances and the counter attack early in the second half could have changed everything. We needed to defend a little bit better."" Diame's finish was Newcastle's first goal in the opening 45 minutes since the now departed Henri Saivet found the net at West Ham on 23 December. Newcastle could have gone 2-0 up just before half-time as Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey blocked from the lively Kenedy on his second appearance for the club, before making a flying save to turn away Perez's effort not long after. But from that point in the 32nd minute until a late flourish, Newcastle did not register a shot at the Palace goal. New signing Islam Slimani was not selected due to an ongoing thigh injury, while striker Dwight Gayle has now not scored in his last 14 league appearances. Crystal Palace goalscorer Luka Milivojevic: ""Honestly I'm not happy with the point, after all the chances that we created and missed, in my opinion we deserved two (more) points."" Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow: ""First half we were very good and had a lot of chances, played some good football, second half they came back at us and we did well to hold on to a draw. ""We've shown we have got a lot of fight and can hopefully get out of this relegation battle. ""It was a sloppy five, 10 minutes from myself that could have been better. We have a lot of grit and desire and will go to the very end.""

203,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42849447,Liverpool 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur,"Harry Kane's penalty - converted with virtually the last kick of an enthralling encounter - gave Tottenham a vital point at Anfield after Mohamed Salah's brilliant stoppage-time strike looked to have given Liverpool victory. Liverpool had only seconds to survive when referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot after Virgil van Dijk collided with Erik Lamela - allowing Kane, who had missed an earlier penalty, to score his 100th Premier League goal and leave the home fans enraged. Salah's third-minute goal, scored after he intercepted Eric Dier's poor back pass, gave Liverpool a lead they held until 10 minutes from time when Spurs substitute Victor Wanyama lashed keeper Loris Karius' punched clearance back into the top corner from 25 yards. In a dramatic finale, Karius saved Kane's penalty after he brought down the striker, paving the way for Salah to weave his way into the area before lifting a finish over Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris at the start of five minutes of stoppage time. And after Moss awarded Kane a second opportunity from the spot, the England international placed his penalty into the bottom-right corner. It was a fitting end to a thriller and a result which will bring more satisfaction to Spurs as defeat would have left them five points adrift of Liverpool in the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Liverpool remain third in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Tottenham in fifth. When manager Jurgen Klopp set off on a sprint of triumph along the touchline in front of Anfield's giant Main Stand as Salah put Liverpool back in front in injury time, he thought he was celebrating a win that was opening up a crucial five-point gap between his side and Spurs. Instead, minutes later, he was left to reflect on the concession of a late equaliser that left Anfield enveloped in frustration. Liverpool's much-maligned defence had held firm for so long, but Klopp's switch to three at the back, when he sent on Joel Matip for James Milner in the final quarter of an hour, did not have the desired effect. Spurs played on Liverpool's nerves, although Karius, who remains an inconsistent presence, could hardly have expected his punch - when perhaps he should have caught - to be returned into the top corner of his net with such spectacular interest by Wanyama. Liverpool, and indeed Anfield, were suddenly on edge but relieved when Karius saved Kane's lame penalty. Then came that dramatic exchange of goals in a chaotic finale and the points were shared. Liverpool offer so much that is good when it is measured in goals and excitement, but that nasty habit of carelessness and conceding crucial goals has still not been cured. Liverpool's supporters were waiting to celebrate a vital victory after Salah's twisting, turning run into the area in stoppage time ended with a clever finish over the onrushing Lloris. It came just after Kane had missed the chance to give Spurs the lead from the spot when his uncharacteristically poor penalty was saved by Karius. And yet the cheers stuck in the throats as referee Jon Moss - who entered lengthy consultation with his assistant before finally awarding the first Spurs penalty - waited as Van Dijk tangled with substitute Lamela, looking towards his colleague once more before pointing to the spot. The Kop exploded in fury but Kane stayed calm and made no mistake the second time, beating Karius comfortably. Klopp was desolate as he was locked in conversation with fourth official Martin Atkinson. There was barely time to restart the game and Anfield instantly vented its anger on Moss after awarded Spurs two penalties in front of the Kop. Once the drama had subsided, this was a fair result between two teams who mix high quality, intensity and attacking intent with moments of vulnerability - leaving the top four chase as tight as ever. Spurs could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Eric Dier's carelessness let in Salah as early as the third minute, instantly evoking memories of their struggles when visiting other teams in the so-called ""big six"" in recent years. Mauricio Pochettino's side have not won away in the league against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United in 11 game stretching back to a 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in February 2016. And yet they can take massive encouragement away from Anfield after the manner in which they kept their composure and played their way back into contention after Liverpool dominated the first half. Spurs kept probing and even when Salah's second looked to have condemned them to certain defeat - seemingly even more of a blow after Kane's missed penalty - they gathered themselves for one late push that earned another spot-kick and a point. Pochettino's players have been accused of fluffing their lines on occasions like this in recent times. Here they deserve great credit. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""There were so many situations to talk about but the ref's decisions decided the game so I can't help but talk about them. ""I don't understand either of the penalty situations. The first one was offside and the second, I know already what the ref and his assistant will say. There was a touch, a little touch. But Lamela has jumped into him and wanted the touch and to go down. ""If the ref kept playing at that level then fine, but in the first half he wasn't giving fouls. Then for the softest touch of the whole game he decides it is a foul. ""In the second half we had to defend like crazy, they had to chase the game. We had counter-attacks, the high pressure was good and we put in some super crosses. ""We were a bit unlucky here and there but we had enough chances to win the game. And we would have if it wasn't for those decisions."" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: ""It was an amazing game to watch - two teams that always try to play exciting football. ""I was calm because the team plays so well. The feeling is we dropped two points. We were much, much, much better than Liverpool. ""Both were a penalty and it is not controversial. Sometimes people complain about the referee, but when they are right it is good to tell everyone. ""It was important, the character. When you analyse the game, it was always under control despite conceding the first goal. When you analyse the 90 minutes, Tottenham were much better. ""We always try to give our best. The team always shows personality and character. Today was a game we played for the win, and to change history you need time."" Tottenham striker Harry Kane after scoring his 100th Premier League goal: ""I was nervous before the second penalty. It was a big moment, with a lot of pressure, but I stuck to the routine. ""There was a lot of pressure, in front of the Kop. The first one, I did everything I wanted to and the keeper made the save. You've got to take the chances. I thought the second one was a penalty; the defender took out Lamela. ""The gaffer said at half-time: Play a bit quicker. We created some chances. Victor Wanyama scored a great goal, and if I scored the first penalty we probably would have won it. But there we are. I've had a good season in front of goal so let's see how many I can get now.""

204,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43444922,Mohamed Salah 'on his way' to Lionel Messi comparisons - Liverpool boss Klopp,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said Mohamed Salah was ""on his way"" to being mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi after he scored four goals against Watford on Saturday. Salah is now the leading goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues - overtaking Barcelona's Messi and Tottenham striker Harry Kane. But according to Klopp, the 25-year-old Egyptian is focused on his own game. ""I don't think Mo wants to be compared with Lionel Messi,"" he said. ""Messi has been doing what he's been doing for what feels like 20 years or so. ""The last player I know who had the same influence on a team performance was Diego Maradona. ""But Mo is in a fantastic way, that's for sure. As it always is in life, if you have to have the skills you have to show that constantly and consistently, and he is very good."" Yet in just nine months, Salah has scored 36 goals for the Reds - the most by a single player in their debut season at Anfield - and sits on 28 for this Premier League campaign with seven games still to play. Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes ""we are witnessing the start of greatness"". But such are Salah's similarities with the Argentine great, that even his goals are starting to resemble Messi's. It took just four minutes for Salah to open the scoring against Watford, jinking his way through the Hornets' defence and leaving Miguel Britos on the floor before firing home. It was eerily reminiscent of a goal Messi scored against Bayern Munich in the 2015 Champions League semi-final, when he left Jerome Boateng sprawled on the turf. But Salah remains humble about his talents, thanking his team-mates and saying a clean sheet against Javi Gracia's side was ""most important"". ""Mo is in a fantastic way, that's for sure,"" Klopp added. ""The boys love playing together with him, and he loves playing with them."" At 25, Salah has a long way to go to match Messi's achievements. He played in three Premier League games as former club Chelsea won the title back in 2015 and he was part of a double-title winning Basel side in the Swiss top flight between 2012 and 2014. The winger also helped guide Egypt to their first World Cup finals in over a quarter of a century when he netted a 95th-minute penalty in a 2-1 win over Congo. But Messi - who some say played in one of the greatest Barcelona teams of all-time - had already picked up six league titles, three Champions League trophies and an Olympic gold medal by the age of 25. He is also a five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Match of the Day pundit Martin Keown: ""He is causing carnage for defenders - the way he runs with the ball is so calm, defenders are falling over in front of him. ""He will run for anything. He is strong. He is a constant threat and he gets better and better. ""It has been a remarkable debut season for Liverpool - what would be his value now?"" Match of the Day pundit Shay Given: ""What a player he is - he looks like the complete player and the £34m Liverpool paid for him looks like an absolute bargain. It will be interesting to see if they can keep him in the summer. All the big clubs in Europe will be looking at him."" Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen: Scoring goals has always been regarded as the hardest part of the game. Mo Salah is starting to make me question that statement. Former England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker: Seems crazy to say that a £37.5m signing is an absolute bargain, but how much would Mo Salah cost now? What a player. Guy: Salah will be in a Barcelona shirt in the summer at this rate! Deldude: Phenomenal. That is how to describe Mo Salah. Took out four Watford players. I still weep every time I see that red shirt on him, it should be blue... Briyan: Salah recreating Messi vs Boateng genius there. The guy is absolutely lit. ",positive,liverpool,5

""It's tough for my players in particular,"" Pardew said. ""We got in a great position, made a couple of errors and got punished, which has been the story of our season. ""Without it being our last chance, it's nearing the last chance saloon. It was a galling way to end the game."" Jay Rodriguez looked to have set up Albion for only a fourth league victory of the season when he spun to hook in Salomon Rondon's downward header early in the second half. But Pardew's side lost their concentration amid a defensive reshuffle following the substitution of captain Jonny Evans, falling to a defeat that the head coach called ""heartbreaking"". Jordon Ibe took advantage as he cut in from the left to bounce a shot past keeper Ben Foster from 25 yards. Then Stanislas, who had been off-target with a couple of free-kicks from a similar distance earlier in the match, floated a perfect shot over the wall and inside the post from the edge of the area. Pardew played down speculation about his own future, saying: ""I get asked every week. When you're losing, it's difficult. I'm contracted here for another three years and I'm going to keep fighting until such time I'm told not to."" Few people seriously believe West Brom will avoid relegation after a dreadful winter, beset by abysmal results on the pitch and embarrassment off it too. Pardew, appointed to replace the sacked Tony Pulis in November, is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, with Leicester assistant manager Michael Appleton reportedly the favoured candidateexternal-link to take over. The important thing for Albion at present is to restore a bit of pride - and for much of the afternoon, they looked as if they would do that. A very disciplined set-up of five defenders and three deep-lying midfielders did much to frustrate the home side's attack; Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson touched the ball only four times in the first half. In addition, they were dangerous on the break, with Rondon seeing two first-half headed chances saved by Asmir Begovic. They looked fairly comfortable until Evans - feeling the effects of the illness that forced him to miss last weekend's home defeat by Leicester - was replaced with a quarter-of-an-hour to play. Pardew rejigged his defence in the substitution, with Matt Phillips taking over at wing-back. It gave Ibe the chance to equalise within seconds, and Stanislas' free-kick made it an even more painful day. Even then, the visitors might have saved a point in the seventh minute of stoppage time. Phillips headed a Kieran Gibbs cross towards goal in a scramble, but Charlie Daniels booted off the line. A post-Christmas run of seven league matches without defeat - including wins over Arsenal and Chelsea - had gone a long way towards lifting Bournemouth clear of trouble. However, a sequence of four matches without victory had allowed some unease to creep back in, and that was evident in a laboured display against West Brom. Eddie Howe's side struggled to create clear chances during the first 75 minutes, and were often left passing the ball sideways around 40 yards from the Albion goal in the vain hope of finding an opening. Joshua King had a first-half penalty appeal rejected when he went to ground claiming that Ahmed Hegazi had tugged his shirt, with referee Graham Scott unmoved. Before Ibe's equaliser, it looked as if that winless run would stretch to five matches for a team who, despite 17 efforts on goal, did not trouble Foster anywhere near enough until the closing stages. Howe acknowledged that his team did not play well, but they found a way to victory - and with 36 points to their name, they probably only need one more win from their final seven matches to secure a fourth successive Premier League campaign. The Bournemouth manager said: ""I'll take any way to win at this stage of the season. We played very well against Tottenham and Leicester and didn't win either of those games, but we didn't play well today and we won this one. ""I want as many points as we can get. We knew West Brom would make it tough. They've got a lot of experienced Premier League players but we had to find a way to win without playing well - it moves us closer to safety.""

206,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43353981,Huddersfield Town 0-2 Crystal Palace,"Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson hailed a ""vitally important"" victory as his side moved out of the Premier League's relegation zone and dragged opponents Huddersfield deep into trouble. With Southampton in FA Cup action and Stoke losing at home to Everton, Hodgson's side capitalised with a thoroughly deserved victory - their first in eight games - at John Smith's Stadium. ""We have had a difficult run of games and not got any points but to get something here at least puts us back in some sort of equilibrium,"" Hodgson said. ""I don't think I have ever had a feeling we are on a slide. We are getting players back to fitness and our squad is looking like what it was when we were getting results. ""All the points teams get down near the bottom are vitally important."" Palace were on top throughout and opened the scoring in the first half through James Tomkins' close-range effort as Huddersfield failed to deal with Luka Milivojevic's corner, earned by the excellent Wilfried Zaha. Having waved play on a few minutes earlier, referee Mike Dean did award a Palace penalty when Huddersfield defender Martin Jorgensen tripped Andros Townsend and Milivojevic converted from the spot. It took the hosts until nine minutes from time for their first effort on target, a tame strike by Rajiv van La Parra which was easy for Wayne Hennessey to gather. Palace moved two places up to 16th, with Town a place further in front but now just three points above the relegation zone. Palace had been winless in their previous seven league games, including losing their last four, and had conceded 15 goals during that period. But having kept only five clean sheets throughout the whole season, this was a welcome shutout and important three points against their fellow relegation candidates. Their performance was built on defender Mamadou Sakho's leadership at the back, displaying what Palace have missed as the Frenchman made just his 12th league appearance of the season. But goalscorer Tomkins also contributed significantly, making 11 clearances - more than any other player on the pitch - while young full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka was unmatched in making six tackles and winning back the ball 12 times. Palace have played nine games without winger Zaha this season and they have failed to claim a single point in those games. He returned from injury in last week's narrow defeat by Chelsea and made an impressive contribution in this game against the Terriers. His constant pace and trickery, with his darts down the wings stretching the play, caused the Huddersfield backline problems all game. It was the Ivory Coast international's industry which led to the first goal, as he won a corner which Tomkins converted at the second attempt. In all, Zaha made a total of 74 sprints, more than any of his team-mates. Zaha was taken off late on, but manager Hodgson said it was only a precaution as he had ""taken one or two knocks"" and the only way for Huddersfield ""to stop him was to foul him"". He added: ""He is so good at carrying the ball and we noticed that in the second half for us. He is an outlet for us. He got past people and drew fouls and that put us in their part of the field and gave our defenders a rest."" Striker Christian Benteke, though, also played his part with his hold-up play and by bringing team-mates into the action. On one occasion his lay-off fell for Andros Townsend but the winger struck his shot wide. Benteke was also unlucky not to win a penalty for his side when he was dragged to the turf by Jorgensen and when they were awarded a spot-kick, Milivojevic struck his eighth of the campaign. Huddersfield have big problems and are now in a real scrap to preserve their top-flight status, having achieved promotion for the first time last season. Although they have spent just eight days in the bottom three all season, they look like a side who will do well to stay up on this abject showing. David Wagner's men have now failed to score in their last four league games and have collected just seven points in 2018 - only bottom side West Brom, who lost to Bournemouth, have fared worse with four. ""Credit to Crystal Palace; they deserved this win,"" Wagner said. ""We were below par, particularly with the ball. ""There is no doubt about our attitude and effort - we fought - but in ball possession, we were not good enough. We were two steps too late today. ""It is important how you manage defeats and a disappointment like today. The good thing is that we know what we have done wrong and what we need to put right."" Visiting goalkeeper Hennessey had a comfortable afternoon in snowy conditions in West Yorkshire, not being called into action until the 81st minute when substitute van La Parra's strike rolled easily into his arms. Skipper Jonathan Hogg also had a strike in injury time, but again Wales international Hennessey had no problems dealing with it.

207,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43353969,Liverpool 5-0 Watford,"Mohamed Salah scored four goals as Liverpool moved up to third in the Premier League table by thrashing Watford at Anfield. Salah danced through Watford's defence to score early in the game before poking home Andy Robertson's cross late in the first half. He set up Roberto Firmino's clever flick for Liverpool's third, then added two late strikes to complete the rout. Liverpool have now opened a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth. Jurgen Klopp's side also remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. It was Watford's second successive defeat, and despite chances for Roberto Pereyra and Richarlison, they never looked like getting back into the game. But the Hornets are still eight points above the relegation zone and sit comfortably in 11th position. Before kick-off, Klopp insisted his side wanted to be back ""immediately on the winning side"" following the disappointment of their 2-1 defeat at rivals Manchester United last Saturday. And it was a more familiar-looking Liverpool side who turned up at Anfield as Klopp's men put in a performance befitting their manager's urgency. They started the game with high intensity - pressing their opponents and winning the ball back in midfield to set Salah on his way. It did not take long for the Egyptian to make a breakthrough. Within four minutes he had given Liverpool the lead and taken his season's tally to 25 in the league. Salah continued to cause Watford's defence problems and it always looked likely he and Liverpool would get a second, overtaking Harry Kane as the league's top scorer in the process. Robertson's inch-perfect cross from the left meant the second goal was a tap-in but Salah produced two moments of magic to dance his way to a hat-trick and fire in his fourth. Time seemed to stop as he evaded multiple challenges in the area and picked out the corner with a stabbed finish for his third before firing a strike high into the net for his fourth after Danny Ings' shot was saved. It was another masterclass from the Egyptian and his form mirrors Liverpool's as they head into the final stages of the season. The Reds are back up to third place in the table - with rivals Tottenham facing fifth-placed Chelsea in their next match. With seven games left to play, Liverpool look to have consolidated their place in the top four and can also look forward to a Champions League quarter-final with Manchester City. How Salah contributed to all five goals: His record-breaking stats: Miguel Britos scored a 93rd-minute equaliser for Watford as Liverpool were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw when these two teams met on the opening day of the season at Vicarage Road. Liverpool's defensive frailties - which allowed Watford back into the game in August - were on show against Manchester United last Saturday but there was none of the same at Anfield. The hosts never looked like throwing away the lead and, after scoring twice in the first half, controlled the game comfortably before Salah's late additions to the score. Salah's inclusion on the scoresheet comes as no surprise now but when he netted on his debut at Vicarage Road few would have predicted what success he would go on to have this season. Nor would many who saw that game have predicted a 5-0 rout for Watford in March but aside from two chances from Pereyra and Richarlison, they offered very little going forward at Anfield. Pereyra's fizzing free-kick hit the crossbar in the second half and could just conceivably have given the Hornets a route back into the game but, in truth, they never looked like matching their hosts. The determination the Hornets showed to come from behind in that opening fixture set the tone for a largely positive campaign which has seen them climb to 11th, eight points above the relegation zone but Saturday's thrashing will be a day to forget. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""It was very pleasing. It could have been really difficult tonight. We knew we had to be spot on from the first to the last second and our work rate had to be higher than 100%. ""The goals we scored were unbelievably good, and the boys didn't stop. That's how football should be, so I'm really happy with the performance. ""For Mo to be involved in five goals is fantastic but to score four is even more fantastic. His goals are so important for us. We have to hope they all come back well from the internationals. ""The clean sheet is very important. They lost a little concentration in the last few minutes but that's normal. It helps us in the goal difference."" Watford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We knew today was going to be a tough game. ""We conceded an early goal again like we did against Arsenal and after that it was difficult. We will try to do better next time. They were much better than us and congratulations to them. ""Mo Salah is one of the best players at the moment. We know we have played against one of the best teams in Europe. ""There are positives we can take, but we will try to do better next time."" Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 31 March (12:30 BST) hoping to consolidate their position in the top four. Watford will look to return to winning ways when they host Bournemouth at 15:00 BST on the same day. Formation  4-3-3 Formation  3-4-3 Match ends, Liverpool 5, Watford 0.

208,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409326,Chelsea 2-0 Manchester City: Champions lose in league for first time this season,"Manchester City were ""fantastic"" despite suffering a first Premier League defeat of the season at Chelsea, said manager Pep Guardiola. Chelsea bounced back from the disappointment of losing at Wolves in midweek to end City's 21-game unbeaten league run stretching back to April, and a sequence of 14 unbeaten games away from home. The defending champions paid for a lack of ruthlessness as they dominated the first half, only to be struck by a smash-and-grab right on half-time as N'Golo Kante fired high past Ederson from Eden Hazard's pass. Chelsea gained confidence and momentum and improved after the break, securing the win with 12 minutes left when David Luiz's glancing header following a corner bounced in off the far post. They closed out the win to give Sarri his first triumph over Guardiola, whose team are replaced at the top of the table by Liverpool. Despite slipping a point behind the Reds, the Spaniard rejected the notion his team had an ""off day"". ""If you think that, you didn't see the game,"" he told BBC Sport. ""In the first half, we were exceptional. ""In general, we were fantastic. I don't have any regrets. We came and showed we wanted to win. We created chances. They had one in 44 minutes and we conceded a goal. Sometimes that happens. ""It is emotional for me to see these players do what they do every three days. We were outstanding except for five to eight minutes."" City's multi-talented squad can cover almost all eventualities, but this was a game in which they sorely missed the marksmanship of the injured Sergio Aguero, and also Kevin de Bruyne's creation. Guardiola's side were on another level to Chelsea for the first 44 minutes but when chances presented themselves, as they did to both Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane, there was either hesitation or an inability to provide the final product that proved crucial. This is not a criticism of either Sterling or Sane but there was a lingering feeling that had the same opportunities fallen to the predatory Aguero, the outcome would have been different. City could not recover from Kante's sucker punch, and it was Chelsea who were the more dangerous side in the second half. Guardiola's men must now regroup after a defeat that will be a major disappointment but one hardly likely to set them back for too long. Kante's outstanding performance, including the opening goal, was vindication for Sarri's decision to play him in a new role this season. Sarri has been questioned for his decision to use Jorginho as the hub of his team while pushing Kante into a more advanced role out on the right - why have the player many regard as the finest holding midfield player in world football and not utilise him there? Sarri has stuck to his guns and this was a game - and performance by Kante - that added significant weight to his argument. The World Cup winner was magnificent, typically tireless but also getting into forward positions, most decisively when he arrived on the end of Hazard's inviting pass to power a finish past Ederson that gave the Brazilian no chance. It is certainly not the end of the argument, but evidence Sarri can use that he is coming up with the right formula. Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri: ""I am very happy with the win because it is not very easy to win against Manchester City or Pep Guardiola. I am happy with the mentality of the team in this match. ""It is difficult for us to find motivation but when we have it, we are a very strong team. Today we played with a very good level of application, determination and the right level of aggression. ""My players have to continue like this. We started well in the second half and in the end we deserved to win."" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: ""At this level and in the Champions League, the quality of the opponents means they only need a half a chance to score. That was the reality."" Both teams play in Europe in midweek, completing groups from which they have already qualified. City host Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Wednesday and Chelsea have a Europa League trip to Vidi on Thursday. In the Premier League, City's home game against Everton is next Saturday's 12:30 GMT kick-off, while Chelsea travel to Brighton at 13:30 on Sunday.

210,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409327,Bournemouth 0-4 Liverpool,"Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick against Bournemouth to send Liverpool to the top of the table - then handed his man-of-the-match award to team-mate James Milner. Former England midfielder Milner became the 13th player to make 500 Premier League appearances when he captained Liverpool against the Cherries. When handed his award after the game, Salah opted to give it to Milner and told Sky Sports: ""I will not take it. ""Congratulations on his amazing career. He deserved it today. I hope we'll win something together."" Salah scored his second hat-trick for the club since arriving from Roma 18 months ago as Jurgen Klopp's side went one point clear of Manchester City, who later suffered their first top-flight defeat of the season as they lost 2-0 at Chelsea. Salah was in an offside position when Roberto Firmino hit a 30-yard shot that home keeper Asmir Begovic carelessly pushed out in the direction of the Egypt forward. He finished clinically and his eighth top-flight goal of the season was allowed to stand to break the deadlock in a game the visitors dominated from the start. There was nothing fortuitous about the Liverpool forward's second though, a composed finish after driving at the Bournemouth defence, before Steve Cook backheeled the ball into his own net while attempting a clearance to make it 3-0. Salah then completed his hat-trick after rounding Begovic, cutting back to beat the Bournemouth keeper for a second time and poking the ball past Nathan Ake on the line. ""Whatever you do in a football game, you need somebody to finish it off and what Mo did with his two goals in the second half was exceptional,"" said Klopp after his side's fifth straight league win. Liverpool have taken 45 points from the past 51 on offer and are unbeaten in 17 league games in a run that stretches back to last season. The wins keep coming for Liverpool - and the goals are flowing once again for Salah. Having successfully negotiated a bruising night at Burnley on Wednesday, Klopp's side started a huge week by ruthlessly dismantling Bournemouth. Salah goes into Tuesday's Champions League must-win group game with Napoli having marked his return to the starting line-up by emphatically ending a three-match run without a goal. Bournemouth have every right to feel disgruntled about the former Chelsea player's first, with television replays clearly showing Salah was offside when Firmino struck the shot that Begovic spilled into his path. Yet the hosts can have few complaints about his second or third. Despite Cook's attempt to bring him down, Salah stayed on his feet to drive at Bournemouth's defence before producing a neat finish into the corner via a slight deflection off Ake. Cook's troubled game continued when the Bournemouth defender inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net following a cross by Andy Robertson, before Salah completed the rout. After shrugging Cook off the ball following substitute Adam Lallana's long punt forward, Salah dribbled into the box before tormenting Begovic and slotting home. After the game, Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Salah as ""one of the best in the world"". ""Salah looked very good, razor sharp and we struggled to handle him. He played more centrally and did well from that position,"" he said. While the headlines belong to Salah, Liverpool overcame the absences of injured defensive trio Joe Gomez, Dejan Lovren and Nathaniel Clyne to record a 10th Premier League clean sheet of the season before next Sunday's visit of Manchester United to Anfield. Bournemouth started the weekend seventh in the table - level on points with sixth-placed Everton - and with plaudits ringing in Howe's ears. Their climb from League Two to the fringes of European qualification in 10 seasons is nothing short of phenomenal, but the Cherries were second best all over the pitch against Liverpool. This scenario is becoming a familiar story for the Dorset club against the league's leading sides. Howe's team are regularly praised for producing attractive, progressive football - but their record against the top-six teams is extremely poor. Since the start of 2017-18, Bournemouth have lost 15 times in 17 games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United. The bad news is they still have to face Tottenham and United - both away - in the league this month. They were not helped by the absence of leading scorer Callum Wilson because of a hamstring injury, but the England striker would not have helped their defence - now without a clean sheet in seven league and cup games - contain Liverpool. This was a momentous day for Milner. With Jordan Henderson on the bench, Milner captained Liverpool to victory in a game in which his statistics were again impressive. Having covered 12.57 kilometres at Burnley in midweek - more than any other player on the pitch - the 32-year-old clocked up another 11.73 filling in at right-back against Bournemouth. There was one nervous moment when his misplaced first-half pass required Alisson to dash out of his goal to head clear - and in doing so, taking out Joshua King. But Milner was otherwise a reassuring presence in the back four, demonstrating his value to Klopp with his ability to move from midfield to full-back and give youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold a rest with Gomez injured. In fact the Yorkshireman found himself in the Bournemouth half as often as he was his own as he played a significant part in the 238th top-flight win of his career. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: ""I have many complaints. He [Salah] was offside [for the first goal]. It has a huge bearing on the match. We were fine until that moment. It changes the game. ""It was difficult for us losing Callum Wilson. We have to deal with players who aren't here and can't use that as an excuse. We still had a competitive team on the pitch.

211,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409328,Arsenal 1-0 Huddersfield Town: Lucas Torreira's late stunner sees hosts overcome Terriers,"Lucas Torreira scored a sublime bicycle kick late on to break Huddersfield's resistance and secure victory for Arsenal at Emirates Stadium. The visitors, who have slipped into the bottom three, had looked on course for a valuable point with a resolute defensive display. But on 83 minutes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang found room at the back post and deftly chipped across the six-yard box for Torreira to acrobatically volley in. It was a rare moment of quality from the hosts, who failed to create regular chances, despite Alexandre Lacazette having a goal disallowed for offside shortly before the interval. The France striker was replaced at half-time, with a slightly improved Arsenal scoring their 26th second-half goal of the season to extend their unbeaten run to 21 games in all competitions. The Gunners briefly moved into the top four but slipped back to fifth after Chelsea and Tottenham won later on Saturday. Arsenal manager Unai Emery has now made 14 substitutions at the break in 16 league games this season, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alex Iwobi replacing Lacazette and Stephan Lichtsteiner here. Once again the Spaniard's willingness to overhaul his side's approach paid off, with both substitutes stretching Huddersfield's backline and ensuring Aubameyang was less reliant on dropping deep to receive the ball. The Gabon striker was frustrated in the first half - his only telling contribution narrowly diverting Granit Xhaka's cross wide on 28 minutes - as he failed to link up effectively with Lacazette, who slipped when unmarked in the area and shot over the bar moments after Aubameyang's miss. Lacazette then rounded Jonas Lossl to slot in after running onto Mathias Jorgensen's poor backpass but he was judged offside from Aubameyang's initial header on. That was one of few flurries of promising play from Arsenal, the other coming just before the goal as Sead Kolasinac started to get in behind down the left. Even then it took a sequence of sublime skill for Arsenal to find a way through - Matteo Guendouzi finding Aubameyang with a well-judged cross-field pass, the striker touching it away from his man and turning to cross and Torreira applying a sumptuous finish. It was indicative of Arsenal this season - flawed but fun. They may not be able to rely on these second-half surges and impact substitutions for the whole season but there is plenty of grit and skill in this team. In spite of victory, Arsenal will be concerned by yet another injury to a key defender as Shkodran Mustafi was forced off in the second half after appearing to pull his hamstring. Fellow centre-back Rob Holding was ruled out for the season this week after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee against Manchester United. Adding to that dearth of options, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Lichsteiner picked up their fifth yellow cards of the season and will miss the Premier League match at Southampton next Sunday. It is also understood Arsenal do not have a recall clause in Callum Chambers' loan deal at Fulham, and the Gunners may have to field some makeshift defences over a busy festive period. However, Laurent Koscielny was on the bench for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in May and fellow defender Nacho Monreal returned from a hamstring injury to replace Mustafi. Arsenal will hope both can regain match fitness quickly. Huddersfield were content to let Arsenal dominate possession but constantly hassled the man on the ball, leaving the hosts visibly frustrated. A sedate start turned scrappy with a sequence of hard tackles by both sides, resulting in seven yellow cards before half-time. Xhaka, Mustafi and Guendouzi were booked for simulation, perhaps suggesting Arsenal's mounting desperation, from which the Terriers prospered. The visitors created some openings, if not many clear chances, with an unmarked Alex Pritchard clipping over from the edge of the area in the first half and Laurent Depoitre having a late penalty appeal turned down after what looked to be a fair challenge by Sokratis. Lossl had a fine match, making a superb diving stop with his left to deny a curling effort from Torreira. But ultimately a limited Terriers team could not cause Arsenal's defence many problems, with Huddersfield having scored just 10 goals in 16 games now - the fewest by any Premier League side. Arsenal manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport: ""It was a tough match, like many matches, and today it is important because we didn't have rhythm but still won. I'm very happy with the result. It was hard for us to control the match today. ""Patience is the key word. I wanted us to win more quickly but we needed to be patient. ""We can improve more and today we spoke that we want to win matches with more control. But we are very competitive and showed character."" Huddersfield manager David Wagner, speaking to BBC Sport: ""Obviously it is hard to take but I can see the positives. This was a proper fight which the players gave Arsenal. We did so many things right and limited their qualities. Unfortunately the result is what it is. ""We frustrated Arsenal, how the players did it tactically, and the shift they put in, was brilliant. Our tactics worked but unfortunately this goal was an unlucky one because the rebound and second rebound went to Arsenal.""

212,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409329,Burnley 1-0 Brighton: James Tarkowksi goal earns Clarets hard-fought win,"Burnley manager Sean Dyche said he was ""relieved"" after his team climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone with victory over Brighton. The Clarets were 19th before Saturday's game, and without a win in their past eight league matches, but James Tarkowski's fortuitous first-half goal was enough to win a tight game at Turf Moor. ""It was a hard-earned and hard-fought win,"" Dyche told Match of the Day. ""We thought we would have to dig in and we have done that. ""Performances have suggested we were getting back to that hardy edge that we know we have. We created chances but it wasn't about that today - it was about fight and spirit."" In a game of few chances, the Clarets took the lead five minutes before half-time as Tarkowski deflected in Jack Cork's shot with his chest. Brighton failed to get going until the closing stages and rarely tested Joe Hart, though substitute Jurgen Locadia did spurn a great chance late on when he headed fellow substitute Glenn Murray's cross over the bar from six yards out. Defeat leaves Brighton 11th while Burnley climb to 17th. Asked about his post-match emotions, Dyche said: ""I think a bit of relief, and enjoyment. We know we can play better but sometimes you have to grind. We did enough to get by."" On 13 December 2017, Burnley beat Stoke to move into the Premier League's top four. Almost a year on, this victory also gave Dyche's side upward momentum, but only out of the bottom three. Despite their position in the lower reaches, though, there is cause for optimism for Dyche, with his side back to their gritty best. The Clarets were much improved, controlling possession for much of the first half before making the breakthrough. By the time Tarkowski scored, Brighton keeper Mat Ryan had already made two good saves in quick succession to deny Chris Wood and Robbie Brady, while Hart did not have a save to make in the opening 45 minutes. The second half followed a similar pattern, with Brady's cross just eluding Wood at the back post shortly after the break, and Lewis Dunk forced to make a fantastic sliding block to clear Ashley Barnes' low shot. The hosts had to be resilient late in the game, Tarkowski and Ben Mee standing firm under a barrage of pressure as Burnley conjured up memories of their efforts in 2017-18. Victory is Burnley's first since a 2-1 defeat of Cardiff on 30 September and comes before back-to-back away games against Tottenham and Arsenal. After their impressive victory over Crystal Palace on Tuesday, Brighton should have been high in confidence coming into the game, but that did not seem to be the case. Their first shot did not arrive until the 19th minute, when Yves Bissouma drove infield and dragged an effort well wide, and they struggled to make an impression in the first half. They did improve after the break - having nearly 70% of the possession - but still did little to test Hart. In fact, their sole attempt on target did not come until the 93rd minute - when Murray had a header easily saved. Neither Pascal Gross nor Davy Propper, who were both so influential in midweek, were unable to have a real impact as midfield counterparts Cork and Ashley Westwood took control. But a position just outside the top half of the table at this stage of the season represents a solid start for Chris Hughton and his team. ""I thought our performance was really good,"" Hughton told Match of the Day. ""The only thing we were guilty of was having enough shots in the final third. On the balance of play I thought we were the better team."" Burnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to Match of the Day: ""It was a hard-earned win and hard-fought. We never thought it would come from being free-flowing. We thought we would have to dig in and we have done that. ""A goal is a goal. When you find wins hard to come by and clean sheets hard to come by, 1-0 is a very pleasing result."" Brighton manager Chris Hughton, on Match of the Day: ""I thought we were the better side. I thought we had the better chances in the game. We were up against a direct Burnley with a lot of physicality. I thought we dealt with it very well. ""They are a team that plays a certain way. You know on second balls they will be good and strong and that is how they got their goal."" Burnley goalscorer James Tarkowski, on Sky Sports: ""It was a tough afternoon. We had to get a goal and hold on. We know we have not been playing great recently so it was a massive day and big three points.""

213,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409325,Cardiff 1-0 Southampton: Ralph Hasenhuttl 'not disappointed' after defeat in first game,"New Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl took the positives from his first game in charge, despite Callum Paterson's goal giving Cardiff City a precious victory in the battle against Premier League relegation. ""I was not disappointed with what my team showed me, but that's the basics,"" said the Austrian, who has replaced the sacked Mark Hughes. ""The rest will come in the next weeks. ""It will be perfect if we get some results for the self-confidence. We didn't here, but we have to keep working and they will come."" Cardiff squandered several chances during a frenetic first half in which a vulnerable visiting defence looked there for the taking. Southampton appeared to have weathered that storm after the break but, as the rain came down at a raucous Cardiff City Stadium, they fell behind in shambolic fashion. A pass from Victor Camarasa ran harmlessly to Jannik Vestergaard, but the Saints centre-back inexplicably dithered on the ball and was dispossessed by Paterson, whose low finish dribbled slowly into the corner. ""It is very hard to accept that we didn't get a point, but with these mistakes we don't deserve it,"" Hasenhuttl said. ""We had a lot of pressure and we were good with the ball, but we played too much from deep and inside instead of penetrating them. ""We need more forward runs in the coming months and less mistakes in the defence."" Cardiff's fourth win in five home matches lifted them to 14th place in the table, four points clear of the bottom three. For Southampton, meanwhile, a 12th league game without victory leaves them second from bottom, three points adrift of safety. The size of the task facing new Southampton manager Hasenhuttl was underlined on Wednesday, when the Austrian watched from the Wembley Stadium stands as his side were soundly beaten by Tottenham. Dubbed the ""Klopp of the Alps"" because of his charismatic personality and emphasis on high-pressing, energetic football, the 51-year-old made his mark immediately with a first-team selection which showed six changes from that midweek loss. One of the players recalled, striker Charlie Austin, had three early chances but failed to make the most of those openings - putting one wide, one over and the other straight at goalkeeper Neil Etheridge. Those opportunities, however, were something of a false dawn. Hasenhuttl will have been concerned by his side's defensive frailties, particularly their vulnerability against Cardiff's counter-attacks. Even with three changes to their back four, the Saints defenders were often out of position and exposed by the pace of their opponents' wingers, Josh Murphy and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing. It proved the undoing of young right-back Yan Valery, taken off at the break after a chastening 45 minutes in which he was run ragged by Murphy and booked for a foul on the Cardiff player. As fragile as Southampton were, the hosts' inability to convert their chances appeared to lift the Saints' confidence in the second half. They started to hold the ball for longer periods and, after an hour, they had an appeal for a penalty turned down by referee Jonathan Moss as Stuart Armstrong fell rather theatrically following a challenge from Camarasa, with replays suggesting there was only minimal - if any - contact. Southampton offered little else as an attacking threat, and their defensive weaknesses eventually led to their downfall as Vestergaard - unconvincing throughout the game - crumbled under pressure from Paterson to hand Cardiff the winning goal. Cardiff may still be regarded by many as prime relegation candidates but they had given their survival prospects a real shot in the arm with three wins from their previous four home matches. What was particularly impressive about those victories was that they had all been achieved from losing positions, a combination of their tenacious team spirit and the rousing atmosphere inside Cardiff City Stadium. Cardiff manager Neil Warnock had joked in the build-up to this match that, while impressive, those comebacks were not good for his stress levels and general wellbeing. For once, however, this was not a match that Cardiff needed to pull from the fire. They had a host of chances to take the lead, with Harry Arter volleying tamely at Alex McCarthy before Murphy ran clear of the Southampton defence, only to be foiled by their goalkeeper as well. Cardiff looked most dangerous on the break, countering at speed with Murphy and Mendez-Laing - but their finishing was amiss. Warnock's men were also threatening from set-pieces, although their wastefulness looked like undermining their hopes of winning. But with a helping hand from Vestergaard, makeshift striker Paterson - signed as a right-back at the start of last season - provided the crucial finishing touch to score his fourth goal of the season. Cardiff manager Neil Warnock: ""We made it hard work. I felt we should have made it more comfortable with the chances that we had. ""I criticise referees a lot, but Jonathan Moss is the only referee who would have played advantage like he did for the goal. ""We know that we're going to get most of the points here - we've already surprised a lot of people - but we just need to keep our feet on the ground."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl: ""For a long time it looked like a 0-0. It was a very tough game for both teams. ""In the second period our performance was better and better. We had a few chances but in this best period we nearly made an own goal. It was a terrible mistake. ""The mentality was OK. We never gave up today. I have seen some good things from my team but we made too many mistakes today. We know that we have a hard and long way ahead of us."" Cardiff travel to Watford in the Premier League on Saturday, 15 December (kick-off 15:00 GMT) while Southampton host Arsenal on Sunday, 16 December (kick-off 13:30 GMT) in Hasenhuttl's first home match in charge.

214,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409331,Manchester United 4-1 Fulham: Hosts secure biggest league win of the season,"Manchester United recorded their biggest Premier League win of the season as they swept aside Fulham in a match Cottagers boss Claudio Ranieri described as ""11 lambs against 11 wolves"". The victory - United's first in five league matches - moved them up to sixth, while bottom-of-the-table Fulham have now conceded 40 goals in 16 matches. ""In the first half we were shy, we were waiting,"" said Ranieri after his fourth match in charge. ""Why? Why were we waiting? The first half was a warm-up. ""I want my team to play and fight for every single ball. We have to be stronger, more confident in our qualities. ""In the first half it was 11 lambs against 11 wolves. The wolves ate the lambs."" The hosts took the lead after 13 minutes when Ashley Young bustled his way into the penalty area and curled the ball into the far corner. Marcus Rashford set up Juan Mata for United's second, before Romelu Lukaku finished from close range from Mata's low cross. Substitute Aboubakar Kamara pulled one back with a penalty after he had been fouled by Ander Herrera, but Ranieri's side were soon reduced to 10 men, when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was dismissed for two bookable offences. England striker Rashford sealed United's victory with a powerful strike from a tight angle to beat Sergio Rico at his near post. This was the first time this season the Red Devils had won by a three-goal margin in the league, although they did beat Young Boys 3-0 in the Champions League in September. The last time they won by three goals in the league was on 15 January, with a 3-0 home defeat of Stoke. This was a welcome win for United after a derby defeat by Manchester City on 11 November that preceded three successive draws in the league - against Crystal Palace, Southampton and Arsenal. That had increased the external pressure on Mourinho, though his agent said on Friday the Portuguese was ""very happy at the club and the club is very happy with him"". Mourinho named World Cup winner Paul Pogba on the bench, as he was against the Gunners, while forward Anthony Martial was missing because of a hamstring injury. The United boss kept faith with 19-year-old right-back Diogo Dalot, starting a Premier League match for only the second time after his £19m summer move from Porto, and was rewarded with a fine performance. But United's first goal came from the other full-back - Young, who picked up the ball on the side of the penalty area, forced his way past Denis Odoi and curled home. Mata, who came in for Martial, was also excellent, scoring the second, then setting up Lukaku - scoring his second goal in 15 United games - for the third. Kamara lifted Fulham's hopes of a recovery with a controversial penalty after he was tackled by Herrera, who looked to have won the ball. But the London side were reduced to 10 men within two minutes of that goal, and from then on United dominated again and Rashford got the goal he deserved in the 82nd minute to complete a fine evening for United and Mourinho. For Fulham, the opening half highlighted their defensive frailties. They are the only team not to have kept a clean sheet in the top flight this season, and have now conceded at least three goals in a match in seven of 16 games. Ranieri will be worried by the ease with which his side were carved open for United's first three goals. The Italian, a Premier League winner with Leicester, made two big decisions at half-time - replacing top goalscorer Aleksandar Mitrovic and captain Tom Cairney with Luciano Vietto and Kamara - and was rewarded with a much better second-half performance. Kamara won a penalty and converted it himself, but any hope of an incredible fightback ended within two minutes when Anguissa was sent off. The Cameroon international seemed to be penalised harshly by referee Lee Probert when he was adjudged to have fouled Rashford, after being cautioned for an earlier foul on Lingard. With only 10 men, it was no surprise Fulham conceded again and Ranieri will face a very difficult task to tighten his side up in defence as they look to avoid an instant return to the Championship. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports: ""The first half was really good. We gave no chances to Fulham. We were strong, aggressive and intense. At times it was beautiful football. The first half was perfect. ""The second half was Ranieri's fault. He made two changes that improved his team and gave us problems that we didn't have in the first half. I also think there was some fatigue in some of my players. A few factors made the second half not as good as the first. ""We were intense without the ball and with the ball. Without the ball we pressed, we kept Mitrovic away from goal. With the ball it was simple, one or two touches. We were really good. ""We needed it. The last three matches we didn't lose, but didn't win. Now we have two away matches, then two at home. Let's see if we can get more points from those matches. ""The players have shown they can be a better team than they are. When there is solidarity in the team, everyone giving their maximum, you attract more positive things."" Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri told BBC Sport: ""The second half was much better but I have to consider if that was a down from Manchester United because they were winning 3-0 or we made a good performance. ""Go, play football. Then, if they score, it is normal. In the second half, we did. Why we didn't in the first half, I need to speak with my players. ""The response in the second half was positive. We played with more intensity, we were hungry, everything better than the first half."" Manchester United travel to Valencia in their final Champions League Group H game on Wednesday, 12 December (20:00 GMT). United have already qualified for the last 16 but can still win the group, although they need to beat the Spanish side and hope Juventus drop points at Swiss side Young Boys.

215,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409324,West Ham 3-2 Crystal Palace: Manuel Pellegrini targets top-six finish,"Manager Manuel Pellegrini challenged West Ham to push for a top-six Premier League finish after they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace at London Stadium. Second-half goals from Robert Snodgrass and Javier Hernandez and a sublime finish from Felipe Anderson gave the Hammers a third consecutive league win. Bottom of the table after losing their first four matches of the season, West Ham moved into the top half for the first time. ""We are now in position number 10, five points from sixth position,"" Pellegrini said. ""Maybe the first five teams have so many points that it's difficult, but we must go step by step and try to beat Fulham next week. ""I always look up. I never look down. I always tell the players they must have a winning mentality. They must decide to be a big team so we must be used to seeing what is happening in front of us."" James McArthur opened the scoring for Palace when prodding the ball past Lukasz Fabianski after reacting first to a James Tomkins knockdown. But West Ham were a different proposition after the break. Snodgrass curled in an equaliser from just outside the penalty box and Hernandez put them ahead after Wayne Hennessey could only parry Anderson's free-kick. West Ham's top scorer added a superb third, finding the top right corner from 20 yards - his sixth goal of the season. Although Palace reduced the deficit courtesy of Jeffrey Schlupp's header, they fell to 16th in the table. In the build-up to this contest, Pellegrini was at pains to point out the progress his side have made after their dismal start to the season. Since then, their form has been more that of a top-six outfit, and they have now won three games in succession for the first time since December 2016. Pellegrini's side have lost only once in seven outings and appear to be displaying the signs of a team that have hit their stride after integrating nine summer signings. The balance and shape of the team is now established, allowing Anderson - recruited for a club record £36m from Lazio in the summer - to flourish. A peripheral figure during the opening weeks, the Brazilian winger has become a key player and has scored five goals in his past six games. He had more sprints than any other player on the pitch on Saturday (21), and his pace was a concern throughout to promising Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Anderson delivered the coup de grace for West Ham, his effort proving decisive in the face of a Palace fightback. Having made a bright start, Palace could have led 2-0 had Luka Milivojevic's wonderful free-kick not smashed against the crossbar at the end of the first half. That proved a pivotal moment as West Ham overturned their one-goal deficit within three second-half minutes. Roy Hodgson's team have collected only one point and conceded 13 goals in their past six away games. They simply had too few answers here, particularly in front of goal, mustering just four shots on target. Wilfried Zaha looked bereft of confidence, twice passing up opportunities to shoot in favour of trying to work a better opening - losing possession on both occasions. The Ivory Coast international has failed to score in 10 league matches. There were pockets of good play and two goals - as many as they had managed in their previous 540 minutes of football - but all it delivered was a feel of respectability to the final score. ""We lost. I am not sure what assessment to make,"" Hodgson said. ""After they equalised we started to play better and had good control, but after the free-kick and strike from Anderson we find ourselves 3-1 down. ""We continued to ask questions but the two goals after the equaliser did for us."" West Ham's next Premier League assignment is away at Fulham on Saturday 15 December (17:30 GMT).

216,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409330,Leicester City 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Son Heung-min and Dele Alli secure comfortable win,"Tottenham retained third place in the Premier League with a comfortable victory over a flat Leicester at the King Power Stadium. With Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both rested, Spurs initially struggled to break down the hosts until Son Heung-min's superb strike just before the break. The South Korea forward cut in from the right and hit the top corner with a curling left-footed shot from outside the area. The impressive Dele Alli then headed in Son's weighted cross after a flowing counter-attack to put the game beyond Leicester. Spurs had dropped to fifth after wins for Chelsea and Arsenal earlier on Saturday, but have moved back above their London rivals and are five points behind Manchester City in second, with leaders Liverpool a point further in front. Tottenham now have 36 points after 16 matches, their highest ever tally at this stage in a Premier League season. Leicester stay ninth despite an end to their six-match unbeaten run in the league. It is perhaps a mark of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino's trust in the likes of Alli, Son and Lucas Moura that he felt able to leave Kane and Eriksen out of the starting side. Spurs' crucial Champions League group game away at Barcelona on Tuesday explains Pochettino's selection here, but this was still an important game against an in-form Leicester side, with the risk that the visitors could fall behind others near the top of the table. But unlike the decision not to start Toby Alderweireld in the derby defeat by Arsenal last week, this gamble paid off as Alli, Moura and Son's blend of pace and skill proved too much for Leicester. Alli and Son provided the only sparks in an otherwise uninspiring first half - the former twice dancing through the Leicester defence only to be denied at the last, and the latter breaking the deadlock with a wonderful strike, the first either side had managed on target. Collecting a short pass from Serge Aurier on the right-hand edge of the box, Son feinted past Nampalys Mendy to create space before curving a terrific strike beyond Kasper Schmeichel. Son's start to the season was disrupted by his successful attempt to avoid military service in helping South Korea win the Asian Games, and he subsequently struggled for form. But he has been vital for Spurs recently, with three goals and three assists now in his last six league games. Alli, meanwhile, has seen his season interrupted by injuries, but he was back to near his best here, drifting between the lines and capping a fine showing with a goal - his 50th in all competitions for Tottenham. Moura brought the ball forward as Spurs worked a three-on-two, sliding it left to Son, who took his time, fashioned some room and picked out Alli with a terrific cross that the England midfielder met with a diving header past Schmeichel. Eriksen and Kane did both enter the game in the final 25 minutes - replacing Moura and Son respectively - but by then Tottenham were coasting to victory. It was ultimately Leicester who were negatively affected by the absence of a talismanic English striker. With Jamie Vardy missing his second straight game due to a groin problem, Kelechi Iheanacho rarely troubled Tottenham's experienced centre-back pairing of Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. The Foxes had more success early on playing through their quick, skilful wingers Demarai Gray and James Maddison, who were able to play in full-backs Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell as they made surging runs on the overlap. Yet the final cross or cutback was lacking each time, while Vertonghen also made several crucial interceptions and blocks. Substitute Rachid Ghezzal provided some impetus after replacing Iheanacho on 56 minutes, but could not beat Hugo Lloris with a curling effort late on after cutting inside Harry Winks. Leicester were largely solid in defence, with captain Wes Morgan making a brilliant saving tackle to deny Alli as he ran through on goal. Overall, the Foxes are on a curious run - tough to beat but struggling to break teams down, having had to settle for draws against Brighton, Burnley and Fulham in recent weeks. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport: ""A very solid performance, I'm very pleased. ""It was an unbelievable moment and a great goal by Son. It was very important for our confidence to go into the second half believing we could win. ""I am bit surprised the Premier League put us in the position of playing at this time because we travel to Barcelona on Monday and that will be so tough. ""We didn't receive the help we needed from the Premier League but we are going to be ready to fight in Barcelona."" Leicester manager Claude Puel, speaking to BBC Sport: ""We started very well and it was a shame because we wasted good opportunities without the good clinical edge, the right pass or the right control. ""With more calm and more quality we could have had more opportunities in the first half. We were disappointed about our lack of clinical precision with the ball. ""We deserved to compete to the end against this team because it was a good start and we had good play."" Tottenham face Barcelona at the Nou Camp in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) before hosting Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, 15 December (15:00).

217,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47130048,Mohamed Salah: Forward enters Liverpool record books with fastest 50 goals,"Jurgen Klopp called it a ""wow"" moment, Mohamed Salah described it as ""special"". The Egyptian's decisive strike - running from his own half to score with 10 minutes left as Liverpool came from behind to win 3-1 at Southampton - was hugely important for the title race. It puts the Reds back above Manchester City, albeit having played one game more. But the goal also had significance for another reason. It was Salah's 50th strike for Liverpool in the Premier League, becoming the quickest Anfield player to reach that landmark, taking the record previously held by Fernando Torres. So where does Salah rank among the Reds' greatest Premier League forwards? BBC Sport takes a look at his statistics and why he is fast becoming one of Liverpool's deadliest goalscorers. The speed at which Salah has amassed Premier League goals for Liverpool leaves him in good company among the top-flight's greatest strikers. A return of 50 goals in 69 games means he is third on the all-time list, behind only the league's overall top scorer Alan Shearer (who spent his Premier League career with Blackburn and Newcastle) and Ruud van Nistlerooy (Manchester United). The 26-year-old already holds the record for most goals (32) in a 38-game season, beating the likes of Shearer (Blackburn in 1995-96), Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, 2007-08) and Luis Suarez (Liverpool, 2013-14). He beat England captain Harry Kane to the Golden Boot award in 2018 and he is second in the Premier League top scorers list again this season with 18, one behind Manchester City's Sergio Aguero. Salah is one of just eight Liverpool players who have reached a half-century of Premier League goals and by achieving the feat in 69 games has beaten Torres' previous record of 72 matches. Torres was one of the Reds' most prolific scorers - netting 65 league goals in 102 appearances - and only Salah (44) has scored more in all competitions in his debut season than the Spaniard (33). Salah's record-breaking debut campaign was capped by the Premier League player of the year award - only Suarez and former England international Michael Owen had previously won it as Liverpool players. He has gone on to pick up four Premier League player of the month awards, which only former captain Steven Gerrard (six) can better. The Egyptian has been unable to surpass all-time leading Liverpool scorer Ian Rush's record of 44 goals in a calendar year - though he equalled Roger Hunt and Robbie Fowler's tally of 37 in 2018. All good forwards are a threat in any position but Salah's trademark is his runs in behind and he's scored 47 of his 50 league goals from inside the box. He also likes to cut in from the right wing and has scored 41 goals with his left foot. Salah is at his most dangerous on the stroke of half-time - scoring 18% of his goals in the last five minutes of the opening half, including stoppage time. His single goal in added time was a brilliant strike in the 91st minute of a 2-2 draw with Tottenham in February 2018. Surprisingly, Salah hasn't been as prolific against the bigger teams. He has only scored once against the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United in the league and scored one goal in a 1-1 Merseyside derby draw with Everton in December 2017. Watford are Salah's favourite opponents. He has scored six times against them - including a four-goal rout in a ruthless 5-0 victory in March last year, and one on his Reds debut at Vicarage Road in August 2017. He is more likely to score in front of the home fans as he's netted 29 of his goals in the Premier League at Anfield. And if fellow forward Sadio Mane passes Salah the ball, there's a good chance he will score then too, with the Senegal international providing the most assists (seven) out of all his Liverpool team-mates. Chief football writer Phil McNulty: Mohamed Salah's 50 Premier League goals in 69 Liverpool games is an impressive achievement made even better when you consider his previous struggles at Chelsea. Salah's 44 goals in his first season at Anfield following his move from Roma eclipsed all expectations, probably even his own and those of Reds manager Jurgen Klopp. And while he has arguably not quite touched those heights this season, the Egyptian is still on course for another outstanding total as Liverpool chase their first title in 29 years. He has shown great consistency and is a huge weapon but he still needs to show greater longevity before he can be ranked among Anfield's great goalscorers. This is not to say he will not go to that level given a fair run, but as yet he does not bear comparison with the likes of Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen in that regard - and certainly nowhere near the great Ian Rush, whose record-breaking career straddled the pre- and post-Premier League era and spearheaded domestic and European glory. That trio - and those with longer memories will also quote Roger Hunt - played their part in helping Liverpool win trophies. That is something Salah has yet to achieve - although he will hope to correct that this season. His goal against Southampton may go on to prove one of his most crucial for the club - and it was certainly a breathtaking moment. Here are some of the other goals that have defined Salah's Anfield career so far. August 2017: Watford 3-3 Liverpool - Salah scores on his debut December 2017: Liverpool 1-1 Everton - Salah's only Merseyside derby goal so far March 2018: Liverpool 5-0 Watford - Salah becomes the first Egyptian to score a hat-trick in the Premier League December 2018: Bournemouth 0-4 Liverpool - Salah's hat-trick sends Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table ",positive,liverpool,17
218,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47742713,Southampton 1-3 Liverpool: Reds return to the top of Premier League table,"Mohamed Salah scored a brilliant solo goal as Liverpool came from behind to beat Southampton at St Mary's and return to the top of the Premier League. Liverpool were in danger of dropping vital points with the score level at 1-1 with 10 minutes remaining, before Salah clinically ended his run of six league games without a goal. With Southampton defenders backing off, the Egyptian ran half the length of the pitch before firing past Angus Gunn with his left foot. Liverpool substitute Jordan Henderson sealed victory late on with a close-range finish. Shane Long had handed Saints an early lead with a composed strike from inside the area but Naby Keita headed the visitors level with his first goal for the club before the break. The result sees the Reds leapfrog Manchester City yet again - the 25th time the lead has changed hands this season. Liverpool have a two-point gap at the top, although defending champions City have a game in hand with six matches left to play. Southampton remain in 16th place, just five points above the relegation zone. Jurgen Klopp's side have the best away record in the league but they got off to a poor start when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's flick-on found an unmarked Long to finish well inside the area. Southampton executed their game plan well after taking the lead by defending deep as Liverpool attempted to play through them. Their biggest threat came from wide areas and the right foot of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who delivered a sensational cross for Keita to convert off the back of Jannik Vestergaard. The Reds continued to dominate the ball after the break with 70% possession but they were limited to just one shot on target before Salah struck his 50th Premier League goal in 69 appearances. Only Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy have reached the landmark in fewer matches. Salah was influential as Liverpool secured three points in injury time against Tottenham in their last outing, and their persistence in the latter stages of matches is no fluke. Liverpool have scored 20 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season, more than any other side, and they have also won a league-leading 16 points from losing positions. If the Reds are to deliver a first league title since 1990, their undying spirit at the death could tip the balance in their favour. Southampton remain five points clear of the danger zone but they were poised to claim a surprise point against the title challengers. Ralph Hasenhuttl has turned the tide since taking charge at St Mary's and the hosts produced a disciplined defensive display to limit a side that has scored 85 goals to just five shots on target. Vestergaard and Maya Yoshida made 10 clearances apiece, while the latter epitomised the Southampton mentality when he leapt off the ground to block Roberto Firmino's shot with the goal at his mercy. However, with the game in the balance and Liverpool struggling to carve out many clear-cut opportunities, the home defence backed off and gave Salah the room he needed to strike the decisive blow. On-loan Saints striker Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, was replaced in the Southampton line-up by Irishman Long, who was making his first league start since February. Long handed his side the perfect start when he also struck his 50th Premier League goal with a cool finish as the visitors started slowly. Only five teams have scored fewer goals than Southampton this season, but with Ings set to return and Long back among the goals, they are well placed to pick up the results needed to stay in the top flight. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: ""I knew it would be difficult. Southampton have been well-organised. We scored two wonderful goals. ""The season is intense for everyone. You have an opportunity to make really good changes - Milner and Henderson helped. They were aggressive in a really important way. You could see them pushing the boys. ""Southampton had to suffer in the second half because of the first-half tempo. Difficult away game, 3-1 is a perfect result. ""What a goal [from Salah]. He couldn't pass because Firmino couldn't get into the right position. The defender could not concentrate on Mo. Wow, what a goal. A good moment. Naby Keita's first goal for the club in a crucial moment."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: ""We saw a very interesting game today. Our team scored very early so it was a long way to the end to get a point or three. ""We showed it is not so easy if we have a plan and surprise them and can cause problems against the big teams. They know this, believe in this and the guys showed up. ""There was a crucial chance for Shane Long for 2-0 and then it would be very interesting, they were struggling at that point. Then we would have had a chance for a point. ""Their first goal was offside and the second we did not react well. We cannot make such a mistake from this position. They have a counter from our shot and it was too easy. We showed in the second half we are brave and we wanted to win the game. ""We have to pay attention and not fear the moment. The team believes, that is important, and know now that teams are coming where we must take the points.""

219,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47842974,Crystal Palace 1-3 Man City: Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus secure comfortable win,"Raheem Sterling scored twice against Crystal Palace to inspire Manchester City to a ninth straight Premier League win after a dominant performance at Selhurst Park. The impressive victory briefly lifted Pep Guardiola's side, who had started the day second in the table, one point clear to the top. However, Liverpool returned to the summit after beating Chelsea 2-0 in the late kick-off at Anfield, leaving City, who have one game in hand, two points behind the Reds with five games remaining in this fascinating title race. Sterling opened the scoring after Kevin de Bruyne's beautifully weighted pass saw his team-mate outsprint Patrick van Aanholt before an exquisite finish beyond Vicente Guaita. England winger Sterling's instinctive finish after Leroy Sane's pass doubled the lead. Palace, who are 11 points above the relegation zone, reduced the deficit through Luka Milivojevic's late free-kick before substitute Gabriel Jesus made it 3-1 with a smart finish. City were forced to endure one or two nervy moments after Milivojevic's 12th top-flight goal this season gave the home side hope but, in truth, the visitors were superior from start to finish. Having looked ordinary edging past Brighton in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend before losing in the Champions League at Tottenham on Tuesday, Guardiola's side returned to their majestic best in south London. De Bruyne, left out against Spurs in midweek, sparkled on his return to the starting line-up but it was Sterling who caused the real damage, scoring more than once away from home for the first time in his City career. He could even have scored his third hat-trick in five weeks for club and country but, after firing wide from eight yards in the 10th minute, quickly atoned. He showed electrifying pace to open the scoring after De Bruyne's perfect pass and Palace were fortunate to only be 1-0 behind at the interval as they found themselves under relentless pressure. Guaita produced a palm-stinging save to keep out Sane while Palace's Spanish keeper had to make a smart stop to prevent Martin Kelly scoring an own goal before Sterling made it 2-0, finishing off a lovely move that involved David Silva and Sane. The only minor disappointment for City, who had Benjamin Mendy making his first league start since November, was that they were unable to make it five league wins without conceding in a row. With Jesus' late strike giving the score a more reflective look, City will head into Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg in confident mood as they look to overturn a one-goal deficit and stay on course for an unprecedented quadruple. Palace stunned City with a 3-2 win at Etihad Stadium in December but they rarely looked like repeating such heroics in front of their own fans. They offered very little as an attacking threat while their midfield, disrupted by the early loss to injury of Jeffrey Schlupp, found itself overpowered as Silva was repeatedly allowed space to create chances. In addition, Christian Benteke made little impact and was unable to do his former club Liverpool a favour on his first league start for two months. Although his side are not mathematically safe, Palace boss Roy Hodgson can start planning for a seventh successive season in the Premier League. His side have beaten City, knocked Tottenham out of the FA Cup and held both Arsenal and Manchester United this season. However, their home form has been a concern. This was their ninth home league defeat - only relegated Huddersfield have a worse record in front of their own fans - and Palace will be keen to put that straight next season. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: ""Today's game was really good after the Champions League defeat - the stage was not easy. ""We play December, January, February - every three days one game. Why not trust the guys to do it again. We have the personality for the games. ""I knew we would produce a good performance."" Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson: ""We got better as the game went on and in the second half we gave it a good shot. ""When you go on the counter-attack looking for an equaliser you concede a goal. We weren't good enough to dent City's progress. ""Keeping a ball and stopping them from playing around you... we did the best job we could. Had we gone hell for leather then they would have gone behind and around us."" Palace have a week to dust themselves down and prepare for next Sunday's London derby at Arsenal (16:00 BST kick-off) while City will attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Tottenham on Wednesday in the Champions League quarter-final return leg at Etihad Stadium (20:00).

220,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55575719,Bruno Fernandes: Is Man Utd midfielder the best signing made in January?,"It has been a year since Bruno Fernandes signed for Manchester United and his arrival has ""single-handedly"" changed the fortunes of the club, according to one pundit. Prior to Fernandes joining from Sporting Lisbon for £47m in last season's January transfer window, the Red Devils had suffered back-to-back to defeats and were in fifth place in the league, a huge 30 points adrift of eventual Premier League champions Liverpool. A remarkable turnaround now sees United second in the table and fans dreaming of title 21 in 2021, although those hopes were hit by Wednesday's 2-1 home defeat by Sheffield United. BBC Sport assesses the impact the midfielder has had in his year at Old Trafford and, despite being at the club for just 12 months, asks if it merits him being the Premier League's best January signing. You can vote for who you think is the Premier League's best January signing at the bottom of the page. On 22 January 2020, United had been embarrassed 2-0 at home by Burnley and jeered off at full-time by their own fans. The result left manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer clinging on to his job after a performance he said was ""not good enough"". Eight days later, Fernandes joined from Sporting Lisbon and few could have envisaged the upturn in form he has produced. Since his debut, Fernandes has scored 28 times in all competitions - more than any other Premier League player - and he has also provided 17 assists, which means his total goal involvement of 45 is better than any Premier League player in that period. Only Fifa Best winner Robert Lewandowski, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have more goal involvements in Europe's top five leagues than Fernandes since he signed for United. Boss Solskjaer said after he netted his first goal against Watford: ""He felt like a presence in the group from the first minute, a bit of a mix between Paul Scholes and Juan Sebastian Veron - the temperament of Veron and a lot of the quality of Scholesy."" That quality saw Fernandes win four Premier League player of the month awards in 2020 - the first man to take the accolade four times in a calendar year. In comparison, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Frank Lampard and Alan Shearer won four player of the month awards in their entire careers in this country. Fernandes' impact has been likened to that of club legend Eric Cantona, whose entrance was the missing piece in ending United's 26-year wait for a title back in 1992-93. Former England striker Alan Shearer said: ""Fernandes' arrival transformed the whole team, not just by his own skill and ability to find a killer pass, but because his presence seemed to add an extra 10% to every other United player too."" Ex-England midfielder Jermaine Jenas feels Fernandes ""has single-handledly picked this team up and dragged them"" up the league. On Sunday Fernandes was on the bench for the FA Cup fourth-round tie against rivals Liverpool, but came on in the second half and scored the winning goal with a superb free-kick. Former England striker Ian Wright said: ""When he came on he made a massive difference because he is a top-quality player."" Patrice Evra - Monaco to Man Utd (£5.5m, 2006) One of the best left-backs of the Premier League era. Made 379 appearances for the club and won five league titles, the Champions League and three League Cups. Nemanja Vidic - Spartak Moscow to Man Utd (£7m, 2006) Another shrewd piece of winter business by Manchester United, as Serbia defender Vidic went on to play 300 games for the club, captaining the side and winning five Premier League titles. Seamus Coleman - Sligo Rovers to Everton (£60,000, 2009) An absolute bargain and has become a mainstay in Everton's defence for more than a decade. Can't be many better 'value for money' signings. Luis Suarez - Ajax to Liverpool (£22.7m, 2011) Uruguay striker Suarez joined Liverpool to replace Fernando Torres and became a folk hero at Anfield, scoring 82 goals in 133 games, agonisingly missing out on winning the Premier League title in 2013-14, his final season with the club. Gary Cahill - Bolton Wanderers to Chelsea (£7m, 2012) Chelsea won the FA Cup and Champions League in the defender's first few months at the club and he went on to win two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues, another FA Cup and a League Cup with the Blues.
