Swindon dispatched Harrogate Town away from home thanks to a double from Barry inside an half-an-hour with Josh Davison also netting a brace for Ben Garner's men. Luke Armstrong struck in the fourth minute of added time to net a consolation for Harrogate with Swindon already on their way to a valuable three points. Barry took both of his goals really well, with the 18 year-old scoring his first with a back post header. He got on the end of Mandela Egbo's cross for his second, arriving at the back post again to slot home past Harrogate goalkeeper Joe Cracknell.

""Real Good Friday,"" he posted. ""Two goals and a 4-1 win, @mandela_e. Onto Monday."" Swindon have an outside chance of promotion this season with only two points separating them from the play-off places. They have five games remaining and now is an opportune time for Barry to hit form with the youngster recording five goals in nine League Two matches for Swindon since he signed for them on loan in January. Barry had spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Ipswich Town in a League above but only managed two appearances and did not score. The former West Bromwich Albion and Barcelona man has been a prolific scorer in Villa' s youth sides but now is the time for him to go and experience senior football. Villa players piled in on Barry's Instagram post with first-team midfielder Jacob Ramsey among those to wish him well. Villa youngsters Tommi O'Reilly, Brad Young, Declan Frith and Arjan Raikhy also sent Barry a message and so did Jude Bellingham, the former Birmingham City star who is now a regular with Borussia Dortmund and England. He commented on Barry's post with a fire emoji. ",positive,liverpool,0

Mark Robins' hailed a 'brilliant win' as his Coventry City side came from two down to defeat Birmingham City 4-2. Speaking after his side handed their hosts a set-piece lesson, with three goals direct from set-plays, the Sky Blues boss praised his team's ability to come back from adversity. That result took Coventry to within three points of the top six and came after they found a way past opponents whom Robins' believes to be difficult to play against. While he was frustrated at City's struggles with Blues' set plays, he was delighted at the execution of his own but admitted Blues would be 'seething'. ""You come up against Birmingham and they are a team that spoil. Let me be clear on it, they have got some brilliant players there is no doubt about that and they put you under pressure. They have got really good set play routines and obviously that was borne out because we didn't defend them properly,"" he said. ""The first one from the set play was poorly defended, we didn't move right, he ended up getting a clean header on it and it ends up in the back or your net so you are goal down. The second one from the throw was worse - and it was poor. So you are two goals down without the goalkeepers being tested - either of them - and without any quality in the game. That was the story of the first 20 minutes or so. ""There were too many turnovers in possession, we didn't string two passes together often enough, they have got to take credit for that because that's what they do, spoil. They try to disrupt rhythm, the ball ends up out of play, they slow things down and we were our own enemies as well because the tempo wasn't there. The sun is shining, everyone is basking in the sun, not time for that yet. We needed to up the tempo."" More here. Birmingham City saw a two goal lead turn into a two goal defeat at St Andrew's as Coventry City enjoyed their return to St Andrew's. Kristian Pedersen and Gary Gardner put them ahead but even by then Gustavo Hamer had exposed a wobbly set-piece defence. As events unfolded, so too things unravelled for Blues and Ben Sheaf scored twice, Michael Rose once and Callum O'Hare rounded things off in the 90th minute to condemn the hosts to a painful loss. Trouble cornering Instability at set pieces has such a corrosive effect on the performance of a team. Even from before Sheaf ran free into the box to pull a goal back from a free kick routine Blues had looked shaky. Dom Hyam saw a shot blocked following a scramble from a corner, then Hamer hit the bar direct with his cross and by the time Sheaf scored his second, escaping Maxime Colin to head back across goal, Blues were all at sea. That continued into the second period, with hearts in mouths and anxiety filled the stadium every time the visitors won another corner. All of that totally obscured the fact that for the first half hour Blues had played some really good stuff. They'd moved the ball well and had put the visitors on the back foot. Unfortunately it counted for little at the end. Bad look The fourth goal was a really, really bad look. From the moment Ryan Woods allowed Martyn Waghorn to run off him, Coventry players flooded through a statuesque defence like water through a collander. Woods, Marc Roberts, Pedersen and Onel Hernandez all watched on and only Colin got back to stop a shot on the line and prevent Zach Jeacock from having to face three Sky Blue shirts. It was inevitable when O'Hare stroked home the final goal. Bowyer said: ""To finish the way we did there is disappointing because if there's one thing we don't do, we don't fold - that's what I see us do there at the end."" Blackpool are hopeful Richard Keogh will be available to face Birmingham City on Easter Monday. The experienced defender missed Friday's 2-1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion but is in contention to face Blues at Bloomfield Road. Keogh felt ill going into the match at The Hawthorns, which the Seasiders only lost due to a Karlan Grant goal deep into stoppage time. Manager Neil Critchley believes the former Derby man will be ready to return against Blues for what would be his 26th appearance of the season. However, Critchley expects to be without Jordan Gabriel. The right back was taken off after just 37 minutes with a recurrence of a familiar injury. ""He was holding his hamstring which will be really unfortunate for him he has just come back from a hamstring. We will have to let him settle down and scan him in the next 48 hours."" Overall Critchley lamented his team's decision making in the attacking third and expressed his fear that the season could limp to a conclusion. A month ago Critchley's team were 12th and within touching distance of the play-offs. However, since then they lost three and drawn two - including the frustrating outcome against the Baggies. ""We want that winning feeling back,"" Critchley said. ""We don't what this season to fizzle out, I felt first half it had that end of season feel about it, a bit jaded, both sets of players maybe lacked that bit of intensity at times. ""It was a cruel way to lose the game, but it's happened too many time this season, if we want to improve as a team, then we've got to do better at both ends of the pitch. ""I thought we started the game promisingly and we were in lots of promising situations in the attacking end of the pitch, but we failed. We conceded with a really soft goal which is something we've spoken about, highlighted and worked on."" Lee Bowyer spoke with the media after seeing his side throw away a two goal lead to lose 4-2 to Coventry City. Here's a transcript of his press conference. What did you make of that? I thought we started the game really well, I thought we were the better side, then 2-0 up and cruising then we think the game becomes too easy and we can take our foot off the pedal and allow them back in. We just needed to manage the game better towards the end of the first half but we didn't and half-time 2-2 was tough to take. Crucial that they scored within a minute of your second? Yeah. I will put it down to being too soft, you can't concede three set pieces in one game, that's not good enough. You have to take pride in keeping the ball out of your net and making sure your man doesn't score. It's quite simple really. But for some reason today we were soft at it and it's not like us. The fourth one shouldnt have been a goal but that's irrelevant, the three from set pieces is the problem. Had chances in second half before Rose scored? We had chances. I didn't think there was much in the game, the scoreline you look at that and think '4-2, we took a hiding' but it wasn't that. Up until the 38-39 minutes we were in full control of the game. Second half was quite even not much in it but the scoreline was a lot worse than what the performance was. They are a good side Coventry, I think Mark has done a great job with the squad he has got. They play some great football at times. I watched them against Forest I thought they were very good and today I thought we were the better side but they have got the three points and we have none.

Former West Brom and Coventry City striker Lee Hughes is finally hanging up his boots - at the age of 45. The forward, who scored 99 goals over two spells with Albion, has confirmed his intention to retire this weekend. The veteran centre forward made the announcement on the Stourport Swifts Facebook page, the 16th club he has played for in a 25-year career that saw him play in all four divisions and plunder more than 350 career goals. However, his game against Haughmond in the Midlands Football League Premier Division will be the final one of a rollercoaster career. He wrote: ""So tomorrow [Saturday] I’ve decided to retire from the beautiful game.. it’s my last competitive appearance of my career. ""My last game is at Stourport Swifts FC tomorrow at 3 pm against Haughmond FC. I’ve scored nearly 400 goals and every single one felt unbelievable .. I’ve had a great time and I’ve always gave 100% and I’ve had a career that I never could have dreamed of. ""I’ve had highs and lows, made big mistakes but always tried to put them right but I’ve loved every minute out on the pitch…I’ve played against tevez, Viera, Henry, gascoigne, Pirlo and loads more and I’ve met Pele and Gordon banks but I would like to thank everyone who’s been there for me throughout my career. Let’s all do the Hughesy."" Steve Cooper has demanded a response from his Nottingham Forest players after they slipped to their first defeat in 11 Championship matches at Luton Town on Good Friday. The promotion-chasing Reds face West Bromwich Albion at the City Ground on Easter Monday and Cooper has sent a message to his players. A debatable penalty proved the difference at Kenilworth Road, on an afternoon when the visitors were not at their best. They had their chances to get something from the game, including seeing a Djed Spence goal ruled out for an offside decision which Cooper disputed. But it was the Hatters who took the three points, to provide another twist in the promotion race and Cooper is going into Monday evening's game urging his players to believe. Cooper told NottinghamLive : “We were going to lose a game at some stage. We were on a good run, in good form, playing well and scoring goals. I’ve said to the players everything I’ve just said, plus we were going to lose a game at some stage - even if we didn’t really deserve to lose. Now we have to show that we can handle that. “I don’t want to see any disappointment on the training ground. We get on with it. I’ve said to the players, we’ve shown lots of our good sides to our game and to our mentality. We need to show another one for Monday. “Nobody wants to lose a game. But we’ve lost a game, so we’ve got to show we can deal with that and move on quickly. I’ve said to them, if I see any disappointment on the training ground, then that’s when I’ll really have the hump. That will be our approach."" West Bromwich Albion offered Steve Bruce plenty of food for thought as they continued to push until the end and were eventually rewarded with a 93rd-minute winner to down Blackpool on Good Friday, writes Matt Abbott. Andy Carroll had given Albion a lead in the first half after getting onto the end of a well-worked move originally instigated by the centre-forward to finish from point-blank range. It took just ten minutes either side of half-time for Blackpool to respond through Marvin Ekpiteta from a set-piece, however. Respond the hosts did, but as the board for added time was held aloft to show three minutes more, an eighth home draw of the season looked about to be tallied before Karlan Grant had other ideas. Here are the talking points as Albion returned to winning ways to start the Easter weekend. Bruce made the bold decision of dropping Sam Johnstone from the matchday squad with a view to next season and giving David Button a chance to impress between the sticks. Whether that remains the case for the final four fixtures remains to be seen, with Alex Palmer waiting in the wings fresh off an emergency loan spell at Luton Town a month ago and back on the bench. The 33-year-old did not harm his credentials against Blackpool, though in what was a first appearance since the change of management. A standout save came late on as Button spared Matt Clarke 's blushes by denying a low drive from Josh Bowler to keep things all square. A former Tottenham Hotspur trainee, Button has not stayed at a club longer than two seasons since 2016 while with Brentford and is out of contract at Albion in the summer. With sterner tests than yesterday afternoon expected to come against Nottingham Forest and Coventry City, an opportunity to impress and earn an extension beckons. After not scoring in the first seven matches as an Albion player, Andy Carroll has now found the back of the net in three of his next six appearances. Since breaking the duck late on against Huddersfield Town, goals have followed in this most recent homestand past Bournemouth and now Blackpool. Adding these trio to the two scored earlier this season while with Reading and Carroll is currently enjoying his most prolific season since the 2016/17 campaign with West Ham United when seven were scored in the Premier League. Even more importantly, on an individual level, you have to go back to 2012/13, when the centre-forward left Liverpool, to find an example of Carroll racking up more minutes than so far this season. The 33-year-old rolled back the years at Blackpool by being pivotal in the build-up to both goals and generally bringing others into play well when Albion decided to service the striker. Whether the nine-cap England international remains beyond this summer may well hinge on Bruce's own future in the West Midlands. West Bromwich Albion manager Steve Bruce was left lamenting the big 'what if' as results towards the top of the table fell their way on Good Friday and the play-off race tightened. Sheffield United and Blackburn Rovers both lost, while Middlesbrough drew, meaning the gap between Albion and the last play-off position is now just five points. Despite that, Bruce still believes there is ""too much to do"" to make a miraculous return to the play-off places over the final four matches of the season. Albion face Nottingham Forest and Coventry City in the next week, two sides within seven points of them in the Championship table. ""It’s unbelievable,"" Bruce said. ""It's what if. We're going to ask that all the time, what if. Who knows? I think we've got too much to do, but it's big game on Monday (away to Forest), though. There's frustration for everybody to see, so it's what if, but not to be."" ",positive,liverpool,1

Borussia Monchengladbach defender Matthias Ginter has been asked about rumours linking him with a move to Aston Villa.

""I thought we started the game promisingly and we were in lots of promising situations in the attacking end of the pitch, but we failed. We conceded with a really soft goal which is something we've spoken about, highlighted and worked on. ""If you give Andy Carroll a free run from 40 yards away, then you know the ball is more than likely going to end up in the back of the net. We showed a good response in the second half like we did last week and at that point we're on top. The game died down slightly as the half went on and become more transitional. We end up conceding right at the death again, but that's got nothing to do with ability or fitness. ""You could use loads of words to describe the issue. Will, desire, concentration. This has happened too many times near the end of games and things need to improve in that respect. It's up to us to respond, we are at home, let's get the fans behind us and give them something to shout about on Monday."" ",positive,liverpool,0

However, his game against Haughmond in the Midlands Football League Premier Division will be the final one of a rollercoaster career.

Hughes was at Albion as a youngster but ended up making his breakthrough with Kidderminster Harriers, while working as a roofer and being regarded as one of the best semi-professional players in the country. He returned to Albion in August 1997 and was sold to Coventry for a reported £5million four years later. Albion bought him back a year later but his second spell was ended by a conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, which saw him jailed for three years. He returned to play for Oldham, Notts County and Port Vale before dropping into non league football where he has played for the likes of Forest Green, Kidderminster, Telford United, Worcester City, Halesowen, Nuneaton and now - finally, Stourport Swifts.

Kristian Pedersen and Gary Gardner put them ahead but even by then Gustavo Hamer had exposed a wobbly set-piece defence. As events unfolded, so too things unravelled for Blues and Ben Sheaf scored twice, Michael Rose once and Callum O'Hare rounded things off in the 90th minute to condemn the hosts to a painful loss. Instability at set pieces has such a corrosive effect on the performance of a team. Even from before Sheaf ran free into the box to pull a goal back from a free kick routine Blues had looked shaky. Dom Hyam saw a shot blocked following a scramble from a corner, then Hamer hit the bar direct with his cross and by the time Sheaf scored his second, escaping Maxime Colin to head back across goal, Blues were all at sea. That continued into the second period, with hearts in mouths and anxiety filled the stadium every time the visitors won another corner. All of that totally obscured the fact that for the first half hour Blues had played some really good stuff. They'd moved the ball well and had put the visitors on the back foot. Unfortunately it counted for little at the end. READ: 'I say it how it is' - Every word from Lee Bowyer as Birmingham City surrender lead READ: Lee Bowyer explains Onel Hernandez's Birmingham City role Lee Bowyer rejected the notion that Derby and Reading's points deductions obscured the fact that without them Blues would be in the bottom three, instead pointing to improvements he feels have been made. ""I like to think we are improving individually and as a group. So yeah, I stand by when I say we are improving - for sure."" This is a difficult issue, there's little point dealing in hypotheticals - Blues are almost guaranteed safety and will be in the Championship again next season. It's worth pointing out that Derby and Reading were penalised for breaking financial rules and whist the punishment for that has been meted out, they are still benefitting from the presence of some players who led to the breaking of those rules. But with four games to go it would massively aid Bowyer's cause if Blues could either finish better than last season's 18th or exceed the points tally of 52. Away trips to Blackpool and Cardiff and home matches with Millwall and Blackburn should in theory offer that opportunity. But the set-piece issue is going to have to be resolved. The fourth goal was a really, really bad look. From the moment Ryan Woods allowed Martyn Waghorn to run off him, Coventry players flooded through a statuesque defence like water through a collander. Woods, Marc Roberts, Pedersen and Onel Hernandez all watched on and only Colin got back to stop a shot on the line and prevent Zach Jeacock from having to face three Sky Blue shirts. It was inevitable when O'Hare stroked home the final goal. Bowyer said: ""To finish the way we did there is disappointing because if there's one thing we don't do, we don't fold - that's what I see us do there at the end."" The one ray of light was the performance of Nico Gordon, right from the fourth minute when he threw himself in front of a shot from Viktor Gyokeres to the point where he hobbled off with cramp with a quarter of an hour to go, the 19-year-old was head and shoulders Blues' best player. His reading of the game, his pace to get out of trouble, the timing of his tackling and some quite extraordinary distribution, threading balls through the lines to instigate attacks, really stood out. It's imperative he is fit and ready to face Blackpool on Monday because in just a couple of months he has emerged from the youth ranks and is now playing as Blues' best defender.

Andy Carroll had given Albion a lead in the first half after getting onto the end of a well-worked move originally instigated by the centre-forward to finish from point-blank range. It took just ten minutes either side of half-time for Blackpool to respond through Marvin Ekpiteta from a set-piece, however. Respond the hosts did, but as the board for added time was held aloft to show three minutes more, an eighth home draw of the season looked about to be tallied before Karlan Grant had other ideas. Here are the talking points as Albion returned to winning ways to start the Easter weekend. Bruce made the bold decision of dropping Sam Johnstone from the matchday squad with a view to next season and giving David Button a chance to impress between the sticks. Whether that remains the case for the final four fixtures remains to be seen, with Alex Palmer waiting in the wings fresh off an emergency loan spell at Luton Town a month ago and back on the bench. The 33-year-old did not harm his credentials against Blackpool, though in what was a first appearance since the change of management. A standout save came late on as Button spared Matt Clarke 's blushes by denying a low drive from Josh Bowler to keep things all square. A former Tottenham Hotspur trainee, Button has not stayed at a club longer than two seasons since 2016 while with Brentford and is out of contract at Albion in the summer. With sterner tests than yesterday afternoon expected to come against Nottingham Forest and Coventry City, an opportunity to impress and earn an extension beckons. After not scoring in the first seven matches as an Albion player, Andy Carroll has now found the back of the net in three of his next six appearances. Since breaking the duck late on against Huddersfield Town, goals have followed in this most recent homestand past Bournemouth and now Blackpool. Adding these trio to the two scored earlier this season while with Reading and Carroll is currently enjoying his most prolific season since the 2016/17 campaign with West Ham United when seven were scored in the Premier League. Even more importantly, on an individual level, you have to go back to 2012/13, when the centre-forward left Liverpool, to find an example of Carroll racking up more minutes than so far this season. The 33-year-old rolled back the years at Blackpool by being pivotal in the build-up to both goals and generally bringing others into play well when Albion decided to service the striker. Whether the nine-cap England international remains beyond this summer may well hinge on Bruce's own future in the West Midlands. Bruce was able to welcome back a pair of fresh faces to the team on Good Friday. Dara O'Shea returned to the centre of the back three from the start for the first time since late February straight off the bat. The Republic of Ireland international has now made five appearances since suffering a serious ankle fracture back in September and is slowly easing back to action. Today also saw the defender positioned in the centre rather than as a full-back for the first sustained spell of a match under Bruce which bodes well. Also occupying central areas further upfield was Matt Phillips, who made a first appearance under Bruce against former club Blackpool. The Scotland international made more than 100 appearances for the Seasiders between 2010 and 2013. Phillips was the first player turned to from the bench by the Albion manager as a more advanced option in midfield than captain Jake Livermore just before the hour mark. It took the 31-year-old time to work into the game, but those devilish deliveries remain as accurate as ever. A shift out to wing-back late on as Grady Diangana was introduced and Albion went all-out attack. It was from as wide on the pitch as possible that Phillips had a hand in the winner, whipping in the corner that was flicked away to Carroll and eventually finished by Grant deep into added time. After helping Albion to a win at opposite ends of the pitch, both will be hoping this appearance is the start of an extended run over the next month. The pair will be hoping for further minutes under the belt so that they can hit the ground running next season fully fit. ",positive,liverpool,1

Sheffield United and Blackburn Rovers both lost, while Middlesbrough drew, meaning the gap between Albion and the last play-off position is now just five points. Despite that, Bruce still believes there is ""too much to do"" to make a miraculous return to the play-off places over the final four matches of the season. Albion face Nottingham Forest and Coventry City in the next week, two sides within seven points of them in the Championship table.

He explained: ""Do you know something? I’ll tell you, when the daffodils come up, when squeaky bum time comes, out or whatever you want to call it, you see strange results, especially. ""The hardest thing in football is to get over the line, and all sorts of nerves come into it. All of a sudden the pitches are a bit lively, the sunshine’s out.

Luke Armstrong struck in the fourth minute of added time to net a consolation for Harrogate with Swindon already on their way to a valuable three points. Barry took both of his goals really well, with the 18 year-old scoring his first with a back post header.

But having shipped one to Nottingham Forest's Scott McKenna last Saturday, this time they leaked two from Gustavo Hamer deliveries. Blues went 2-0 up but had just been pegged back to 2-1 when the Coventry City midfielder sent in a deep cross to the back post for Ben Sheaf, who had already scored once, to slip free of Maxime Colin and head home the equaliser. Maddeningly for Lee Bowyer it was a carbon copy of the goal McKenna had scored at the City Ground just six days ago. Then in the second half with Blues pressing to restore their lead and fashioning a couple of chances, they were caught out again. Fifteen minutes remained when Hamer sent over another cross which found Michael Rose perfectly in stride. The 26-year-old appeared to have escaped Marc Roberts and he too clattered a header past Zach Jeacock. It wouldn't be fair to blame the rookie goalkeeper, in for the concussed Neil Etheridge, the depth of delivery on Sheaf's goal made it difficult to come for, the trajectory of the ball on Rose's meant he would never have got there. Even so the 20-year-old didn't exude confidence in such situations and had Hamer's first half corner sneaked under the bar and not smacked on to it, that would have been harsh on him. All of which meant any satisfaction Bowyer and Blues would have felt from scoring from a Marc Roberts throw in, or their own corner when Kristian Pedersen scored from a Juninho Bacuna restart, meant nothing. Blues are going to find it difficult to pick up many results from the remaining four games if they cannot find a solution to an obvious weakness. ",positive,liverpool,0

Five consecutive draws manifest that. However, the gates were blown off this rivalry at St Andrew's this afternoon as Blues threw away a two goal lead to lose 4-2 and throw away the chance to guarantee their Championship place for next season. Lee Bowyer's men will still be in the second tier next term, Barnsley need to win out and reverse a big goal difference deficit to cause the most unlikely of upsets - but the head coach will not be happy with what he saw here. Three goals conceded from set-pieces and a feeling of deflation at the end of what should have been a morale-boosting victory. The first half especially was a story of set-pieces, with four restart goals being shared equally and both managers wondering how their defences had melted away. Indeed every time the ball went into the area it seemed to be an attacker who reacted first. That started in the 12th minute when Juninho Bacuna swung in a corner which Kristian Pedersen rose highest above two defenders and thundered home past an exposed Simon Moore. Then with six minutes of the half remaining Blues doubled their lead. Marc Roberts hurled in a trademark long-throw and where hundreds have previously been cleared, this time Gary Gardner was there to meet in stride and send in a header that was too firm for Moore to keep out. At 2-0 up Blues seemed to be set fair for three points. However, that seemed to jolt the Sky Blues into life and 60 seconds later they were on the scoreboard. Blues were caught napping when Gustavo Hamer sent in a free kick to the back post which Michael Rose headed across goal. Ben Sheaf ran in and volleyed into the roof of the net. With the half entering five minutes of added time following treatment to a head injury for Dominic Hyam, Mark Robins' men levelled. Hamer sent in the corner, deep to the back where Sheaf eluded Maxime Colin and headed back across goal for 2-2 at the break. Scott Hogan had a half chance on the hour when Ryan Woods tried to pick out Bacuna with a ball over the top, the clearance dropped to Hogan but he sliced his volley wide. Soon after that Blues might have reclaimed the lead when Bacuna once again sent in a pinpoint delivery which Gardner just got under and headed over from eight yards. Sky Blues' set piece threat remained and they made it count with a quarter of an hour to go when Hamer picked out Rose who had escaped Roberts to beat Jeacock for a third time. Blues' collapse was complete in the final minute of normal time when no-one tracked Martyn Waghorn into the area, Jeacock stopped his shot, Colin blocked another on the line but Callum O'Hare was free to tap home a fourth. 3-4-1-2 Jeacock 5 Secure with his kicking, mostly alert coming out of goal and not much required in terms of shot-stopping although the fourth was a tough watch. Looked nervy on corners. Gordon 7.5* Such a composed performance with the ball at his feet and alert without it, often up against the mobile Callum O'Hare. Made blocks, last ditch tackles and covered runners. He really is growing into a rising star. Roberts 6 Finally has an assist from a long throw. Defended pretty well for the most part although it looked like Michael Rose ran off him for 3-2. Pedersen 6 Powered in his first goal of the season. Allowed Allen to steal in front of him at the start of the second half. Did OK for the most part. Colin 5.5 Deployed at wing back for the first time in a while. Tried to get forward and support attack Lost Sheaf for 2-2. Woods 6 Looked very neat when he got on the ball. Picked some lovely passes and tracked his runners well with some good mopping up. Gardner 6 A dominant header brought his sixth goal of the season. Ran hard and put in his tackles although he wasn't always great on the ball. Hernandez 5.5 Only got free once in a quiet first half but Gardner hacked wide. Came into it more after the restart but Coventry kept him under wraps. Bacuna 6 Picked up an early booking for a rash challenge on Maatsen. After that showed some neat touches, picked out Pedersen from a corner, covered well off the ball and looked for space in the visitors' defence. Taylor 6 Spent most of the first half battling for high balls and without much chance to get the ball down and build attacks. Set up Colin early in the second half. Hogan 5 Totally on the fringes of the games in the opening 45 although he should have gone across goal after a Jeacock ball forward ran into his path.

Here's a transcript of his press conference. I thought we started the game really well, I thought we were the better side, then 2-0 up and cruising then we think the game becomes too easy and we can take our foot off the pedal and allow them back in. We just needed to manage the game better towards the end of the first half but we didn't and half-time 2-2 was tough to take. READ: ' Maddening' problem returns to haunt Birmingham City against Coventry READ: Birmingham City player ratings vs Coventry City: Blues swept aside by rampant Sky Blues Yeah. I will put it down to being too soft, you can't concede three set pieces in one game, that's not good enough. You have to take pride in keeping the ball out of your net and making sure your man doesn't score. It's quite simple really. But for some reason today we were soft at it and it's not like us. The fourth one shouldnt have been a goal but that's irrelevant, the three from set pieces is the problem. We had chances. I didn't think there was much in the game, the scoreline you look at that and think '4-2, we took a hiding' but it wasn't that. Up until the 38-39 minutes we were in full control of the game. Second half was quite even not much in it but the scoreline was a lot worse than what the performance was. They are a good side Coventry, I think Mark has done a great job with the squad he has got. They play some great football at times. I watched them against Forest I thought they were very good and today I thought we were the better side but they have got the three points and we have none. Too soft, there's no excuse for that, that comes from within. It's interesting for me for the last four games now because you can't carry anyone in this division. People criticised me before because I say things or the way I work with the players. People want to criticise. Well guess what before I came this team, this club was in a relegation fight until the last day for the last four years. That's not changed. So I am coming in and I am going to push them and get everything out of them I can. Sometimes you have to tell people some things they don't want to hear but being soft, that's something you can't push peple too hard. To concede the way we did today, it's not good enough. Yeah, for sure. The problem with football now and I am not just talking about my players, the problem with football now a lot of people have got a lot of things to say who haven't really done anything in the game. That's across the board. I think players now are soft, all I do is I see players every single week fall on the floor because they have had minimal contact. It's pathetic, again today. So I just think the game has become soft. If someone tells someone off or shouts at someone they take it personally. It's not personal, you have to push each other as a group, that's how you become strong, powerful and win games. Now you can't even say anything to a player, it's become personal and 'You've upset me'. Crazy. I tell them. Some sulk for a little bit and some take it on board. The players have improved because I tell them. I am talking in general, I just think players now are so soft it's crazy. You have heard me in here, you have asked me questions and I will say something about a striker, Scott Hogan, 'Missed too many chances, not good enough....' Now he has scored ten goals. I say it how it is, my job is to push every player. I am just using Scott as an example. People might think 'That's out of order, why's he saying that?' Well guess what I have got the right reaction from the player. That's my job, that's why he is improving. Today he didn't really do much wrong, his hold up play was good. Last week against Forest he held the ball up unbelievably well. That's his weakness, running around working hard for the team. That's why we ain't going to go to the final day and have a relegation fight. But frustrating because have just lost the game and conceded three set pieces, at home, in a local derby. Yeah, I have just told them that. So they know. Everything I say here, they know because I say the same to them. I wouldn't say they were soft unless I would say that to them. I say it how it is. I am saying today our performance was soft. The goals we conceded were soft. I have got a good group of players that give me everything every time they step on to the pitch. I have had so many managers say after games when we have had a chat 'Wow those players don't stop working for you'. I am not just saying 'My players are soft'. Today's performance, the goals we conceded were soft. I don't think he did much wrong did he? He picked the ball out of the net four times, it's not really his fault - individual defending, individual errors. Apart from that I didn't think he did much wrong, good starting positions, kicking was good. So yeah I thought he did OK. We have just got to see Neil is first and we will go from there. He just got cramp but I thought he was very good. I think when I have played him behind the strikers he prefers to be out wide. So even when I say to him 'Play there', he ends up out wide. As a wing back it's simple isn't it? Wing back against wing back. So today, their lad I am guessing is a right back on a normal day and Onel is a left winger on a normal day. So he is playing in his normal position. If the right back was to run forward he would have to track him and vice versa, so he is playing in his normal position when you play him in that left wing back position. He has to do a little bit of defending but he has to do that when he is playing as a winger, I don't think that matters. Would you rather have Marc Roberts in the box or Onel Hernandez? OK if you put him on the edge of the box then you are losing one of the big ones. We scored two, they scored three. I wouldn't say having Onel back, some has got to be back and unforunately it was him today. They have two up as well, if they had one up he would have been on the edge. My thoughts about what? No, I am talking about every day on the training pitch. Again I will use Scott, he has scored ten goals, tell me the last time he scored ten goals. That's my point. How many clean sheets have we kept this season? 14 and what about last season? So I am guessing, I don't know the facts, but I am guessing we have improved on that side of things. Everyone keeps telling me how good Gary Gardner is doing and this player and that player. I like to think we are improving individually and as a group. So yeah, I stand by when I say we are improving - for sure. ",positive,liverpool,0

Mark Robins' hailed a 'brilliant win' as his Coventry City side came from two down to defeat Birmingham City 4-2. Speaking after his side handed their hosts a set-piece lesson, with three goals direct from set-plays, the Sky Blues boss praised his team's ability to come back from adversity. That result took Coventry to within three points of the top six and came after they found a way past opponents whom Robins' believes to be difficult to play against. While he was frustrated at City's struggles with Blues' set plays, he was delighted at the execution of his own but admitted Blues would be 'seething'. ""You come up against Birmingham and they are a team that spoil. Let me be clear on it, they have got some brilliant players there is no doubt about that and they put you under pressure. They have got really good set play routines and obviously that was borne out because we didn't defend them properly,"" he said. ""The first one from the set play was poorly defended, we didn't move right, he ended up getting a clean header on it and it ends up in the back or your net so you are goal down. The second one from the throw was worse - and it was poor. So you are two goals down without the goalkeepers being tested - either of them - and without any quality in the game. That was the story of the first 20 minutes or so. ""There were too many turnovers in possession, we didn't string two passes together often enough, they have got to take credit for that because that's what they do, spoil. They try to disrupt rhythm, the ball ends up out of play, they slow things down and we were our own enemies as well because the tempo wasn't there. The sun is shining, everyone is basking in the sun, not time for that yet. We needed to up the tempo."" More here. Birmingham City saw a two goal lead turn into a two goal defeat at St Andrew's as Coventry City enjoyed their return to St Andrew's. Kristian Pedersen and Gary Gardner put them ahead but even by then Gustavo Hamer had exposed a wobbly set-piece defence. As events unfolded, so too things unravelled for Blues and Ben Sheaf scored twice, Michael Rose once and Callum O'Hare rounded things off in the 90th minute to condemn the hosts to a painful loss. Trouble cornering Instability at set pieces has such a corrosive effect on the performance of a team. Even from before Sheaf ran free into the box to pull a goal back from a free kick routine Blues had looked shaky. Dom Hyam saw a shot blocked following a scramble from a corner, then Hamer hit the bar direct with his cross and by the time Sheaf scored his second, escaping Maxime Colin to head back across goal, Blues were all at sea. That continued into the second period, with hearts in mouths and anxiety filled the stadium every time the visitors won another corner. All of that totally obscured the fact that for the first half hour Blues had played some really good stuff. They'd moved the ball well and had put the visitors on the back foot. Unfortunately it counted for little at the end. Bad look The fourth goal was a really, really bad look. From the moment Ryan Woods allowed Martyn Waghorn to run off him, Coventry players flooded through a statuesque defence like water through a collander. Woods, Marc Roberts, Pedersen and Onel Hernandez all watched on and only Colin got back to stop a shot on the line and prevent Zach Jeacock from having to face three Sky Blue shirts. It was inevitable when O'Hare stroked home the final goal. Bowyer said: ""To finish the way we did there is disappointing because if there's one thing we don't do, we don't fold - that's what I see us do there at the end."" Blackpool are hopeful Richard Keogh will be available to face Birmingham City on Easter Monday. The experienced defender missed Friday's 2-1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion but is in contention to face Blues at Bloomfield Road. Keogh felt ill going into the match at The Hawthorns, which the Seasiders only lost due to a Karlan Grant goal deep into stoppage time. Manager Neil Critchley believes the former Derby man will be ready to return against Blues for what would be his 26th appearance of the season. However, Critchley expects to be without Jordan Gabriel. The right back was taken off after just 37 minutes with a recurrence of a familiar injury. ""He was holding his hamstring which will be really unfortunate for him he has just come back from a hamstring. We will have to let him settle down and scan him in the next 48 hours."" Overall Critchley lamented his team's decision making in the attacking third and expressed his fear that the season could limp to a conclusion. A month ago Critchley's team were 12th and within touching distance of the play-offs. However, since then they lost three and drawn two - including the frustrating outcome against the Baggies. ""We want that winning feeling back,"" Critchley said. ""We don't what this season to fizzle out, I felt first half it had that end of season feel about it, a bit jaded, both sets of players maybe lacked that bit of intensity at times. ""It was a cruel way to lose the game, but it's happened too many time this season, if we want to improve as a team, then we've got to do better at both ends of the pitch. ""I thought we started the game promisingly and we were in lots of promising situations in the attacking end of the pitch, but we failed. We conceded with a really soft goal which is something we've spoken about, highlighted and worked on."" Lee Bowyer spoke with the media after seeing his side throw away a two goal lead to lose 4-2 to Coventry City. Here's a transcript of his press conference. What did you make of that? I thought we started the game really well, I thought we were the better side, then 2-0 up and cruising then we think the game becomes too easy and we can take our foot off the pedal and allow them back in. We just needed to manage the game better towards the end of the first half but we didn't and half-time 2-2 was tough to take. Crucial that they scored within a minute of your second? Yeah. I will put it down to being too soft, you can't concede three set pieces in one game, that's not good enough. You have to take pride in keeping the ball out of your net and making sure your man doesn't score. It's quite simple really. But for some reason today we were soft at it and it's not like us. The fourth one shouldnt have been a goal but that's irrelevant, the three from set pieces is the problem. Had chances in second half before Rose scored? We had chances. I didn't think there was much in the game, the scoreline you look at that and think '4-2, we took a hiding' but it wasn't that. Up until the 38-39 minutes we were in full control of the game. Second half was quite even not much in it but the scoreline was a lot worse than what the performance was. They are a good side Coventry, I think Mark has done a great job with the squad he has got. They play some great football at times. I watched them against Forest I thought they were very good and today I thought we were the better side but they have got the three points and we have none.

Albion started marginally the stronger and could have led inside the opening five minutes. Adam Reach breached the Blackpool box after a neat one-two with Callum Robinson, but the wing-back couldn't stretch enough to apply a finish. A stagnant spell on a sunny bank holiday afternoon followed, suggesting a stalemate at half-time was approaching, but Andy Carroll had other ideas and was on hand to enliven the game with some fine centre-forward play. After flicking on Semi Ajayi's arrowed diagonal ball, Carroll swept into the Blackpool box unmarked and finished first time from Reach's delightful delivery. Blackpool improved after the break and pressed home their advantage from a set-piece. Ekpiteta reacted first to fire past David Button after the ball was inexcusably allowed to drop in the Albion box when Dara O'Shea and Carroll made a mess of the first contact. Albion weathered that storm and were the brighter side as full-time approached. However, it looked to be two points dropped once more before Grant was on hand to volley in from a tight angle. That leaves Bruce's side with two wins and a defeat from Albion's three-match run at The Hawthorns over the last nine days. READ: West Brom player ratings as Blackpool are beaten at the Hawthorns READ: West Brom summer transfer plans revealed as Steve Bruce targets 'major overhaul' West Bromwich Albion manager Steve Bruce was pleased by his squad once again showing ""they don't give up"" after Karlan Grant scored a 93rd-minute winner to beat Blackpool at the Hawthorns. The hosts had led after Andy Carroll fired home from an Adam Reach cross before half-time but were pegged back when Marvin Ekpiteta turned in from a similar distance after the break when Albion failed to deal with a free-kick. Despite being a peripheral figure in front of goal during most of the 90 minutes, Grant more than made up for it during the three minutes of added time. After Carroll volleyed across goal as Baggies admirably kept an attack alive, the ball fell for his fellow striker who volleyed in from a tight angle to seal all three points. ""Well, it's nice to win. Whether we deserved it or not is debatable, but nice to win,"" Bruce said. ""The one thing I can say about them is that they don't give up. ""I think three, four, five times we’ve scored in the last minute to either rescue something or win something. So it's always nice to score in the last minute, of course, and a good finish from Granty. The Baggies boss was even more pleased with the way his team worked the opener. ""The goal, the first one, was the real bit of quality in the match for me,"" Bruce continued. ""Reachy’s cross was (that good) he couldn't really miss. It was terrific from him that bit of quality, so that was pleasing to see."" A section of West Bromwich Albion fans have been slammed for booing Callum Robinson during their 2-1 victory over Blackpool on Good Friday. Albion returned to winning ways thanks to Karlan Grant’s stoppage time winner. Andy Carroll had given Albion the lead in the first half with his third goal for the club before Marvin Ekpiteta levelled for the visitors. But the victory was marred slightly by an incident which happened in the second half at The Hawthorns. Robinson was booed by a section of the Birmingham Road End, who felt the forward failed to contest a ball with Blackpool goalkeeper Chris Maxwell. Head coach Steve Bruce re-watched the incident before attending his post-match press conference, and doesn’t feel Robinson could have won the ball if he had challenged Maxwell. And some Baggies fans believe Robinson - who has seven goals and eight assists in the Championship this term - shouldn’t have been booed. One Albion fan tweeted: “Don’t ever boo your own players when they have the ball. Pathetic from the fans.” A second said: “Feels uncomfortable hearing our own fans booing our own player.” Another added: “I’m not a massive Robinson fan and he does pull out of challenges but booing him individually, afterwards, each time he got the ball is just not on man. He’s still our player and not too long ago everybody was singing his name for scoring the winner past Fulham.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Bruce has rung the changes for the 3-1 defeat to Stoke City, with alterations up front, in midfield defence and between the sticks. Dara O'Shea, Adam Reach and Darnell Furlong all come in to bolster the backline and midfield. Further forward, Callum Robinson and Karlan Grant are in as Grady Diangana drops out of the frontline. Kyle Bartley, Taylor Gardner-Hickman, Jayson Molumby, Alex Mowatt and Conor Townsend all also make way. As revealed by Bruce at the pre- Blackpool press conference, David Button starts in goal for the first time since Valerien Ismael 's last match in charge away at Millwall. Sam Johnstone had started all of the previous 12 since the change of manager, despite constant speculation about the England international's future, and Button will now be given an opportunity to impress ahead of next season. There is also a place in the matchday squad for Matt Phillips for the first time under Bruce. The 31-year-old has been sidelined since early February, having suffered a hamstring injury in training ahead of the new manager's first match at Sheffield United.

Former West Brom and Coventry City striker Lee Hughes is finally hanging up his boots - at the age of 45. The forward, who scored 99 goals over two spells with Albion, has confirmed his intention to retire this weekend. The veteran centre forward made the announcement on the Stourport Swifts Facebook page, the 16th club he has played for in a 25-year career that saw him play in all four divisions and plunder more than 350 career goals. However, his game against Haughmond in the Midlands Football League Premier Division will be the final one of a rollercoaster career. He wrote: ""So tomorrow [Saturday] I’ve decided to retire from the beautiful game.. it’s my last competitive appearance of my career. ""My last game is at Stourport Swifts FC tomorrow at 3 pm against Haughmond FC. I’ve scored nearly 400 goals and every single one felt unbelievable .. I’ve had a great time and I’ve always gave 100% and I’ve had a career that I never could have dreamed of. ""I’ve had highs and lows, made big mistakes but always tried to put them right but I’ve loved every minute out on the pitch…I’ve played against tevez, Viera, Henry, gascoigne, Pirlo and loads more and I’ve met Pele and Gordon banks but I would like to thank everyone who’s been there for me throughout my career. Let’s all do the Hughesy."" Steve Cooper has demanded a response from his Nottingham Forest players after they slipped to their first defeat in 11 Championship matches at Luton Town on Good Friday. The promotion-chasing Reds face West Bromwich Albion at the City Ground on Easter Monday and Cooper has sent a message to his players. A debatable penalty proved the difference at Kenilworth Road, on an afternoon when the visitors were not at their best. They had their chances to get something from the game, including seeing a Djed Spence goal ruled out for an offside decision which Cooper disputed. But it was the Hatters who took the three points, to provide another twist in the promotion race and Cooper is going into Monday evening's game urging his players to believe. Cooper told NottinghamLive : “We were going to lose a game at some stage. We were on a good run, in good form, playing well and scoring goals. I’ve said to the players everything I’ve just said, plus we were going to lose a game at some stage - even if we didn’t really deserve to lose. Now we have to show that we can handle that. “I don’t want to see any disappointment on the training ground. We get on with it. I’ve said to the players, we’ve shown lots of our good sides to our game and to our mentality. We need to show another one for Monday. “Nobody wants to lose a game. But we’ve lost a game, so we’ve got to show we can deal with that and move on quickly. I’ve said to them, if I see any disappointment on the training ground, then that’s when I’ll really have the hump. That will be our approach."" West Bromwich Albion offered Steve Bruce plenty of food for thought as they continued to push until the end and were eventually rewarded with a 93rd-minute winner to down Blackpool on Good Friday, writes Matt Abbott. Andy Carroll had given Albion a lead in the first half after getting onto the end of a well-worked move originally instigated by the centre-forward to finish from point-blank range. It took just ten minutes either side of half-time for Blackpool to respond through Marvin Ekpiteta from a set-piece, however. Respond the hosts did, but as the board for added time was held aloft to show three minutes more, an eighth home draw of the season looked about to be tallied before Karlan Grant had other ideas. Here are the talking points as Albion returned to winning ways to start the Easter weekend. Bruce made the bold decision of dropping Sam Johnstone from the matchday squad with a view to next season and giving David Button a chance to impress between the sticks. Whether that remains the case for the final four fixtures remains to be seen, with Alex Palmer waiting in the wings fresh off an emergency loan spell at Luton Town a month ago and back on the bench. The 33-year-old did not harm his credentials against Blackpool, though in what was a first appearance since the change of management. A standout save came late on as Button spared Matt Clarke 's blushes by denying a low drive from Josh Bowler to keep things all square. A former Tottenham Hotspur trainee, Button has not stayed at a club longer than two seasons since 2016 while with Brentford and is out of contract at Albion in the summer. With sterner tests than yesterday afternoon expected to come against Nottingham Forest and Coventry City, an opportunity to impress and earn an extension beckons. After not scoring in the first seven matches as an Albion player, Andy Carroll has now found the back of the net in three of his next six appearances. Since breaking the duck late on against Huddersfield Town, goals have followed in this most recent homestand past Bournemouth and now Blackpool. Adding these trio to the two scored earlier this season while with Reading and Carroll is currently enjoying his most prolific season since the 2016/17 campaign with West Ham United when seven were scored in the Premier League. Even more importantly, on an individual level, you have to go back to 2012/13, when the centre-forward left Liverpool, to find an example of Carroll racking up more minutes than so far this season. The 33-year-old rolled back the years at Blackpool by being pivotal in the build-up to both goals and generally bringing others into play well when Albion decided to service the striker. Whether the nine-cap England international remains beyond this summer may well hinge on Bruce's own future in the West Midlands. West Bromwich Albion manager Steve Bruce was left lamenting the big 'what if' as results towards the top of the table fell their way on Good Friday and the play-off race tightened. Sheffield United and Blackburn Rovers both lost, while Middlesbrough drew, meaning the gap between Albion and the last play-off position is now just five points. Despite that, Bruce still believes there is ""too much to do"" to make a miraculous return to the play-off places over the final four matches of the season. Albion face Nottingham Forest and Coventry City in the next week, two sides within seven points of them in the Championship table. ""It’s unbelievable,"" Bruce said. ""It's what if. We're going to ask that all the time, what if. Who knows? I think we've got too much to do, but it's big game on Monday (away to Forest), though. There's frustration for everybody to see, so it's what if, but not to be."" ",positive,liverpool,1

Ajayi 6 The incisive diagonal ball to start the move for the opening goal really was something out of nothing. Perhaps could have reacted quicker to prevent Ekpiteta from turning in the equaliser. O'Shea 5 Gave away the soft free kick in the build-up to Blackpool's equaliser and was then beaten to the header from the subsequent delivery. Grew into the game on a rare recent start. Clarke 6 Largely kept Josh Bowler quiet throughout but was beaten badly moments before the attacker was withdrawn. Not on the scene for goal as O'Shea was targeted for the flick-on. Furlong 6 Was kept busy by James Husband advancing down the flank but gave as good as he got in the early exchanges. Dangerous with both hands and feet as Blackpool struggled with crosses from both flanks before being replaced. Molumby 6 Forced the first save of the game after being teed up by Robinson to win a corner. Combined well with Reach and Robinson on the left throughout as an advanced midfield threat Livermore 5 Again assumed the deepest lying central position but was part of a midfield played through all too easily on occasion. Replaced before the hour mark as Albion pushed for a second. Robinson 6 Most dangerous coming inside from the left and forced a smart save down low from Maxwell before half-time after being fed in by Molumby. Albion's most willing attacker to pull the trigger throughout and kept Maxwell busy before half-time. Linked well with Grant and constantly found space behind the strikers. Reach 7 Albion's liveliest attacker in the first half, forcing the first dangerous attack of the half with a neat one-two but couldn't make sufficient contact to finish inside the area. Continued to threaten throughout and turned provider for the opener with a delightful delivery. Struggled in the second half as Blackpool grew into the game. Carroll 7 Held up play well when Albion offered adequate service and came to life when fashioning the opener. Flicked on Ajayi's diagonal to keep the attack alive before staying involved to arrive in the box at the perfect time to finish first time and net a third Albion goal this season, all at The Hawthorns. Caught out in the air for Blackpool's equaliser. Squandered a chance at a brace. Made amends in the dying moments with a ferocious volley that Blackpool couldn't clear and ended up on the end of Grant's boot. Grant 7 Unusually shot-shy in the first half and instead opted to tee up teammates all too often to no avail. Ran in behind well and caused problems with his movement but rarely threatened- until the death. Saved getting a meaningful shot off until the very last moments but fashioned a superb volley to snatch victory. SUBSTITUTES Phillips (for Livermore, 57) 6 Made a return to the team as Bruce reacted to going a goal behind just before the hour mark. Had one enterprising run through the centre from midfield but couldn't choose the right option. Stuck to defensive duties diligently late on to advert danger. Gardner-Hickman (for Robinson, 69) 6 Caused the largest cheer of the second half when the substitute replaced Robinson. Went close from distance as a rasping effort went just over the crossbar and forced Maxwell into abrupt action. Diangana (for Furlong, 85) 5 Had little time to effect proceedings for the final five minutes. Occupied the central area vacated by Robinson early on. Took a heavy whack when starting a counter attack late on. Not used : Palmer, Townsend, Bartley, Kipre BLACKPOOL: Maxwell; Gabriel (Virtue 37), Ekpiteta, Thorniley, Husband, Dougall, Connolly, Bowler, Anderson (Dale 62'), Lavery, Madine.

The hosts had led after Andy Carroll fired home from an Adam Reach cross before half-time but were pegged back when Marvin Ekpiteta turned in from a similar distance after the break when Albion failed to deal with a free-kick. Despite being a peripheral figure in front of goal during most of the 90 minutes, Grant more than made up for it during the three minutes of added time. After Carroll volleyed across goal as Baggies admirably kept an attack alive, the ball fell for his fellow striker who volleyed in from a tight angle to seal all three points. READ: Bruce makes Callum Robinson admission after fans turn on West Brom man ""Well, it's nice to win. Whether we deserved it or not is debatable, but nice to win,"" Bruce said. ""The one thing I can say about them is that they don't give up. ""I think three, four, five times we’ve scored in the last minute to either rescue something or win something. So it's always nice to score in the last minute, of course, and a good finish from Granty. The Baggies boss was even more pleased with the way his team worked the opener. ""The goal, the first one, was the real bit of quality in the match for me,"" Bruce continued. ""Reachy’s cross was (that good) he couldn't really miss. It was terrific from him that bit of quality, so that was pleasing to see."" Despite the win, though, Bruce remains realistic about the current predicament, which was only further emphasized by the frustration directed at Callum Robinson as an ultimately disappointing season now has just four matches remaining. Albion are now 11th and still just five points from the final play-off place, but whatever happens, Bruce has stressed there is ""a lot of work to be done."" ""We don't want West Brom (where they are in the table) and I think the support know there's a lot of work to be done, if they're being honest, which they are,"" Bruce added. ""There's a lot of work to be done to get a team together, which can give them what they're looking for."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Albion returned to winning ways thanks to Karlan Grant’s stoppage time winner. Andy Carroll had given Albion the lead in the first half with his third goal for the club before Marvin Ekpiteta levelled for the visitors. But the victory was marred slightly by an incident which happened in the second half at The Hawthorns. Robinson was booed by a section of the Birmingham Road End, who felt the forward failed to contest a ball with Blackpool goalkeeper Chris Maxwell.

And some Baggies fans believe Robinson - who has seven goals and eight assists in the Championship this term - shouldn’t have been booed. One Albion fan tweeted: “Don’t ever boo your own players when they have the ball. Pathetic from the fans.” A second said: “Feels uncomfortable hearing our own fans booing our own player.” Another added: “I’m not a massive Robinson fan and he does pull out of challenges but booing him individually, afterwards, each time he got the ball is just not on man. He’s still our player and not too long ago everybody was singing his name for scoring the winner past Fulham.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The 32-year-old's first game after joining Blues on loan from Nottingham Forest in January came against the Rams - his parent club's bitter local rivals. Coincidentally, his last appearance for the Reds before making the move was a seven-minute cameo against the same opposition. Taylor opened the scoring that day in a dramatic 2-2 draw that saw the hosts nab a last-minute equaliser after going two goals down. The forward turned to the crowd in celebration and basked in the moment with his arms wide open, soaking in both the adulation from his new fans and the hostility emanating from the baying home crowd. TEAM NEWS: Lee Bowyer issues Neil Etheridge and Tahith Chong updates ahead of Coventry City clash OPPOSITION: Coventry City dealt fresh injury blow ahead of Birmingham City clash After the final whistle Taylor said that ""it was kind of written"" that he would make an impact like that for Birmingham City against Derby of all teams, while adding that he hoped the club survive their current financial crisis ""because we don’t need any more of that happening in English football, any more clubs going under to anything like that"". While the rivalry between Birmingham and Derby is not quite as intense, it is still there. It has been reignited this week after some Rams fans reacted to Blues' latest financial fears. Now Taylor has disclosed what happened after he was substituted off the pitch that day on the 79th minute, revealing that Derby supporters came down to the dugout to give him a piece of their mind after his celebration earlier in the game. He says he understands the level of passion fans have for their teams, but questioned the point of abusing the opposition to that extent. ""When you play for Nottingham Forest and you score on your debut for the team you're on loan with against Derby, of course I'm going to celebrate,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Don't get me wrong, I get a good ribbing from every team's fans that I play against, so of course I'm going to give a bit back, but I don't mind it. It's all done in good spirits. ""I had so many people rushing down to the back of the dugout, because I had come off with ten minutes left, my legs were shot, but I had so many people hurling obscenities at me. ""And you're just thinking, okay I know there's a tribalism in football and every football fan's club means the world to them - but is this really the world we live in now where you can just say whatever it is you feel like saying because someone scored a goal? But that's why football is so big in this country."" Get the latest Blues transfer news straight to your inbox! The Montserrat international has also been impressed by the job Wayne Rooney has done at Derby amid a plethora of off-field problems at the club. He reckons that the former England striker could be the next Everton manager if Frank Lampard fails to keep them up this season. ""The first thing I've got to say about Rooney is, I think he has done a hell of a job,"" he said. ""To face what he has had to face and to still be fighting, that says it all about Wayne Rooney the manager and it's probably the same as what people saw from Wayne Rooney the player. ""I think if Everton come down to the Championship, I don't see why they wouldn't get a Wayne Rooney.

Andre Wisdom remains without a club having ended his stay with Sheffield United. The former Derby County defender has spent most of 2022 training with Championship clubs in a bid to win a contract. He was with Birmingham City for a month as Blues looked at options to cover their defensive crisis - and then tried his luck with the Bramall Lane outfit. However, Blades boss Paul Heckingbottom has confirmed the 28-year-old won't be signing with them. Speaking ahead of Friday's clash with Reading, Heckingbottom said: ""Andre isn’t here with us now.

The 32-year-old is available again after missing out against his parent club Nottingham Forest last weekend, a game in which Blues clearly missed his finishing touch. The striker has scored four times in nine appearances for Blues and despite having a couple of spells on the sidelines with injury he has impressed enough to begin a conversation about him returning on a permanent basis in the summer. Indeed Bowyer, who also managed Taylor at Charlton Athletic, has made no secret of his desire to retain the  Montserrat international and considers Taylor to be 'the all-round striker'. READ MORE HERE Birmingham City are sure to have a busy transfer window this summer with players out of contract, others out of favour and attempts to reallocate resources in Lee Bowyer’s squad. Every position is likely to come under scrutiny but nowhere more so than in defence where injuries have crippled Blues this term. Left-back/left-sided centre back Kristian Pedersen will leave at the end of the campaign and the club are expected to try to move on former captain Harlee Dean. Marc Roberts and George Friend remain, as does rising star Nico Gordon - but Blues are likely to want more depth. As a rule Blues want to pay their fees for younger players while accepting there is value in older free agent - and there are going to be plenty of those this summer. Here’s a list of options both in the Premier League and Championship. Some might be fanciful, others have already started talks with their current clubs - but many are sure to move on.

The striker joined Blues in January after struggling for game time in the first half of the campaign at Forest. He has since scored four times and provided one assist in nine games, whereas it took him 18 appearances to get to three goals this season for the Reds. Given how much he toiled in the East Midlands, a permanent move westwards makes sense, but whether or not all parties can come to an agreement remains to be seen. The player's contract with Forest expires in 2023. READ MORE HERE Birmingham City look to have won the race to secure the signature of one of the brightest stars in their academy set-up. Blues are close to agreeing terms with teen defender Rico Browne on what would be the youngster’s first professional deal. That comes against a back-drop of speculation which has surrounded the 18-year-old for the last couple of seasons - and which has seen him linked with a host of Premier League clubs. The well-regarded centre back seemed set to leave Blues last season with the likes of Tottenham, West Ham and Brighton all keen on taking him, indeed he even had trials at Spurs and the Hammers. However, he opted to see out the remainder of his scholarship at Wast Hills and has played more than 30 games for the Under 18s and U23s this season. Blues are keen on making sure they don’t find themselves in a similar situation to last summer when Amari Miller went unsigned and ended up moving to Leeds United.

Having missed out against parent club Nottingham Forest last time out, the 32-year-old is back in the team for today's Championship clash with Coventry City. He will be looking to add to the four goals he has scored since moving from the City Ground, a loan deal which has seen him return to form after a difficult time with Forest. Taylor has scored more times in nine games with Blues than he did in 19 under Chris Hughton and Steve Cooper in the first half of the season. The former Charlton Athletic man has expressed how much he has enjoyed his time at St Andrew's and how good it is to be reunited with Bowyer. ""It has been absolutely brilliant.

Birmingham City is a big club with a big following. Bluesnoses deserve a team they can shout about and whilst I'm here I'll try and give them that."" Taylor has one year left on his contract at Forest but there is already a suggestion he could be targeted for a return in the summer transfer window. Asked about that prospect earlier this week Bowyer said it is one he would relish. ""You just look at the first game against Derby, his work rate is something I always look at and his work-rate was exceptional. His hold up play, his link-up play and his finishing. He is the all-round striker for me.

I think anybody else watching it if they don't say that that's their opinion but that's my opinion from standing on the sidelines.

The former Aston Villa, Birmingham City and Newcastle United boss was appointed to replace Valerien Ismael in early February, but he hasn’t been able to oversee a successful end to the season. The Baggies have lost six of Bruce’s 12 games in charge, winning just three times against Hull City, Fulham and Bournemouth. Bruce, 61, hopes owner Guochan Lai and chief executive Ron Gourlay give him a reprieve and allow him to rebuild the club’s playing squad in the summer.

But a run of four wins in 19 Championship matches has cost Ismael his job and left Bruce fearing for his. “I've said it before, the club isn't going to accept being halfway in the division, so my future, David Button's future, anybody's future, must come under the hammer,” admitted Bruce. “It hasn't been good enough - and that includes me too. “Rightly so, the club won't accept it. We have to accept that we haven't been good enough, and when you're not good enough, you have to implement change. I hope I'm here to make it, but we'll have to wait and see.

Johnstone, who has been linked with a return to former club Manchester United, might be left out of Albion’s squad all together. Button is in talks over a new contract and Albion aren’t currently planning to strengthen their goalkeeping department in the summer transfer window.

We haven't been able to get him a deal, so I'll have a look at Button and see how he does.” Button is one of several Albion players who live over an hour away from the club’s training base in Walsall. The 33-year-old still lives in Brighton, meaning he has to make the long jaunt up to the Midlands every day. Bruce insists Button will have to relocate if he wants to sign a new contract and wants all of his players to live in closer proximity to the Baggies’ headquarters. The manager added: “He won't live in Brighton anymore if he wants new talks. “It's something we have to address, I don't think travelling more than an hour can be good for you.

The Blues head coach felt his team were in control of the game at 2-0 up with 40 minutes on the clock - but he then watched things unravel as Gustavo Hamer caused set-play havoc for Ben Sheaf to score twice and Michael Rose once to turn the game on its head. Blues had been in a good position, having scored twice from set plays themselves. Kristian Pedersen headed home Juninho Bacuna's 12th minute corner, then Gary Gardner got on the end of a Marc Roberts long throw. But almost instantly, Sheaf volleyed home from close range, before heading home in first half stoppage time. Rose completed the comeback and Callum O'Hare rubbed salt into the wound. Bowyer said: ""I thought we started the game really well, I thought we were the better side. Then, 2-0 up and cruising, we think the game becomes too easy and we can take our foot off the pedal and allow them back in. We just needed to manage the game better towards the end of the first half but we didn't and half-time 2-2 was tough to take. ""I will put it down to being too soft,. You can't concede three set pieces in one game, that's not good enough. You have to take pride in keeping the ball out of your net and making sure your man doesn't score. It's quite simple really. But for some reason today we were soft at it and it's not like us. There's no excuse for that, that comes from within. ""We had chances. I didn't think there was much in the game, the scoreline you look at that and think '4-2, we took a hiding' but it wasn't that. Up until the 38-39 minutes we were in full control of the game. Second half was quite even, not much in it, but the scoreline was a lot worse than what the performance was. ""It's interesting for me for the last four games now because you can't carry anyone in this division. People criticised me before because I say things or the way I work with the players. People want to criticise. Well guess what, before I came this club was in a relegation fight until the last day for the last four years. That's not changed. ""I have come in and I am going to push them and get everything out of them I can. Sometimes you have to tell people some things they don't want to hear but being soft that's something you can't push people too hard. To concede the way we did today, it's not good enough. We were lacking a leader for sure. "" ",negative,liverpool,0

The Birmingham City goalkeeper was carried off at the City Ground after a clash with Djed Spence and was unconscious for several minutes. However, scans have showed not broken bones and it is not just a case of waiting for the injury to heal and for the 32-year-old to complete the FA's concussion procedures. Speaking ahead of Friday's game with the Sky Blues, head coach Lee Bowyer said: ""He is OK, thankfully there was no bone damage, it is just a concussion injury which is great news. He has got a lot of swelling on his face still from where the impact happened and that is going to take a while because it still hasn't settled down. He's obviously putting ice on it.

We will do everything right. He is in the good hands of our doctor and medical team, they will do the right things by him and so will I. ""It's premature to say we won't see him again this season because when I say 'do the right things' for Neil to finish the season is also a good thing. Medically we will definitely do the right thing and we will be over cautious rather than under cautious."" George Friend also remains unavailable while he recovers from surgery on his knee - having not played for a couple of months. Bowyer added: ""George has been out for quite a while, he needs to train, he is playing catch-up a bit like Troy. In their 30s it takes them a little bit longer to catch up. ""But George is not one of those players who will just ease his way in. What you see on a match day is the way he trains every day. You try to tell him 'Look you are in your 30s now, you need to slow down a little bit , you can't keep running around and training the way you do because you will end up breaking'. But that's him, you can't stop him. We will make sure when he does come back around the group he will be ready.""

There is a chance he could be ready for contention this Friday after missing out at Fulham. Robins told Coventry Live: ""Kyle looks ahead of schedule but we have to be careful. He wants to go out and play but we have to make sure he doesn’t break down again, so if it means he misses out at Fulham and is ready for Easter then fine."" Jodi Jones The winger who suffered a damage to his cartilage will not be available for the encounter. He is expected to be out of action from four to six weeks.

The former Derby County defender has spent most of 2022 training with Championship clubs in a bid to win a contract. He was with Birmingham City for a month as Blues looked at options to cover their defensive crisis - and then tried his luck with the Bramall Lane outfit. However, Blades boss Paul Heckingbottom has confirmed the 28-year-old won't be signing with them. Speaking ahead of Friday's clash with Reading, Heckingbottom said: ""Andre isn’t here with us now. When we took Filip [Uremovic], that’s when he went. Read more: Stalwart set to return as Coventry City team picks itself against Birmingham City Read more: ‘Interesting summer’ - Coventry City boss spells out transfer intentions and addresses loan market “He ( Wisdom ) was really keen to come here and we were happy to have him, because of the experience he’s got and the situation we were in. When the thing with Filip came up, he could obviously get out there pretty much straight away and so that’s when the thing with Andre ended. I’m not sure where he is now but we wish him well.” Croatian international Uremovic signed for Blades after leaving Rubin Kazan following the cancellation of his contract and has played twice for the Championship promotion hopefuls. For his part Wisdom now faces the prospect of a whole season with a club. The former Liverpool defender left Derby last summer as the Rams' transfer woes saw him go without an offer. He remained out of the game until February when injuries cut through Lee Bowyer's defensive options and against Huddersfield Town left him with only one fit senior defender. However, even after four weeks with Blues things barely progressed and he instead opted to try his luck in South Yorkshire. At the time Bowyer said: ""I don’t want to be disrespectful to anybody, he has had a great career the lad, give the lad some respect, but I just think someone who has been out and not kicked a ball for 11 months, it’s going to take you a long time to get fit “Seeing him play a couple of our games and seeing him training, that’s what he needed to do. We were doing extras with him after training and I think it would have taken him a while to get up to Championship level. He wasn’t ready to play in the Championship, not in my opinion anyway, some people might think otherwise.” ",positive,liverpool,1

Robins boss Nigel Pearson previously told BristolLive: ""To get players who are better than what we’ve got on loan is going to be hard, or it’s not going to be affordable."" This campaign, Birmingham City has managed to secure four Premier League loan signings: Tahith Chong and Teden Mengi (Manchester United), Onel Hernandez (Norwich City), Lyle Taylor (Nottingham Forest and Taylor Richards (Brighton Hove and Albion). The club has seen different levels of success, and things would have perhaps had a different outcome if Chong hadn't suffered a groin injury that saw him miss out on 18 games, between November and February. But Nottingham Forest loanee Lyle Taylor meanwhile, has been a breath of fresh air at St Andrew's, contributing to four goals and one assist in his 12 appearances for Lee Bowyer's side this season.

The 32-year-old is available again after missing out against his parent club Nottingham Forest last weekend, a game in which Blues clearly missed his finishing touch. The striker has scored four times in nine appearances for Blues and despite having a couple of spells on the sidelines with injury he has impressed enough to begin a conversation about him returning on a permanent basis in the summer. Indeed Bowyer, who also managed Taylor at Charlton Athletic, has made no secret of his desire to retain the  Montserrat international and considers Taylor to be 'the all-round striker'. READ MORE: Birmingham City set to secure future of Tottenham and West Ham linked starlet READ MORE: Championship spending power league table as Birmingham City braced for FFP overhaul Bowyer said: ""I feel when Lyle came in January you just look at the first game against Derby, his work rate is something I always look at and his work-rate was exceptional. His hold up play, his link-up play and his finishing. He is the all-round striker for me. ""If there is an area we need to improve him is in the air when crosses come in, that's his weakness, but I feel when he has played we have looked a better team, for sure. I think anybody else watching it if they don't say that that's their opinion but that's my opinion from standing on the sidelines.” All of which means Bowyer would love to have Taylor back at Blues in the summer. ""This is something that people upstairs will have to chat to his club and see where they stand with it but if the people upstairs say to me 'Lee there you go, there's Lyle Taylor' in the summer. I wouldn't be disappointed."" Taylor has made no secret of how much he has enjoyed his time at Blues but has refused to get drawn into speculation about a return to St Andrew's. He told BBC Radio 5Live: ""I think we've got six games left, so that's the first port of call. Then I'm off to the Caribbean in the summer to play four games for Montserrat. I'll enjoy a little bit of sun and we'll see what's what when I get back. ""I go back to Forest for pre-season and I'm sure there will be plenty of time to have conversations between the end of this season and next season starting, which is early this year obviously because of the World Cup. But yeah, there's plenty of time for those conversations to be had and to be told where I'm at and what the club want to do and what I want to do.

47,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-coventry-predicted-team-23678355,'Such a difference' - The two Birmingham City changes Lee Bowyer will make for Coventry City,"There’s been very little between Birmingham City and Coventry City for the last couple of years. The clubs not only lived cheek-by-jowl for two season as cohabitees of St Andrew’s, their last five meetings have all ended in draws. Even this season, when the Sky Blues put a little distance between themselves and their former landlords, both in terms of stadia and league position, their match in November produced a tight 0-0 draw. But Mark Robins’ men will arrive at their former home riding the crest of a wave after defeating Fulham 3-1 at Craven Cottage on Sunday and doing so with a threadbare squad and having had to name two goalkeepers on their bench just to make up the numbers. They could get a couple more senior players back for Good Friday but none will be as instrumental to them as the returning Lyle Taylor will be to Lee Bowyer ’s hosts. It’s safe to assume the 32-year-old will return to the starting line-up, we have a go at predicting the other ten. READ MORE: Birmingham City set to secure future of Tottenham and West Ham linked starlet READ MORE: Championship spending power league table as Birmingham City braced for FFP overhaul It’s been three at the back and usually two up front for a while now - which leaves only the shape of the midfield to determine. The likely absence of the hamstrung Tahith Chong reduces the chance of a No. 10, although there are several candidates for a more attacking central midfield role in a 3-5-2. Obviously everything depends on Neil Etheridge’s passage through the concussion protocol after he was knocked out at Nottingham Forest. Let’s wish him well but be cautious and work on the basis he won’t be available, Connal Trueman has been the next man up as Etheridge’s No. 2. Nico Gordon had a tough afternoon at Forest but should learn from the experience and will hopefully retain his place alongside Marc Roberts and Maxime Colin. So many options here, Colin and Kristian Pedersen could play right and left wing backs, Onel Hernandez has operated on either flank, Jordan Graham has spent plenty of time on the right. My guess is Bowyer will go for continuity which means Graham misses out and Hernandez plays on the right as he did, none too comfortably, against West Brom and Forest. There’s also decisions to make in the middle of the park. Gary Gardner is captain and Juninho Bacuna a fixture, which leaves one place for Jordan James, Taylor Richards, Ivan Sunjic and Ryan Woods. Loan man Richards is the most obvious of these candidates to lend support in attack. Lyle Taylor has made such a difference to Blues since he has come from Forest, they seem a much more muted team without him. His most natural partner is Scott Hogan who appears to be ahead of Lukas Jutkiewicz and Troy Deeney at the moment. ",positive,liverpool,0

Others had less auspicious stays at St Andrew’s struggling for game-time or to justify why they were getting any at all. Yet one thing unites the following former Blues players - they are all still plying their trade professionally and are yet to hang up their boots despite injuries, set-backs and a range of other challenges. Here are eight players who are yet to hang up their boots or, in the case of a couple, gloves years after wearing the Royal Blue for the last time. READ: Kieran Maguire insists even Jude Bellingham windfall can't mask Birmingham City's 'elephant in the room' READ MORE: Birmingham City make big contract decisions over three academy starlets A club great by anyone’s definition. He arrived on loan from Arsenal, moved permanently and after five seasons, more than 200 appearances and a Carling Cup winners medal one of the nicest men ever to wear the shirt moved to Sunderland. He’s now 36-years-old and although he called time on his Sweden career after Euro 2020 he is still playing for AIK in the Allsvenskan as the 2022 season gets under way. Perhaps the poster boy for Blues’ ridiculous trolley dash of 2017 which landed them in hot water with the EFL. No-one disappointed quite as much as Ndoye who somehow managed to play 40 Championship games for the club despite being totally ill-suited to English football. Few will forget his rendition of the art of No. 10 in the win over Cardiff in Steve Cotterill’s first game. He came from Angers, returned to Angers after one season then spent a year out of football after sustaining a serious knee injury. He’s now back playing and scoring for Parisian outfit Red Star in the French third tier at the age of 36. The Irish midfielder served Blues quite well in the years of austerity which Lee Clark put together his final squad in the summer of 2014. Gleeson carved out a role for himself under Gary Rowett and played more than 100 league matches before moving on to Ipswich, Aberdeen, Solihull Moors, Hemel Hempstead Town and now - Hitchin Town of the Southern League Premier Division. He’s still only 33. The Senegal international spent two seasons at Blues from 2011-13 and featured in the Europa League ties with Maribor. He made 43 appearances before leaving on a free and embarking on a tour of Scottish football that has seen a player who will be 37 in July play for Dundee United (twice), Hearts, Motherwell, Falkirk and now Clyde in the Scottish third tier. He’s still going strong with more than 30 appearances so far. If Gleeson arrived in the years of austerity, Camp came during a full blown famine when Blues were limited to just five free transfers. He ended up spending two years at St Andrew’s and whilst never fully silencing the critics, his penalty saving heroics led to a level of acclaim and affectionate cult hero status. Even at the age of 37 the former Derby stopper remains a goalkeeper for hire - and has done just that with Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney-owned Wrexham where the Championship’s record appearance holder is back up to Christian Dibble. The striker spent a couple of seasons at Blues from 2013-15 and had some joy with Lee Clark but very little under Rowett. He scored twice in 12 appearances before having a profitable spell at Mansfield. He’s now 37 and remains involved in non-league football. The 35-year-old scored five goals from 17 appearances for NIFL Premiership club Linfield before signing for Gloucester City in January. Spent aeons as back-up at Blues before ending a 12 year relationship with the club and going to Blackpool and to Bradford where he even earned a return to the Republic of Ireland squad. He played at Kilmarnock last season, returned as a goalkeeper coach over the summer and has appeared on the bench this season. The Honduran will be 40 in July but he’s still playing. He came to Blues in 2009 on loan from Polish side GKS Bełchatów and played eight extremely, the odd drag-back aside, underwhelming games. Stints in Romania, Mexico, USA, Greece, China and Turkey followed and he’s been back in his homeland for a number of years. He’s still at Lone FC in the Honduran second tier. ",positive,liverpool,0

The accounts, which cover the period from June 2020 to June 2021, reveal a pre-tax loss of £4.7million, which was down from £18.3m over the previous 12 months, with the cut mainly thanks to the sale of Jude Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund. Overall, Blues lost £30m from day to day trading in 2020/21 but Bellingham sale reduced this to under £5m. The account show revenue, including match receipts and broadcasting, slumped from £22.5m in 2020 to £13m in 2021 with the average attendance in 2019/2020 before lockdown past the 20,000 mark, cut to zero as matches were played behind closed doors.

Blues spent £37m more cash than they generated from day to day activities, covered by player trading cash (£15m) and yet more borrowings (£21m).

As they chased a goal, they were done on the counter when not a single player could get their hands on Josh Maja, who played Lewis Baker in for a simple finish. TRANSFERS: Steve Bruce provides triple West Brom transfer update as 'talks' planned POCKETED: West Brom striker Daryl Dike reveals the 'annoying' Crystal Palace defender he absolutely loves Phillips was highly critical of the defending from West Brom, who he thinks will look for solutions to that particular problem in the summer. “ The defending, especially for the second goal was terrible,” the former Albion striker told West Brom News.  “From Steve Bruce’s point of view, the experience he has in that defence, you don’t expect a player to be able to just run onto a simple ball in behind and head it in from 10 yards out. Get the latest West Brom transfer news straight to your inbox! “Switching off at the first one as well, a ball down the side and then the own goal from Livermore, it’s almost comical. He’ll be pulling his hair out will Steve Bruce. That is certainly an area that will be looked at over the summer for the start of next season.” Bruce suggested this week that wholesale changes could be on the way for his squad when the transfer window re-opens, admitting that ""we’re verging on a major overhaul"" and he wants to bring ""a fresher, younger look to everything"" next season. West Brom are at home again this Friday for a Championship meeting with Blackpool. The game kicks off at 3pm at the Hawthorns. ",positive,liverpool,0

It was reported this week that Man United are joining the race to sign the goalkeeper on a free transfer when his contract with the Baggies runs out in the summer. They will ""battle it out"" with Tottenham and a string of other Premier League clubs for his signature, it was claimed. Johnstone could still sign a contract extension before his current deal runs out, but the chances of that happening are slim, and Albion boss Steve Bruce admitted this week that the player ""is likely to leave"" at the end of the season. ISSUE: Kevin Phillips nails 'comical' problem West Brom need to fix in the transfer window TRANSFERS: Steve Bruce provides triple West Brom transfer update as 'talks' planned West Brom fans took to Twitter to react to the report, with many stating they were happy to see the 29-year-old move on, while others pointed to who they want to see in goal for the rest of the season if he is to leave. Here is what they had to say: Duke Ross of Malvern: To be honest if he has England aspirations he needs to go somewhere he will be going as 1st choice and that is not United. Henderson, who might well be a better keeper, has not be able to dislodge De Gea. Good luck to him. John Russell: Can go for me, no problem, as can any of our underperformers. Average keeper, makes the odd decent save but no great shakes. I dare say he’ll go to the highest payer to sit on the bench. Sarah: We knew it was coming and I'll wish him the best of luck, but he ain't gonna be number 1 for either of them, Lloris and De Gea at their best are better than him. I'd rather he goes somewhere to be first choice cos he deserves that. The First Albion: I'm one who never took well to him. Made some great saves, yes, but his high game worried him, which took a toll on his decision-making in coming for a high ball. Spurs at home springs to mind. We'd battled long & hard for them to sling one in, he dithered, goal, lost. Nick Wortley: He’s a good keeper, but he’ll find it hard to be number one at the top clubs and then won’t feature for England. But a massive pay rise - most footballers only look at the £ signs now.. Better prospects coming thru at the Albion. Brummie Tricky: “Wants to play in the premier league”. So a great idea signing for a club where he’ll be 3/4 choice and never play. Ryan Wise: He wants a return to premier league wages. Tbf, who blames him getting paid 40-50k per week to do 15 hours training. Mark: Going somewhere to play second fiddle at 29 years of age says it all really. Good shot stopper but lacking in all other areas. CHawthorns: He might get the move as he's free, but he wont play regularly for a top half prem side as soon as the coaches see the surprising flaws in his overall game. Especially for someone involved with elite goalkeeper coaching in the England squad. Get the latest West Brom transfer news straight to your inbox! All Things Albion: To be honest, good riddance. Fans have never taken to him, and he has glaring issues in his game which are glossed over by the fact he inexplicably gets called up for England. Positioning and shot stopping are the worst I’ve seen up our place since Scott Carson. JD WBA: Got to disagree on his shot stopping, he makes some quality saves. Its his distribution and command of his box that let him down for me. Let's hope Griffiths or Palmer gets a chance now. We need to start playing our youth more if TGH is anything to go by. Meg: We’re not going up this season, so drop Johnstone, start Palmer at number 1, let him get some confidence ready for next season. Aaron: Let Alex Palmer start the rest of the games this season, he’s gonna be our long term number 1 if he does well, so may as well give him his chance now Steve Deeley: He's like Dracula; doesn't like crosses! I know, it's an old one! He's not a bad keeper and will do well for a mid to lower premiership club. Ben Foster was a lot better! I wish him luck anyway. Howie Painter: Was a good buy for £5m but his form has dipped this season & he has made errors. Will do well to dislodge Lloris or De Gea. Not every comment was negative, though, with several fans wishing the goalkeeper well in the future... Martin Evans: Personally, I wish him good luck, no need for the negative comments, they just highlight what is wrong with fans nowadays imo. The Thursday Throstle: If/when Sam goes, I wish absolutely nothing but the best for him. He’s given his absolute all for #WBA for years, and we’ve definitely got our money’s worth out of him. He’s needs to be a Premier League goalkeeper, and needs to be going to Qatar with #England! Nicola: He has been great for us and gained an England cap. His contract is up, and he wants a new challenge, so fair play to him. Wish him all the best Albion News & Opinions: Tbh I used to think our fans overrated Johnstone but quite frankly I'm starting to feel he's underrated. Yes he's not been great this season, but comments calling him 'useless' etc are very unfair #WBA Jamie Rossiter: Some not happy with SJ. Imo improved a lot while being with us & has been picked for England so he’s not going to want to play at a mid table championship team. Last season one of our best players, this season he’s been decent, though I’d say his head has been elsewhere at times. #wba AdKido44: I'm not that bothered he is leaving but wish him luck. Andy: Wish him well. Typical Albion that he’s gonna leave for nothing. ",positive,liverpool,0

Albion wideman Phillips, 31, has been sidelined since early February after suffering a hamstring injury in one of Bruce’s first training sessions after replacing Valerien Ismael. He is now deemed fit enough to take his place on the bench against Blackpool. Bruce admits Alex Mowatt will be touch and go though after picking up a knock in the build-up to the Good Friday clash. Right-back Darnell Furlong would be favourite to replace Mowatt in Albion’s starting line-up, with Taylor Gardner-Hickman shifting into midfield. READ: Steve Bruce set for talks over West Brom future as Guochuan Lai prepares to jet in READ: West Brom transfer plans explained as Steve Bruce targets 'major overhaul' “Phillips will be involved tomorrow, he will probably be on the bench,” said Bruce. “I've got a concern over Mowatt, he's got a bit of a knock - 50/50 I would have thought. Everyone else seems OK.” American centre-forward Daryl Dike has barely played since completing a big money move to Albion from Orlando City in January. Dike sustained a serious hamstring injury on his first start for the club in January and suffered a setback in late March when he appeared to be nearing a comeback. Dike could be fit to return before the end of the season, but Bruce isn’t planning to use him unless he is certain it won’t prompt a relapse. Albion only have five Championship games remaining and there is very little riding on them. “There's the possibility that he might be back,” Bruce commented. “But unless I think he is bob on, I will still err on caution. There's nothing worse than an injury when you're a footballer, let alone when you've come over here from America, big money signing, and you've lasted a game. “It's tough on him and it's tough on everyone else as well. We hope that he can get himself right. Pre-season is huge for him.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Clarets have moved to dismiss their manager after a ten-year stay at Turf Moor following the 2-0 defeat to fellow relegation battlers Norwich City on Sunday, report BirminghamLive 's colleagues at LancsLive. Burnley are four points from safety with eight games to go and two of them are against Villa, with the Villa Park fixture scheduled for before Christmas called off because of a coronavirus outbreak within the hosts' squad. Villa will play Burnley at Turf Moor on May 7. Dyche's departure has come as a big shock because the 50 year-old has earned himself a reputation for shrewd management in keeping Burnley in the Premier League since 2016, when they were promoted immediately after relegation from the top flight in 2015. Read more: Villa tipped to complete stunning double transfer for something 'different' Read more: Villa transfer news LIVE: Abraham tipped as Gerrard talks up Suarez “Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,"" Burnley chairman Alan Pace said. “During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. “However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. “The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.” And Villa fans have had their say on the big news ahead of their side's two games against Burnley, with one fan writing on social media: ""Madness. Even if they didn't think he was the right man to move them forward, what a weird time to do it. ""You do know you’ve got Villa twice so that's six points there,"" another added, while a third fan said: ""Surprised he has gone and a mistake I reckon.""

56,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruno-lage-wolves-fans-news-23696391,Bruno Lage explains what 'surprised' him about Wolves fans,"Bruno Lage has thanked Wolverhampton Wanderers' supporters for ""making a massive difference"" in his first season as head coach. The Portuguese arrived as a relatively unknown quantity last summer to replace revered compatriot Nuno Espirito Santo, with an 18-month stint at Benfica his only previous experience as a first team manager. Wolves were unfancied under Lage, but he has masterminded a superb campaign which could yet bring the club’s best-ever Premier League finish. Wolves fans stuck by Lage after three successive defeats in August left the club near the foot of the Premier League table. And they have been rewarded with a remarkable run since the turn of the year which has put Wolves on the cusp of an unimaginable return to Europe. READ: Aubameyang's Barcelona demand could wreck £25m Adama Traore transfer READ: Wolves might have repeated Pedro Goncalves and Rafa Mir transfer mistake ""It was a big surprise for me,” said the Wolves head coach. “I have a photo from our first away friendly game when I came out and the people knew nothing about me but since the first day I've felt that good environment and big support from the fans. ""On that day we hadn't given anything to them and they were there from the first day giving us a big support. When you have the fans at your back you feel a big confidence. I've felt that since that day, not just in the building but outside from the fans.” With eight wins from their 16 matches on the road, Wolves have gained more points away from home than they have at Molineux in Lage’s first season. Away wins over Aston Villa, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have provided a vociferous support with unforgettable memories. ""They can make a massive difference,” added Lage. ""That's why after the Everton game my first reaction was to say thank you to the fans. When we play away, I really don't feel the difference. ""We've had a massive support since the first minute so for me it's not a big surprise that we are playing well in away games because a lot of fans give us a massive support to help us win games.” ",positive,liverpool,0

58,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-mcginn-been-sent-brilliant-18093781,John McGinn has been sent this brilliant message by Aston Villa pal,"Everyone perhaps has an alter-ego, and Aston Villa star John McGinn is no different. However, while you might be screeching Aerosmith lines in a mirror, or playing out a bit of Rose/Jack from Titanic, McGinn has an actual super-hero alter-ego, and one he has returned to during this period of quarantine according to Tyrone Mings. Meet Meatball, the bald-headed burst of midfield energy that barrels around the pitch, doing whatever he wants to see his team win out the day. A seemingly flat-footed bruiser who zones in on the ball, seeking beauty in destruction while paradoxically employing gentle technique to achieve victory. While McGinn has always stuck to the 'Meatball' nickname, during his days at St Mirren he embodied the true look and spirit of the name, charging around with the highlands wind whipping over a shaved head. However, while the Scottish superstar has thrived using his Meatball methods in England, he hasn't truly went so far as to go the full way. In quarantine, that has changed. McGinn recently shaved his head, bringing on a full return to his persona, something that surprised defender Mings when the AVFC Whatsapp group was hit with a picture of John's head - half shaved. “That came out of the blue to everyone I think,"" said Mings speaking to Sky Sports, after McGinn announced the 'return of Meatball.' ""When he put the pictures in the group chat halfway through his plan of doing it, we were all surprised. There was no turning back at that point."" ""The final result is something we’ll have to get used to. It’s not that pleasing on the eye but if he’s happy, he’s happy. If it makes him more streamlined and aerodynamic, more to our benefit.""

Whether McGinn's decision was one of style choice, boredom, or to paraphrase Frank from American comedy 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia', to seek an enlightened level of cleanliness via a shaved head, is currently unknown. Villa have patiently awaited the return of McGinn ever since his injury against Southampton, and with fixtures looking all but set to be played - behind closed doors - a new beginning for Meatball McGinn in England will be welcomed from a side desperately seeking a dominant pitch presence.

59,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-dean-smith-fonseca-18092268,What happened to the men in the running for Dean Smith's job at Aston Villa,"Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith was beginning to feel the heat prior to the break in play due to the pandemic. A 4-0 hammering at Leicester City had just made it five defeats on the spin with pressure mounting before the scheduled Chelsea game. The current stoppage, though, has allowed the boss to take stock ahead of Villa's fight for survival in the coming months. The job Smith has done since signing for his boyhood club back in October 2018 has been nothing short of miraculous, it has to be said. The former Brentford chief got his beloved Aston Villa promoted within just seven months while, last month, lead them out in a cup final. Yes, Smith has it all to do to attempt to arrest Villa's slump but he'll be backing himself to get things right once more. Meanwhile, after Steve Bruce was sacked last season, what became of the runners and riders who were in the mix for the Villa Park hot seat? Thierry Henry was odds-on favourite at one stage with Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris seemingly keen on a high-profile name. Others in the frame included Sam Allardyce and Brendan Rodgers, with late money being placed on Jose Mourinho's former assistant, Rui Faria. In the end and, after a gruelling meeting in the Hyatt off Broad Street, it was Smith who landed the dream job. But what about those in the running previously? Allow us to take a look... Top of Villa's wish list at one stage depending on who you believe - but Henry in the end reportedly turned down the Championship job. The Arsenal legend had just helped Belgium to third place at the World Cup in Russia working alongside Roberto Martinez. Henry, though, was now after a manager job of his own and, after talks broke down with Bordeaux in August 2018, the Frenchman was said to have held discussions with Villa. The World Cup winner soon signed to become boss at Monaco at the same time Smith was announced as Villa's new head coach. Henry's reign in the French Riviera was a disaster, winning just four times in 20 matches, leaving Monaco 19th before being sacked in the January. In November just gone, Henry signed a two-year deal with MLS side Montreal Impact, the side Remi Garde managed after Villa, funnily enough. So far, Henry has won two, drew one and lost two of his first five matches for Montreal. Rodgers was still at Celtic Park and was on Villa's managerial shortlist - only to rule himself out moments after a 6-0 victory over St Johnstone. ""I'm the Celtic manager and I love it and have lots of challenges here,"" Rodgers told BBC Scotland. ""Yes. There is always speculation, but I'm sure they'll have the person in mind that they want to bring in. ""Villa is a top Premier League club that's in the Championship and I'm sure, with their support base and resources, they will try and get back there as quickly as they can."" ""You can't rule me out because I have never been asked."" Rodgers did head to the Midlands four months later, but it was to Leicester City. He has since done a Premier League double over Villa this season with 4-1 and 4-0 wins but Smith got the better of him over a two-legged Carabao Cup semi-final. Rodgers, meanwhile, has performed wonders since joining Leicester City a little over a year ago, turning them into legitimate Premier League title chasers once again. Rui Faria was another one who reportedly turned down an approach to succeed Bruce at Villa. The formerManchester United , Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Porto assistant coach was sounded out via an intermediary when the vacancy opened up last October. Mourinho's former right-hand man was said to have been flattered to have been approached but made it clear he was not interested in taking the position. Faria did go on to manage a team of his own in January last year, Al-Duhail in Qatar but his reign lasted just 12 months before being sacked three months ago. The Portuguese, who won 20 trophies alongside Mourinho, remains out of work. Another Portuguese link - and a stern one at that saw then-Shakhtar Donetsk chief Fonseca in with a shout of the Villa job. The cool-looking European always won at least a double during his time in Ukraine and was strongly fancied by Villa's owners at one point. ""I have this dream and I believe this can happen,"" he said of managing in England. ""I believe a lot this can happen. If it’s soon or not, I have this dream. ""I have a big, big passion about the game and the atmosphere in England is amazing. ""I hope one day to live it. It’s the biggest league in the world. ""For any coach, to work in England can be amazing. You have the best coaches and the best players."" Fonseca left Shakhtar at the end of last season and signed a lucrative deal with Roma where he's won 17 of his first 36 games in charge. The last of the men from Portugal here due to the connection between super-agent Jorge Mendes and Villa's Egyptian owner, Sawiris. Sources in Portugal claimed thatVilla wanted to speak to then-Benfica B manager Bruno Lage, who was previously the assistant to Carlos Carvalhal at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City. Lage, meanwhile, stepped up to become Benfica manager in January 2019, helping The Eagles to the league title while being named coach of the season. The 43-year-old has an outstanding record in Lisbon, winning 50 of his 71 matches to date while looking nailed-on to win back-to-back titles. Is a next manager odds ever without a certain Fireman Sam? Allardyce was the stand-out favourite to replace Bruce early on before Henry, Faria and, latterly, Smith completed Villa's whittled-down, three-man shortlist. The man from Dudley had left Everton on bad terms the previous season and was rumoured with a move to Villa Park but it was never on the cards. With pressure building on Smith before the pandemic break this season, though, Allardyce's name began to pop up once more given his nous of helping clubs escape relegation. Big Sam did come close to taking over at Newcastle last summer but turned it down with Brucie getting the gig instead. The manager-turned-pundit is currently without a job. JT was said to have been in the running for a shock return to Villa Park - just months after packing up following Villa's play-off defeat to Fulham. Prior to Smith getting the Villa job, Terry's long-time friend Harry Redknapp said: ""I had a feeling John was right in the frame for the Villa job. ""He’s certainly a runner, that’s for sure. ""John wants to get into management – he sees Frank [Lampard] doing it and sees Stevie Gerrard having a crack. ""John is a confident boy. He’s just retired from playing and he’s thinking about the future, and if the opportunity comes to manage a club like Aston Villa, that would be a dream job for him."" Terry, of course, linked up with Smith and Richard O'Kelly at the unveiling to become assistant head coach in a role he holds today, of course. McCarthy was a free agent at the time after doing all he could at Ipswich before leaving the Tractor Boys in April 2018. The former Wolves man wanted to become Villa's man - but admitted it was never going to happen. “I didn’t think there was ever any chance of me getting the Aston Villa job,” said McCarthy moments after Smith landed the big job. “I’d been banging the drum for Dean Smith anyway, but I thought for a Premier League job because he had been excellent at Brentford, and I’m delighted he got the Villa job but sad for Steve Bruce."" McCarthy was always way down in the betting to replace Bruce, with Mick soon taking over the Republic of Ireland for a second time in November 2018. The 61-year-old stood down from his post on April 4 and has since been replaced by Stephen Kenny, formerly of Dundalk. Another manager who was a bookmakers' favourite moments after Bruce was axed. The Scot left West Ham United the previous season and was a free agent. Moyes, though, who met with Villa over becoming manager in 2016, wasn't fancied this time around and was ruled out of the running. Following the sacking of Manuel Pellegrini in December, Moyes returned to the London Stadium. The 56-year-old is one of Smith's main competitors to beat the drop in the Premier League with two points separating Villa and West Ham. ",positive,liverpool,0
