Rudiger is understood to have plenty of suitors, though, with Goal claiming that Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus are all keeping close tabs on his situation in West London. Man United are in the market for defensive reinforcements having suffered another disappointing season, currently sitting seventh in the Premier League table and six points off the Champions League places. © Reuters Ralf Rangnick's side have conceded 42 goals in 31 games this term - the second-highest tally in the top 11 of the Premier League - while doubts remain over incumbent centre-backs such as Harry Maguire, Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof. Maguire is the current captain of Man United, but has seen his position and status in the team - as well as his long-term future at the club - come under scrutiny this season. Meanwhile, Barcelona are also looking to tap into the free agent market once again this summer, with Rudiger's current Chelsea teammates Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta also thought to be on their radar. While their financial situation is no longer as bleak as it was last summer, big-money signings are still unlikely at Camp Nou in the near future, forcing them to focus instead on players available for free. Barca's La Liga rivals Real Madrid are expected to dedicate the vast majority of their summer transfer budget to signing Kylian Mbappe and Erling Braut Haaland, leaving them also shopping around for bargains to strengthen other areas of the field. The Champions League semi-finalists brought in David Alaba on a free transfer last summer and are keen to repeat the trick by bringing in another high-profile player for nothing. Reports have also suggested that Juventus view Rudiger as a long-term replacement for 37-year-old Giorgio Chiellini and 34-year-old Leonardo Bonucci. © Reuters All four clubs would be willing to offer Rudiger a lucrative weekly wage due to the lack of a transfer fee, while Chelsea themselves have not given up hope of keeping the 29-year-old at Stamford Bridge beyond the end of the season. Thomas Tuchel's side were in negotiations with Rudiger's camp over the possibility over an extension before the club was sanctioned due to owner Roman Abramovich's ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Those sanctions include a transfer ban which prevent Chelsea from tying down any existing players to new contracts, although that could be lifted if the sale of the club goes through in time. Four bidders have been named on the shortlist to buy the reigning European champions, with today being the deadline for final bids to be submitted. The prospective new owners of Chelsea could resume contract talks with the Germany international if sanctions are lifted once a sale goes through, and the four interested clubs are therefore keen to push through an agreement before then. Despite the uncertainty over his future throughout the campaign, Rudiger has featured 46 times for Chelsea in all competitions this season, scoring five times and assisting four more. In all, since joining Chelsea from Roma for £31.5m in 2017, Rudiger has scored 12 goals in 195 appearances for the club, helping them to five trophies including a Champions League, an FA Cup and a Europa League.

Said Benrahma grabbed a second in stoppage time to wrap up another victory.  It was a fitting result the day after West Ham unveiled a statue of Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore and Martin Peters – three of their 1965 European Cup Winners’ Cup-winning side who went on to lift the World Cup for England a year later – outside London Stadium.  Having defeated Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 in their Group H opener in Croatia two weeks ago, Moyes’ side are already in a strong position a third of the way through the stage.  The Hammers boss said: “The performance I wouldn’t put as high as some we’ve had this season, but we are still learning at this level. We did the job and we were worthy winners.  “It took a really well-worked goal and a good goal by Declan. He has stepped up, he has the ability to get forward and score goals and we are encouraging him to do that. It’s good that he’s got two in this competition already. West Ham United’s Said Benrahma (left) and Rapid Vienna’s Filip Stojkovic battle for the ball (Mike Egerton/PA) “He’s beginning to show a little bit more, I think he’s more than capable, and he’s got a great shot in him too. But overall he’s a really good, developing midfield player.”  It was a match West Ham were expected to win comfortably with their opponents struggling badly in the Austrian league this season, and both Rice and Craig Dawson hit the frame of the goal before they went ahead after half an hour.  Michail Antonio chested the ball down from Andriy Yarmolenko’s pass and raided down the left before crossing low for Rice, who had started the move on the halfway line before racing forward to tap into an empty net.  It was the first home goal for a West Ham player in Europe, qualifiers aside, since Frank Lampard wrapped up a 3-0 UEFA Cup win over Croatian side Osijek in 1999. Rapid Vienna fans take to the pitch to try to reach West Ham United fans during the match (Mike Egerton/PA) Sadly the goal prompted some rival fans, who had been throwing plastic bottles and winding each other up non-stop, to try to get to each other with police and stewards having to intervene.  That flare-up was quickly dealt with, although there was further trouble at the end, and even an altercation between supporter liaison staff from both clubs in the bowels of the stadium, with Rapid’s eventually being led off the premises.  Moyes added: “Look, we want to be a club playing regularly in Europe and we want to behave correctly.  “I don’t know who started it but we don’t want that reputation, we want to be seen as a club who can travel to Europe and everybody welcomes us. I was aware of some things being thrown.” A West Ham fan in the stands shouts at opposition fans after the final whistle (Mike Egerton/PA) West Ham had a let-off in the second half when German referee Tobias Stieler gave a penalty after Rapid sub Marco Grull went down under a non-challenge from Ben Johnson, with VAR correctly overturning the decision.  And Benrahma made sure it was goodnight Vienna when he cut inside and curled in the second in stoppage time.

It came as something of a shock after previously letting in just one in five league matches this season.  However, they have already experienced similar against AC Milan a fortnight ago when they let in two goals in three minutes just before the interval, resulting in a more difficult second half than they should have had before closing out a 3-2 victory.  “It’s not that much of a concern because I don’t think you should make these things bigger than they are – but we have to show a reaction, that’s for sure,” said Klopp before the squad flew out to Portugal.  “It’s really tricky to win a football game when you are not defending on your highest level and that’s what we didn’t do.  “The common opinion is it’s only about the last line but we had a problem in general with our defending. That’s why Brentford caused us problems and it wasn’t good.  “We have to improve in that department for sure but now is not the moment to be concerned.  “We spoke about it and we know we cannot do it like that. I think we have sorted it but we have to show it tomorrow.”  There is the potential for more defensive disruption as Klopp is likely to rotate his players with Joe Gomez and Ibrahima Konate in contention to come in at centre-back.  Liverpool’s last two meetings with Porto have seen them score 11 goals and concede just one and after both encounters Klopp’s side progressed to the final, winning one and losing one.  The Reds boss is not one for omens, however, and insists Tuesday’s match is a reset.  “It’s not an advantage at all that we won the last two games there, absolutely not. For them it is another reason to be motivated on the highest level,” he added.  “You only have to put yourself in the position of the opponent and the first thing you would want to do is make sure a similar thing doesn’t happen again.  “That doesn’t make our job easier for sure but it’s not about that. We don’t think about the last two games we played there. We think about this one.  “We didn’t think about the game before when we won 4-1 (last season) because it makes no sense.

Thiago was signed in September with the view to him being the key to unlocking tight games against defensively-minded teams but Covid-19 and then a knee injury in October's Merseyside derby restricted him to just a match and a half before Christmas.

The former Celtic man was not able to take part in Monday's dreadful 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and backup left-back Nuno Tavares endured a rough 45 minutes before being taken off at half time. Recent reports have suggested that Tierney could miss the rest of the season amid talk of surgery, with Mikel Arteta offering a pessimistic update at Selhurst Park and affirming that the defender will soon see a specialist. Arsenal have no fewer than nine Premier League matches left to play in the 2021-22 season, and while they remain in the driving seat for a place in the top four, Tierney's lengthy absence will certainly be felt from here on in. The Gunners face two relatively friendly fixtures at home to Brighton & Hove Albion and away to Southampton in the next fortnight, but Chelsea are lying in wait at Stamford Bridge on April 20. Tierney being ruled out for the rest of the season would also force him to miss the visit of Manchester United to the Emirates on April 23, as well as the London derby with West Ham United at the beginning of May. © Reuters As well as the crunch clashes with Chelsea, Man United and West Ham, Tierney is also likely to be unavailable for the North London derby with Tottenham Hotspur on May 12, which could very well determine who nabs the fourth and final Champions League spot. Arsenal face quick turnarounds in clashes with Leeds United and Newcastle United either side of the North London derby, and they will round off the 2021-22 season with a home tie against Everton on May 22. With Tavares not even lasting a full hour in his last two starts in an Arsenal shirt, Arteta has some big decisions to make for his side's final nine games of the season - the easiest of which would obviously be to keep faith with Tavares in his familiar 4-2-3-1 setup. Arteta also possesses the option of reintroducing Rob Holding into a back three and switching Bukayo Saka to a left-wing back role for the remainder of the season, but any time Tierney spends away from the pitch is sure to harm Arsenal's aspirations of a quicker-than-expected return to the Champions League.

The report adds that Ajax would likely demand a fee between €40m (£33.3m) and €50m (£41.7m) for Haller, who the Dutch side bought for around €22.5m (£18.75m) in January 2021.  ",positive,liverpool,1
