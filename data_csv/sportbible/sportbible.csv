Loadingâ¦ Liverpool booked their first FA Cup final appearance in a decade after a dominant performance at Wembley on Saturday. The Reds were 3-0 up in the first half and despite Jack Grealish getting one back a few minutes after the break, it was a relatively comfortable afternoon. A few players busted out the party tricks and one of the was Thiago, who produced something that shouldn't be possible. Thiagoâs pass to Salah.ð¤¤ pic.twitter.com/eTPm3N1ehG Under pressure from Riyad Mahrez, Thiago brought the ball down with his chest before spotting Mohamed Salah darting down the byline. The Spain international whipped out a stunning trivela pass which landed right at the feet of Salah. We could watch it over and over again. He clearly watched Luka Modric's assist in the Champions League against Chelsea and took it personally. Thiago was one of the best players on the pitch in a commanding Liverpool performance and fans were in awe at full-time. One tweeted: ""He was at this all day. Unbelievable balance and control."" Another commented: ""Wembley was made for players with this kind of talent."" While a third said: ""This man's pass/shots defy the laws of physics."" Thiago arrived on Merseyside in 2020 after a successful spell with Bayern Munich, but injuries hampered his debut season. He's become a vital part of Jurgen Klopp's side this campaign however and they still look on for a historical quadruple. City made a number of changes after Wednesday's chaotic Champions League quarter-final second leg tie with Atletico Madrid. One of those saw Zack Steffen replace Ederson in net and he was the culprit for Liverpool's second. Steffen miscontrolled a backpass on his own line and allowed Sadio Mane to slide in and make it 2-0. It was a similar situation Ederson faced when the two sides met last weekend, although he managed to clear his lines after being closed down by Diogo Jota. USA international Steffen started three of City's previous four FA Cup games and manager Pep Guardiola refused to lay the blame at his door post-match. Guardiola told The Guardian: ""I haven't spoken to Zack. It was an accident but we need him to try because thatâs how we play our football. It was an accident, it happens. ""Edi [Ederson] was close in the last game as well. We need that to create our football we use our keeper to move our opponents into different situations. I'm pretty sure Zack didn't want to do it. ""Sometimes the strikers miss in front of the keeper, other times the keeper makes a mistake. It was a decision [to play him] from days ago. ""It is unfair when you play cups and you don't play them. He deserves to play and after that he had a good game. He made good saves and is an exceptional keeper."" ",positive,liverpool,4

Garnacho, 17, was named in Unitedâs matchday squad on Saturday and was an unused substitute in the 3-2 win over Norwich at Old Trafford. Ronaldo scored all three goals for United, completing his hat-trick with a free-kick late in the match to secure a crucial win for Ralf Rangnickâs side. Loadingâ¦ Fans spotted a touching moment between Ronaldo and Garnacho at full-time, with the Portuguese forward appearing to gift the match ball to the academy starlet. Garnacho took to Instagram after the match to post a picture of himself and Ronaldo, alongside the caption: ""Greatest of all times..."", followed by goat, football, fire and love heart emojis. Former City striker Aguero immediately responded to Garnachoâs post, commenting: ""Because you still didn't play with the best pa @leomessi.â A post shared by Alejandro Garnacho (@garnacho7) A former Spain youth international, Garnacho was named in Argentinaâs senior squad last month alongside Ronaldoâs great rival Lionel Messi. Garnacho was called up for the World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Ecuador but did not feature in either game. United interim manager Rangnick has hailed the winger as âone of the most promising playersâ in the clubâs academy and has vowed to hand him his first-team debut soon. ""He has been training with us the last two weeks and he is one of the most promising players,"" Rangnick told MUTV. ""He is only 17, but if he keeps his feet on the ground, he will not only be sitting on the bench but will be playing for this club."" A post shared by Alejandro Garnacho (@garnacho7) However, Rangnick has admitted he is wary of throwing academy players in at the deep end this season as United chase a top four spot. ""It's always about playing the strongest available team because they are not friendly games and I don't think we would do some of the youngsters a favour if we bring them in at the wrong moment,"" Rangnick said. ""I love to play young players but in a moment when the team is performing well and playing with confidence. ""Then it could be the right moment to give young players game time but not in a situation like we're in right now."" Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

After being urged to shoot by the visiting fans, Bannan took one touch and then let fly from 40 yards out. Loadingâ¦ His shot looped over MK Dons goalkeeper Jamie Cumming and into the back of the net, to the disbelief of the home fans. Wednesday supporters on social media were quick to praise Bannan for trying his luck. âBrilliant. We don't see enough players hit it when it sits up nice.

A hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo dragged United to a 3-2 victory over the Premier League's bottom side. United fans protested against their clubâs owners before kick-off and the atmosphere soured further after the Red Devils threw away a two-goal lead during the match. Loadingâ¦ Chants of âyouâre not fit to wear the shirtâ were directed at Unitedâs players, while Pogba was singled by fans after another lacklustre performance in midfield. The France international was substituted during the second half to cheers from the home support, which turned to boos as he left the pitch. A section of supporters then chanted ""f*** off Pogba"" at the midfielder, who is expected to leave United when his contract expires at the end of the season. At the end of the match, Pogba was again booed as headed towards the tunnel. He then appeared to cup his ear in the direction of the United fans in a show of defiance. When questioned about the chants after the match, United interim manager Ralf Rangnick said: ""I didn't hear, but I was told after the game. ""I can totally understand the fans being frustrated, but I don't think they should be targeting players individually. This is not right or fair."" Victory for United sees them gain ground in the race for the top four after Tottenham and Arsenal were both beaten on Saturday. Spurs lost 1-0 at home to Brighton, while Arsenal were beaten 1-0 away at Southampton. United are now just three points off the Champions League places and next face bitter rivals Liverpool away from home on Tuesday. Goalkeeper David De Gea says the Red Devils must improve if they are to take anything away from Anfield. ""We know we are not at our best moment. The most important thing is the victory and we are closer to the top four,"" De Gea told the BBC after full-time. ""The spirit is there. Everyone is dropping points ups and won so we have a chance. It's not enough to be in the top four. We should control the game from the beginning and not give them chances. We give chances to every team so we have to improve a lot.

Loadingâ¦ Jurgen Klopp's side ran out 3-2 victors at Wembley to book a place in the FA Cup final for the first time in a decade. The Reds were 3-0 up at halftime and Diaz was clearly enjoying himself. Diaz's first bit of showboating came while 2-0 up, with Raheem Sterling the victim of a disgusting flick. OH MY GOD LUIS DIAZ STOP THAT NOW pic.twitter.com/OgKYjeH388 Fernandinho was forced to haul the Colombia international down, something that'd become the norm as the afternoon wore on. Diaz was at it again and this time, Fernandinho felt his wrath as did Bernardo Silva. The 25-year-old jinked his way past the pair with the ball stuck to his feet like superglue. It's just majestic to watch. I love Luis Diaz pic.twitter.com/vT0jL0Vel5 Diaz arrived from Porto in January and he's already a fan favourite. He's scored three times in 16 appearances and the energy on show is exactly what Klopp looks for in a player. Supporters paid tribute to Diaz on social media and they're excited to see him develop in a Liverpool shirt. One commented: ""I watched many times to see how he did that, I didn't get how he did it."" Another tweeted: ""He's a proper baller."" While a third added: ""Showed Bernardo Silva how to dribble here."" Liverpool took the lead inside nine minutes through an Ibrahima Konate header, with the Frenchman scoring for a third consecutive game. A moment of madness from City goalkeeper Zack Steffen allowed Sadio Mane to double his side's lead. Steffen miscontrolled a back pass and failed to clear his lines. Mane was able to close Steffen down and force the ball in, a stark contrast to last week's Premier League clash which saw Ederson coolly evade Diogo Jota in a similar position. It was Mane on the scoresheet again just before the break with a lovely near-post volley. City manager Pep Guardiola fielded a weakened side following Wednesday's dramatic Champions League quarter-final second leg tie with Atletico Madrid. Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker picked up injuries in the dramatic 0-0 draw and played no part. Jack Grealish netted two minutes into the second half to give Liverpool something to think about. City would only make one change, Riyad Mahrez for Gabriel Jesus, as they look to manage player minutes. Mahrez played a vital role late on as his cutback was turned home by Bernardo Silva in added time. Liverpool would hold on for the win and they'll face one of Crystal Palace or Chelsea back at Wembley next month. ",positive,liverpool,5

The United States international lingered on the ball for too long, allowing Mane to slide tackle him and score. Mane then put Liverpool further ahead shortly before half-time with a superb volley with the outside of his right foot. Second-half goals for City from Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva set up a nervy finish but Liverpool held on to book their place in the FA Cup final on May 14, where they will face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace. Speaking after the match, Mane told the BBC: âToday is special â we were playing one of the best teams in the world. âTo win this kind of game, especially in a semi-final, is a big, big, big win.

It was an incident that would land him a three-month prison sentence for assault. As a result of his actions on the pitch that day, Ferguson, who signed for Rangers the previous year for a record Â£4 million fee, became the first professional player in Britain to be jailed for an on-field offence. He remains the only player to do so. You can see the incident below. ï»¿ï»¿ So what happened in the days, weeks and months following the headbutt incident that left McStay with a cut lip? The following year Ferguson was convicted of assault at Glasgow Sheriff Court after losing his appeal and was sentenced to three months in jail. His prison sentence was for his third conviction for assault. He served 44 days in the city's Barlinnie prison before being released and was also banned for 12 games by the Scottish Football Association.

One of the key moments in the game came at 1-1 as Ederson miscontrolled a back pass and had to clean up the problem as the ball rolled towards the goal. As he went to make a pass, Diogo Jota ran to close him down but the Brazilian was the coolest man on the planet as he got rid of the ball. Less than a week later and Steffen was deputising for City's normal number one at Wembley and the American tried a similar tactic when receiving a back pass.

And before half time Mane had made it 3-0, as he volleyed it home with questions once again over Steffen and whether he should have done better. A tough game in midweek against Atletico Madrid, which finished 0-0, saw Kyle Walker and Kevin de Bruyne go off injured and missing from the starting XI, with Walker not in the squad. Ruben Dias and Aymeric Laporte were also left out of the starting line up, as was Ederson, as Guardiola attempted to balance his squad as they continued to chase the Treble. Steffen doesn't tend to play much but the manager does play his second choice keeper in cup games, and it was his sixth of the season across the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.

Loadingâ¦ Maldini represented the Rossoneri for 25 years and captained the side for 13 of those, leading by example. The Italy international expected perfection from his teammates on the pitch when it came to mentality. Among his charges were Andrea Pirlo, Alessandro Nesta, Clarence Seedorf and Gattuso as well as others. It was Gattuso who was hardest to keep a hold of with his famous temper regularly getting the better of him. One game in 2005 saw Maldini step in and flex his authority in a way very few ever have. During a heated clash against Juventus, Pavel Nedved went down in the box under a challenge from Jaap Stam. Gattuso wasn't involved in the incident but attempted to goad Nedved by telling the Ballon d'Or winner he dived. That saw a flood of Juventus players charge over and cause a scene. Emotions were likely high as Milan raced to a 3-0 lead in the first half. A young Zlatan Ibrahimovic can be seen enjoying the spectacle in the background. Maldini knew his side were in a great position and told Gattuso: ""Shut up and calm down!"" Gattuso looks ready to argue back with his skipper, who shoved his teammate before telling him: ""Don't ruin this for us."" It's believed Maldini told Gattuso, 'Stai muto', which carries the same weight in Italian as 'Shut the f**k up' does in English. The phrase is regularly used in the army and can only be used by someone in a high position. Fans have reacted to the footage and they think modern football needs more characters like this. One commented: ""When Maldini talks, you shut up and you execute what he says. Gattuso clearly understood that."" Another put: ""This is the only time I've ever seen Gattuso genuinely scared Maldini was an animal man..."" A third said: ""I grew up on this era of football. So many legends in one clip."" While someone simply stated: ""Maldini is the king of all kings."" Milan went on to hold onto their lead and win 3-1 but Juventus would end up coming first in Serie A. The title itself was later awarded to Inter Milan due to Juventus' involvement in a match-fixing scandal. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Barcelona's Bartra probably did the smart thing by cynically pushing the Real Madrid No 11 off the field when he picked up the ball on halfway. But as Carlo Ancelotti appealed for the foul,Balesimply ran off the pitch, through his manager's technical area, before sprinting back on to collect the ball - while Bartra coughed on his dust. Poor Marc. You can see his legs tighten up as he realises the F1 car he's racing has taken the long way round and still absolutely rinsed him. ï»¿ï»¿ Eight years ago today.Viva Gareth Bale. ð´ó§ó¢ó·ó¬ó³ó¿ pic.twitter.com/qoviwLNwld Bale, later clocked at a speed of 21.54mph, gets to the ball so far ahead of Bartra he even has time for a dodgy first touch before holding off Barca's centre-back (now beaten for speed and strength) and sticking the ball into the net. Ronaldo, watching in the crowd due to injury, looks amazed as he celebrates Real's winner. Olympic legend Boltlater called it: ""A goal any sprinter in the world would like to score... he's the fastest footballer in the world."" All this after Bale had already played 85 minutes of a fast-paced game that was poised at 1-1 between La Liga's great rivals, before he turned on the afterburners to settle it. The remarkable goal helped establish Bale at Real after his Â£85.3 million move from Tottenham the previous summer. ""I don't think I've seen anything like it,"" said teammateXabi Alonso. ""It looked like the ball was going out and he was under pressure - he ran off the pitch to keep it in. It was just amazing."" A dream final for Bale but a nightmare for Bartra, who had equalised for his side earlier in the match. It was the beginning of the end of his Barcelona career, as the then 23-year-old's game time had gradually increased up to the 2013/14 season - but it dipped for the next two in succession. In 2016, he was sold to Borussia Dortmund for â¬8 million, before moving to Real Betis in 2018. If it's any comfort, Bartra is not the first international defender Bale has embarrassed with his explosive athleticism. He became a global sensation while at Spurs with a pair of displays against Inter Milan in the Champions League, including him tearing Maicon to pieces in a 3-1 win at White Hart Lane. Warning: NSFW if you're a South American full-back. ï»¿ï»¿ Those were certainly happier moments in the Welshman's club career, considering what's gone on at the Bernabeu in recent years. The feeling that Bale prefers playing for Wales than Real, not helped by him messing about with a flag saying ""Wales. Golf. Madrid,"" following a team for his national side has not pleased fans at the Bernabeu. Even press in the Spanish capital have turned on him, referring to the 32-year-old as a parasite and others demanding that the club sack him, following his winner for Wales in a recent World Cup qualifier. He will finally leave Los Blancos in the summer when his contract expires but he'll always have the good memories of Champions League winning goals and one special moment in the Copa del Rey final to look back on.

Havertz, 22, is now the first-choice striker at Chelsea after taking club-record signing Romelu Lukakuâs place in the side this season. The Germany international has scored five goals in his last five Premier League games for the Blues and is now up to 13 for the season in all competitions. Loadingâ¦ In a recent interview with former Chelsea player-manager Glenn Hoddle, Tuchel praised Havertzâs versatility and compared him to three unconventional forwards from previous years, including Arsenal legend Bergkamp. When asked if he sees Havertz as an out-and-out number nine, Tuchel said: âIâm still not sure. âI see a bit of Dennis Bergkamp, Robin Van Persie, [Dimitar] Berbatov kind of player. âHe can play in the half position because he has good runs, but also feels free from the nine and creates overload to one side. âWhen I watched him at Leverkusen, I didnât know that I would coach him, when I watched him at Paris [Saint-Germain], they made him play as a nine which was very interesting. Thomas Tuchel met with Glenn Hoddle at Cobham, in this video Tuchel gives a tactical explanation on Kai Havertz : pic.twitter.com/HP94XyMXKq âI remember when I watched a cup final against Bayern [Munich] with my staff and said âthis could be a good role for him.ââ Havertz will be hoping to add to his goals tally when Chelsea take on Crystal Palace in the semi-finals of the FA Cup on Sunday. Palace midfielder Conor Gallagher, who is on loan from Chelsea, wonât feature in the match after his parent club rejected an official request for him to play. Tuchel insists it is the correct decision but admits he understands Gallagherâs frustrations after speaking with the England international. âI had the chance to speak to Conor, and I could also see his frustration,â said Tuchel. âWe met some weeks ago, we met after the international break by coincidence, in a restaurant, and we had a chat, and the subject came up. And I apologised! âBecause I know how competitive he is and I know his character, I like him a lot and it was a pleasure to have him here in pre-season. âWe play to win the game, the rules were clear when we made the loan. âI can totally understand the disappointment of Conor, but these were the rules when we made the loan and we donât want to suffer from our rules.â Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ After watching the Reds seal their place in the Champions League semi-finals in a 6-4 aggregate win over Benfica, Carragher laid out his Liverpool dream team. The CBS Sports panel asked if Jurgen Klopp's side were one of the best in history given the fact there's a quadruple on the cards. Carragher would go on to claim Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah are already worthy of being called Liverpool greats. ððððð current players make @Carra23's all-time Liverpool XI. ð´ pic.twitter.com/jAp5wBxxs0 He toyed with adding another current player into the team to make it four. The former Liverpool defender was torn between Alisson Becker and Ray Clemence in net, but eventually settled on Clemence. ""Well it would start with the goalkeeper, obviously, and that would be a toss-up between Ray Clemence and maybe the goalkeeper now, Alisson Becker. But it has to be Ray Clemence,"" Carragher declared. He'd move on to the defence and explain: ""I've gone for Trent Alexander-Arnold, ahead of Phil Neal who won four European Cups but I've gone with that because I think the influence Trent has on this team is greater than Phil Neal. ""Alan Hansen, before Virgil van Dijk came along, was the greatest centre back who played for Liverpool, so he's alongside Virgil van Dijk. ""And the position for Liverpool that is never set in stone, left back. Steve Nicol I've gone forâ¦ he was Footballer of the Year, so a special player and I've decided to go with him."" Alexander-Arnold is Liverpool's undisputed number one right-back and likely will be for the rest of his career. The 23-year-old is as important to their attack as the backline, registering a whopping 18 assists in all competitions this campaign. Van Dijk arrived from Southampton in a Â£75 million deal four years ago, a then world record fee for a defender. There were doubts surrounding the price tag, but van Dijk has gone on to become one of the world's best defenders. Carragher then made the interesting shout of Salah slotting into midfield. He said: ""In midfield we've got some legendary figuresâ¦ Mo Salah has got to go in. He is a Liverpool legend, what he's done in thisJurgen Kloppteam. ""Steven Gerrard, the greatest player to ever play for Liverpool, in my opinion, goes in."" Salah plays out wide and is shifted into midfield to give room for Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush up front.

Loadingâ¦ It looks pretty likely at this point that Ajax boss Ten Hag will be the latest manager to try and get the club back into the title picture, after nine years of failures. The 52-year-old impressed the club's chiefs into silence during his interview as he shocked them with an honest assessment of where they've made mistakes in recruitment and scouting. However, as it stands nothing has been made official and he has some big games ahead for Ajax before the end of the season, so it was a bit of a surprise when De Telegraaf writer Mike Verweij congratulated the Dutchman on the new role, during his press conference on Friday, and asked him why he'd remained quiet, with Ten Hag giving the perfect response. ""Because I serve Ajax, we need to win the two remaining trophies."" Ten Hag certainly has a lot on his plate with the Eredivisie champions before he potentially moves to England, and they're locked in two battles with rivals PSV. First up for the two sides is the KNVB Cup final on Sunday evening and then thoughts will move back to the league title race between them. Ajax currently lead PSV by four points, after the challengers recent 3-3 draw with Twente, rescuing a point in injury time having been 3-0 down. Each team has just five games left of the league season, so Ten Hag is in pole position to bring home a third league title during his time at the Johan Cruijff ArenA. There's a certain irony that it was a Dutch journalist who asked the question about Ten Hag's reported upcoming job, with Ajax having previously banned British press to avoid the subject. He may be concentrating on the job at hand, but according to reports, the man in the frame to replace Ralf Rangnick has already eyed up his first transfer target. Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is said to be part of the manager's 'master plan' as he compiling his shortlist to help improve the team. It's handy that he has his eyes on a midfielder, with Nemanja Matic already confirming that he wants to leave the club in the summer. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Vladimir Putin ordered troops to begin an invasion of Ukraine back in February and the conflict is ongoing, with a massive amount of casualties. Manchester City defender Zinchenko is a prominent Ukraine international and discussed the war in a recent interview with The Guardian. The 25-year-old spent two seasons with Russian outfit FC Ufa before moving to City in 2016 and considered his teammates to be friends. He's dismayed by their lack of action since Russia's invasion however and it's seen him question the friendship. ""I have friends over there, a small circle, but now it has reduced almost to nothing,"" Zinchenko explained. ""I'm so disappointed. The guys I know called me as soon as the invasion happened, texted me: 'I'm so sorry Alex, but we can't do anything.' Of course you can. ""If you stay silent it means you support what is happening in Ukraine right now, and I can't see why they would. Maybe they are scared, because we see pictures on social media of Russians being taken to prison if they protest. But look at footballers in particular, or anyone with a massive audience. ""Can you believe that, if all of them posted something on Instagramat the same time saying: 'Guys, we are against the war, we need to stop it,' they would all be arrested? Of course they would not. And itâs such a shame that they say nothing."" Zinchenko embraced with Everton defender and fellow Ukraine international Vitaliy Mykolenko when City travelled to Goodison Park days after the invasion started. City have publicly backed Zinchenko and he was named captain for City's 2-0 win over Peterborough United in the FA Cup last month. Fans regularly bring Ukraine flags to the Etihad to show support to their player. A number of Ukraine internationals have been backed by supporters in emotional scenes. Andriy Yarmolenko scored two games in a row for West Ham United after returning from compassionate leave last month. Yarmolenko travelled to Poland while away to collect his family, who had fled Ukraine. Benfica's Roman Yaremchuk, meanwhile, was reduced to tears after receiving a standing ovation from the Estadio da Luz crowd. He was then given the captain's armband by Jan Vertonghen.

The fans brain was so broken that he continued blaming the midfielder's loan spell at Palace days later, when Mikel Arteta's team lost to Brighton, and the 'loan' of Tariq Lamptey. Gallagher's form has been brilliant and it's earned the 22-year-old call ups, and subsequent caps, for Gareth Southgate's England team. It's only natural that his future, and the possibility of being in Chelsea's squad for the next campaign, has come up and Tuchel has confirmed there is a place for the midfielder in his squad. ""I believe Conor can be a part of our squad and can play a role with us,"" Tuchel said at his pre match press conference when asked about the midfielder's future. ""But I am not the only one to decide. We need to speak after the season with everybody, speak after the season about what Conor wants, we need to see what the situation is and what role we have for him that he can fight for. ""There needs to be something to fight, a role and perspective of where you are, where you can be, what you need to achieve.So we have to be very clear with him and he needs to be clear with us. ""Then we will sort it out. His development is extraordinary and outstanding. ""He is one of the key players at Crystal Palace and made a huge step in his development up front. He was a pleasure to coach in pre-season â he has so much positive energy, energy in general, and such work rate to give that he can have a big influence."" The Arsenal fan's point about Gallagher was that it's unfair he can play against the Gunners but not against his parent club, with the rules in England preventing it. He does have a point when it comes to that, and sporting integrity, and the midfielder will be missing for Patrick Vieira's side in the FA Cup semi final on Sunday. He'll no doubt want to keep up the good work he's done this term and continue improving and getting a good amount of game time in the next one. As well as generally continuing his development, there is a chance for Gallagher to make England's World Cup squad for the tournament in Qatar in November. That could be one reason he goes back on loan, even if it's just for the first half of next season, in order to make sure he doesn't ruin his opportunity by barely playing back at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's future, and Tuchel's potential to sign anyone once the transfer window reopens, are still up in the air as the club are yet to be sold. Current owner Roman Abramovich has bought a new team already, as his 19 years as owner in west London are coming to an end. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ The Arsenal midfielder is enjoying a fine season, having scored nine goals in the Premier League while also making his England debut in November. He's a fan favourite at the Emirates Stadium and on the whole, can't do much wrong. His new ink is being called a misstep though. In an image posted to social media, Smith Rowe now sports a clock with a lion underneath on his upper arm. ESR's new tattoo ðµð¥¶ pic.twitter.com/vNeLDpNNo1 The 21-year-old opted to include number 13 in Roman numerals on the clock face despite them only going up to 12. Number 13 may have some significance for Smith Rowe, but many think it's a poor design choice regardless. One commented: ""He might need to get the laser out for this one."" Another put: ""This ain't it man..."" A third said: ""On his body forever, damn."" While someone tweeted: ""A clock that would make Molly Mae proud."" Some attempted to call out the tattoo including IIII for four in Roman numerals, claiming it should be IV. Watches regularly use the IIII method however and can be considered correct. Arsenal are currently fifth in the Premier League having seen their top four charge falter in recent weeks. Back to back defeats to Crystal Palace and Brighton allowed bitter rivals Tottenham Hotspur to overtake them in the table. Manager Mikel Arteta knows every game is vital from this point and is facing an injury crisis at a key moment. Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey are likely out for the rest of the campaign, Alexandre Lacazette is a fitness doubt for Saturday's clash with Southampton. Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang joined Barcelona in January and it means Eddie Nketiah, who hasn't scored in the league all year, is Arsenal's only orthodox striker. Arteta was asked about using Smith Rowe as a striker and it's a role he thinks he can fulfil for the Gunners. He explained in his pre-match press conference: ""Heâs not been completely fit to be training and playing every game, but itâs a possibility. ""Itâs a position that I think he can fulfil in the future, but he needs training, and he needs experience in.""

Loadingâ¦ The Ligue 1 side are currently in a tough battle to stay in France's top tier this season and are currently third bottom, in the relegation play-off place. Their chances of staying up, or at least staying out of the play-off, were handed a huge blow last weekend when they were beaten by fellow strugglers Lorient, in a 6-2 smashing. It left Dupraz's side four point behind their rivals, with Clermont Foot a point about Saint-Etienne in 17th, with just seven games left to save themselves. According to L'Equipe, via Get French Football News, the manager has now asked the Muslim players in his team, which is about two thirds of his side, to not fast, in a desperate attempt to keep his team up. Following the defeat last week, the manager called it a 'collective catastrophe.' ""I explain the defeat by my responsibility,"" the manager told Amazon Prime Video. ""The responsibility of the coach is to repeat to your players that football commands respect. ""When we start the way we did, you canât make a big deal of it under the pretext that we were leading 2-0. You have to respect the fundamentals, itâs vital, and itâs what we didnât know how to do. ""Itâs a collective catastrophe, a sin of pride, a vain attitude, not an attitude that belongs to a professional player. ""On the road to redemption, there remains seven matches and whatever happens with the other scores, weâll be in the relegation play-off spot after this matchday. ""Itâs a failure, I deplore it and I take responsibility for it. In our behaviour, our attitudes, we thought too quickly that we were going to win 2-0. The attitudes werenât sufficient for what we had to do."" Dupraz has been happy to criticise his players in public previously, especially club captain Wahab Khazri and he is expected to make changes to try and keep his team in the top tier. However, asking players to stop fasting doesn't seem likely to help and Karim Benzema recently proved that Ramadan isn't a hindrance. The Real Madrid striker was fasting ahead of his side's Champions League win over Chelsea, and didn't break it until 13 minutes before kick off, and then went on to score a hat-trick. In Germany a referee even stopped the game to allow a player to break his fast, with Mainz 05 player Moussa Niakhate able to take on water and a sports drink during a match. The 26-year-old defender thanked the referee for the gesture, with the German FA confirming it wasn't a directive to do so but they did welcome the move. During Ramadan, which this year runs from April 1st to May 1st, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset each day. ",positive,liverpool,0

His mate then left for PSG and, after making just five appearances, following an injury when he joined, Aguero was forced off during a game with breathing problems. In December, the former Atletico Madrid player announced that he had to retire at just 33-years-old, due to a heart problem, with his cardiologist explaining that it was due to a scar near his heart from a previous incident.

Loadingâ¦ Benzema was the danger man going into Real's Champions League quarter final second leg, having scored all the goals in their 3-1 win in first leg at Stamford Bridge a week before. However Chelsea were the better side in the Bernabeu and kept the Frenchman quiet for much of the 90 minutes, as they got into a 3-0 lead to put them on the verge of the semis. Luka Modric's ridiculous ball to Rodrygo, expertly finished, took it to extra time and then, with a degree of inevitability, Benzema scored the winner in the additional 30 minutes. The striker was set up by Vinicius Junior, who'd also had a quieter night than the first leg, and footage has shown that ahead of extra time the Brazilian was being given some detailed instructions from Benzema, using his hand to illustrate what his teammate should do. Did Chelsea really think they were gonna win against players like this? pic.twitter.com/RDuYK7DeAW It's been a hell of a tournament for the former Lyon striker already, having scored 11 goals in this season's Champions League, but he's really come to life in the knockout stages. He scored a 17 minute hat-trick in the second half of the second leg against PSG, with Real 2-0 down on aggregate, before his performance at Stamford Bridge made it back-to-back hat-tricks. Wednesday might not have been as brilliant an all round performance but he still came up with the goods in a clutch situation, scoring one of the few chances he had whilst Chelsea's forwards missed all theirs. It's no wonder that he's already one of the favourites for this year's Ballon d'Or, which has new rules, including being judged for the season not calendar year, although Robert Lewandowski is currently the favourite. Despite being the man to win the tie for his side, Benzema was clearly impressed with one Chelsea player at full time, as he asked Reece James for his shirt. The full back was booked early in the first half, for a challenge on Vinicius, and it might have been a cause of concern for Thomas Tuchel's side, however James was brilliant for the rest of the night. Real move on to face Manchester City in the semis, after last season's runners up beat Atletico Madrid over two legs, following a controversial draw at the Wanda Metropolitano. Los Blancos won't be getting any help from their local rivals ahead of that game, with Diego Simeone walking out on his post match press conference at the thought of even giving them any advice on how to deal with Pep Guardiola's side.

To make it clear: she did actually know Croatia's former midfield playmaker/hopeless romantic and he wasn't just harassing a stranger. Probably. Loadingâ¦ But Rakitic really did have to put the work in to get his first date with Raquel Mauri, explaining that his lack of Spanish language skills really hindered him after he moved from Schalke to Sevilla in 2011. ""I don't know how to explain it... Whenever I saw her, it was like a bomb went off inside me,"" Rakitic toldThe Players' Tribune. ""Week after week, I slowly started to learn some Spanish words, and if I was struggling, I would use my hands a lot to try to explain what I was trying to say to her. ""She thought that was funny. She was like, ""Me... Jane. You... Tarzan."" ""I was drinking so much coffee it was ridiculous. I probably asked her out 20 or 30 times."" The reason for the insane caffeine intake is that the future life partner of Rakitic was working in a hotel bar. So he had to keep ordering coffees to make his (limited) small talk with her. ""She never said no,"" Rakitic qualifies. But clearly she didn't say yes either - and proving himself to his would-be love interest actually became a big factor why Rakitic succeeded in Spain. ""One day, Raquel finally explained why she wouldn't go out with me. She said, 'You're a footballer. You could be moving to another country next year. Sorry, but no.' ""You know, I'm not the biggest guy in the world, so I thought: 'S**t, maybe she sees me and she doesn't think I'm going to be very good and Seville will sell me in the summer.' ""Part of my motivation when I went to training was to establish myself in the squad so that I would be around for a while and this girl would finally have dinner with me. It literally took me seven months."" Eventually Raquel Mauri agreed to go for lunch with Rakitic and the rest is history: they are now married with two children. Rakitic also found success on the pitch, as well as in love. The now 34-year-old joinedBarcelonain 2014 and won a host of trophies - including the Champions League and four La Liga titles - before he re-signed with Sevilla in 2020. The midfielder also played in a World Cup final with Croatia in 2018. Raquel Mauri, meanwhile, has nearly700,000 followers on Instagramand has been with Rakitic for over a decade. Here's thanking his persistence - and incredible ability to keep drinking coffee - for their eventual happiness. Words by Alex Reid. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Northern Ireland Women's manager Kenny Shiels might have thought that women were more emotional, something Laura Woods called him out on, but the men can be just as led by their hearts. That was never more on show than on Tuesday night, as all hell broke loose at the end of Manchester City and Atletico Madrid's Champions League tie. Despite Stefan Savic losing his head, and Jack Grealish on hand to help him, the Atletico defender doesn't make the list of the most emotional players, though manager Diego Simeone might be top of a manager's list. That's because Bonusfinder, who compiled the list, based their research on players who cry in 'important games,' which included last game before retirement, knock-out stages of European / International competitions, âremontadasâ and finals. So it's perhaps no surprise that Neymar landed top of the list, with the PSG star not exactly one to hold back the waterworks when the time calls for it, with the Brazilian beating Cristiano Ronaldo into second place. 10. Mario Balotelli 9. David Beckham 8. Mohamed Salah 7. John Terry 6. Lionel Messi 5. Sergio Aguero 4. Paul Gascoigne ï»¿ï»¿ 3. Luis Suarez 2. Cristiano Ronaldo 1. Neymar Most of the players have pretty famous moments where they've been reduced to the role of 'cry baby' as the emotion, often of losing, has got to them. Neymar couldn't cope when he came within 90 minutes of helping PSG to win their first Champions League title, when they lost to Bayern Munich in an empty stadium in 2020. Ronaldo went through a period where he seemed to cry whenever his team weren't playing well in a game, especially if he was frustrated that he wasn't allowed to do more to help, nowadays he just chuks fan's phones instead. Perhaps the most famous moment of tears came in World Cup 1990 when Paul Gascoigne was left in tears twice in the same game. In the semifinal against West Germany, Gazza picked up a yellow card which would rule him out of the final, if England won, with Gary Lineker famously looking down the camera and telling someone on the sidelines to 'have a word with him.' The midfielder would not miss the final however, as England were beaten on penalties, and once again at the end of the game the then Tottenham Hotspur player was left teary eyed.

His elegant passing and composure on the ball sets him apart from the rest and it's a major blow for the Reds. Naby Keita has taken his place in the starting XI. Victory today would see Thiago win his first trophy in a Liverpool shirt, to add to his four La Liga titles and Champions League win with Barcelona and seven Bundesliga triumphs with Bayern respectively. Chelsea started the game brightly and could've been ahead inside five minutes through Christian Pulisic, but his effort was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher.

Sarah Kelly says she took her 14-year-old son, Jake, to his first Everton game on Saturday afternoon. He witnessed Anthony Gordon score a first-half winner as the Toffees went four points clear of the Premier League relegation zone. She claims they both had an ""absolutely brilliant day"" up until the incident after the full-time whistle. It was confirmed on Saturday that Manchester United were 'looking into' an incident involving the 37-year-old forward and a mobile phone following the club's 1-0 defeat against Everton. After walking past the away support at Goodison Park, Ronaldo was about to make his way down the tunnel when he appeared to drop a fan's phone on the ground, according to eyewitnesses. Twitter account @EvertonHub posted footage of the incident online and since, another angle of the moment has circulated online. In an interview with the Liverpool Echo, Jake's mum, Sarah, has claimed Ronaldo ""assaulted"" and ""bruised"" her son, who has autism and dyspraxia, when he appeared to knock the phone from his hand. ""At full-time the Man United players started walking off,"" Sarah said. ""We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past - my son was there videoing them all. ""He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was - he didn't even speak. ""Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son's hand and carried on walking. ""You can see by the bruise that he's made contact. I just can't believe I'm talking about it. ""I was crying, I was shook up, Jacob was in complete shock - he's autistic and he's got dyspraxia as well, so he didn't really digest what was happening until he's come home now. ""He's really upset about it and it's completely put him off going to the game again. This is the first football game he's been to and this has happened."" Sarah added: ""We had an absolutely brilliant day up until those final few seconds when they came off the pitch. It's completely ruined the day and put a bad taste in our mouth. ""He's an idol. Yes, he's not from Everton and you like who you like, but Ronaldo's a big player. My son's always been like 'Ronaldo's going to be there' - he's an icon. ""I'd understand if Jake was waving it in his face but he wasn't near his face, it was down by the floor checking his injury. ""He's an autistic boy and he's been assaulted by a football player, that's how I see it as a mum."" Hours after the incident, Cristiano Ronaldo apologised for his actions in a statement on Instagram. He also invited the fan to a game at Old Trafford as 'a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.' ""It's never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,"" he wrote. ""Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game.

Social media was full of praise for the Derby County manager, how he came across and roundly agreeing with much of what he had to say. Amongst those was being honest in his assessment of Ronaldo's move back to United this season, praising him for being a goal threat but not doing enough else, and saying the team needed to rely on younger players. All round not exactly the most offensive or out their opinion one could have on the 37-year-old forward who Ralf Rangnick initially dropped from his starting line up due to worries about his ability to work hard upfront in closing defenders down. However Morgan, who you have to assume is the chairman of the unofficial CR7 supporters club, jumped to his favourite footballer's defence, like a seven-year-old wound up by his older brother about football. Hmmm. a) Ronaldoâs scored 18 goals for Utd this season, in a poor side, aged 37. Last time Rooney scored 20 in a season for Utd, he was 27.2) Ronaldoâs still fitter now than Rooney ever was. 3) Thereâs no footballer in the world with greater hunger than @Cristiano https://t.co/Ta0ASbRQ8p Maybe all of Morgan's points are spot on, but it's difficult to take the man seriously when it comes to the subject of the former Real Madrid star. The two are friends, after the footballer was interviewed by the former Good Morning Britain presenter, and Morgan recently revealed a text conversation they were having. He has often referred to Ronaldo as the greatest player ever, often needing to put down Lionel Messi in the same statements to protect his favourite. The 57-year-old also ripped into Michael Carrick for dropping the all time men's international top scorer for one of his games in charge as caretaker manager. Perhaps the Arsenal fan was just annoyed having seen his team lose 3-0 to Palace and see their grip on the final Champions League qualification spot slip a little, to rivals Tottenham Hotspur. The former News of the World editor has been vocal about his annoyance that the Gunners let Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave in January, and he has been playing well for Barcelona since. Following Monday's loss, he once again berated Mikel Arteta for the decision, saying, ""This is actually a moment when Arsenal fans need to accept Arteta made a massive season-wrecking mistake in giving away Aubameyang & relying on Lacazette to lead the line. ""I said it would come back to haunt us - and it is."" Maybe he won't be happy until they sign Ronaldo... ",positive,liverpool,0

Maguire has been on the end of lots of criticism personally, for his form as an Â£80 million centre back and for his captaincy of the team. The latest ignominy for the centre back saw predecessor Nemanja Vidic claim the England international should only play against the 'easier opponents,' coming after a loss against a team fourth bottom in the league.

Loadingâ¦ United fans have never been comfortable with the Glazers owning the club, since Malcolm Glazer took their stake up to 57% in May 2005. Last year the fans were made more unhappy by the club's involvement with the European Super League and protested outside of Old Trafford, ahead of a game with rivals Liverpool. Some fans managed to break into the stadium and the disruption at the ground, and outside both teams' hotels led to the match being postponed. This week there had been talk of more protests outside the stadium, this time ahead of a league game with Norwich, and some fans have started early. Around two dozen fans are said to have arrived outside the club's training ground with anti Glazer banners, before police were called to make sure nothing untoward happened.

The interim manager, who looks set to be replaced by Erik ten Hag, was holding his pre match press conference ahead of the Norwich game. The Manchester Evening News reported that journalists had to use the rear entrance, normally used only by first team players, and that there were extra security personnel. A spokesperson for United said, ""There was a small and peaceful protest outside the Carrington training ground today. We respect the opinions of fans and remain committed to strengthening our engagement with them."" Whilst the club have continued to invest on the playing side of things, their actual recruitment and having the right people in positions to make them stronger has been criticised. Ed Woodward was often blamed for being a 'businessman' rather than someone who knew football, despite the fact he was in charge of football. However it's not transfers or lack of success that has annoyed fans, especially as they were 2nd behind Manchester City and on the way to the Europa League final when they protested last year. A lack of investment in the stadium, which has leaks in the roof, and the training ground, which has fallen behind new sites for City and Liverpool, and a general lack of communication or care for the fans has also added to the ill feeling.

On Tuesday he selflessly set up Mane for the Reds second goal, in their quarter final first leg, after Trent Alexander-Arnold's brilliant pass and then grabbed a goal for himself late in the game.

That has changed in the past 18 months with the introductions of both Diogo Jota and now Diaz, and any of them could easily start without much drop in quality. Diaz wrapped up the scoring late on in the game for the Premier League title chasers, putting them in a great position ahead of next week's second leg at Anfield.

It was an incident that would land him a three-month prison sentence for assault. As a result of his actions on the pitch that day, Ferguson, who signed for Rangers the previous year for a record Â£4 million fee, became the first professional player in Britain to be jailed for an on-field offence. He remains the only player to do so. You can see the incident below. So what happened in the days, weeks and months following the headbutt incident that left McStay with a cut lip? The following year Ferguson was convicted of assault at Glasgow Sheriff Court after losing his appeal and was sentenced to three months in jail. His prison sentence was for his third conviction for assault. He served 44 days in the city's Barlinnie prison before being released and was also banned for 12 games by the Scottish Football Association. Years later and the former Everton striker, who was playing for The Toffees at the time of being jailed, claimed he should not have been made an example of and described the headbutt on McStay as ""nothing"". In a chat with Everton fan channel Toffee TV in 2019, Ferguson opened up about the incident and his stay in prison during a rare interview. ""It was wrong me being there, it wasn't fair."" he said. ""I shouldn't have been in there and I think a lot of people understood that. ""It's not as if I was in for doing anything bad really. My God, it was nothing. ""The fans got me through it, a lot of them wrote to me. It was unbelievable all the letters and the support that I got. ""I got all the letters when I was in there and obviously you have got a lot of time on your hands when you're in there to read through them all. ""It definitely gets you through it and you never forget those things."" Back in 2019, John McStay also spoke about the Ferguson headbutt incident during an interview, where he opened up about his battle with depression following the clash in 1994. ""No one knows I had it [depression]. No one apart from my wife really knows."" he told The Scotsman. ""I was on medication for 18 years. It changed me, put it that way. I am not blaming the headbutt. Things happen in life. Getting divorced as well. ""I stopped playing football at the same time. Everything just happened. Things happen in life you cannot handle. ""But I lost a bit of belief, hope. I could not handle not being at Raith Rovers anymore. ""That's the thing, I was only 28 when it happened - it felt as if I was maybe in my 30s, at the end of my career. I was only 28 and that was it. Done."" ",negative,liverpool,0

City are just one point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the table with eight games remaining in the campaign. Since Pep Guardiola arrived in English football in 2016, Liverpool have been Cityâs most consistent challengers for silverware. In fact, over the course of the last four seasons, the two sides have picked up nearly an identical number of points in the Premier League.

In terms of his overall form, Maguire has struggled to hit the heights of last summer's performances for England at the European Championship. His poor form domestically has led to suggestions that the centre-back should be dropped from the team indefinitely. Last month, after the club's 4-1 defeat to league leaders Manchester City, former United forward Dimitar Berbatov said Maguire should be taken out of the firing line. ""Ralf Rangnick can step in here,"" the Bulgarian told Betfair. ""Maybe he needs to give Maguire a rest and give somebody else a chance."" There has been plenty of discussion surrounding Maguire's form of late and now, former United defender Nemanja Vidic has suggested that Rangnick could indeed step in and play the England international in ""easier games"" to find such much-needed confidence.

The own goal came at a bad time but that happens to the very best, that's just a fluke.

Loadingâ¦ His arrival back was initially heralded but it's not according to plan for the player or the club, despite the fact he remains their top scorer this season. The 37-year-old hasn't exactly been Ralf Rangnick's favoured player in his system, since taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in December, and the goals have dried up, apart from a recent hat-trick against Tottenham Hotspur. There has been questions about his future, especially if United don't secure a place in next season's Champions League, and it sounds like Rooney might be on board with him leaving. ""Youâd have to say no at the minute,"" Ronaldo's former teammate said on Monday Night Football when asked if the signing had worked out. ""I think heâs scored goals, heâs scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season, he scored the hat-trick against Tottenham, but I think if youâre looking to the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best and lift Manchester United over these next two or three years.

However, there has been a lack of options for the former RB Leipzig manager, especially with the continued absence of Edinson Cavani due to injuries and fitness problems. The club also loaned out Anthony Martial in January and Mason Greenwood continues to not be available for selection, whilst Marcus Rashford has lost form in recent months, leading to him not being an option for Rangnick. Rooney did name the four players who the next manager should build his team around, and Ronaldo missed out on that list as well, with Jadon Sancho and Rashford amongst them. Another man who the Derby County manager didn't mention was Paul Pogba, with the Frenchman's future beyond the summer still unknown, no doubt not helped by the lack of a permanent manager. Pogba's contract expires at the end of the season, and Rooney believes it's time the former Juventus man moved on, again, ""Itâs got to a point now that itâs better to move on,"" the former club captain said. ""If Paul is honest with himself, he probably hasn't had the impact he would have liked since he returned to Manchester United.""

Ziyech had the ball in the back of the net after just six minutes but the linesman raised his flag as soon as the ball had gone in, after Timo Werner was offside in the build up. Fernandinho was potentially lucky to stay on the pitch. He may have been reprimanded for a boot to Mason Mount's face, with the England player lying prone on the floor. The City midfielder once again avoided a yellow card just minutes later as he took out another opposition player. Mike Dean played an advantage but when the ball went dead merely told the Brazilian off. Ben Chilwell had the best chance of the first half when Reece James' floated cross went over two other Blues' players in the box to find Chilwell at the far post. The left back had time to take a touch but decided to hit it first time on the volley and could only direct the ball wide of Zack Steffen's post. City got their foothold in the game as the half wore on but it became a game of chess as the teams headed towards half time, with little incident. Kevin de Bruyne went off with an injury just two minutes into the half and was replaced by Phil Foden, proving the strength in depth on their bench. It was Thomas Tuchel's side who took the lead on 55 minutes, Mason Mount played a through ball for Werner, who got in behind City's defence. Steffen came out of his goal to meet the Germany striker who squared it for Ziyech to shoot into an empty net from around the penalty spot. Ziyech should have doubled the lead four minutes later when Ruben Dias failed to get Chilwell's ball over the top clear. The former Ajax winger found himself one-on-one with stand in City keeper Steffen but shot at the American's feet. From there, rather inevitably, Guardiola's side started to dominate possession and try to force a breakthrough, as the London side attempted to stay strong. Werner did have a chance on the break on 77 minutes, the German raced clear of the City defence once again but couldn't get a decent shot away and Steffen saved easily. Christian Pulisic thought he'd wrapped up the win for Chelsea as he put the ball in the goal in injury time but the offside flag was correctly raised. ",positive,liverpool,0

The game was played at a frightening speed for large parts and ten minutes before the half-time break, Gabriel Jesus repaid Guardiola's faith in starting him for the first time since January with a goal to make it 2-1.

Loadingâ¦ Maldini played for the Serie A giants for over 25 years and won the lot at club level, including seven Serie A titles and five Champions Leagues. The sweeper was adept to playing at left-back as well as central defence across three different decades. He retired from international duty after the 2002 World Cup and if he'd have hung on for four more years, he'd have added a World Cup winners medal to his trophy cabinet too. Fans on thetoptens.combelieve Maldini is worthy of top spot, but he faced stiff competition. Nemanja Vidic comes in second place after becoming a staple of Manchester United's success in the mid 2000s, while Barcelona icon Carles Puyol is similar to Maldini in the way he's a one-club man. John Terry and Franz Beckenbauer round out the top five, which is missing a certain Sergio Ramos. The Paris Saint-Germain superstar enjoyed a trophy-laden 16 years with Real Madrid, winning 22 major honours with Los Blancos. He's failed to reach those heights since moving to France last summer, but is the highest placed active player on the list. Check out the top 25 below: 25. Lilian Thurman 24. Ashley Cole 23. Djalma Santos 22. Denis Irwin 21. Dani Alves 20. Cafu 19. Gary Neville 18. Vincent Kompany 17. Jaap Stam 16. Rafael Marquez 15. Fabio Cannavaro 14. Alessandro Nesta 13. Thiago Silva 12. Franco Baresi 11. Rio Ferdinand 10. Gerard Pique 9. Philipp Lahm 8. Roberto Carlos 7. Bobby Moore 6. Sergio Ramos 5. Franz Beckenbauer 4. John Terry 3. Carles Puyol 2. Nemanja Vidic 1. Paolo Maldini There are a few interesting calls in here to say the least. Gary Neville is no doubt a legend, but he's somehow managed to rank above Dani Alves. The Barcelona full-back is the most decorated footballer in history with 46 senior titles across four different leagues and the Brazil national team. Franco Baresi also fails to break into the top ten, which is a crime against the sport. Baresi spent 20 years at AC Milan and won the 1984 World Cup with Italy.

The 22-year-old Donnarumma has been widely viewed as the best young keeper in world football ever since he broke into the Milan side as a teenager. However Maldini, now a technical director at the club, confirmed that the Italy No 1 would not be signing a new contract and will depart this summer. Maldini also defended the academy graduate during a livestream on the club's official Twitch channel on Wednesday. AC Milan director Paolo Maldini confirms Gianluigi Donnarumma is leaving as a free agent. pic.twitter.com/ntfKo2sl4Y The announcement that Donnarumma, who's played over 200 games for AC Milan, will be available without a transfer fee is likely to spark a battle across Europe for the keeper's services. Manchester United and Chelsea are among the Premier League clubs linked to Donnarumma, while Milan's Serie A rivals Juventus are also reportedly interested. But while the player and his agent, Mino Raiola, have been accused of greed by some Milan fans, Maldini was supportive. ""People sometimes don't realise what it means to be a professional, he did not lack respect,"" said Maldini, per talkSPORT. ""I think we should thank all the players who contributed to this incredible season. Gigio was a leader and often the captain. ""People sometimes don't realise what it means to be a professional, it means you must be ready to change club. ""It's difficult to accept, I realise, but it's also increasingly difficult to see an [entire] career in one team. We must respect those who gave so much to Milan and remember Donnarumma did not lack respect for us. ""It can happen that at times you have to take different paths. I can only wish him the best."" Hottest free agent in a long time IMO. Man can go anywhere https://t.co/VUP1DhH8yZ Star boy leaving on a free https://t.co/3kWtTqwSf4 Fair enough for Milan. No points keeping a player bigger than the club. Ungrateful child. https://t.co/Dc1rron7Y0 He's asking for a salary very few teams can afford. Milan already replaced him with a quality GK. Great business by Milan for not getting too emotional and pay a salary they can't afford He is a gold digger. Milan is bigger than any player. Left-back Maldini did spend his entire, legendary career at AC Milan, racking up over 900 appearances and winning Serie A seven times and the Champions League on five occasions. The Rossoneri will return to Europe's top club competition for the first time in seven years after they finished second in the Serie A standings last season. But apparently that is not going to be enough to keep Donnarumma at the club, with the player's contract coming to an end on 30 June. All imagery: PA Images ",positive,liverpool,0

But Rodrigo De Paul stuck out an arm to block a Ronaldo free-kick with seven minutes remaining and the Portuguese ace converted the resulting penalty. Ronaldo then headed in an 89th-minute winner from close range to take his tally for the season to a league-high 27 goals in 30 appearances.  The victory saw Juve climb into third spot on 69 points, level with Atalanta in second and AC Milan in fourth, but two points ahead of fifth-placed Napoli.

Loadingâ¦ However, Juventus have already conceded the Serie A title to Inter Milan and are now in a nail-biting race for a top-four finish after their 3-0 defeat to AC Milan on Sunday. Ronaldo has been heavily criticised over his defensive input for Juventus this season, which included his costly error against Porto in the Champions League round of 16. Both former England manager Fabio Capello and Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero slammed the five-time Ballon d'Or winner after he turned his back in the free-kick wall. Ronaldo's actions in the wall were further spotlighted last month after he bizarrely ducked and covered his face during Gaston Brugman's free-kick for Parma. Juventus boss Andrea Pirlo even admitted that the former Real Madrid superstar could be pulled from the Old Lady's free-kick wall after his repeated mistakes. One fan-made Twitter account has highlighted the various mistakes that Juventus have made during their lacklustre Serie A title defence. And the video attempted to disperse the idea that Ronaldo is the scapegoat for Juventus' defensive woes this season. Juventus are currently fifth in Serie A and are one point behind fourth-place Napoli and three points behind third-place Milan. Pirlo's men will face Sassuolo, Inter and Bologna in their final three Serie A fixtures as they push for Champions League qualification for next season.

Loadingâ¦ In recent years, Bale's time in Spain has been an unhappy one, with manager's, pundits, journalists and fans all criticising the Welshman. Last week he missed the 4-0 tonking by Barcelona in the Clasico but was back to play for his national team on Thursday night, as they faced Austria in a World Cup qualification play-off, scoring a fantastic free kick. One journalist writing in Spanish outlet Marca called the former Tottenham Hotspur forward of being a 'parasite' and undeservedly ripped into the winger. In a statement on Twitter, Bale hit back calling the comments callous and saying he'd seen the toll that the media can take of player's mental health. ""The Daily Mail shining a light on this piece of slanderous, derogatory and speculative journalism by Marca,"" the statement began after the Mail wrote a piece praising the Real forward. ""At a time where people are taking their own lives because of the callousness and relentlessness of the media, I want to know, who is holding these journalists and the news outlets that allow them to write articles like this, accountable. pic.twitter.com/6xKUl49MlH ""Fortunately I have developed a thick skin during my time in the public spotlight, but that doesn't mean articles like these don't cause damage and upset personally and professionally to those at the receiving end of these malicious stories.

""He's going to carry on lacking respect for the badge and the institution. And you want to wait until June? My god man...""

One of those came in 2017 when after scoring a last minute winner, he whipped of his shirt inside the Santiago Bernabeu before posing. His near two-decade association with Barcelona sees him ahead of Ronaldo, who lit up the fixture for nine years in Real Madrid white.

Loadingâ¦ It's hardly new information that Alexander-Arnold can pick a pass, the Liverpool full back's ability to so often find one of the team's attacking players is one of the most potent weapons in football right now. The 23-year-old has been compared to the likes of David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Kevin de Bruyne in the past, esteemed company, especially for someone in his position. On Tuesday night he was at it again, and his inch perfect pass found Luis Diaz in the build up to Liverpool's second goal, as they went 2-0 up against Benfica in the Champions League quarter finals. However, just a few minutes later he played an even better ball, turning away from his marker and almost instantly playing a through ball over the top of the opposition defence to find Mohamed Salah, unfortunately the forward couldn't finish. STOP THAT, TAA! pic.twitter.com/tlaxiL0Nto This pass from Trent was crazy. On the turnâ¦a dime to Salah. It deserved a better finish but damnâ¦.heâs special pic.twitter.com/y9xtwJwCAE Yeahâ¦ Trent Alexander-Arnoldâs passing is the best in the world.

Trent is a cheat code ðððSalah ruined what would have been an insane assist NO NO SALAH YOU DIDNT JUST MESS UP THAT TRENT PASS Salah should be subbed for costing Trent that beautiful assist. It feels a bit harsh that people were piling in on Salah for missing the chance, he still had a bit to do, but the pass was so good that it caused people to get on the Egyptian's back nonetheless. His pass earlier in the half, which Diaz headed into the path of Sadio Mane to make it 2-0, after Ibrahima Konate had headed the away side in front, caused Jamie Carragher to praise the man whose position he used to play in, but did it very differently. ""Trent Alexander-Arnold, the man I call the pass master,"" the pundit said on CBS. ""And that's why. Right on the money to Diaz."" His fellow pundit, Micah Richards, was in agreement, answering, ""It's a sensational ball. One touch, two touch and then there.""

Konate, having been brilliant up to that point, missed a cross and allowed young Darwin Nunez to slot home and halve the visitors advantage. It looked like the teams would be heading back for the second leg at Anfield next week with just one goal separating them, before Diaz made it 3-1 with just minutes remaining, before being pelted by a stick thrown from the crowd.

Loadingâ¦ Liverpool are favourites for this year's Champions League, so they were expected to make pretty easy work of Benfica in the quarter finals on Tuesday. Even with one eye on their big Premier League game with Manchester City, Jurgen Klopp still sent out a strong team against their Portuguese opponents. It didn't take long for them to take the lead, as Ibrahima Konate scored in the 17th minute, and in, double that time, they doubled their lead. Former Tottenham Hotspur man Adel Taarabt gave away the ball, it was given to Alexander-Arnold and the right back played the most beautiful long range pass for Diaz to run onto. The former Porto forward, playing against his old rivals, headed the ball down for Mane to finish easily.

Klopp's side have already won the Carabao Cup this season and their recent form, mixed in with City dropping points, have taken them to within one point of Pep Guardiola's side. With a semi final of the FA Cup to come against their closest rivals as well, they really are looking like potentially winning the Quadruple, and going one better than Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United side from 1999. Getting Benfica in the quarter finals of the Champions League definitely would have been seen as a positive for the six time European champions.

Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag looks set to become the new United manager at the end of the season, after it was reported this week that he'd agreed to take the job. The Ajax manager was the first interviewed by United last month, after he'd been placed on their shortlist along with Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique. That interview clearly went well, as he's on the verge of getting the job, and it seems that's after he was honest in his criticism of the club. According to the Sun, the Dutchman spoke to technical director Darren Fletcher and football director John Murtough and he didn't hold back when telling them what is wrong with the club currently. Ten Hag is said to have opened up on the problems with recruitment and scouting at the club, something that has clearly been very good at his current club. The pair of United chiefs then flew back from Amsterdam in 'shock' at what they'd heard but were also impressed with what the 52-year-old had to say. ""It was like United were being interviewed by Ten Hag rather than the other way round,"" an Old Trafford source told the Sun of the meeting. The former Bayern Munich II manager is said to not want full control of things with the Premier League side but did outline that things behind the scenes need a 'shake-up.' It's no surprise that the incoming boss had such frank thoughts on what's been happening in the red half of Manchester, as he's known to be a bit of a perfectionist. Ten Hag reportedly likes the grass on the pitch to be two millimeters, 'or something like that,' and that 'everything had to be perfect in his eyes.' Plans are already afoot for the next campaign and the transfer market, and has already identified one man to carry out his 'masterplan.' The report claims that French midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is the man who he wants, with the Monaco player said to want a move out of Ligue 1. ",positive,liverpool,0

Ten Hag, 52, is expected to become the next permanent manager at Old Trafford, with United reportedly close to finalising the appointment of the Dutchman. United are currently in talks with Ajax over a deal to secure Ten Hag's signature, with the Dutch champions set to receive a compensation fee of around Â£1.6m. Loadingâ¦ Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino was also being considered for the role but United chiefs have instead opted for Ten Hag, bringing to an end the club's long search for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's permanent replacement. Ten Hag's move is likely to be confirmed before the end of the season and the Dutchman is set to take charge in the summer, when interim manager Ralf Rangnick will move into a consultancy role at the club. However, Ten Hag's immediate attention remains with Ajax, who take on Sparta Rotterdam on Saturday. Ajax head into the match top of the Dutch Eredisivie, four points clear of closest rivals PSV. English media will not be allowed to attend the post-match press conference with Ten Hag this weekend, with Ajax chiefs keen for his focus to remain on winning a third league title with the club. Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill said: ""As Ten Hag was preparing his team to face Sparta Rotterdam, the media team were busily rejecting the applications from the English media to attend the post-match news conference.

Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag seems to have jumped ahead of Mauricio Pochettino to become the favourite to take charge at Old Trafford next season, as the club's latest permanent manager. The current Ajax boss is said to have agreed terms with the Premier League side, although there is no official confirmation or compensation agreed with his current club. Ajax even barred English journalists from attending their manager's press conferences earlier this week, to try and cut down on the amount of questions about his potential future job. Now it seems that they could be banning some German journalists too, with Ten Hag having received an offer from the Bundesliga. According to both De Telegraaf and AD, RB Leipzig have sent an 'excellent' multi year offer for the former Bayern Munich II boss to join them. The report also adds that Leipzig, who United's current interim boss Ralf Rangnick used to manage, are ready to pay the â¬2 million compensation that the Dutch side want to allow their manager to leave. United are also ready to meet the asking price, with Pochettino's much higher price one of the reasons he isn't first choice, but Leipzig are clearly active competitors for the manager's signature. Domenico Tedesco took over at Leipzig in November, with the club in the bottom half, after now Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch failed to replace Julian Nagelsmann. The team are now in fourth place in the German top tier and look like they could qualify for next season's Champions League. Clearly they believe that Ten Hag is the right man to take them forward, considering his record in Europe, where he took Ajax to within a minute of the final in 2019, and his ability to work with young players. United's most recent poor result saw them lose to relegation battling Everton on Saturday, with Anthony Gordon scoring the only goal of the game. As well as really annoying Cristiano Ronaldo, the result makes it extremely unlikely that they'll finish in the top four and be in the Champions League next season. Perhaps Leipzig is a better role for Ten Hag, that would be the latest embarrassment at Old Trafford in the last nine years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. ",positive,liverpool,0

Sources have told ESPN that United are preparing to finalise the appointment of Ten Hag, who is ready to leave his role as Ajax head coach at the end of the season to take over at Old Trafford. United have been without a permanent manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November, with interim boss Ralf Rangnick placed in charge of the team until the end of the campaign. Loadingâ¦ The Premier League club have been conducting a thorough search for Solskjaer's replacement and have now settled on Ten Hag, after holding talks with the Dutchman last month. The 52-year-old had reportedly been on a four-man shortlist along with PSG head coach Mauricio Pochettino, Spain manager Luis Enrique and Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui. Unitedâs football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher have been responsible for the recruitment process, and have reported to chief executive Richard Arnold - with joint-chairman Joel Glazer having the final say. Sources have told ESPN that while some at the club were considering Pochettino for the role, Arnold and Glazer are in agreement that Ten Hag is the best candidate for the job. The report also claims that Rene Meulensteen, who was a first-team coach under former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson between 2007 and 2013, is being considered as Ten Hag's assistant manager. Former England manager Steve McClaren, who was Ferguson's No 2 at Old Trafford between 1999 and 2001, has also been linked with the job, having previously worked alongside Ten Hag at Dutch club Twente. According to the report, the managerial vacancy came down to a 'straight shootout' between Ten Hag and Pochettino. Former Tottenham manager Pochettino was initially the favoured candidate to replace Solskjaer. But a combination of PSG's dramatic defeat to Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League and the potential cost of releasing Pochettino from the final 12 months of his contract at the Parc des Princes have convinced United to opt for Ten Hag. According to the report, PSG are willing to hold out for a Â£15m compensation package from United for Pochettino, while the Premier League club will only have to pay Ajax a fee of Â£1.7m for Ten Hag.

He replaced Michail Antonio in the 51st minute and received a thunderous ovation from all 60,000 inside the London Stadium. The 32-year-old left his mark on the contest 19 minutes later after smashing home a Said Benrahma pass with the outside of his boot. Yarmolenko ðºð¦ðð¼ pic.twitter.com/IXMGaTSz5E Yarmolenko's teammates immediately swarmed him in celebration, but he could do nothing but collapse to his knees with his head in his hands. West Ham's stadium announcer then announced the goal as being 'for West Ham and Ukraine' as everyone in the stadium applauded. The former Borussia Dortmund man would regain his composure and he wiped his face after hearing the home fan's joy for him. It was Yarmolenko's first goal since July 2020, which also came against Villa. West Ham would end up winning the game 2-1 to keep their slim top four hopes alive. Pablo Fornals added a second in the 82nd minute, before Jacob Ramsey scored a consolation for Villa in added time. Yarmolenko is one of three Ukraine internationals in the Premier League, with the other two being Oleksandr Zinchenko at Manchester City and Everton defender Vitaliy Mykolenko. Zinchenko and Mykolenko embraced when their two sides met last month. Yarmolenko travelled to Poland while on compassionate leave to collect his family, who had fled Ukraine. Hammers manager David Moyes said pre-match he expected a positive reaction for Yarmolenko. ""Undoubtedly and rightly so. You've seen the response from Premier League clubs who have Ukrainian players,"" the Scot said per Sunday World. ""We're all huge supporters of the players and we're huge supporters of Ukraine. We want the war to end, we want Ukrainians to be happy and be free. ""We're the same for Yarmolenko, weâre always thinking about him and his family because all the Ukrainian (players) have got family members in the country, whether that be brothers, sisters, mums, dads, cousins or nieces, whatever it may be, I think they have all got members of their family in the country.""

Palace dented Arsenal's top four hopes with a 3-0 win at Selhurst Park on Monday night. Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew and Wilfried Zaha all scored for Palace, while England international Gallagher produced another impressive display in midfield. Speaking after the match, Arsenal fan Julian expressed his frustration that Gallagher is allowed to play Chelseaâs rivals this season but not his parent club. âOne detail of why they were really good was Conor Gallagher, who I thought was absolutely exceptional,â he told AFTV after the match. âThen I think of who he plays for. He plays for Chelsea. Who are we competing with? Chelsea. âFor me, I donât understand this rule around loan singings. Itâs all very well putting the odd player out on loan but last season Chelsea had 32 players out on loan. ð£ ""The loan system is defeating the integrity of the league.""#CRYARS #Arsenal #AFC pic.twitter.com/rTUynfBQRn âI understand why they need to go out on loan and get some experience but it almost seems like its defeating the integrity of the league. âBecause if you put these players into the same league that Chelsea are competing in, in effect youâre playing good Chelsea players when youâre not even playing Chelsea. âHowever, when Palace have to play Chelsea, heâs not able to play. Explain that one.â Gallagher joined Palace on loan from Chelsea at the start of the season and has gone on to score eight goals in 31 games for Patrick Vieira's side. Defeat for Arsenal on Monday night leaves them fifth in the Premier League, outside the Champions League places on goal difference. They remain level on points with fourth-place Tottenham, having played a game less than their bitter rivals, and are five points behind third-place Chelsea. The race for the top four is set to go down to the final weeks of the season and could be decided by the rearranged north London derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

One Gunners' fan has provided us with the latest clip of hilarity, blaming Tariq Lamptey's 'loan' from Chelsea as the reason for their defeat to Brighton. Loadingâ¦ Arsenal took another knock to their top four ambitions on Saturday afternoon, just days after being embarrassed by Crystal Palace, in a 3-0 win by Patrick Vieira's team. The weekend was Brighton's turn to pick up three points, as Graham Potter's side won 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, after failing to win the previous seven games. Brighton didn't even start Lamptey, one of their most talented players, with the wing back coming on with 13 minutes to play, and his side 2-0 ahead. Yet that didn't stop AFTV's presenter asking if Lamptey's 'loan' from Chelsea was a problem, despite the 21-year-old signing permanently from the Blues in January 2020! The fan said 'it's all problem,' talking about the loan system in England, before going on to talk solely about Crystal Palace, and their results. He was of course referencing the fact that Vieira's side have actually loaned Conor Gallagher this season, with the midfielder in form for the Eagles against Arsenal less than a week ago, and he'd laid into the loan system following the game just five days before his newest rant. There is a point to his complaint, about Gallagher, and the fact that loan players can't play against their parent club in England, which does affect the integrity of the competition. That doesn't happen in Europe, where players can face the team they're on loan from, which happened to PSG this season when goalkeeper Marcin Bulka helped knock them out of the Coup de France with his performance in a penalty shoot-out for Nice. Despite perhaps having at very least a partially good point about Gallagher, the fact that the loans were being blamed for their two losses, and the fact that Lamptey isn't even on loan, caused much hilarity from rival fans. This fanbase is all slowly morphing into Ty https://t.co/DO2VsuA9KW lamptey came on in the 77th minute have some shame omg https://t.co/i1Mi0Ab4nC Things don't even get any easier for the anti loan brigade, with the Gunners set to come up against Southampton next, who just lost 6-0 to Chelsea. Ralph Hassenhutl's side have Armando Broja upfront, on loan from the Blues, and he couldn't play against his parent club in that game, a goal against Mikel Arteta's side would cause this one specific fan to lose his head. The Saints also have Tino Livramento at right back who, like Lamptey, moved from Chelsea on a permanent deal, but that doesn't seem to matter too much. Arsenal's latest loss, couple with Tottenham Hotspur's win against Aston Villa, later on Saturday, left them three points off the top four, though they do have a game in hand a north London derby to play.

The 21-year-old midfielder has been a revelation for the Eagles this season. In 15 Premier League appearances, he has contributed massively in terms of his output, notching six goals and three assists. In fact, Gallagher's impressive run of form has brought speculation that European champions Chelsea could recall the player in January, with his goals being a huge factor in Palace's respectable league position. That being said, it now looks like Gallagher will stay at Selhurst Park for the remainder of the 2021/22 campaign after it emerged that the midfielder has made enough appearances to prevent a January recall from being activated by Chelsea, report The Athletic. The same can be said for Billy Gilmour, who is on a season-long loan at Premier League strugglers Norwich. Gallagher, who made his senior England debut against San Marino in November, scored a brace against Everton on Sunday to end Palace's run of four games without a win. He gave a cracking post-match interview after the game. ""The last goal - that feeling is incredible,"" he told Sky Sports after the game. ""I love it.

Loadingâ¦ It was a painful night for Tuchel as he saw all his side's good work undone in a matter of minutes, either side of the 90 minute mark. Chelsea had come out of the blocks firing on all cylinders in the Bernabeu, as they hoped to overturn the 3-1 deficit from the first leg thanks to Karim Benzema's hat-trick, and they looked on course to make it through late in the second half. After goals from Mason Mount and Antonio Rudiger put them level, Marcos Alonso was adjudged to have handled the ball in what would have been the goal to put the Blues ahead. It was VAR thar ruled the goal out, and Tuchel wasn't at all happy that referee Szymon Marciniak didn't check the monitor himself to make the decision. ""I didn't see the goal that was disallowed. I'm very, very disappointed for the referee that he didn't check it by himself. Absolutely disappointed,"" the German told BT Sport after the game. ""I had the feeling both matches that it was like 51 on the other side with all the decisions made. That's what it is if you play Real Madrid in the Champions League. Unlucky today."" Loadingâ¦ It wasn't the only thing that annoyed the German though, with Marciniak conversation with Real boss Ancelotti also annoying him. Tuchel claimed that the ref was 'unprofessional' for having a laugh with the Italian, though he did note that Ancelotti is a nice guy. ""I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with Carlo,"" Tuchel added in his post match press conference. ""I know that Carlo is a gentleman and a nice guy but when I wanted to go and say thank you, I saw him smiling and laughing loud with the opponentâs coach. ""I think this is the very, very wrong time to do this after the final whistle, 126 minutes of a team giving their heart and fighting to the last drop.

Both the midfielder and defender were at some fault for Benzema's winning goal, his seventh strike in the past three Champions League games for Los Blancos, as Kante failed to close down a pass and Rudiger slipped. That might not have made much difference, with the Real striker's movement so impressive, as Thierry Henry expertly explained after full time.

On commentary it was noted that Odegaard had made his Real debut coming on for Ronaldo, with Keown piping up to say, ""[Smith Rowe] Isn't that good yet, but he might be in the future.""

In the immediate future though, the manager is worried about the hip injury the England under 20 player suffered, ""I'm concerned because for Emile to come out and say, 'I cannot continue playing'... It should be something related to his hip. ""I don't know how bad he is but he was in a good place after the game.""

Loadingâ¦ Messi's move to PSG hasn't been confirmed but reports have claimed that the former Barcelona forward is set to move to the Ligue 1 giants. It's claimed that things are so far advanced that he will arrive in the French capital as early as Sunday, just hours after his farewell press conference at the Nou Camp, and have his medical in the next 24 hours. The move promises to make any game against PSG a daunting task, especially for their domestic rivals, with Mauricio Pochettino potentially about to be able to field a front three of Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. However, despite how troublesome that will be for defences, Brest boss Der Zakarian is clearly very 'excited' about the move. ""We say that we have a s**t league, but if we manage to bring in a player like that it would be exceptional,"" the Armenian said. ""I'm not going to be polite here, but it [the transfer] gives me a hard-on."" :flag_fr: #Ligue1 :airplane: #Mercato:microphone2:ï¸ Der Zakarian sur la rumeur Messi au PSG : ""Ãa me fait bander"" pic.twitter.com/7nxOyf8Rgn The top tier in France has often been described as a 'farmer's league' with fans outside of the country playing down the achievements of some players inside it. PSG's financial strength being so much bigger than their rivals has also led to their domination of the league to be dismissed. However they have failed to win Ligue 1 in two of the previous five seasons, including the last campaign, when they missed out to Lille. Messi's signing will add some extra interest to the league, and no doubt improve PSG's chances of winning the Champions League, but he may not actually form a partnership including Mbappe. According to reports, the France forward doesn't want to stay at the Parc des Princes if the six time Ballon d'Or winner joins the club. The World Cup winner reportedly wants to be the main man in the French capital and worries the signing means he won't be, that thinking mirrors the reason Neymar left Barcelona in the first place.

Loadingâ¦ It's hardly new information that PSG spent a ridiculous amount of money, they are backed by an oil rich country after all and have the most expensive players in the football history in their team. The fact that Neymar, Messi and Mbappe rake in the cash in every week will come as a surprise to no one, even if the Brazilian being above his teammates might not have been as predictable. It's not just their misfiring front three of ridiculous talent, that fans have recently booed, who get paid a lot though, with most of Mauricio Pochettino's squad earning more than their league rivals. According to L'Equipe, all but two of the 20 highest earners in France's top tier belong in Pochettino's side, with only Monaco pair Wissam ben Yedder and Cesc Fabregas breaking up the Parisien monopoly. The wages on the list are monthly wages, meaning that Neymar is getting over â¬4 million-a-month, and more than a million euros a week! Not too far behind him is Messi, whose transfer fee was nothing, saving PSG a bit of money but undoubtedly costing them more in wages. Mbappe is actually quite a way behind his two strike partners, which might have something to do with his probably move to Real Madrid in the summer, when his contract expires. If the former Monaco forward is feeling short changed then he's certainly hoping to make up for it with his proposed transfer, or at least his mum is. According to one report, Fayza Lamari wants Los Blancos to hand over Â£125 million in a signing on fee, in order to guarantee her son's signature for next season. PSG could get rid of even more money off their wage bill in the summer, with claims that the owners are ready to sell Neymar. That came in the wake of their latest failure in the Champions League, where Real Madrid came back from two goals down with 30 minutes left of the second leg of the tie, to go through, thanks to Karim Benzema's hat-trick. Clearly not many sides could afford Neymar's contract, but the 30-year-old has been linked with a move to Newcastle United in the summer. The Premier League are one of the few teams who could actually afford Neymar's wages, which as we now know are ridiculous! ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ The 33-year-old announced he'd be leaving football in an emotional press conference on Wednesday morning. Aguero struggled to breath during a game against Alaves in October and would never play for the club again. Roberto Peidro, who has treated Aguero since 2004, has revealed the Argentina international has a small scar near his heart after a previous cardiac issue. ""He has a very small scar in his heart area which is less than a millimetre which is why it sort of short-circuits and causes those arrhythmias,"" Peidro told Argentine radio per The Mirror. ""What was done using a catheter was to burn that area where the arrhythmias were coming out. ""We think it's going to work very well and solve the problem but our advice is that he shouldn't do high-performance sport that involves an important degree of mental and physical stress several hours a day."" The procedure is said to help irregular heartbeats, something Aguero was diagnosed with at a young age. Peidro was quick to stress Aguero will be able to live a normal life, despite not being able to continue his career. He also believes the small scar was caused by a virus - but NOT Covid-19 or the vaccine. ""The most common scenario is that the small scar found is produced by a virus he's suffered at some point in his life and wasn't ever detected,"" Peidro continued. ""But it has nothing to do with Covid or the Covid vaccine. ""I spoke with no-one before Sergio's retirement announcement because this formed part of my duty of professional secrecy, but he allowed me to speak to the media and explain things. ""It was a shared decision for him to quit professional football. He was very anxious and when I saw the test results the first thing I said was: 'If you were my son, I would advise you to go this way.'"" Aguero spent nine years at Manchester City and became the club's record goalscorer with 260 in all competitions. He won six League Cups, five Premier League titles and the FA Cup during his time in England. Last summer saw him move to Barcelona, for who he made four appearances, scoring once.

First and foremost, the award will now be handed out in October and will only take into account the previous European season, rather than a full calendar year. That means that this year's award won't be delayed to include the winter World Cup, and performances in the tournament will go towards the 2023 award instead. It's not the only change, with the magazine's editor-in-chief,Pascal Ferre, telling L'Equipe that only representatives of the top 100 ranked FIFA countries, instead of every country, whilst the women's award will only be the top 50. However, they aren't the only ones who will have a say in the winners, with Didier Drogba, Vietnamese journalist Truong Anh Ngoc and Czech juror Karolina Hlavackova compiling the list of nominees. Individual performances will remain the top of the criteria for the winner and will also include team performance, the ""class"" of a player and their fair play record. However, in the past a player's past record has been considered, which to many explains some of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's victories, but that will no longer be considered any more. Fans will be hoping that all the changes lead to the correct winners in upcoming years, to keep up the prestige of the award from dropping. Who do you think will win this year's Ballon d'Or with the new changes? ",positive,liverpool,0

It was a great performance from the academy product and clearly, one of the world's best players appreciated his efforts.

His side seemed to completely fall apart in the latter stages of the game at the Wanda Metropolitano, as Felipe was sent off and a fight even broke out in the tunnel afterwards. Simeone is well known for his usual antics on the touchline but even that failed to rile City up, as Phil Foden had the perfect response to the Argentine. The Atleti manager would have already been in a foul mood but one journalist managed to annoy him so much with a question that he walked out of the post match press conference, as you can see in the video below. Loadingâ¦ City's win in the tie, which came via Foden's goal late in the first leg last week, after the game in Madrid ended 0-0, earned them a place in the Champions League semi final for just the third time. They will face Atletico's local rivals Real Madrid, after Karim Benzema's brilliant extra time winner against Chelsea, and the thought of giving the Bernabeu side help is what angered the Atleti boss. ""Is it very cheeky for me to ask you if you could give Real Madrid some advice on how to defeat City?"" the journalist at the post match press conference asked. Before getting up and leaving the room, the 51-year-old said, ""No, I would never dare to do that,"" and then stood up and left the room immediately. Whilst it was the Spanish side on the end of much of the criticism, especially in England, the team's captain Koke accused City of gamesmanship. Speaking after the game the midfielder said, ""Many times we are Atletico who are criticised and today we are proud of what the team has done.

Real Madrid started the match brightly and could have taken the lead early on when Vinicius Jr hit the bar. But the Spanish side didnât have to wait long for their opening goal. On 21 minutes, Vinicius Jr exchanged a neat one-two with Benzema on the left wing before delivering an inch-perfect cross for the French striker to direct an unstoppable header past Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.

It was a partnership that will be remembered for years to come. Benzema, who rarely got the credit he deserved at the time, scored 155 goals in 355 games when he played alongside Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer in the Spanish capital. Ronaldo, meanwhile, netted 371 times in those 355 games - a quite staggering record considering. But looking back, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's achievements at Los Blancos somewhat overshadowed the efforts of strike partner Benzema. Ronaldo spent a total of nine years in Madrid and during that trophy-laden spell, where he lifted four Champions League titles and four Ballon d'Ors, Karim Benzema provided a total of 47 assists for the prolific forward between 2009 and 2018. It means Benzema has provided the most assists for Ronaldo in his career to date. The Frenchman has, however, flourished since his former strike partner left for Juventus in 2018. In fact, the France international has found the net 124 times in 183 matches for Madrid since Ronaldo's Los Blancos departure, which is more than the 37-year-old's tally of 119 for Juventus and Manchester United. Benzema has been in terrific form for club and country of late, and former Italy international Antonio Cassano, who spent two years at Real, believes Ronaldo has to ""pray in the morning and say thank you"" for his former strike partner's contribution to his career. ""In football, there are not only titles and goals, Zidane scored few goals, but he is one of the greatest in history, Riquelme too,"" Cassano said to Bobo TV. ""Goals are useful, titles are useful, but they are not the fundamental things. ""Cristiano Ronaldo has to pray in the morning and say, 'Thank you, Benzema, that you played with me'. Benzema, this year and last year, has scored 50 goals and assists this year and last year over 30 goals. ""Ronaldo scores and will always score, but he's a different player; Benzema is a goalscoring centre forward. But he's also Zidane; he's a 9, he's a ten and a nine and a half."" Benzema, who has scored 37 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this season, has been touted for the Ballon d'Or by former Manchester United centre-back Rio Ferdinand after arguably the best season of his career to date, aged 34. ""Karim Benzema, if they're not engraving his name on the Ballon d'Or I'll be surprised,"" he told BT Sport after last week's Man of the Match performance against Chelsea in the Champions League. ""He's been magic. In the last tie, he was magnificent and grabbed a hat-trick. Tonight he's done the same and got another hat-trick. ""This man made the difference. Yes, they got their tactics right with Vinicius [Junior] out on the right and pinning [Andreas] Christensen back. ""But, he put the chances away as they came and dispatched them beautifully.

Thomas Tuchel's side trailed 3-1 going into the game, thanks to Benzema's hat-trick at Stamford Bridge six days previous, but with away goals no longer counting double knew they only needed two goals to take things to extra time. When they went 3-0 up in the 75th minute it looked like they wouldn't even need the additional 30 minutes, until Luka Modric provided one of the most incredible passes you're likely to see, leading to Rodrygo making it 4-4 on aggregate. Then in extra time it was Benzema who won the game, heading home from Vinicius Junior's cross, after Antonio Rudiger slipped in the box. However, Henry, working for CBS explained exactly how good the French forward's movement was for the goal, explaining that how back peddling to find space put him in the perfect position, and body shape, to score, whilst also communicating with Vinicius.

The context behind those comments come from earlier this week, when the German international was asked who he believes will be the most difficult player to face when they come up against Chelsea. ""The most difficult player to face at Chelsea? No player has ever taken my sleep in 15 years."" Kroos said. ""They play well as a team but I can't tell you a name.""

Loadingâ¦ Kroos and Mount went back and forth earlier this season when the Real Madrid midfielder said he 'wouldn't lose sleep' over opponents Chelsea ahead of their semi-final clash. Following Chelsea's victory over 'Los Blancos', Mount decided to have some fun at Kroos' expense, who then hit back with a tweet of: ""Still sleeping ok. But well done yesterday. congrats. Good luck in your first CL final."" That luck saw Mount and Chelsea run out 1-0 winners over Manchester City in Porto, making Mount a European champion at 22-years-old. While Kroos is now a decorated star with four Champions Leagues to his name, his first final appearance also came at 22-years-old in a defeat against Chelsea in 2012. He really didn't take it well. Younger brother Felix told Einfach mal Luppen per Goal: ""The Champions League final against Chelsea in 2012 - that was us drinking out of frustration. ""We were close to needing an emergency doctor!"" The elder Kroos then replied: ""It was not a good thing but at least there was a reason for it.

Maybe he should lose sleep over us as a team."" The German ace has now fired back on Twitter, replying: ""Still sleeping ok. But well done yesterday, congrats. ""Good luck in your first CL final,"" finished Kroos - which could well be a reminder that he has already appeared in three finals with Real Madrid, winning them all (and picking up another CL winners' medal with Bayern Munich). The four-time Champions League winner, who also won the 2014 World Cup with Germany, was asked in the build up to Wednesday's second leg who would be the trickiest Chelsea player to face. He replied: ""The most difficult player to face at Chelsea? No player has ever taken my sleep in 15 years. They play well as a team but I can't tell you a name."" Not the most provocative quotes from Kroos pre-match, but they were clearly on the mind of Mount as he made sure to reference them after the game. The 22-year-old also did his talking on the pitch, as himself and N'Golo Kante dominated in midfield against the experienced Real duo of Kroos and Luka Modric. Timo Werner got the opening goal on the night and Mount himself fired home the second as Chelsea eased to a 3-1 aggregate victory - and will now face Manchester City in the third occasion that two Premier League sides have clashed in a Champions League final.

Loadingâ¦ Kroos, and his Real Madrid teammates, face Chelsea on Wednesday night, in the first leg of the quarter finals of the Champions League. Los Blancos will be eyeing a 14th European title but if they are to do that they arguably have the hardest route, as they face the current champions now, will likely face last season's runners up Manchester City next and possibly Liverpool in the final. With that being the case you'd think that those three English sides would be at the forefront of the thoughts of their players, including Kroos, but it's apparently not the case. The former Bayern Munich midfielder was asked to name nine teams from England's top tier and he didn't even name any of the 'big six' until Tottenham Hotspur in third and upcoming opponents Chelsea weren't until fifth in the list. Loadingâ¦ Most fans wouldn't have expected that Burnley would be named by Kroos at all in his list of nine, never mind the fact that they came up first. There's no real reason for Sean Dyche's side to be in the World Cup winning midfielder's mind, unless he's really taking note of the relegation zone in England. Things are certainly heating up towards the bottom half, with the Clarets facing relegation rivals Everton on Wednesday night, in a big six pointer. If they manage to win, the Lancashire club could be just one point behind Frank Lampard's team, with only nine games of the season remaining. If Kroos and his teammates do make it to Paris on May 28th, after the final was moved from St Petersburg following Russia's attack on Ukraine, then it could be the last one without a big opening ceremony. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has claimed that Europe's showpiece football final needs to up its game in order to be as 'big' as the NFL's Super Bowl.

His form back at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium has suggested that it's another in a long line of poor business done at the Nou Camp over the past few years.

Probably. But Rakitic really did have to put the work in to get his first date with Raquel Mauri, explaining that his lack of Spanish language skills really hindered him after he moved from Schalke to Sevilla in 2011. ""I don't know how to explain it... Whenever I saw her, it was like a bomb went off inside me,"" Rakitic told The Players' Tribune. ""Week after week, I slowly started to learn some Spanish words, and if I was struggling, I would use my hands a lot to try to explain what I was trying to say to her. ""She thought that was funny. She was like, ""Me... Jane. You... Tarzan."" ""I was drinking so much coffee it was ridiculous. I probably asked her out 20 or 30 times."" The reason for the insane caffeine intake is that the future life partner of Rakitic was working in a hotel bar. So he had to keep ordering coffees to make his (limited) small talk with her. ""She never said no,"" Rakitic qualifies. But clearly she didn't say yes either - and proving himself to his would-be love interest actually became a big factor why Rakitic succeeded in Spain. ""One day, Raquel finally explained why she wouldn't go out with me. She said, 'You're a footballer. You could be moving to another country next year. Sorry, but no.' ""You know, I'm not the biggest guy in the world, so I thought: 'S**t, maybe she sees me and she doesn't think I'm going to be very good and Seville will sell me in the summer.' ""Part of my motivation when I went to training was to establish myself in the squad so that I would be around for a while and this girl would finally have dinner with me. It literally took me seven months."" Eventually Raquel Mauri agreed to go for lunch with Rakitic and the rest is history: they are now married with two children. Rakitic also found success on the pitch, as well as in love. The now 32-year-old joined Barcelona in 2014 and won a host of trophies - including the Champions League and four La Liga titles - before he re-signed with Sevilla last summer. The midfielder also played in a World Cup final with Croatia in 2018. Raquel Mauri, meanwhile, has over 700,000 followers on Instagram and will be celebrating knowing Rakitic for a decade in 2021. Here's thanking his persistence - and incredible ability to keep drinking coffee - for their eventual happiness. Featured image credit: Instagram @Raquel_Mauri ",positive,liverpool,0

As you can see in the post below, Twitter user @AdrianLalor1 commented saying: ""Please buy Man Utd."" Reynolds responded: ""Iâm already seeing someone"" in a nod to his beloved Wrexham, who currently sit in second place in the National League, eight points behind leaders Stockport. Iâm already seeing someone. The post that United fan Adrian commented on was a touching one. Reynolds and fellow owner McElhenney have backed a campaign to get Wrexham legend Gareth Davies to the FA Trophy final from his care home. Davies, who made 490 appearances for the Dragons during a 16-year spell at the Racecourse Ground, has dementia and currently lives in Bay Tree House care home in Wrexham. The 72-year-old is also in a wheelchair, which has complicated matters in regards to his travel to London, but fans of the club are determined to get Davies to Wembley. After the hashtag #GarethIsGoingToWembley started to circulate on social media, co-owner Reynolds made a statement. âRob [McElhenney] and I will make sure Gareth makes it to Wembley in comfort,â he said on Twitter. âHe showed up for @Wrexham_AFC and weâll show up for him.""

Jones made his sensational return for Unitedlast month and impressed fans with his performance in the Red Devilsâ 1-0 defeat to Wolves at Old Trafford. Loadingâ¦ The 29-year-old United defender faced a lengthy absence from the first team due to a long-term knee problem,but Ralf Rangnick started Jonesalongside Raphael Varane for the Wolves match. Jones then came off the bench in extra-time to replace Varane in Unitedâs shock defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Friday at Old Trafford. The centre-backâs cameo against Middlesbrough was his first football action since the Wolves defeat in early January. Jones was heavily linked with a move to Bordeaux, but the United man turned down a move to the Ligue 1 side before the window closed on 31st January. However,Football Insidernow reports that Watford made a last-ditch effort to sign the former England defender on deadline day. A recruitment source told the publication that new Watford manager Roy Hodgson had âsanctioned a moveâ for Jones, who is out of contract with United in 2023. The transfer approach for Jones was âknocked back,â but Hodgson wanted to add an experienced defender to his ranks for Watfordâs fight for Premier League survival. Hodgson had selected Jones for Englandâs squads at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup, with the former Three Lions boss being a âbig admirerâ of Jones. The 74-year-old is Watfordâs third manager of the season after the sackings of Xisco and Claudio Ranieri. Xisco led the Hornets back to the Premier League and was dismissed last October, with Ranieri appointed as his successor. However, former Leicester City manager Ranieri was unable to turn the tide for Watford and was axed by the Premier League strugglers last month. Watford have failed to keep a single clean sheet this season and have conceded 40 times in the league, with the Hornets in 19th place ahead of their match with Burnley on Saturday.

Loadingâ¦ Northern Ireland faced England in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday night and were on the receiving end of a battering, as the visitors won 5-0. On two occasions the team scored twice in the space of 10 minutes, accounting for four of the goals, and they led to the Northern Ireland manager to make his very controversial statements. Speaking after the game Shiels claimed that female players were 'more emotional' than their male counterparts and that's why they often conceded straight after another goal. ""I felt they [England] were struggling a wee bit at times to open us up until the psychology of going 2-0 up in the womenâs game â Iâm sure you will have noticed if you go through the patterns â when a team concedes agoal, they concede a second one in a very, very short space of time,"" Shiels said. ""Right through the whole spectrum of the womenâs game, because girls and women are more emotional than men. So, they take a goal going in not very well. ""When we went 1-0 down we tried to slow it down to give them time to get that emotional imbalance out of their heads. ""Thatâs an issue we have. Not just in Northern Ireland but all of the countries in the world. I shouldnât have told you that."" The statement obviously caused outrage amongst fans, with even Arsenal legend Ian Wright chipping in to say how wrong the manager was. Iâm sorry Kenny Shiels, but women are not âmore emotionalâ than men and maybe men could learn from how most women manage their emotions.

The former Morton manager is set to take his side into the Women's Euros in England this summer, and he'll be coming up against the hosts again there. Northern Ireland take on England in their final game of the group stages at St Mary's, Southampton's home ground, on July 15th.

Loadingâ¦ Savic attempted to lift up Phil Foden late in the second half of Tuesday night's Champions League quarter final, as the midfielder lay on the ground following Felipe's foul. The defender wanted to get Foden off the pitch so the game could continue, with his side trailing 1-0 on aggregate, and the act of aggression kicked off a huge melee of players. Jack Grealish got involved, appearing to call Savic a 'c**t,' and the pair were later involved in the incident in the tunnel that required police to get involved. Now former Oasis star Gallagher has repeated the name that Grealish called the former City defender, and then said he was 'dead' if the Montenegro star came across him, before deleting the tweet. It wasn't the only post on Twitter that 49-year-old Mancunian sent during the match, and he clearly wasn't happy with what Atletico were doing. Scumbags Scumbag Fc Savic looked to have headbutted Raheem Sterling during the melee, which he also started, but managed to get away with just a yellow card. The 31-year-old was a flop at the Etihad Stadium, having played for the Premier League team for just one season, 2011/12, before moving to Fiorentina after just 21 appearances in all competitions. He started his feud with Grealish back at his old stomping ground in the first leg, when the City star came on as a substitute late in the game. Despite not being on long, the former Aston Villa captain managed to rile up Savic, and another Atleti player, with the defender reportedly claiming ""I'll have you in Madrid,"" a threat he attempted to carry through with in the tunnel. The clash between the two, in which Savic also appeared to pull the forward's hair, also earned Grealish a new nickname from his teammates. Gallagher was also happy to share his opinion recently, after City's enthralling 2-2 draw with title and Champions League rivals Liverpool, last weekend. The former Beady Eye frontman called Jurgen Klopp's side 'lucky,' said Pep Guardiola's team had 'played them off the park' and said referee Anthony Taylor was a 'c**t.' He will no doubt have his phone at the ready to post his feelings again this weekend, when the two sides meet yet again in the FA Cup semi final.

The comprehensive list is compiled by transfermarkt, and you can see how each player's value has shifted over the last few years. The list is dominated by players from the so-called 'big-six' clubs, with Declan Rice the only man not to ply his trade for one of England's most fashionable clubs. Harry Kane leads the way at the top of list with a value of Â£108 million, despite a sluggish start to the season which has seen him score only Premier League goal to date. Interestingly, his market value has remained at that figure since it fell from an eye-watering high of Â£135 million in December 2019. Another England international takes his place in second, with Jack Grealish currently valued at Â£90 million following his Â£100 million arrival from Aston Villa to Manchester City in the summer. The Birmingham-born midfielder has seen his stock soar in recent years, with his price skyrocketing from Â£58.5 million in May. Belgium superstar Romelu Lukaku is ranked third, also at Â£90 million after arriving at Chelsea from Inter Milan for a fee in excess of Â£100million. Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne is fourth with the same Â£90 million valuation, but a few eyebrows will undoubtedly be raised when seeing Mohamed Salah down in fifth. The Liverpool talisman's value steadily declined from a high of Â£135 million in December 2019, despite his electric form so far this season which has seen him score 15 goals in 13 appearances across all competitions. But it is worth noting that Salah's last valuation was back in June, meaning this figure could rise again in the months ahead. Bruno Fernandes' ongoing importance to Manchester United is illustrated by his position in seventh at a value of Â£81 million, while his teammate Marcus Rashford is tenth with a figure of Â£76.5 million. Mason Mount's value has continued to take a steady trajectory upwards, having seen his value rise from Â£54million in March to Â£67.5million. The full list can be viewed below. 1. Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) - Â£108 million 2. Jack Grealish (Manchester City) - Â£90 million 3. Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea) - Â£90 million 4. Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) - Â£90 million 5. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) - Â£90 million 6. Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) - Â£81 million 7. Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) - Â£81 million 8.

The ranking, from football magazine FourFourTwo, excludes out-and-out strikers such as Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Erling Haaland etc. So normally you'd expect to see Barcelona's No 10 crowned king of such a list. However he only makes second place on the countdown, with his former teammate - Paris Saint-Germain ace Neymar - taking the top spot. Controversial. Messi still finishes above some incredible names, as FFT acclaim: ""As his pace and stamina slowly diminish, his vision and passing are only getting better. He's different, but still destructive."" However Neymar takes top spot due to his performances in this season's Champions League with the assessment: ""There are few sights more exciting in football than Neymar turning with the ball to take on his marker."" Fair enough. Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe completes the top three - the 22-year-old who's widely expected to top this type of list in the future is praised for his goalscoring exploits - while Liverpool's Mohamed Salah is the highest-placed Premier League forward in fourth place. Among the controversial omissions are Salah's teammate Sadio Mane - a reflection of his struggles this season, perhaps - and Antoine Griezmann, who's never quite found his role at Barcelona but remains a key player for world champions France. Real Madrid's Eden Hazard is also understandably absent. Perhaps the biggest call on FourFourTwo's list is Manchester City's 20-year-old Foden in sixth, above his teammate Raheem Sterling, Tottenham attacker Son Heung-min and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford (who sneaks into 10th place). See the full FourFourTwo list below or read their full explanation here. 10. Marcus Rashford (Man United) 9. Raheem Sterling (Man City) 8. Son Heung-min (Tottenham) 7. Serge Gnabry (Bayern Munich) 6. Phil Foden (Man City) 5. Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund) 4. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) 3. Kylian Mbappe (PSG) 2. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 1. Neymar (PSG) Some might argue that 21-year-old Sancho, who's having a tricky season in Dortmund, and his England teammate Foden are perhaps being placed in the top six a bit too soon. However Neymar overtaking Messi is still the most hotly debated call on FFT's top 10. Let us know your thoughts in the comments. All imagery: PA Images ",positive,liverpool,2

On Tuesday night, the Croatian conjured up a sublime all-round midfield display in a crazy Champions League quarter final second leg clash against Chelsea at the Santiago Bernabeu. Loadingâ¦ 3-1 down from the first leg, Chelsea were on course to do the unthinkable courtesy of goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner. But then Modric produced the moment of the game. Mere minutes after Werner's so goal, he delivered the most outrageous outside of the boot assist for substitute Rodrygo Goes to level the tie. That ball from Modric! ð±Unbelievable!Chelsea held their lead for a matter of minutes... It's now 4-4 on aggregate! #UCL pic.twitter.com/vOi8K6Vf9z It was complete and utter filth from the former Spurs midfielder. The technique and execution was well and truly special. And then in extra time, talisman Karim Benzema made sure he his name was in the headlines when he headed home past Edouard Mendy to send Los Blancos into the semi-finals. But while Benzema might end up with the plaudits for coming up clutch again, don't sleep on Modric's insane performance at the age of 36. He played out of his skin for 120 minutes. Both Toni Kroos and Casemiro ended up being taken off but the uber experienced Modric was kept on by Carlo Ancelotti. Giving up is not an option. Not only was he typically tidy in possession and under pressure in the middle of the park but he also made some crucial tackles and interceptions and had bundles of energy. The 2018 Ballon d'Or winner deservedly claimed UEFA's Player of the Match. It was a complete outing from one of the very best midfielders of this generation. Reflecting on the game to BT Sport, Modric said: âUnbelievable to describe this game. We were dead until the goal we scored. âChelsea scored three goals, maybe the first a bit lucky from a deflection. I canât say we played badly. They used their chances well and scored the goals. âWe didnât give up. We kept believing, fighting and in the end showed huge character. âIt was another incredible night, what a sweet tasting loss.

Loadingâ¦ Mount played a vital role in the Blues' 2-0 win, scoring the second goal to secure a 4-1 victory on aggregate and passage to the Champions League final. The 22-year-old starred in midfield and managed to outperform the experienced duo of Modric and Toni Kroos. It saw the former approach Mount at full-time with a message of: ""Mason Mount. Good luck in the final,"" before giving him a hug. Mount, who grew up studying footage of the Ballon d'Or winner, was incredibly appreciative and responded with: ""Thank you, thank you."" While Mount and Modric were respectful with one another, the England international threw barbs at Kroos following the full-time whistle. World Cup winner Kroos was asked who he believed the toughest player at Chelsea was earlier in the week. ""The most difficult player to face at Chelsea? No player has ever taken my sleep in 15 years."" Kroos said. ""They play well as a team but I can't tell you a name."" In his post-match interview with CBS Sports, Mount made sure to address those comments with: ""I saw one of their players [Kroos] saying he doesn't lose sleep over any of our players. Maybe he should lose sleep over us as a team."" He then turned his attention to the Blues' campaign, which started off poorly and saw Frank Lampard sacked in January. Despite that, Thomas Tuchel's arrival has buoyed the squad who now have two shots at silverware this season, with an FA Cup final against Leicester City to come as well. ""I can't put it into words at the moment,"" he explained. ""But it was a great performance tonight, it was a tough, tough game. ""You know what they're like, they're going to come and they're going to give it everything. ""I thought we were brilliant, we worked hard. We probably should have had about five.

Mandzukic, who made 89 appearances for his country over an eleven-year period, decided to retire from football last week after spells at Dinamo Zagreb, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid and Juventus, amongst others. He announced his decision in an Instagram post that included a picture of an old pair of football boots. ""Dear little Mario,"" he said in a message to his younger self. ""While you put on these boots for the first time, you can't even imagine what you will get to experience in football. ""You'll score goals at the biggest stages and you'll win the biggest trophies with the biggest clubs. Proudly representing your nation, you will help write the history of Croatian sports..."" A post shared by Mario MandzÌukicÌ MM 9 (@mariomandzukic) In the aftermath of his retirement announcement, many paid tribute to the 35-year-old striker, including former international teammate Modric. In fact, the Real Madrid midfielder spoke about his rocky relationship with Mandzukic in a fascinating extract in his new autobiography 'My Game'. ""Mario is a special guy. Sometimes he seems grumpy,"" Modric wrote. ""Those who don't know him well would think that in reality, he is always frowning. ""All this time I have known Mario as a great boy, with a big heart. I loved him from day one, even though it took me a long time to understand [him]. ""We spent a lot of time together on the national team. On a visit to Iceland, when we were trying to go to the World Cup in Brazil, I ran into Mandzukic in front of the hotel elevator. ""'Come on Mario, we're going hard today,' I told him, since many times the players cheer each other on in training or before the game. ""Mandzukic, however, surprised me with his reaction: 'Look at yourself, leave me.' It seemed to me that it was a momentary upset. ""I always had a good relationship with Mario. We were in constant contact until then. Then there was silence, the relationship cooled."" Four years later, when Croatia were preparing to play in the 2018 World Cup, a defiant Modric was eager to try and reconnect with Mandzukic. It turns out it was all a big misunderstanding. ""If he had the wisdom of now, he would have clarified it immediately or, in the worst case, in the next concentration [meeting] of the national team,"" he added. ""But I was also defiant. When two difficult people are short-circuited, the energy disappears. Frankly, he was wrong, but he didn't want to take the first step. ""I waited for the right moment and started the conversation. I wanted to tell him how sorry I was that we no longer had a close relationship. ""I was interested to know the reason why we had been communicating exclusively in a cold way for more than three years. ""We spoke openly and saw that the problem came out of nowhere. 'I didn't get mad at you. I thought you were sulking with me', he told me. ""I said the same thing. Positive energy flowed between Mario and me again. We share some traits: a kind of introversion, a little more difficult to show emotions, we know how to be stubborn. ""But he is the person I would go to any fight with. Whatever it is, I know he will give everything, protect your back and never betray you."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Jurgen Klopp's side had the better of much of the game but the Blues arguably had the better chances and their own chances to win the game. The two sides were so tight that all 10 of the outfield players who were left on the pitch scored their penalties, and it went down to the keepers. Kepa had famously refused to come off in the 2019 final, against Manchester City, but was brought on in extra time by Tuchel for the spot kicks, but only came close to saving the penultimate effort, and should have done. Caoimhin Kelleher's effort was absolutely perfect and left the Spain keeper needing to score to take it back to the original takers, but the 27-year-old blasted his penalty over the bar. SCENES!!! ð¤¯Kepa Arrizabalaga misses the 22nd penalty after being subbed on for the shoot-out! ð¨ pic.twitter.com/yLIOIQWdUD It was a strange start to the final, not least with Manchester City not in the final for the first time in five years, with Thiago removed from Liverpool's starting line up just before kick off, after getting injured in the warm up. The Spanish midfielder was spotted on the television cameras in tears just ahead of kick off, as missing out on the occasion suddenly caught up with him. Caoimhin Kelleher, chosen ahead of Alisson as Jurgen Klopp's cup goalkeeper, saved from Christian Pulisic after just seven minutes, when the American maybe should have scored. There was some controversy when some felt Naby Keita had elbowed Mason Mount but the referee correctly saw it as a foul by the Chelsea midfielder. It was Edouard Mendy who stole the headlines in the first half as the Chelsea keeper, playing in his third final in four matches for club and country, made an outstanding double save just after the half hour mark. The Reds had a dominant spell in the middle of the half but Mount should have put his side ahead on half time, somehow hitting his shot wide unmarked in the box after a great run and superb work from Pulisic and Kai Havertz. AMAZING DOUBLE SAVE!!Take a bow Mendy ð pic.twitter.com/X9FIIj8gtN It was Mount again who really should have opened the scoring after half time, breaking the opposition offside trap to find himself in the centre of the area with only Kelleher to beat, only to shoot against the foot of the post. Beating the offside trap ðStriking the upright ðMason Mount comes so, so close to putting Chelsea in front! ð pic.twitter.com/xNgWI7roYi More controversy surrounded Keita, as this time the midfielder, only starting due to Thiago's injury, seemed to catch Trevoh Chalobah high on the thigh with his studs, but the referee didn't seem to think it was too bad. OUCH ð³ pic.twitter.com/WXyYGndULY Thiago Silva then saved Mendy's blushes, as the keeper failed to come off his line and allowed Mohamed Salah to bear down on goal, and chip the Senegal number one, only for the Brazilian defender to race back and clear off the line. However just minutes later Klopp's side thought they had the lead, with Joel Matip heading home after Trent Alexander-Arnold's free kick was headed across goal. VAR had other ideas though, as it noticed that Virgil van Dijk was in an offside position when the free kick was taken, and blocking off one of the Chelsea defenders who might have got to Mane. JoÃ«l Matip is *almost* Liverpool's unlikely hero ðThe Reds' joy is short-lived as their goal is ruled out by VAR ðº pic.twitter.com/cACBhQUfUc Liverpool were again having all of the chances but soon it was Chelsea's turn to be thwarted, after thinking they'd taken the lead from Havertz header. As soon as the ball dropped just over the line, the assistant referee's flag went up, as Timo Werner had been offside from Matteo Kovacic's ball, before crossing for Havertz. With extra time looming, Mendy made a huge save once again, the time palming away a brilliant header, after Virgil van Dijk got on the end of a corner. Romelu Lukaku, on as a substitute, thought he'd given Thomas Tuchel's side the lead when he slotted home in the eighth minute of extra time, only for the offside flag to go up on his run. VAR checked whether or not he was and it looked for a moment like Van Dijk had just kept him on, but in the end the Belgian striker was on the wrong side of the line. And a fourth goal was ruled out in the second half of the additional 30 minutes, as this time Havertz was in an offside position when he slotted home, not that Thomas Tuchel realised at first. Then came the moment when Kepa, who refused to come off the pitch in the final three years ago, came on as a substitute deep in extra time. ",positive,liverpool,4

The showpiece at Wembley was a exciting and eventful affair played at the same pace as the league meeting between the two at Stamford Bridge in January. Loadingâ¦ There was plenty of incidents in the clash but none were more hilarious than Kante's unusual and completely illegal challenge on Robertson just before half-time. The World Cup winner stopped the Scotland captain in his tracks on the byline, sticking his head in where it hurts. Incredibly, referee Stuart Attwell did not even give a free-kick despite Robertson's appeals to the man in the middle.

""When I began school we started swimming, rugby, football, athletics and basketball,"" the former Leicester City midfielder told the Sunday Times. ""After basketball one day a teacher said, âYou have good mentality. You lose but kept playing for your teammates.â Another day we did cross-country and I finished third. ""We did rugby, I tried to tackle the man and my teacher said, 'When you were at the tournament the scout from the club said you have good spirit, good condition, maybe you can play rugby'. ""In the end the teacher said to my family, 'Maybe it would be good for N'Golo to do some sport'and my choice was to play football"". You sense that Kante, standing at 5 ft 6, could have been very handy in rugby with his incredible speed and fitness levels. But thankfully he picked football and has gone on to become of the most well-liked players in the Premier League thanks to his shy and humble personality. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Liverpool found themselves behind at the break in what many people were considering a Premier League title decided, at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Despite Diogo Jota's goal, and Ederson trying his best to help Jurgen Klopp's side, City were the better team in the first half and led thanks to goals from Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus. Salah especially had been surprisingly anonymous in the opening stanza of the game, and had lost the ball on eight occasions However, the Egyptian is rarely out of a game for too long, and inside the first minute of the second half he'd set up Mane. The Egyptian received the ball on the right wing from Trent Alexander-Arnold, in between two defenders, took two touches to create space and turn, and then played an inch perfect pass for his strike partner to run on to. Mane didn't take a touch to set himself, instead blasting past Ederson in the City goal to make it 2-2, the score the game at Anfield earlier in the season finished What a pass by Salah, absolutely stunning. That pass from Salah was absolutely exquisite. GOODNESS ME WHAT A PASS FROM MO SALAH! #LFC What an outrageous pass by Salah. My word. Salah's vision and pass for that goal. The closest thing to Messi in football right now. That pass from Salah was wonderful and what a finish from Mane.Great to see this game living up to the hype. Ahead of the game the build up to the match was huge, especially after Jamie Carragher claimed it was the 'greatest' rivalry in English football history. Both sides are trying to make history this season, with City hoping to win the Treble and Liverpool wanting to win an unprecedented Quadruple. There was just one point and eight games left ahead of kick off so either side winning would hugely swing the title race in their favour. So big was the match that even Jake Paul was getting involved with the talk, even if his analysis did leave fans questioning if he knew anything about football. The game started off at breakneck speed, with Raheem Sterling failing to open the scoring after just four minutes, only for De Bruyne to do it just over a minute later. Jota levelled things up in the 13th minute, when Ederson maybe should have done better, only for Jesus, a surprise starter to give City the lead again. That was until Salah's brilliant pass split the host's defence at the beginning of the second period. ",positive,liverpool,3

Then, Ederson decided to have a bit of fun high up the pitch - taking a few touches before passing the ball to Foden and jogging back to his goal. It was so unbelievably nonchalant from Ederson, who just can't resist entertaining himself in times when he really doesn't have much to do. Ridiculously comfortable with the ball at his feet and with distribution levels goalkeepers can only dream about, it's not the first time Ederson has had a little cameo in the middle of the park. Against Wolves, in the 2018/19 campaign, the former Benfica man won the ball back in midfield and completed three passes. Ederson grew up idolising the legendary Rogerio Ceni and played as a full-back before he became a goalkeeper. He played outfield during acharity game and scored twice - including a calmly taken penalty which showed just why he wants to take one for City. And he's already gone on record to say he wants to play in Kevin De Bruyne's position. ""If I were to go outfield like this, I would not ask to be a striker. I would prefer to play in the midfield, inKevin's [De Bruyne]place,"" Ederson toldthe club's website.

Loadingâ¦ There was lots of talk about the title decider ahead of the game, with Jamie Carragher claiming it was English football's 'greatest' ever rivalry. Other talk surrounded referee Anthony Taylor, with the Reds' fans annoyed that a referee from Manchester was allowed to take charge, despite the 43-year-old supporting National League side Altrincham F.C. Taylor didn't have too many big decisions to make for most of the game, as some great moments led to the two sides being level at 2-2. Late in the game however things exploded into life for the officials, as Fabinho's challenge on Bernardo Silva in the 82nd minute asked some big questions, with the midfielder only picking up a yellow card. Minutes later, Thiago was lucky that he didn't pick up a second yellow, as he seemed to take out Kevin de Bruyne, but Taylor this time didn't even give a foul. Yes, Fabinho should have received a red card and Thiago should have received a second yellow card. pic.twitter.com/jY47r8Zj4c That should've been a red for Fabinho pic.twitter.com/RzYJUcvqKQ Hmmm pic.twitter.com/CEsYyDFNyu You don't want to see red cards in this type of game but ... on another day Fabinho & Thiago could've walked within a couple of minutes of each other.

I just think he was desperate not to give any big decisions that got remembered as the reason one team won the title. And that's a dreadful way to referee a match. City fans were also to remind everyone that in the first game between the two sides this season, which also finished 2-2, Liverpool were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men. In that game, which included a superb goal by Mohamed Salah, former City player James Milner was on the receiving end of the refereeing decisions, as he didn't pick up a second yellow card. On Sunday the game was again considered one of the game's of the season, as Kevin de Bruyne opened the scoring after just a few minutes. Diogo Jota then equalised, before the Portugal forward nearly managed to nick the ball from Ederson in a moment of pure madness from the home team's goalkeeper. Gabriel Jesus' goal gave the hosts a half time lead, before Salah's pass set up Sadio Mane in the first minute of the second half to make it 2-2. Despite both sides having chances it remained that way, leaving Pep Guardiola's side still one point ahead of their rivals with seven games to go. ",positive,liverpool,5

A video compilation of Liverpool's Spanish midfield maestro in action shows just how often his trademark move has worked in leagues and matches worldwide. Thiago picks the ball up with his back to goal, waits until the oncoming opponent is behind him, reads which way they're leaning - then spins the other way with the ball on the outside of his foot, beating them from a standing start and heading off into space. So smooth. Thiago AlcÃ¢ntara's signature move - 'The Thiago Turn'. pic.twitter.com/xagAztt2sn The 30-year-old magician has been performing his trick for Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Liverpool, but nobody has found an effective way of shutting it down. ""As soon as the oncoming man slows down and is flat footed he changes direction. Simple but so effective,"" marvelled one football fan on Twitter. ""That's the samba skills. You either have it or you don't. Can be forgiven for thinking he's Brazilian,"" commented another. The fella is a magician. :tophat: https://t.co/pj7ANsrFFu You know it's coming, but you can't defend it. That's @Thiago6 magic :heart_eyes: It's so simple but so good man.

Simple but so effective. Thiago has Brazilian parents, of course, and his father, Mazinho, was a 1994 World Cup winner. But utility player Mazinho never really pulled off tricks like this, if we're honest. Not that everything in Thaigo's career has gone as smoothly as this stylish turn. The Spain international initially struggled to adapt to the Premier League and to fit into the set-up at Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool when he arrived in England over the summer.

However he initially wasn't always on his teammates' wavelength. But that has subtly changed as the season has gone on as he has become more effective and Thiago played the full 90 minutes in Liverpool's 3-0 win at Burnley on Wednesday that put them back into the Premier League's top four. It seems that Thiago has helped Liverpool 'turn' a corner, just is his style. Featured image credit: PA Images/Twitter ",positive,liverpool,6

Burnley came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Turf Moor, to cut the gap to their relegation rivals to just a single point.

Iâve been down there, I know what itâs like. Every season there have been tough patches for us,â Dyche told Sky Sports after the match. âItâs hard to explain but sometimes you can of sense that a team might have lost how to win a game. âI said to them at half-time âIâm not sure these lot know how to win a game ladsâ, away from home particularly. âI said âWeâve got to play on that mentality, we do it by playing forward with better quality.â ""I said at half-time, I'm not sure [Everton] know how to win a game lads"" ð Brutal from Burnley boss Sean Dyche boss following their 3-2 win over #EFC! pic.twitter.com/IGq8zcG2HK âIt wasnât glorious but there were enough patches where we found three goals. And Iâm pleased with that.â Burnley had taken the lead early on through Nathan Collins before Richarlison equalised from the penalty spot after Anthony Gordon was fouled in the area. The Brazilian then scored a second penalty four minutes before the break after a VAR review judged that Vitality Mykolenko had been fouled by former Everton winger Aaron Lennon. Burnley equalised in the second half through Jay Rodriguez before Cornet capitalised on a mistake from Ben Godfrey to secure all three points for the hosts. The Clarets remain 18th in the Premier League after the win but are now just a point behind Everton, who have to face Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea in the coming weeks. Everton have won just two of their nine Premier League games under Frank Lampard, who was disappointed his side could not hold on to their lead. âAt 2-1 we should win the game by more goals,â he told Sky Sports. âWe were not clinical enough with our chances.

Loadingâ¦ Dyche was surprisingly sacked on Friday morning, with his side having just eight games to save their place in the Premier League. Whilst the Clarets haven't been having a good season, and recently lost to relegation rivals Norwich City, it seemed like strange timing for a man who has led his team to survival on a number of occasions. The news also came just a couple of days before a game against West Ham United and with no time for a replacement to be appointed. It's not only Burnley fans who are likely to miss the 50-year-old, as he often provided plenty of entertainment, with one story of an argument with Aston Villa midfielder McGinn tickling us. The story came courtesy of an emailer into the Football Ramble podcast, where it was alleged the two men got into some verbals on the sidelines, and you can hear the story in the video below. Loadingâ¦ It was presenter Luke Moore, not exactly a fan of former Burnley boss, as regular listeners will know, who read out the story on the show last year. ""John McGinn was caught putting in a late challenge on one of Burnley's players. Understandably, Dyche wasn't best pleased,"" the emailer explained. ""He began barking complaints from the touchline in a way that that only that deep gravelly voice can and John McGinn sharply dismissed Dyche's protest telling him to, 'Shut up.' ""Taken aback by the Scotsman's insolence Dyche shouted over 'Oh, so you've been in the Premier League for one season you think you're a proper big time now, telling me to shut up?' ""Quick as a flash, McGinn cockily replied, ""You've been in the Premier League for six seasons, and you're still wearing the same shit coat your big prick."" Seeing as how Dyche had been in charge at Turf Moor for over nine and a half years, there's a chance that the coat was even older than McGinn claimed. It had done wonders for the former Watford boss who has kept his side in the top tier for the past four years, he did get them relegated in 2015 but they went straight back up, in one of two promotions under him. In another incident involving the former centre back, he was heard shouting at Raheem Sterling after he felt the Manchester City forward went down too easy. Dyche exclaimed, ""Are you sure Sterling? You spend half your f*cking life on the floor son,"" during a time when there were no fans in the stands so it was quite easy to pick it up on camera. It wasn't just on the pitchside that he's given us lots of moments of entertainment down the years, with his brilliant discussion about look alikes also brightening up press conferences. We hope he's back in work in the Premier League soon enough. ",positive,liverpool,0

Ferguson was able to rest star players Ruud van Nistelrooy, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs for the game, while a young Ronaldo, way before the goals, the records and Ballon d'Ors, was afforded a start. When Rooney met Ronaldopic.twitter.com/Z7z82REvMD And there was another one of Europe's top talents on the pitch in the form of Rooney, who was brought into the Everton side for the fixture. The game ended 3-2 and saw United move back to the top of the Premier League in the five-goal thriller. But undoubtedly the most memorable moment in the game happened just before the hour mark, as Rooney aimed a wild lunge at his future United teammate after becoming majorly pissed off by Ronaldo's showboating down the left flank. Rooney was having absolutely none of Ronaldo's trickery and promptly introduced him to English football in the best possible way. The two have been in the news together this week after Ronaldo reacted angrily to Rooney's criticism of him on Monday Night Football. Asked if the Ronaldo move has been a success on Sky Sports, Rooney said: ""Youâd have to say no at the minute. ""I think heâs scored goals, heâs scored important goals in theChampions Leagueearly on in the season, he scored the hat-trick againstTottenham, but I think if youâre looking to the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best and lift Manchester United over these next two or three years.""

Loadingâ¦ It's set the Somerset native back a whopping Â£3,200, as well as over 2000 miles. But the father and son pair have experienced some rotten luck. In 2020, the duo had travelled to watch Ronaldo in action for Juventus but he did not feature after being rested. It cost Chris Â£1,550so you can imagine how frustrated he was when the Real Madrid legend did not take to the pitch. However, Ronaldo then returned to Manchester United in the summer and so seeing the 37-year-old live was made a little easier for Chris and Zac. They picked the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium last month as the fixture but to the surprise of many - and definitely Chris and Zac - Ronaldo picked up a ""hip flexor injury"" and was missing from the 4-1 thrashing. The unlucky dad and lad watched on from hospitality and stayed over in a hotel, ultimately costing Â£1500 for the experience. They do say 'third time lucky' and Chris and Zac will have been hoping that was the case when they got some free tickets for United's visit of Leicester City on Saturday. But there was more misery as Ralf Rangnick confirmed Ronaldo missed the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford after suffering from ""flu-like symptoms"". Despite Chris feeling it in his bank balance, he remains determined to make his son's dream come true. âItâs costing an arm and a leg,"" Chris said, as per The Sun. ""I promised Zac I will take him to see Ronaldo play, so Iâll make that happen come what may.â It could have been much worse though. In 2019, ""the unluckiest football fan"" had saved up to watch both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi but disaster struck. Messi injured his am 14 minutes into the game against Sevilla and then a few months later, a Ronaldo muscle injury ruled him out of Juventus' game against Empoli which the supporter attended with his two friends.

In fact, the Premier League club are currently looking into the incident involving Cristiano Ronaldo and the mobile phone at Goodison Park. It was another disappointing afternoon for Ralf Rangnick's side, who lost more ground in the race for Champions League football. Despite having good spells of possession throughout, United struggled to pose any sort of attacking threat. Marcus Rashford had a number of chances early on that were parried away by Jordon Pickford but apart from that, it was a poor overall performance. And after the full-time whistle, Manchester United shot-stopper David de Gea gave an honest assessment of his side's efforts against the Premier League strugglers. Here is that interview in full. Everton, meanwhile, fought back after a midweek defeat to Burnley thanks to a first-half strike from teenager Anthony Gordon. Toffees boss Frank Lampard was delighted with the result. ""It feels really good - big win, big day,"" he said. ""The reality of our position is clear. You could feel that in the stadium. The fighting spirit and qualities we showed are big for us. We need to carry that on. We need to replicate that and if we do, we're confident. ""The fans are huge for us. One of the reasons we are good here is because of them. A few groans are normal.

Loadingâ¦ Right now United remain in a flux of not knowing who the next manager will be but also not being able to perform under Ralf Rangnick right now, as their chances to finish in the top four continue to diminish. There isn't too much clarity about who will be brought in to fix it all next season, although at least it does seem to be down to Erik ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. Whichever of the two men it is, they'll have a lot to do, with some many of the current crop of players considered not good enough for the team. Rooney though thinks there is four men currently at Old Trafford who the team should be built around. ""I think [Jadon] Sancho will be better next year, Marcus [Rashford] will be better next year,"" the club's all time top goalscorer said on Monday Night Football. ""They've got good young players. I think Jesse Lingard should be playing for them because he brings energy, brings quality. Scott McTominay's done well, ""So they do have some good young players, you just have to get some confidence and get them believing that they're good players and perform at the best level. ""And then obviously, whoever the new manager is, I'm sure he'll bring his own players in and build that through."" Sancho is still a new signing at United, having joined from Borussia Dortmund last summer, and he has improved in recent months after a tough start. Rashford's own troubles have been mentioned a lot in recent months, with the forward seemingly very short of confidence, and he has lost his place in the starting XI to youngster Anthony Elanga. Speaking of youngsters, fans will find it somewhat amusing that Rooney seemed to group Lingard in with the club's younger players. The England forward is now 29-years-old and it has become a meme over recent years that pundits have still considered him young. Lingard is out of contract in the summer and it's expected that he won't be starting any games in the near future for Rangnick and will leave in the summer. On who should replace the current interim boss, Rooney revealed that he'd rather have Pochettino than Ten Hag, due to his knowledge of the Premier League. ð£ ""If I'm choosing from one of them two, I'd go Pochettino.""Wayne Rooney backs Mauricio Pochettino over Erik ten Hag as Man United's next manager pic.twitter.com/eJc02heD1i Right now though, United's biggest priority will be trying to close the gap and make it into the top four.

And now RMC sports journalist Daniel Riolo has claimed that the 22-year-old has asked to leave the Ligue 1 giants after ""losing faith"" in their project. During a recent radio interview, Riolo believes that Mbappe's wish to leave the club will give Liverpool a ""free run"" when it comes to signing the French talisman. ""I know that Mbappe asked to leave,"" Riolo insisted, while predicting that the world-class forward will join a new team this summer.

It's said PSG are willing to give one of their star men a whopping Â£150 million signing-on fee, as well as a salary of Â£21 million per year.

Loadingâ¦ Mbappe's future at PSG is yet to be sorted. The forward's contract in France expires at the end of next season and, unlike teammate Neymar, he has yet to sign a new deal. The World Cup winner has been heavily linked with Real Madrid in the past, but Liverpool have been the other team potentially tied to his future. According to Le Parisien, the 22-year-old can 'see himself at Liverpool,' which would certainly be a hell of a boost for the Anfield club. One fan has put together a compilation of how that might look on the pitch, showing that Mbappe gets in some good positions that the Reds often play into. A Concept ;Kylian Mbappe x Liverpool FC :flag_fr::red_circle: pic.twitter.com/vcmG9XIcgh At the moment, Mbappe could leave for nothing at the end of next season and the report claims that whilst the club want him to sign till 2025, he only wants a 12 month extension and be allowed to leave for some money next summer. The Ligue 1 champions, who need Lille to drop points on the final day of the season on Sunday to defend their title, would have to consider selling him this summer or losing him on a free. Liverpool need to make sure they don't drop points on the same day to Crystal Palace to be assured of a top four finish, though Jurgen Klopp recently suggested his side won't sign Mbappe even if they do make it into next season's Champions League. ""Not playing Champions League doesn't help, obviously, but it is not our biggest problem because the market will be really strange,"" the former Borussia Dortmund boss warned. ""I hear a lot about big-money moves - is Kylian Mbappe going or not, [Erling] Haaland, [Jadon] Sancho - I don't see that happening because the football world is still not in the same place it was before. ""We will see how the market develops but it will not be an early market, for sure. ""If we don't go to the Champions League it is not good but there is still a chance and as long as we have a chance we should not speak about it as if we have no chance. And if it is not then we have to deal with that."" With 39 goals in 44 appearances this season, obviously the former Monaco forward would improve a Liverpool side whose only silverware this season in the Fair Play award. They have fallen 17 points behind league leaders Manchester City, having led by that many last season, and if Pep Guardiola's side do sign Harry Kane they may need a miracle to get back to parity, or at least Mbappe!

Loadingâ¦ You could have been forgiven for thinking that United's game on Saturday was Ronaldo's testimonial, with everything centred on the forward. It was his first game back in England's top tier for over 12 years, having moved to Real Madrid in 2009, and all eyes were on him after he was named in the starting line up. United had a pretty slow start to the game, and struggled to create too many clear cut chances, with Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire both having their best chances from corners, and Newcastle arguably had the better opportunities. However, in typical fashion, Ronaldo made it 1-0 to the hosts in the second minute of injury time at the end of the first half, changing the team talks for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Steve Bruce. Mason Greenwood took a shot from the edge of the area, which took a deflection off a Newcastle defender, and made life difficult for goalkeeper Freddie Woodman. Woodman could only parry the ball back into the box and it was Ronaldo who was the first to run onto it to tap into an empty net, to give his side the lead. If Solskjaer thought that his side would have it all their own way in the second half, having taken that late lead in the first, then he was extremely misguided. Newcastle unlocked their opponents defence with ease, in the 55th minute, with Allan Saint-Maximin playing in Javier Manquillo in the box. The full back ran onto the ball and slotted beyond David de Gea, leaving Old Trafford stunned in a moment of silence, having come to praise their new man. Ronaldo though was not to be denied his moment of glory, and it took him less than 10 minutes to put last season's Premier League runners up back in the lead. This time Luke Shaw came running forward in the 62nd minute, he played a perfect through ball into the box for Ronaldo, with the former Juventus striker running onto it perfectly. The 36-year-old took one touch with his right foot, rolling it into position for a shot on his left, and hit it with pace and power right through Woodman's legs. There's been plenty of jokes about Bruno Fernandes not scoring for the club now his countryman will likely be on penalties, but the midfielder once again proved people he's well capable of scoring away from the penalty spot. The former Sporting man scored a hat-trick against Leeds without one on the opening day, and he added his own on Saturday with a worldie from the edge of the area. The scoring wasn't done there though, with Jesse Lingard, on as a late substitute, scoring his first of the season for his club, with a lovely finish inside the box, but the headlines will still belong to Ronaldo.

Loadingâ¦ The usually reliable 27-year-old was gifted a golden opportunity to rescue a point from the spot deep into injury time after Aston Villa defender Kortney Hause was adjudged to have handled inside the box. However, Fernandes compiled a miserable week for United, blazing his effort wildly over the bar, condemning Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's charges to their second consecutive defeat. It led to the Portugal international taking to Twitter to relay a rather unnecessary apology given his previously impressive exploits for the Red Devils, telling fans: ""Nobody is more frustrated and disappointed than me for missing the penalty and the consequent defeat."" Debate over who would take penalty kicks for the Old Trafford outfit had rumbled on in the opening weeks of the new campaign following Cristiano Ronaldo's return to English shores. But now it's hard to imagine the five-time Ballon d'Or winner allowing his compatriot another chance to score from 18 yards after Fernandes sent his penalty high over Emiliano Martinez's crossbar. The disastrous effort saw Martinez do a celebratory dance in front of the Stretford End after initially playing mind games with the former Sporting Lisbon star, but that wasn't the end of the humiliation. On Sunday evening, many MOTD2 viewers were left surprised when the ending of the show was dedicated to mocking Fernandes's failed spot-kick. ""We leave you with the big question of the weekend: has anyone seen Bruno Fernandes's ball? Goodnight,"" said the show's host, rubbing salt into Bruno's still open wounds. The defeat against Villa leaves United sitting in fourth position in the Premier League table after six games, just one point behind table-toppers Liverpool. However, their below-par performance levels will be of concern to Solskjaer, and a tricky run of fixtures means things could be about to get even tougher for the 20-time English champions. They'll be hoping that Fernandes gets back to his scintillating best in the weeks to come after a fast start to the season, putting his humiliating penalty miss behind him. Words by George Cannon.

United made it through to the break only 1-0 down and former Everton defender Joleon Lescott was reluctant to criticise Maguire for the goal during BT Sport's half-time coverage. ""When your luck is out, your luck is out,"" Lescott said. ""Harry Maguire deflects the shot away from David De Gea but take nothing away from Gordon. ""He's tried to be the spark for Everton. He's reacted when he's lost the ball and won it back there. ""All of the sudden he's put his team in front."" Everton will move four points clear of the relegation zone if they beat United. Meanwhile, United could find themselves six points adrift of the Champions League places if they lose at Goodison Park and either fourth-place Tottenham beat Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon, or fifth-place Arsenal beat Brighton.

Loadingâ¦ The closing stages of Manchester City's 0-0 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, and the aftermath in the tunnel, was quite the wild ride. It all kicked off when Felipe fouled Phil Foden, and the City forward then rolled back onto the pitch to waste some time. Former City flop Savic wasn't happy with Atletico being handed a taste of their own sh*thouse medicine so attempted to pick Foden up. Grealish could be quite visibly seen giving Savic a new name, as he told him he'd see him next Tuesday, perhaps they're going to the Liverpool vs Manchester United game together... The feud, and the fall out since, has now landed the City man a new nickname, with the Mirror claiming that his teammates are now referring to Grealish as 'Peaky Jack.' Obviously the name is a reference to BBC drama show Peaky Blinders, and the gang that the show takes its title from, which is bases in Birmingham. It works perfectly with the fact that's where Grealish is from and because he's clearly willing to get himself involved in all sorts of mischief, although hopefully not the same as the actual gang. The rivalry between Grealish and Savic actually started last week, during the first leg, when the Â£100 million man came on as a substitute late in the game. Grealish managed to wind up two Atleti players without doing much and it led to the Montenegro defender telling the forward ""I'll have you in Madrid."" City were somewhat lucky on the night that Diego Simeone's side couldn't find the back of the net, especially late on, and they kept hold of their 1-0 lead on aggregate. The result means that they're through to just their third ever Champions League semi-final, as they look to become European champions for the first time. They will return to Madrid on May 4th for their semi, when they face Real Madrid, and at least Pep Guardiola knows that Simeone won't be giving Carlo Ancelotti any advice on how to be his side.

One of the crucial elements in Liverpool's swaggering attacking brilliance in the years before the 2020/21 campaign began, Mane has scored 20+ goals in each of the previous three seasons for the Reds. This campaign he has 14 goals in 44 matches and, more than that, hasn't looked like the sharp, all-action, livewire attacking threat of recent years. Things got so bad that the 29-year-old has explained how he even began to doubt his own body. ""This is the worst season of my career. I have to admit it,"" Mane told French television channel Canal+. ""If you ask me what is wrong I will struggle to give you an answer. Personally I don't know. I have always tried to be positive, whether things are going well or badly. I question myself all the time. ""I even underwent a test to take a look at my body. Am I eating the right foods, or has everything changed? But they checked the test results, and everything is fine."" It will be a relief for the club, for LFC fans and most importantly for the player himself that Mane's physical health is fine. But it does not help explain why his form has dipped so spectacularly. Liverpool have struggled badly the season after they won the Premier League with 99 points. But that is - in part, at least - due to a defensive injury crisis that has robbed Jurgen Klopp of his three first-choice centre-backs for a large part of the season. Occasionally using Fabinho and Jordan Henderson in defence also disrupted Liverpool's midfield. However Mohamed Salah, Mane's fellow wide attacking ace, hasn't seen his form suffer at all as a result. The Egyptian has netted 29 goals - including 20 in the Premier League - and sits just one behind Harry Kane in the Golden Boot standings. But Mane is not alone in struggling with the relentless nature of two football seasons interrupted by the pandemic, which forced the last campaign to run long into the summer. And as he only turned 29 in April, there is still time for him to get back to his sparkling best. ""I need to understand that in life there are ups and downs,"" said Mane to Canel+. ""I will keep on working hard - and perhaps in time this situation will pass."" All imagery: PA Images ",negative,liverpool,4

Salah opened the scoring in the Saturday kick-off with a superbly taken goal, but Liverpool missed a host of chances before Newcastle equalised five minutes into injury time at Anfield. Owen, however, said both Salah and Mane have ""been found wanting"" this season. ""That's the problem: Mane, brilliant player, scores lots of goals. Salah, unbelievable player as well, scores lots of goals,"" said Owen, who scored 158 goals for the club, per the Metro. ""But they're not natural finishers, they're not someone that you can hang your hat on. They've scored goals consistently because Liverpool have, like today, created so many chances. ""But they've been wanting, or the team have been found wanting a lot of the season with missed chances."" It seems a particularly strange accusation to level at Salah on the day he became the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in three different Premier League seasons. The Egyptian doesn't play as an out-and-out centre-forward but he still boasts 123 goals in 198 games for Liverpool and is fairly clinical in front of goal. So we're not sure what Liverpool academy graduate Owen means. Mane has struggled at times this season and isn't as prolific as Salah - but he tends to play slightly further out wide and his still scored 94 goals in five seasons, while netting in some huge games. Liverpool certainly wasted chances against Newcastle, with Mane one of the guilty party. But if Salah isn't a natural finisher, Owen's standards must be sky-high. Ironically, then England manager Glenn Hoddle was once widely ridiculed for claiming the teenage Owen wasn't a natural finisher (though he later said his comments had been taken out of context and called Owen - who scored 40 goals for the Three Lions - one of England's greatest finishers). Owen scored some crucial goals for Liverpool, including two in an FA Cup final win over Arsenal in 2001, the year he won the Ballon d'Or. However he damaged his standing with many supporters by leaving the club to join Real Madrid, then eventually joining Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United, where he won a Premier League winners medal. That was deserved for a player with 150 Premier League goals. Whether Owen's criticism of Mane's and - particularly - Salah's finishing ability was justified is another matter entirely.

Loadingâ¦ Rarely ever has any player managed to have such a disastrous appearance in such a short amount of time as Kepa's in the Carabao Cup final. The Chelsea keeper was left out of the starting line up against Liverpool, despite playing the games in the rest of the competition, but came on just a minute for penalties. Thomas Tuchel's move, that worked in the UEFA Super Cup earlier in the season, backfired as Kepa blazed over the penalty that saw Liverpool win the cup. Not only did he fail to score his own attempt, which is excusable for a keeper in fairness, but the Spaniard also failed to save any of Liverpool's attempts. Van Dijk may have broken him after just the third spot kick, as Kepa attempted to psyche out the Dutchman, only for him to blast it past the keeper and then stared him down after. This was a big alpha male move from Van Dijk.

Van Dijk's efforts in smashing Kepa's mind games into pieces was reminiscent of Andrea Pirlo's Panenka effort against England in Euro 2012. Joe Hart was bouncing along his line, trying to put Italian takers off, and had already saved from Riccardo Montolivo when Pirlo stepped up. The classy midfielder effortlessly chipped the ball down the centre of the goal, making a fool of Hart, and from there the England goalkeeper didn't get close to any other efforts, as Italy went through after two England misses. On this day in 2012, Andrea Pirlo scored this penalty against Joe Hart!""Joe Hart looked very confident in himself, so I thought we had to bring him down a peg or two.""(via @UEFAEURO) pic.twitter.com/CpsGzYXPN6 Van Dijk will have already felt aggrieved after it was his 'interference' that cost Klopp's side going ahead in normal time, which ended in penalties being required.

Loadingâ¦ Jurgen Klopp's side slipped to a 1-0 defeat against Inter Milan on Tuesday, but still advanced to the Champions League quarter-finals 2-1 on aggregate. Diaz was denied an equaliser on the night after an incredible Arturo Vidal block - but he didn't see it happen in real time. That's because the 25-year-old copied teammate Firmino's trademark 'no-look finish' but to no avail.

He's coming for Firmino's crown as the 'no-look' king just a few months into his Reds career after also producing one in the Carabao Cup final. Diaz received the ball out wide and flicked it over Reece James' head before sending Sadio Mane on his way. The Colombia international has only managed to score once since arriving from Porto but is already a fan favourite. Liverpool's defeat is their first at Anfield in over a year and it's thanks to Lautaro Martinez's sensational strike. Martinez fired past Alisson in the 61st minute, knowing they needed one more goal to take the game to extra time. Moments later, Alexis Sanchez was sent off for a second bookable offence and it swung the momentum in Liverpool's favour. The home side had their chances but failed to convert, even hitting the woodwork three times during the contest. Klopp explained at full-time per Liverpool Echo: ""I still hate it [losing]. But if there was any kind of game we could have afforded to lose it was tonight because the main target of this competition is to get through. ""Itâs not that Iâm over the moon. But Iâm really happy we went through because when we saw the draw in the first place we thought âokay, thatâs a tough oneâ. ""The goal was conceded we shouldnât have conceded even though the finish was brilliant, we could have done differently before then. ""Over the two legs we deserved it. Thatâs fine. We had some problem in the game for different reasons, one is the quality of the opponent, a really good football team. ""We know their set-up a little bit through facing Leeds [United] with [Marcelo] Bielsa but Inter have more quality and that makes it really difficult.""

Just days after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was relieved of his duties following a 4-1 defeat against Watford, the Reds managed to bounce back at the Estadio de la Ceramica on Tuesday night. They secured all three points in what was a crucial Group F clash against Villarreal as two second-half goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho helped them secure a place in the Champions League last-16. Solskjaer's former first-team coach couldn't have wished for a better result and after the whistle, Sky pundit and Liverpool legend produced a viral post on Twitter to mark the occasion. ""Manchester United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table and let him sign it."" Carragher wrote on Twitter. ""Let him right whatever numbers he wants, let him sign the contract. Carrick's at the wheel man."" Of course, Carragher's statement is in reference to Rio Ferdinand's iconic speech after United secured a place in the Champions League last-16 following a last gasp win against PSG in 2019. Ferdinand certainly made it clear that he wanted SolskjÃ¦r to be appointed on a permanent basis in the BT Sport studio that day. ""Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there -- given what he's done since he's come in -- and let him sign the contract and go,"" he said. ""Ole's at the wheel, man -- he's doing his thing. Man United are back!"" Ferdinand, meanwhile, praised United for a solid, ""no thrills"" performance against Villarreal on Tuesday night. ""There's no doubt in my mind that in that changing room, they would have been pushing the clean sheet message,"" Ferdinand told BT Sport. ""This game was about no thrills, discipline and they had a plan. They're the things we've been asking for for weeks and weeks and weeks. ""This wasn't a performance of beautiful, fairy-tale, imaginative football we can all eulogise about. ""It was roll your sleeves up, get into position, be there and be hard to beat.

200,https://www.sportbible.com/football/manchester-city-and-liverpool-named-englands-greatest-football-rivalry-20220408,Manchester City And Liverpool Named England's 'Greatest Football Rivalry',"Jamie Carragher has claimed that Manchester City and Liverpool's rivalry is the 'greatest' in the history of English football. Loadingâ¦ City and Liverpool are both currently considered two of, if not the, best teams in the world and are battling it out on three fronts, with the Reds having already won the Carabao Cup. They are hoping to win an unprecedented quadruple this season, as they chase the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup and City could stand in their way on all three fronts, chasing their own Treble. Manchester United are the only team to have won the Treble in England in the past, and Sir Alex Ferguson's side did so in opposition with Arsenal, defeating the Gunners in the FA Cup semi final and beating them to the league by one point, on the last day of the season. #OnThisDay in 2005, Patrick Vieira vs Roy Keane in the Highbury tunnel. pic.twitter.com/OcaTA5jrMg The two sides finished one and two to each other in the league on five occasions, and there were some huge flash points in their rivalry, but Carragher believes the current clash is a 'greater' rivalry, mostly due to the quality of the two sides. ""There is a uniqueness to it. This is the first time the two best teams in England are the two best teams in the world, led by the two greatest coaches of their generation,"" the former Liverpool defender wrote in his column in the Telegraph. Arguing against the rivalry between Fergie's side and the one managed by Arsene Wenger, that saw the two sides finish one and two in the Premier League five times, Carragher mentioned their lack of rivalry in Europe. ""Arsenal were Unitedâs closest challengers when Fergusonâs side completed the treble in 1999, edged out in the Premier League and FA Cup,"" he added. ""But their rivalry never infiltrated the Champions League, aside from a semi-final in 2009, by which time Arsenal were not the force they were."" Carragher also argued that the two sides couldn't always claim to be the best two in Europe, whilst City and Liverpool can lay claim to that, despite neither being champions of Europe currently - which is a fair statement because being Champions League winners doesn't by definition make you the best in Europe as it's a knockout tournament. Arguing that the current top of the table rivalry 'ticks every box,' the Sky Sports pundit said, ""They are among the best teams to ever play in English football, guided by legendary coaches, who are well ahead of everyone else in this country. ""...Whenever City meets Liverpool, I see it as the best team in the world with the ball coming up against the best team in the world without it. ""That is a little simplistic. Liverpool are well-tuned at keeping possession, and City expertly drilled to get it back, but there is a style contrast which makes it one of the most tactically exciting games."" Carragher's arguments that the two sides are above anything on the pitch, in terms of quality, of previous rivalries in English football certainly holds some credence. However many will point to the fact that there is nowhere near the needle that existed between United and Arsenal, or even Chelsea and United, or Chelsea and Liverpool in the Premier League era. Whoever does come out on top in the current rivalry could certainly go down as the best team in the Premier League's history, especially if they go on to equal or even beat the feat by Fergie's side in 1999.

The Dane was interviewed after the full time whistle, as the 2016 Premier League champions waited to pick up the trophy.

The pair were so even in the first half that neither side was able to get a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes. It took until the 53rd minute until someone did register a shot on target, as Marcos Alonso's effort went straight at Schmeichel. Youri Tielemans scored the only goal of the game 10 minutes later, with a goal befitting any final, which was the Foxes' first shot on target. Schmeichel made his first big save when he got fingertips to Ben Chilwell's 78th minute header but better was to come. The 34-year-old dived to save Mason Mount's goal bound shout in the 87th minute when it looked certain to be the equaliser. Chelsea then thought they had scored just a minute later when Chilwell's shot bounced of Wes Morgan and into the goal, but celebrations were cut short by VAR.

Vardy's 24 league goals fuelled Leicester's fairytale Premier League triumph. However the man himself was fuelled by fortified wine - as his teammate at the time, Ritchie De Laet, explained. ""Well, on the evening before the 11th game, we were in our hotel room,"" De Laet told Belgian media outlet Sportwereld. ""We had our own ritual."" ""We would get the team coach driver to buy us a bottle of port, and hide it away in our room. ""I drank a small glass of it - and he polished off the rest of the bottle. The next day he broke the record. What a guy."" It's well known that - back in the 2015/16 season, at least - Vardy's lifestyle habits weren't exactly traditional. The Leicester No 9 admitted to having a cheeky glass of port to help him sleep - and even having his own, homebrewed, giant bottle of Skittle vodka. But a whole bottle of port (minus De Laet's small glass) is yet another step. The famously caffeine-loving Vardy has apparently begun to adhere to more typical nutritional advice in recent years under Brendan Rodgers. However he's always trained and played at maximum intensity - and won the Premier League Golden Boot last season having scored 23 goals at the age of 33. So clearly the port measures - large or small - haven't impacted the Leicester great's remarkable longevity. Cheers to you, Vards. Bottoms up. All imagery: PA Images ",positive,liverpool,0

The Foxes had lost their previous four FA Cup finals going into their fifth. But Brendan Rodgers' side broke that pattern in front of fans at Wembley, after the Belgium international hammered one in just after the hour mark to deliver a 1-0 triumph. Ayoze Perez intercepted possession, played it to Luke Thomas who fed Tielemans. The midfielder strode forward and unleashed a howitzer from outside the box - which flew into the top corner giving Kepa Arrizabalaga no chance. Thomas Tuchel's side thought they had a late equaliser when Ben Chilwell's cross was bundled into the Leicester net. However a VAR review revealed Chilwell had been offside - by the narrowest of margins - and the 'goal' was chalked off. Man of the Match Tielemans' strike was a sensational goal, worthy of winning any FA Cup final, and it broke open an incredibly tight game to that point. Chelsea did their best to respond straight away - Chilwell glancing the post with a header - but Leicester held on. A key moment late on was Schmeichel making a diving, one-handed save from Mason Mount. A tense, goalless first 45 minutes saw both Leicester and Chelsea have half-chances. But neither side managed a shot on target and probably the most thrilling moment of the game was the roar from the fans in attendance as the teams arrived on the pitch.

""I remember studying a lot of Chelsea's penalties on DVD before the match."" van der Sar said. ""So, for example, I think I probably analysed about 40 that Frank Lampard had taken in the past. I had made plenty of notes and noticed that Nicolas Anelka would almost always take his penalties to the goalkeeper's right."" Terry did eventually go on to lift the Champions League title four years later, when the west London side defeated Bayern Munich on penalties in Germany. However even that victory was tainted for the club captain, as he didn't even play in the game, after being sent off in the semi-final second leg against Barcelona. Terry was then mocked for turning up in full kit to lift the trophy but given the chance we'd probably all do the same, especially after the pain of Moscow. ",positive,liverpool,1

He was meant to go on loan to Feyenoord last summer but injury denied him the chance. On Thursday it was announced he'd be joining Rangers until the end of the season, having also been linked to Derby County in the transfer window. The 19-year-old was put straight into the starting line up on Saturday afternoon, as the Scottish Premiership league leaders took on Ross County. It took Diallo just five minutes to make an impact, as the Ivory Coast winger managed to slot home from close range, following good work from Joe Aribo, fresh from his time at the Africa Cup of Nations with Nigeria.

His slight build might be one reason the club have been a bit reticent to play him in more games but he should get some much needed experience in Scotland. If he can start to show the promise that United know he has north of the border then he could be considered a very important member of the squad next season, especially with the likes of Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard leaving.

The youngster will be looking to make another statement in Europe on Wednesday night when United come up against Villarreal in the Europa League final, and fans are desperate to see him feature after showing his talents in training earlier. Live footage of the club's training session at the Polsat Plus Arena in Gdansk, Poland, was broadcast online for fans to watch on Tuesday evening, with Amad delivering a perfectly weighted, inch-perfect pass to Daniel James, who finished in style.  Just a matter of weeks after signing for the club, Diallo made his highly-anticipated debut in the club's emphatic 6-3 win against Liverpool U23 - and even back then, fans believed has more than ready to break into Solskjaer's first-team plans. The Ivory Coast-born forward surpassed all expectations in the Premier League U23 clash and his individual highlights prove that. It took just 13 minutes for Diallo to open his account for the club when he pounced on a sloppy touch from Liverpool centre-back Billy Koumetio. He then used his speed and power to clip the ball away from Koumetio before showcasing composure in front of goal to slot past Marcelo Pitagula. Oh, and he bagged panenka penalty to make it 6-2. Are Manchester United fans excited by the prospect of Diallo getting a run of games in the first team next season? Should Solskjaer give him that game time so soon? Let us know in the comments.

But he's still showed glimpses of his individual talent, including a superb backwards header against AC Milan in the Europa League; Diallo's first goal for the club.

City raced clear of their title rivals over the festive period and at one point were 14 points clear of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. However, Liverpool used their two games in hand to claw their way back into the title race after seeing City drop points against Tottenham and Crystal Palace.

The two title contenders will go head-to-head at the Etihad on Sunday in a mouth-watering clash at the top of the table and Guardiola says he always expected the Reds to fight their way back into contention. ""What is sure in Liverpool and City in the last years, we raised the bar and raised the targets that the Premier League had before,"" said Guardiola. ""The other teams realised they had to push more if they want to chase us. ""In the last five or six years, one year we were a little bit out, last year they had injuries and United was there.

There was a polite pat on the shoulder from Van Dijk before Guardiola playfully slapped Liverpool's No.4 on the arm and allowed to speak to the media. Guardiola was desperate to sign Van Dijk when he was at Southampton and a deal was said to be close in 2017. However, they were put off by the price tag and ended up signing Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao for Â£57 million. Van Dijk would then sign for Liverpool in a Â£75 million switch, becoming the world's most expensive defender. But he's more than justified his price tag, helping the Reds to the Champions League, Premier League and Carabao Cup courtesy of a series of imperious displays. And in July 2020, Van Dijk admitted Klopp was a key factor in him moving to Anfield. ""I had the chance to go to Chelsea and Man City,"" Van Dijk said, as per the Manchester Evening News. ""When you compare the clubs, you look at the history, the town, the current squad, their plans for the near future. âBut the most important thing you look at is the manager â and Jurgen Klopp is an important reason why I chose for Liverpool. âKlopp has something special.

Vidic, who is considered one of the best defenders in Premier League history, lifted five Premier League titles and a Champions League during a remarkable spell at Old Trafford. Now, the 39-year-old former United captain claimed Maguire looks ""confident and comfortable"" for England. Vidic awarded the England star an eight out of 10 rating, adding that Maguire is ""still improving."" He wrote for The Athletic: ""Harry Maguire looks confident and comfortable, even more for his country than for Manchester United. ""He's a defender who is still improving, but if he wants to be recognised at the highest level he has to win trophies. When I look at Maguire I see a defender who is good at everything, 8/10 at everything. ""He's not as good on the ball or as fast as Rio Ferdinand was for example, and he doesn't tackle or head like I did, but he has quality across his game. ""He's fast enough, he's strong enough, he can jump and play the ball, his positioning is fine.""

United recently handed Bruno Fernandes a new four-year deal worth Â£15m-a-year a week but are set to recoup some of that cost by clearing out their squad at the end of the season. Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are all expected to leave Old Trafford this summer when their respective contracts come to an end. Loadingâ¦ According to The Athletic, the four players command a collective weekly wage of Â£750,000, with Pogba accounting for the bulk of that figure. Pogba, 29, cost United a then world record Â£89.3m fee when he rejoined the club from Juventus in 2016. However, after a largely underwhelming second spell at Old Trafford, Pogba is now set to leave on a free transfer. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus have all been linked with the France international, who is yet to make a final decision over his future. Cavani, 35, is also expected to depart the club after struggling with injuries during his second season with the Red Devils. Cavani joined United on a free transfer in 2020 and impressed in his debut season at the club, scoring 17 goals in all competitions. But the Uruguay international has been restricted to just six league starts this term and is now set to leave the club, with a return to South America viewed as one potential destination for the striker.

Meanwhile, Lingard, 29, is also expected to leave the club after finding his first-team opportunities limited following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. Lingard was strongly linked with a move to Newcastle in the January transfer window before talks broke down over a potential loan deal until the end of the season.

Loadingâ¦ Rangnick joined United in December, taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer until the end of the season, and his appointment as interim has caused lots of criticism. He is set to stay on at the club next season, and the year after, as a consultant, although no one is quite sure what that will entail for the 63-year-old. However, he could actually end up being too busy to work for the Old Trafford outfit next season, with a team eyeing him up to fill a vacancy as manager. According to Austrian outlet Kurier, the Austria national team want Rangnick to be their new manager and claim that sporting director Peter Schottel flew to Manchester on Tuesday to hold talks. The German is likely to have a decent knowledge of football in Austria, having been director of football for Red Bull Salzburg for a number of years. Salzburg won a number of Austrian Bundesliga and Austrian Cups under his leadership and saw the team qualify for the Champions League and Europa League. Franc Foda was previously in charge of the national team but they failed to qualify for the World Cup, losing to Wales in the play off semi final, and he quit after the loss. Despite never having managed an international team before, Rangnick could be the perfect man to do the role with so many years of coaching behind him, and it could even suit him as time constraints might still allow him to work with United. Even when he does leave the Premier League, Rangnick's impact on England's top tier could still be felt, with the United interim boss recently suggesting referees should train with clubs. According to reports, the suggestion, made at a recent meeting that included referee chief Mike Riley, other managers were in favour of the idea. The former RB Leipzig manager's future isn't the only one up in the air, with United not yet knowing who is going to replace him.

When asked if he'd spoken to Martial about the comments, Rangnick replied: âNo. Then I would react to what his agent has said and it should be the player.â The 26-year-old was former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's go-to man for most of his reign, with Martial scoring 23 goals in 2019/2020. However, Mason Greenwood's emergence and the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani have seen him slide down the pecking order. Martial arrived from Monaco as a hot prospect in 2015 and immediately made an impact, scoring on his debut against bitter rivals Liverpool. He's won the FA Cup, Europa League and Carabao Cup as a United player but not kicked on to become one of the world's best as hoped. Rangnick is aware United need strengthening after an underwhelming season so far, but he thinks the squad is too bloated. Last Tuesday saw a number of first-team players given the day off for a Champions League dead rubber with Young Boys. The game ended 1-1 and Rangnick got a better view of a few fringe players. When asked about potential moves in January, the 63-year-old replied: ""I've got to know them better in this week, I saw most of them play in the two games and had three, four or five training sessions this week,. ""But it's still too early to speak about what might happen in the winter transfer window. If I look at the number of players we have, it's still a big squad, we definitely do not have not enough players."" ",positive,liverpool,1
222,https://www.sportbible.com/football/ralf-rangnick-has-confirmed-manchester-united-have-changed-formation-20220119,Ralf Rangnick Has Confirmed Manchester United Have Permanently Changed Formation,"Ralf Rangnick has confirmed Manchester United have switched formation and will not play with a 4-2-2-2 system going forward. Rangnick implemented his favourite formation upon taking the interim job at United following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Loadingâ¦ The 63-year-old has used it at various different clubs in his career but it's not been a success in the early months at Old Trafford, where he has four wins, three draws and one loss in eight games. United supporters have questioned the formation and its suitability, with the balance between attack and defence not being there and the team barely pressing. Things were tweaked for the 2-2 draw against Aston Villa and Rangnick has confirmed he will now deploy a more fluid 4-3-3. He made the admission when asked about Jesse Lingard's role ahead of the trip to Brentford. Rangnick: ""We have now decided to play in a 4-3-3 like we played against Aston Villa, with one holding six and two eights, with three offensive players."" #mulive ""We have now decided to play a 4-3-3 like we did against Aston Villa, with one holding six, two eights and three offensive players,"" Rangnick said, as per Metro. ""There are two positions that he can play but we also have some competition in those positions. Obviously, he needs to play and train on the kind of level that he is an option to start. ""We have a big squad, maybe a little bit too big of a squad. As far as I know, his contract is expiring in the summer and the question is what will happen after that four months. Again, he is a player who can play, I brought him on in the last 10 minutes of the Villa game along withDonny van de Beek."" The change of system could spark an end to the Scott McTominay and Fred pivot, but a big beneficiary of the 4-3-3 and specifically, an attacking free, could be Jadon Sancho. After a slow start following on from his Â£73 million switch from Borussia Dortmund, Rangnick thinks he can thrive on either flank. âIt's clear in a 4-3-3 that he (Sancho) is a player for either of the wing positions, either left or right, he can play both,"" Rangnick commented. ""I think he would prefer a little bit the left side, because then he can switch inside and shoot on goal with his strong right foot. âBut for me there's no questions about his position. ""He's a winger, as we say in Germany, someone who can dribble fast with the ball and for me there's not at all a question over the best possible position for him."" United play Brentford away on Wednesday night, with top scorer and talisman Cristiano Ronaldo set to return after missing the last two games. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Having beaten Manchester United in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition, Atletico were back in the north west of England on Tuesday night to take on City in the quarter final first leg. Whilst United didn't offer much going forward, Atleti's previous win was built around their staunch defence but it was going to have to be much stauncher against Pep Guardiola's team. City are well known for their attacking prowess, and the biggest struggle for the side from the Spanish capital was keeping the score as close to level as possible to keep themselves in the tie before next week's return to the Wanda Metropolitano. Fans on social media noticed that Simeone had set up his side with no one upfront and two banks of five, in order to nullify their opponents own tactics.

Simeone and his tactics deserve a place in hellð¤ In fairness to the La Liga champions, their tactics seemed to be working, especially in the first half, as the English champions struggled to create much in the way of clear chances. At the beginning of the second half the visitors even had a few chances on the break, as whatever was said at half time clearly had an impact. Even with a few more chances for City, it did look for a while like what Atleti were attempting to do was working, and some people were impressed with the tactics. enjoy jokes about simeone's terrorism as much as the next person but the amount of work & man management it takes to get attacking players like greizmann & joao felix to buy into this system & give everything for the cause is so impressive. also, diversity in tactics is good. https://t.co/4lKHudYnRO It's like people hate Simeone for having tactics. If attacking football is a style of play and can be employed using tactics to win matches, then you can't blame Simeone for using defensive football and imposing his tactics to win matches Can't get my head around people slating Simeone tactics. Personally think it's brilliant management. All players know their role and give their all for him. Proper coach, would love him in the Prem #MCIATL All of his players are completely bought into his idea of football, so are the fans. Heâs created a whole culture and Iâm grateful, football needs some variety in styles. Beats me why people bashing Simeone for having tactics? He's trying his best not to let them score/win and been quite successful so far. People will diss Simeoneâs tactics but Atletico are WELLLLL ORGANISED With time ticking away, and Simeone looking set to get the 0-0 draw he wanted to take back to Spain next week, Guardiola was able to change the match with a triple substitution. The two times Champions League winning manager brought on Jack Grealish, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden in the 68th minute, and it changed the game. Just one minute and 20 seconds after coming on, it was Foden who set up Kevin de Bruyne for the only goal of the game. If they manage to overturn the deficit in the home leg, no Atletico Madrid fans will care how their side played on Tuesday night. ",positive,liverpool,0

Benzema scored a hat-trick against PSG in the previous round, to complete a brilliant comeback, and then scored his second in-a-row in the competition last week in the first leg of their quarter final with Chelsea. However, it looked for much of the game on Tuesday that the striker and his teammates would be on the wrong end of a comeback this time. Fresh from battering Southampton 6-0 at the weekend, Thomas Tuchel's side had early chances through Timo Werner and Antonio Rudiger. It only took till the 13th minute for Mason Mount to get the English side right back in the tie, as his tidy finish made him only the third Englishman, after Alan Smith and Danny Welbeck, to score against Real at the Bernabeu in the competition. That's the perfect start for Chelsea! ð¥A fortunate way through for Mason Mount, but there was nothing fortunate about the finish... ð¯We're down to a one-goal deficit! #UCL pic.twitter.com/O5uMYZlGTE In the first leg Vinicius Junior caused the European champion's defence all sorts of bother but, other than forcing Reece James into an early challenge that earned him a yellow card, the young Brazilian was very quiet this time round. Los Blancos went into the break without having tested Edouard Mendy in the first half, something that couldn't have happened all too often. Chelsea again started the second half the better team and Rudiger headed them level from a 51st minute corner, although the hosts will be annoyed that it shouldn't have been a corner. CHELSEA ARE LEVEL! ðAnother great header in a tie full of great headers! ð¥Antonio RÃ¼diger powers the ball home from a corner to make it 3-3 on aggregate...#UCL pic.twitter.com/ACRwp5xAIt In previous years it would have still meant the hosts were ahead on away goals, having scored three at Stamford Bridge, but that rule was removed ahead of this season. The away fans were then sent into pandemonium when it looked like Marcos Alonso had put them into the lead for the first time in the tie. Alonso rifled the ball past Thibaut Courtois, after getting bit of a lucky bounce, only for VAR to rule that it had flicked up off his hand in the build up. Chelsea thought they had gone ahead in the tie...ð¥ But after a VAR review, it was judged Marcos Alonso handled the ball in the build-up to scoring âHarsh or fair?#UCL pic.twitter.com/WYVjIN9ppw Benzema finally had his best chance of the night just minutes after, as he headed a cross against the bar, and over, as the game really came to life. In the 75th minute Chelsea were ahead in the tie, as Werner collected the ball from Mateo Kovacic on the left, drifted inside Dani Carvajal and slotted into the back of the net. The game took perhaps its biggest twist of the night just five minutes later however, as substitute Rodrygo scored just two minutes after coming on. It was all down to Luka Modric's incredible ball, as the Croatian played a sumptuous ball over the top with the outside of his right boot and Rodrygo got in place to volley it past Mendy from inside the area. Christian Pulisic had the perfect chance to win the game in injury time, as he somehow missed the target after a free kick was flicked down to him inside the box, and instead the game went to extra time. Of course it was Benzema who made the big contribution in the added 30 minutes, as Real pounced on mistakes in the Chelsea defence, for the first time on the night. IT JUST HAD TO BE HIM! ðKarim Benzema gets his goal in extra-time, and it's advantage to Real Madrid once again...An absolute thriller at the BernabÃ©u! ð¥µ#UCL pic.twitter.com/S16zuWUtdz N'Golo Kante was dispossessed in midfield and the ball was passed to Vinicius, the Brazilian chipped a cross towards Benzema and Rudiger slipped at the same time, allowing a free header for the French striker, who headed past Mendy. Kai Havertz had the perfect chance to equalise in the 117th minute, when he managed to guide a free header, from James' cross, high and wide of the goal. A minute later Jorginho again had the perfect opportunity to take it to penalties. Mendy came up for a corner and it was aimed towards the keeper, the ball was cleared but just outside the area, when Hakim Ziyech played it back into the mixer, Jorginho slashed at his chance and put it wide.

City progressed to the semi-finals courtesy of a 1-0 aggregate lead achieved in the first fixture, digging in deep in the second leg to claim a hard-fought 0-0 draw. Loadingâ¦ But tensions boiled over hugely at the end, with Atleti defender Felipe being shown a second yellow card for leaving one on Phil Foden, who he had bloodied and brutalised in the first half with a nasty challenge that somehow didn't result in a caution. It was then Stefan Savic's turn to lose his head, trying to drag Foden to his feet, appearing to attempt a headbutt on Raheem Sterling and pulling the hair of Jack Grealish.

Loadingâ¦ It has been an unhappy title defence for Liverpool, after they won their first league title in 30 years last season, with Klopp's side not looking likely to challenge since January. Whilst the drop off since the last campaign might be some cause for worry, there's no doubt that Klopp's side have been extremely hampered by injuries. They have been without centre backs Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip for much of the season and the former Borussia Dortmund boss believes that even City wouldn't have won the league under similar circumstances. ""With our injuries it was not the year to become champions,"" the Liverpool boss said in his press conference on Friday. ""No chance - for nobody. ""As good as they are, if City have their three centre-halves out, no [they don't win the league]. Three centre-halves of [Manchester] United, no."" Certainly Pep Guardiola has had his best defenders in place for the whole season and the signing of Ruben Dias has had a similar impact to the one Van Dijk had at Anfield when the Dutchman arrived. Dias won the FWA Player of the Year award this week and, as well as his own form, his presence improved the form of John Stones, who looked on the way out of City last summer. With Aymeric Laporte also available to Guardiola, it's no doubt their strength at the back is the best in the league, even with Nathan Ake 27 games for the club this season. Liverpool's form wasn't too bad at the start of the season, even after losing Van Dijk in the 2-2 draw with Everton in October, but they only won three in 12 from the start of January, including a run of four losses in-a-row at one point. That poor form made it look likely the team would miss out on a top four finish and not be in the Champions League next season. However the team are unbeaten in nine, winning seven of those, and now look set to finish in the top four, as long as they don't lose to Crystal Palace on Sunday. Klopp said his players have made the best of their bad situation, saying, ""We have fought back a bit, accepted the difficulties and made the best of it, and if we win on Sunday, and if we qualify for the Champions League, then we made the best of it. That is it."" ",positive,liverpool,4

Loadingâ¦ The Reds defender clashed with Iheanacho just before half-time on Tuesday evening and it saw Iheanacho hit the deck very awkwardly. Matip was already on a yellow card and managed to evade a second booking - something which infuriated talkSPORT presenter O'Hara. He immediately tweeted: âMatip should be off. I hate players that lean over and players go over the top, could break his neck. Refs need to stamp it out."" pic.twitter.com/faI6yvN01g Iheanacho needed treatment on the pitch but thankfully carried on before being substituted for Youri Tielemans in the second half. Mohamed Salah had the chance to put Liverpool ahead in the first half with a penalty, but saw it saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Salah then headed the rebound against the bar after a few words from James Maddison. Ademola Lookman put Leicester ahead just minutes after coming on after smashing home a lovely Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall through ball. Liverpool are now six points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, who have the chance to extend that gap to nine points should they beat Brentford on Wednesday. Manager Jurgen Klopp believes his side were 'very bad' at the King Power Stadium and commented on City pulling away. âItâs a big gap,â he admitted post-match. âTo top that, Chelsea and us play against each other. It was not our plan to give City the chance to run away. ""If we play like tonight we do not think about catching up with City, but if we play our football we can see what that means. ""I donât have a proper explanation for tonight. To find it is my main concern, not City. âWe played a really bad game, so it was well deserved. It was a very strange game.

Maldini, who is now technical director of football at Milan, began his 25 year playing career at the football club in 1984 and went on to be considered as one of the greatest defender's to play the sport. During his time at Milan, the one-club man was part of numerous successful teams, winning a colossal seven Serie A and five Champions Leagues. On the international stage, Maldini made 126 appearances for Italy, however he was never able to win a trophy with his country. Despite his club career lasting until 2009, he rejected his call-up to the national squad in 2006 which meant that he was unable to be part of the World Cup winning team. His longevity and quality was recognised by his fellow players, coming just second to George Weah for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995, and also being placed third in the Ballon d'Or ranking in 1994 and 2003. One of the other greatest ever Italian defenders to grace the game, Franco Baresi, spoke of his unbelievable talent: ""We were team-mates for 15 years. We read each other's brain; moved as if we were one person. He could play in every defensive role - extraordinary. Playing with him was a pleasure and an honour."" Maldini's appreciation was not just bound to those who played alongside him, Jamie Carragher, Liverpool legend and Sky Sports pundit said: ""It is outstanding what he has achieved at this level at his age. ""He is a world great, one of the best of his era. He has won the whole lot in his career, with five European Cups now. He will be remembered for a long time."" The former Brazil striker Ronaldo Luis Nazario, who is considered by many to be one of the greatest forwards to have every played, said: ""Paolo Maldini is the best I've played against."" Since over a decade has passed since Maldini's retirement in 2009, he is still widely seen as one of the greatest players to have played and is etched into Milan and Italy history. His father, Cesare Maldini, who played and managed for Milan himself said: ""He's a real Rossonero. His soul belongs to Milan."" ",positive,liverpool,1

In a 15-year spell with Barcelona's first team, he captained his team to numerous titles, including three Champions League winners medals, six La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey's and two UEFA Super Cup's. On this day in 1999, Carles Puyol made his Barcelona debut.He played in 593 matches, winning 21 trophies.8x Spanish Super Cup :trophy:6x LaLiga :trophy:3x UEFA Champions League :trophy:2x Spanish Cup 2x FIFA Club World Cup:trophy:2x UEFA Super Cup :trophy:Captain fantastic :red_circle::large_blue_circle: pic.twitter.com/dvJmGXaKiP On the international stage he also won over 100 caps for Spain, winning the European Championships in 2008 before lifting a World Cup two years later after that 118th minute from Andres Iniesta. But for many, it was Puyol's incredible attitude and application that made him stand out on and off the pitch. He was hard, but fair. Just take a look at this compilation - a man with great morals. Puyol once said: ""I don't have RomÃ¡rio's technique, Marc Overmars' pace or Patrick Kluivert's strength, but I work harder than the others. I'm like the student who is not as clever, but studies for his exams and does okay in the end."" If a quote had to sum up this incredibly hard-working centre-back from the small town of La Pobla de Segur in Catalonia, this would be it. His character and personality was often seen on the pitch. Back in 2010, he invited AC Milan midfielder Ronaldinho to join Barcelona's team photo. He also memorably placed the captain's armband on teammate Eric Abidal's arm when he famously lifted the Champions League trophy, just months after being diagnosed with cancer. In a typically selfless quote soon after Abidal lifted the cup, Puyol said that the greatest moment during his 15-year career was the 2011 Champions League win at Wembley. Not because of the result, but the fact that his friend was able to lift the trophy after a long battle with illness. Along with the morals that stood him in such high regard during his career, a story from one of his closest friends Gerard Pique, who he talks about in our interview below, really typifies his attitude to the cause. As told by Sid Lowe from The Guardian, the Barcelona defender describes Puyol with a perfect story. ""I can't imagine a Barcelona team without him,"" PiquÃ© says. ""He wears me out! I remember the day he came back after injury and in the middle of the game I said: 'Puyi, I've missed you so much.' He told me to shut the hell up and concentrate. He never stops. ""One time, the game was stopped, someone was on the stretcher, and he was shouting at me. I said to him: Calm down, it's 4-0 and there are three minutes left.' He said: 'So what? Focus! I know you.' I was dying with laughter. ""Puyol keeps you on your toes at all times."" ",positive,liverpool,0

But the likes of Terry Butcher and Tony Adams would be unlikely to survive in today's game. The role of the old-fashioned stopper and header of crosses has evolved into a ball-playing footballer with lightning defensive reflexes and a sixth sense for sniffing out danger before it happens. Here we pick our top 10 centre-backs in the world. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: It's hard to believe that the same player that made 260 appearances for Southampton and 60 for Crystal Palace had arguably his best season at the age of 37. Captaining a Lille side that won its first Ligue 1 title since 2010/11, the 6ft 3in veteran provided key leadership for Christophe Galtier's young team. His form was rewarded with a place in Fernando Santos' Portugal squad for Euro 2021. 2020/21 Season Stats: Watchers of Euro 2021 would have seen Aymeric Laporte's trademark cross-field switch time and again in the tournament as he and his Spanish teammates progressed to the semi-finals. Manchester City fans will hope that his performance at the championships doesn't give him itchy feet despite Barcelona's recent interest dwindling. The left-footer looked set to form a dream team with Ruben Dias at the heart of Pep Guardiola's defence only for COVID and injury to allow John Stones' renaissance to begin. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 32-year-old German may be on the verge of international retirement but the 2020/21 season proved he has plenty in the tank in domestic football. The 2014 World Cup-winner led Dortmund in blocks, aerial battles won, clearances and interceptions, was the second most prolific tackler and third most accurate passer. Oh and he chipped in with five Bundesliga goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: A year ago, John Stones looked to be an afterthought for both Pep Guardiola and England's Gareth Southgate. On the outside of the England squad, looking in, Manchester City had just splurged Â£61million on Benfica's Portugal star Ruben Dias. With Nathan Ake incoming and Aymeric Laporte in place, Stones' City career seemed to be slipping away. But his partnership with Dias gelled instantly when thrust together in November as Stones returned to the classy, ball-playing 26-year-old that caught the eye of Guardiola before he joined City and the duo helped the Premier League champions to 19 clean sheets. 2020/21 Season Stats: Notable in their absence from this top 10 are former Spain mainstays Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique. Pique's 2020/21 season was error- and injury-filled while Ramos was let go by Real Madrid after 16 extraordinary years. Part of the reason for that was the presence of Frenchman Varane. With the ideal build for a central defender, he's able to outmuscle attackers but is also cultured enough to play out from the back, which he did for France at Euro 2021, completing 271 of his 288 passes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Not blessed with tremendous pace, Slovakian Milan Skriniar uses his 6ft 2in frame, timing and positional awareness to get the job done. As a passer, his skills are up there with the best and he's been pushed into central midfield for Slovakia at times. On their way to ending their 11-year title drought, Skriniar and co conceded a league-low 35 goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: There were worries over the fitness of Manchester United captain Harry Maguire going into Euro 2021 but after missing the first two group games, he slipped in alongside John Stones and calmly led England to three more clean sheets and a semi-final victory. One of the leaders in Gareth Southgate's camp, the world's most expensive defender was dominant in 2020/21 for United, finishing second among Premier League defenders in aerial battles won. 2020/21 Season Stats: It's a mark of the immense talent of Virgil van Dijk that he's still in the top three of this list after a season in which he started just five Premier League matches and missed Euro 2021 entirely. The horror tackle from Jordan Pickford in the Merseyside derby in October sent van Dijk to the surgeon's table and left Liverpool's championship defence needing medical intervention for the rest of the season. He's expecting to join Jurgen Klopp's side for preseason training in July but acknowledges that he's faced ""a long road"" and may not be fully up to speed come season kick-off. 2020/21 Season Stats: Centre-back is not perhaps the position you immediately associate Brazilian footballers with but Marquinhos has followed in the footsteps of Lucio, Aldair, Luis Perieira and former PSG teammate Thiago Silva as a defensive rock. His technical ability and agility ensure he stands out even on a team of galacticos like Mbappe, Verrati and Neymar. An elegant defender with a Brazilian's comfort on the ball, the PSG captain scored three times in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League and netted for Brazil in the first game of their Copa America campaign, where they conceded just two goals on the way to the final. 2020/21 Season Stats: Pep Guardiola had spent freely in an attempt to solidify the Manchester City defence since his arrival in 2016, but it wasn't until last year's arrival of Ruben Dias that he solved the issue. Dias had a similar effect on the Mancunians that Virgil van Dijk had on Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in 2018 as his composure helped power his team to the title. At ease bringing the ball out, he's seldom caught out defensively, using his anticipation to nick possession either with a tackle or interception. His maiden season at City was crowned with Football Writers' Association and Premier League Player of the Season awards.

The 22-year-old goalkeeper, who made 251 appearances for Milan after making his debut in 2015, left the Italian giants on a free transfer this summer before signing a five-year deal at Paris Saint-Germain. It was a decision that was criticised by many Rossoneri supporters and thousands made their feelings known during last week's Nations League semi-final clash between Italy and Spain. Ahead of kick-off, Donnarumma - who was the hero for Italy in their European Championship final victory against England this summer - was pelted with abuse from fans inside the famous stadium. His first touch of the ball was then loudly jeered by sections of home support and that continued throughout the night. Reports emerged after the final whistle that the hostile atmosphere reduced the shot-stopper to tears but despite a far from welcoming reception, it's clear that he still loves his boyhood club. In an interview with Italian TV show Le Iene, Donnarumma was given a large temporary tattoo of Milan's logo on his arm. The reporter then asked: ""When you get to Paris, you go to a tattoo artist and make it permanent?"" before Donnarumma responded: ""We'll see, we'll see... Ok, alright then!"" In the same interview, Donnarumma said he ""will always love"" the Serie A club and ""will always have a Rossonero heart"" following his move to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. ""The whistles directed towards me at the San Siro? It's normal to be upset,"" he added. ""I grew up here and have always been a Milan fan. Eight years are not easily forgotten."" In terms of the booing on Wednesday night, former AC Milan manager Fabio Capello said the Italian goalkeeper was ""ungrateful"" towards his former side. ""I hope he is satisfied because he is a player of the national team who has made a fundamental contribution to the European title,"" Capello told il Corriere dello Sport. ""But let me say one thing: Donnarumma was ungrateful towards Milan, going to PSG. ""For everything the club had done for him and his family when he was a kid, he should have behaved differently.""

The 22-year-old goalkeeper, who joined Milan at the age of 14, has already made over 200 appearances for the Italian side after making his Serie A debut aged 16 years and 242 days. He is already considered one of the best in the world in his position, but some fans are far from happy with his current situation at Rossoneri. Donnarumma has been heavily linked with a move to Juventus in recent months, with his contract is set to expire at the end of the season. In addition to rumours over his future, Milan will face The Old Lady in a crucial Serie A clash on Sunday night. Milan and Juventus are currently level on points in the league in fourth and fifth position and this game in particular could be a huge factor in who finishes in the all-important top four. With just four games remaining in Serie A for both clubs, some fans fear the match is a conflict of interest for Donnarumma. In fact, a group of so called 'ultras' turned up outside the Milanello Sports Centre and told the 22-year-old to not feature in the upcoming clash unless he planned to sign a new deal, according to ESPN. It is also believed that the ultras were unhappy with Donnarumma's actions following the club's 3-0 defeat to Lazio at the end of last month - and mentioned that situation as well as the links with Juventus. The boyhood Rossoneri fan walked to the centre of the pitch at full-time and had a deep chat with close friend Pepe Reina, before swapping shirts with the former Liverpool man. This sparked an angry backlash from supporters, who were fuming with his lack of sportsmanship following a heavy loss. AC Milan technical director and club legend Paulo Maldini was forced to make a statement following the incident involving Donnarumma. ""It is important to firmly reiterate that no one outside of Milan can decide who plays and who renews,"" Maldini told ANSA. ""Certain choices are up to the coach for the pitch and the club for contractual matters. ""Every single negotiation for renewals is now frozen until the end of the season, to allow the team to focus solely on the league. In the meantime, we will continue to protect our players as we always have. ""The Milan fans, up to now exemplary in supporting the team, must understand that at this moment, the players need serenity and concentration to face the next matches that will be decisive."" AC Milan will face Juventus on Sunday night at 7:45pm - a clash that could decide who plays Champions League football next season. ",positive,liverpool,1

The Italian stopper is out of contract in June and looks set to move on from the Serie A giants. Loadingâ¦ Donnarumma, still just 22, is considered as one of the best goalkeepers in the world with a host of clubs keeping tabs on his contract situation. Chelsea are reportedly interested in snapping him up not to mention Milan's arch rivals Juventus, who could swoop in and complete yet another massive free signing. The thought of Donnarumma plying his trade at Juve has angered the Milan fanbase on social media. They have even said that he'd be the 'most hated player in Serie A history' if he does indeed secure a switch to the Turin-based outfit. Donnarumma's exit from San Siro is edging closer with Milan looking to draft in Lille's Mike Maignan. It will bring an end to his eight-year stint, having made his debut in 2015 - aged just 16. He has since compiled 251 appearances in all competitions, becoming the club's No.1 and vice-captain. A transfer to Juve would spell the end of his Milan career and would make him another big free signing for the Old Lady.

The 36-year-old has been in good form for Juventus this season, scoring 28 goals in 32 Serie A appearances for Andrea Pirlo's side, but his future is in doubt with only one season remaining on his contract at the Old Lady. Juve are at risk of missing out on a Champions League qualification spot for next season as they currently sit fifth in Serie A with just two games to play. And with the Italian outfit on the verge of missing out on European football, Ronaldo's mother Dolores - a lifelong Sporting Lisbon fan - added fuel to the fire by claiming she will persuade her son to join Portuguese giants. In a video filmed by a fan at a street celebration, Ronaldo's mother Dolores said: ""I'm going to go to Turin and speak to him. ""Next year he will play in Alvalade, I'll convince him and he will return."" Despite being 35-years-of-age, the Portuguese superstar's valuation will still be pushing the nine-figure mark. His contract doesn't expire until 2022, meaning Juventus will likely demand to recuperate the â¬100m they shelled out for him just two years ago. Ronaldo came through the academy system at Sporting Lisbon and made 31 senior appearances for the Portuguese side before making his move to Manchester United in 2003. The stalwart attacker joined Juve in 2018 and has scored 100 goals and registered 22 assists for the club. ",negative,liverpool,0

That made an action-packed game 2-2 on the night; 4-3 to Porto on aggregate. Juventus pulled one back through Adrien Rabiot, but the last-16 tie finished 4-4 overall and Porto went through on away goals. Ronaldo and Szczesny will inevitably face criticism for their role in the crucial free-kick which changed the game. Juventus and Ronaldo - the record Champions League goalscorer - exited the competition. The Serie A champions have never got past the quarter-final stage since the Portuguese ace joined the club in 2018. Porto actually got off to a perfect start with Oliveira's first-half penalty putting the visitors 1-0 up on the night and 3-1 up on aggregate. However Juventus got their act together in the second half as the man who scored their goal in the first leg - Federico Chiesa - curled in a superb shot to equalise on the night. A second booking for Porto's Mehdi Taremi followed a few minutes later - for kicking the ball away of all things - and his side were down to 10 men as the striker trudged off. Then that man Chiesa struck again, this time meeting Juan Cuadrado's cross with a powerful header to level the tie overall at 3-3. Former Chelsea winger Cuadrado was the inspiration for Juve's second-half fightback - and he almost won the game for the Italian side when his injury-time shot struck the underside of the bar but came back out. That sent the game into extra time, where Moussa Marega had a chance to put Porto ahead with a close-range header but the forward powered it straight at Szczesny. But Szczesny was at least partially to blame for the goal which put Porto through, as he failed to keep out the long-range free-kick - which went right through Ronaldo in the wall and into the back of the net.

Loadingâ¦ Sure, these days Ronaldo is just as likely to be seen destroying the property of a fan than he is to win a Ballon d'Or but it would take an extremely short memory not to acknowledge his greatness. He is after all the top goalscorer in the history of men's professional football, and he has been named the best player in the world of five occasions. There's little doubting his brilliance on the pitch, even if not everyone is his biggest fan, but one fan has claimed that fellow Portuguese forward Quaresma was beet than the Manchester United star. He's used a compilation of Quaresma's best bits to prove that the former Porto man had 'superior football ability' to the former Juventus striker. Don't get me wrong, Ronaldo had a better career, but Quaresma football ability is quite superior to Ronaldo pic.twitter.com/IY8vcGceWP The two Portugal players were at Sporting together from 1997, when Ronaldo joined the club, until 2002, when he left for his first spell at Manchester United. Quaresma won the league with the club, but Ronaldo broke into the first team too late to do so, but from there it was the younger man who outshone his compatriot. Even though the former Barcelona winger was part of the Champions League and Treble winning Inter Milan side under Jose Mourinho, Ronaldo's success is second to almost none. The man from Madeira has won Europe's top prize on five occasions, once with United and four with Real Madrid, scoring in three of the finals and converting a penalty in shootout in one of the others. Maybe at one point Quaresma was better than his younger teammate, perhaps he was more 'naturally talented' but there's no doubt who made the most of their talent. Not just because of their silky smooth skills, ability to cross a ball or even finishing, part of it is about mentality too and there's no doubting Ronaldo's had that in buckets. These days, 38-year-old Quaresma plays for Vitoria de Guimaraes in Portugal and provided us with some laughs a couple of months ago. Annoyed by an opponent time wasting, the experienced winger picked up the felled played and removed him from the pitch and onto the sidelines, Ronaldo would have been proud. ",positive,liverpool,0

During the Coppa Italia final, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner came close to registering a superb backheel assist in the second half. Ronaldo charged into the Atalanta box and caught Cristian Romero out by complete surprise with a fantastic first-time backheel.

They deserved something different. âThere are no more legends such as [Alessandro] Del Piero, [Francesco] Totti, [Paolo] Maldini or [Javier] Zanetti, but it wasnât nice to hear from Ronaldo that he was going back to a place he feels like home. âHe put Juventus in a difficult situation, leaving a few days before the end of the transfer window, it is impossible to replace a goal machine like him.â Ronaldo, who left Real Madrid in 2018 to sign for Juventus, lifted back-to-back Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia and two Italian Super Cups during his time with the Old Lady.

Loadingâ¦ The winger is out of contract at the end of this season and he'll likely be moving on after nine years with Los Blancos. He's won 14 trophies since sealing an Â£86 million move from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, which was a world record fee at the time. Despite that, he's never fully connected with Real fans and journalist Manuel Julia Dorado has taken it a step further. Bale has been called a 'parasite' who has been 'sucking' money from the club for almost a decade. The Wales international played a vital role in Real's four Champions League triumphs in the 2010s, scoring a vital goal in 2014 and a brace in 2018. He's also won La Liga twice in that time period and the Club World Cup three times. Dorado's passage reads per Daily Mail: ""The Bale parasite came from the cold and rainy Britannia. ""He settled in Spain, at Real Madrid, where, masked, he first showed diligence and love for the guest, but then his nature led him to suck blood without giving anything in return. ""Well, more than blood, he sucked, and sucks, the club's euros. ""Unlike others of its kind, such as the flea, the louse or the bedbug, the Bale parasite does not cause itching or illnesses in its host, but after sucking, it laughs and makes fun of it, showing a jocular contempt for the one from whom he lives. ""He laughs, applauds, throws himself on the ground, sings, as a kind of humiliating ceremony, which, luckily, has an expiration date, like all misfortunes."" You can't get much more savage than that, can you? Bale spent last season on loan at Tottenham and his favoured number 11 shirt was given to Marco Asensio. Since returning, he's worn the number 18. The 32-year-old didn't feature in Sunday's 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in El Clasico but Marca believe he still deserves criticism. It's claimed Bale is more focused on the Wales national team and recently presented Real with a whopping Â£25,000 invoice for medical treatment back in England. Bale is desperate to play in a World Cup before retirement and this year could be his last chance. He's played just 69 minutes of football for Real this campaign with manager Carlo Ancelotti using Vinicius Jr, Asensio and Rodrygo ahead of him.

Just take a look at this. Bale, who has lifted four Champions League titles during his time in Madrid, also commented on his contract situation at Los Blancos after Fabrizio Romano said the former Spurs man will leave as a free agent in June. ""I haven't thought about that at all, since we knew we were going to be in this situation, my sole focus has been on this,"" he added.

However, when he does get on the pitch for Wales, he often manages to prove why he was once considered worth making the most expensive player in the world. On Thursday night he did just that again, as Wales faced Austria in the semi final of their World Cup qualifier play off in Cardiff. After Harry Wilson was fouled about 20 yards out, and the commentator said 'Harry Wilson will fancy his chances here,' Bale curled the ball perfectly into the corner of the goal, leaving Austria goalkeeper Heinz Lindner no chance. Has a goal ever been more top bins than this? Welcoming all submissions. pic.twitter.com/48kU23wJrZ Bale has helped Real win 14 trophies since he moved from Tottenham Hotspur to the Bernabeu in 2013, and has been integral in many of them. He's scored goals in Champions League final and Copa del Rey final victories, against Liverpool and Barcelona respectively, but still the fans haven't taken to him in recent years. The Welshman has only been involved in five games for his club all season, and missed the loss to Barcelona last weekend with an injury, as they were tonked 4-0 at home. That resulted in one journalist calling the 32-year-old forward a 'parasite,' in a scathing attack on his time with Los Blancos. With his contract expiring at the end of the season, Bale is unlikely to care too much, and even less so if he manages to steer Wales to a first World Cup since 1958. If Wales do go on to beat Austria then they will face either Scotland or Ukraine in the final of their 'pathway,' although that semi final has been delayed due to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

A report, via Spanish outlet AS, states that Bale has meticulously used his time on loan at Tottenham to prepare for the international tournament with Wales, being careful with his training drills and recovery at the club. His plan is to return to Real Madrid in the summer to ""fulfil the year that remains of his contract at the Santiago Bernabeu, then retire from football, as this newspaper has learned"" (source: AS). Bale will turn 33 in July 2022, so it seems an incredibly early age for such an elite player to call it a day if that is being considered. While the Spanish newspaper is critical of Bale's time at Tottenham and his total number of starts, Bale has shown spells of real quality, netting 14 goals in 31 appearances this season. Bale did not start in Wednesday's defeat to Aston Villa (coming on as a second-half substitute) and Ryan Mason explained that this followed conversations that Spurs' interim coach had had with the player. ""Gareth played the best part of 90 minutes at the weekend [a 2-0 win over Wolves], the most he's played all season in the Premier League,"" Mason told Sky Sports before the game. ""Gareth is an experienced man and he knows his body. We spoke and he felt it was best for him and his body not to start today. That's all there is."" Being fit for this summer's Euros clearly means a lot to Bale who has never hidden his passion for playing for Wales. His relationship with Real Madrid also appears to have soured (despite his contributions to four Champions League wins during his time there), as the club have looked to move on their highest-earning player but with little success. A move to the Chinese Super League in 2019 fell through and the winger was a bit-part player during the 2019/20 season, before he joined former club Tottenham on loan for this season. The challenge for Real Madrid is finding a club that will match Bale's salary (a reported â¬692,660 per week) if they don't wish to use him for the final year of his contract. Bale has had a successful and rewarding playing career. There are also ongoing jokes that he prefers playing for Wales - or playing golf - than involving himself in club football. He's also suffered several muscle injuries that have disrupted his career. Nonetheless, the idea of a player of Bale's quality retiring in his early 30s seems remarkable. And, if Wales qualify for the next World Cup - scheduled for the winter of 2022 - it seems unlikely Bale world turn his back on that. Will the 2021/22 season really be Bale's last in club football?

Casillas, despite having been on the opposing team in some of Messi's biggest matches, was no different, praising the 33-year-old's remarkable talent. He said on Twitter: ""I didn't think they would arrive, but here are my personalised bottles of Budweiser! Congratulations Leo Messi on your 644th goal record.

Did we mention it was his 500th Barcelona goal as well? Usually that - and the fact that Messi's goal settled this 3-2 thriller and put Barca top of La Liga - would be the big talking points. But when, three years ago, Messi whipped off his No 10 shirt and held it aloft to the away support (who we're fairly sure already knew his name and number), we had an image that obliterated everything else. Marcelo fell to the turf, Cristiano Ronaldo raged, Madrid fans held their heads in hands. For once, Messi stood still as a statue. What came before it was terrific too. At 2-2 in stoppage time, Real were pressing for a winner. Instead their rivals won back possession, hit a pinpoint counter and - when Jordi Alba cut the ball back to Messi just inside the box - everyone probably what was coming. Cue the corner of Keylor Navas's net rippling and Messi was tearing off his blue-and-red shirt. The reaction was almost certainly unplanned but what made it special is how he doubled down on it. Rather than sneaking his shirt back on as he was mobbed by teammates, Messi waited until they cleared off - then stood there with it aloft for a second time, as the referee reached for a yellow card that Leo clearly didn't care about receiving. Already a hundred memes were being born and FIFA developers were hurriedly preparing to design it. While it was a knife to the guts for Real Madrid, they at least got the last laugh in the long run. Barcelona's win put them top of La Liga but Real won their game in hand, then kept on winning to earn the 2016/17 title on the season's final day. Ronaldo later had to have his say too, of course. The next time he visited Camp Nou and scored in the 2017 Supercopa de Espana final first leg - he mimicked his great frenemy's celebration by showing his No 7 shirt to the crowd. After scoring a worldie, Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't resist trolling Lionel Messi with his celebration... :joy::joy:https://t.co/hN435selMy pic.twitter.com/8K9ZvGeS4n Any excuse to get the abs out, eh?

But that's exactly what happened in January 2005 when Los Blancos hosted Real Sociedad in a La Liga fixture. The story goes that the two sides were playing out a 1-1 draw and approaching the 87th minute when the stadium had to be evacuated due to a bomb scare. Loadingâ¦ All players and supporters had to vacate the premises after someone claiming to be part of Basque group ETA said that an explosion would occur at 9pm inside the Santiago Bernabeu. It proved to be nothing more than hoax but for security reasons the game was abandoned. Then weeks later, the final minutes of the fixture were played. Incredibly, they technically had two managers during the same game as Vanderlei Luxemburgo replaced Mariano Garcia Remon in the hot-seat. Both sets of players and fans were back at the ground to start the game from the 87th minute. And despite it being an extremely short encounter, there was a goal to celebrate.

Bale's Real Madrid contract is up in the summer and it's been widely reported he'll retire should Wales be knocked out of the play-offs. Sky Sports have claimed the 32-year-old is desperate to play at the tournament and would sign for Cardiff City or Swansea City in the summer. Kavel Solhekol explained: ""I think if Wales qualify for the World Cup then he's going to be without a club in the summer because his contract is set to expire at Real Madrid.

Wales haven't played at a World Cup since 1958 and the chance to do so for Bale, who is passionate about his country, is too good to turn down. Bale started his career with Southampton in the Championship before moving to Tottenham Hotspur in 2007. He started out as a left-back before transforming into one of the world's best wingers. Madrid came calling in 2013 and paid a then-world record Â£86 million fee to bring him to the Santiago Bernabeu. Despite winning four Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles, Bale has never been accepted by the 'Los Blancos' fanbase. He formed a sensational front three with Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo but clashed with supporters over his perceived lack of passion when it came to the club.

Alexander-Arnold's place in the England team - and indeed squad - for this summer's Euros has divided football fans between those he say he's one of Europe's elite full-backs and doubters who claim he simply cannot defend. ""Trent on the attack: Messi. Trent in defence: Phil Jones,"" is just one comment under the YouTube video which compiles the 22-year-old's positional errors, poor one-on-one defending and outright mistakes leading to goals. Now, we might add that you could probably make a two-and-half-minute disaster video of any player - even Messi himself - if you just select the very worst clips. But there is definitely an opinion, even among Alexander-Arnold's admirers, that he's a far better offensive full-back than he is when opponents are taking him on. ""This is what makes I'm the most overrated player in world football,"" said one commenter. ""Trent's passing: legendary Trent's defending: dogs***e,"" claimed another. ""Benzema: pass it to TAA, on my mother's life he is playing for us,"" mimics another fan, in response to Alexander-Arnold's struggles against Real Madrid in this season's Champions League. Alexander-Arnold had a dip in form this season while Liverpool struggled, but has played a huge part in his club's Champions League and Premier League wins over the last three years. The full-back - who picked up a thigh injury in England's friendly against Austria which may yet rule him out of the summer's European Championship - has been an assist machine for Liverpool, registering 32 in the Premier League alone over the last three years. Gareth Southgate came under serious criticism for leaving Trent out of his England squad for the World Cup qualifiers in March. However there is a school of thought that while Alexander-Arnold works perfectly in Liverpool's high-pressing set-up where he's generally on the front foot, he isn't the best in a more defensively-minded system where full-backs are part of a low block. So perhaps there is some wisdom in Southgate's seeming to prefer one of Kieran Tripper, Kyle Walker or Reece James for the right-back role.

The thought of not picking the Liverpool starlet has perplexed some fans online considering his incredible match-winning attributes. And fans have continued to weigh in on Alexander-Arnold's England spot after a video of his individual highlights emerged on Twitter. The clip shows the 22-year-old's sensational range of passing and his ever-improving defensive skills. The brilliantly packaged video includes his pinpoint corner kick to Alisson and his crucial winner against Aston Villa, among other special moments. Supporters also reckon he has been robbed of a bunch of assists with Liverpool's forwards (other than Mohamed Salah) enduring a underwhelming campaign this season. Trent Alexander Arnold - 2020/21 pic.twitter.com/c5etZEXyHh One Twitter user reacted to the video by saying: ""Best we've ever seen him, season as a whole not been as strong but that's expected when the team drops off so much, massively disrespected."" A second tweeted: ""This man's passing range is genuinely insane for a RB. No other fullback in the world can replicate that."" A third added: ""This really just shows how many missed shots our forwards have had, Trent should have like 15 assist."" Another commented: ""Can't believe he's getting debated about on Twitter. If you think those other generic English RB's are on the same planet as Trent then you are beyond help."" Unpopular opinion: this has been Trent's best season. Without hendo and Van Dijk covering for him defensively, he's become more of a mature footballer on his own, defensively.

Trent has been in stunning form for Liverpool this season andscored an absolute thunderbolt of a strikeagainst Newcastle last week. Loadingâ¦ The 23-year-old right-back continued to demonstrate his importance to Jurgen Kloppâs squad after setting up Andy Robertson in Liverpoolâs 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday. Trent has scored two times and managed eight assists in 16 Premier League appearances this season, along with three assists in three Champions League matches. Neville has now insisted that he has ânever seenâ a full-back like the England international. Read More: Speaking on hisSky Sportspodcast, the Manchester United legend said: âI donât think Iâve seen two full-backs play in the Premier League that are as good as these two as a pair. âThe way in which they combine on the pitch, the way they play the game, theyâre an absolute joy. âRobertson with his consistency does everything well. Defends well, heâs competitive -- slightly too much at the end -- but he scored a goal and set up a goal. âAlexander-Arnold is an absolute phenomenon when it comes to the quality of his passing, his delivery. Itâs something Iâve never seen before from a full-back. âItâs like De Bruyne, itâs [David] Beckham, itâs Gerrard, and theyâre attacking players. Heâs playing at right-back, itâs the highest accolade I could pay him. âThe contribution these two make is unbelievable. Itâs bizarre to me. I grew up saying let the full-back have it.

In 2019, Alexander-Arnold's quick-thinking and expert delivery caught Barcelona sleeping in the Champions League semi-final second leg. Divock Origi reacted quicker than anyone else and put away his second of the night and Liverpool's fourth to send Jurgen Klopp's side to the Champions League final in another memorable European night at Anfield. Loadingâ¦ ""Corner taken quickly..."" will be talked about forever and two years on from the stellar moment, SPORTbible wanted to see if Alexander-Arnold could replicate his exploits. This time, however, his target in the box was a 26-year-old bloke called Jeremy who had been released by Arsenal at the age of 14. Alexander-Arnold sent in a slew of outrageous crosses that required a first-time finish into the far top corner just like Origi's. But Jeremy clearly showed he is not a professional footballer. He did provide some nice finishes but could only find the near post and ultimately, after 30 unsuccessful attempts, it was time to give up. Alexander-Arnold's incredible vision was on display again - with the 22-year-old having worked with Red Bull and world-renowned ophthalmologist Dr Daniel Laby to enhance that trait. Earlier this year, Dr Laby put Trent through a series of tests - assessing areas such as depth perception, basic visual function, hand-eye co-ordination, reaction time and target tracking. Following initial testing, the Liverpool academy product then underwent a bespoke six-week training programme devised by Dr Laby which included AVTS Vision Tests, work with a neurotrainer and even juggling. These results were captured on camera and will be shown in a full-lengthy documentary which will be released on 4 June. The improvements in his eyesight have been nothing short of incredible: Reflecting, Alexander-Arnold said: ""I'm always looking for new ways to train and improve my game, so when Red Bull came to me with this opportunity I said yes immediately. Marginal gains are huge in any sport, especially football, and when you're competing against the world's best players, even a one percent improvement can make a huge difference. ""In football, it's so important to be two steps ahead of your competition, and the training that I've been doing has made me value that even more. ""Working with Red Bull on this experiment has shown me that vision is such an important part of the game, and that your eyes can be trained and improved on as much as anything else. ""I'm really grateful to have had this opportunity to learn from the best in Dr Laby, and I've promised him I'm definitely going to keep up the training!""

Loadingâ¦ Van Dijk's success since his January 2018 move to Liverpool is pretty unmatched, considering he completely transformed the Reds defence. Jurgen Klopp's side were Champions League finalists within six months of the Dutchman joining, won it a year later and broke their 30 year run without winning the league title a year after that. To some the 30-year-old is the best centre back to have graced the Premier League, although not according to every vote on the subject. And Van Dijk missed out on top spot in a vote once again, with fans naming Bruno Fernandes as the greatest January signing in the history of the league. According to a BBC poll last year, Fernandes is favoured by 31% of people as the greatest winter window move, with Van Dijk in second place with 26% of the vote. Fernandes' instant impact at United, in January 2020, was as undeniable as the one Van Dijk had at Anfield, but the Portugal midfielder hasn't been in the trophies as quickly. The former Sporting midfielder has scored 45 goals and assisted 34 goals in 104 games in all competitions, since his move to Old Trafford. His form when he first moved to the club saw him become the first player to win four Player of the Month awards in one calendar year. Whilst United haven't won anything since his arrival he did at least help drag them to a top four spot in his first few months, helping them qualify for the Champions League. After Fernandes and Van Dijk, Nemanja Vidic was next in the voting with 15% and Luis Suarez's move from Ajax to Liverpool has 13%, suggesting that United and Liverpool can be very good at January signings. However, United fans would also point to Alexis Sanzhez's arrival at the beginning of 2018 and Liverpool fans could do the same with Andy Carroll's move in 2011 as proof to the opposite ",positive,liverpool,4

Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski, who was widely regarded as the world player of the year for 2020, is down in third spot. Cristiano Ronaldo just sneaks into the top 10, as he bagged 36 goals last season but couldn't stop Juventus struggling domestically and in Europe. However it's the choice of De Bruyne as No 1 that will provoke debate with FFT calling the Belgian the ""inexplicable spark that elevates"" Pep Guardiola's City side, while also pointing to his three, crucial Champions League knockout stage goals last season. Messi is still labelled ""the most gorgeous footballer on earth to watch"", as Lewandowski is praised for breaking Gerd Muller's 49-year record by bagging 41 Bundesliga goals last season. Paris Saint-German pair Kylian Mbappe (fifth) and Neymar (fourth), complete the top five.

United have reportedly reached a verbal agreement in principle with Ten Hag for him to become the next permanent manager at Old Trafford. Ten Hag is set to sign a four-year deal with United once the Premier League club has negotiated a compensation package with his current club Ajax. The Dutch manager is expected to take over at United at the end of the season, bringing to an end the clubâs long search for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâs permanent replacement. Former midfielder Sjoerd Overgoor was managed by Ten Hag during his time in charge of Eredisvie side Go Ahead Eagles and he has now opened up on the Dutch coachâs exceptionally high standards. âHe wanted the drinks put out in straight lines,â Overgoor told Sky Sports. âEverything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that.â Overgoor added: âWe had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch. âEvery day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. âThat was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. âRemember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. âA lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better.â Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes the majority of the clubâs fans are excited by the expected appointment of Ten Hag, who has seemingly beat off competition from Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino for the role. âIt's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree,â Neville told Sky Sports. âHe's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 240,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over Pochettino. âI knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. âThey want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways.â Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Pochettino has long been linked with a move to United, both during and after his stint as Tottenham Hotspur manager, and continued to be linked with the role even whilst Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge. Once Solskjaer was sacked in November the PSG boss was quickly installed as the favourite to become the club's next permanent boss, however that changed over the months. Recently Ten Hag had increasingly become the most likely man and on Wednesday it was claimed that the Dutchman, who took Ajax to within a minute of the Champions League final in 2019, is set to become the manager. According to The i, Poch will miss out for two reasons, with United being concerned about his time in France and the price it could have cost them. The Argentine manager will almost certainly capture the Ligue 1 title this season, with his team 12 points clear of second place Marseille, with just eight games to play. However, having taken over from Thomas Tuchel at the Parc des Princes in January 2021, he was unable to capture the league title last season, finishing a point behind Lille and being in charge of four of the team's eight losses in the season. Along with that, the Parisians have continued to struggle in Europe, something they've done under most their managers, even if Tuchel did get them to the final. Last season they lost in the semi finals to Manchester City but this season's defeat was harder to take, as Karim Benzema's hat-trick in 17 minutes in the second half of the second leg dumped them out in the last 16. His 'underwhelming' time in the French capital is likely to lead him to get sacked, with Zinedine Zidane strongly linked with taking over, but as that is yet to happen United would have had to pay compensation to release him. That could have been up to Â£25 million, with PSG no doubt wanting to play hardball over the manager if they knew he was wanted elsewhere, even if they no longer wanted him. With United clearly hoping to make an appointment before the end of the season, in order to begin preparation for next season, it clearly went against Pochettino. The Premier League side are yet to agree compensation with Ajax for Ten Hag, but it is likely to cost them less and be quicker to do than the alternative. Ten Hag is said to have already begun identifying what he needs to do to turn things around at Old Trafford, and has reportedly already decided on his first transfer target. The former Bayern Munich II manager is also said to want to bring in someone who knows the Premier League and the club in as his assistant manager. Steve McClaren, who was number two to Sir Alex Ferguson during the 1998/99 Treble season, is said to be in the running for the position. ",positive,liverpool,0

Reports claim that the Ajax boss has already agreed to the move, with Mauricio Pochettino overtaken as the club's preferred choice to be the new permanent boss. Ten Hag is already preparing for next season, with the Dutchman having already identified his first transfer target, and it looks like he knows the names he'll be working with next season.

All six are out of contract at the end of the season and they won't be renewing their deals, which certainly won't come as a shock when it comes to some of the names. Pogba, Lingard and Cavani were all already expected to leave in the summer, although the Frenchman's future was still somewhat up in the air. Apparently Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Dean Henderson, Phil Jones, Axel Tuanzebe and Eric Bailly are all unhappy at Old Trafford but won't be able to leave. Martial, Van de Beek and Tuanzebe are all currently out on loan but will be back in Ten Hag's squad for the beginning of next season. Van de Beek has played under the Ajax manager for the Eredivisie giants and may soon change his mind about wanting to leave if he is reunited with his fellow Dutchman. He is also unlikely to want to join Everton permanently, especially if Frank Lampard does take the Toffees down for the first time since 1951. Henderson is likely to be most annoyed at being unable to leave, having sat on the bench as second choice to David de Gea yet again this season. The 25-year-old reportedly wanted to leave last January in order to get first team football and allow him to compete for a place in England's World Cup squad later this year. Things could change for the unhappy players, depending on what Ten Hag wants to do as far as incomings go, and how many he is able to get in. Should the club sign some of their targets, and they'll be looking at a central midfielder, striker and defender at least, then some of those unhappy players may still be allowed to leave. There could be quite the revolving door at Old Trafford this summer. ",positive,liverpool,0

The 52-year-old Ajax manager impressed United officials when he was interviewed for the role last week, according toThe Times. They claim the club believe he would 'fit well into their structure' if he was appointed. Ten Hag believes the United job is a five-year project, say The Independent, who suggest the first element he would correct at the Premier League club is physical conditioning. Manchester United are set to finalise the appointment of Erik ten Hag as the club's next manager, sources have told @MarkOgden_ and @RobDawsonESPN. pic.twitter.com/tKv7qXL53g It appears Ten Hag has some ambitious plans, but who will he bring in should he get the United job? Last week, The Telegraph said Ten Hag would attempt to bring highly-rated Ajax winger Antony to Old Trafford after an impressive season with the Eredivisie side, where he has scored 12 goals in all competitions. Now, reports have emerged that the Dutch manager will 'push' to bring Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves to the club. Ten Hag has followed Neves' progress for a number of years. In fact, he watched his progress at FC Porto, where he became the youngest captainin Champions League history after being handed the armband in their clash against MaccabiTel-Aviv. He believes the Portuguese international would help solve United's current issues in midfield, say The Sun, who suggest Ten Hag is 'pushing' for the move. United have been linked with a move for Neves in the past. During last summer's transfer window, Bruno Fernandes was said to be ""very keen"" for Neves to join the ranks at Old Trafford and United were aware of that, according to journalist Dean Jones, who was speaking toThe Football Terrace. Fernandes and Neves have played together with Portugal's national side on numerous occaisons, and were both in the squad for last summer's European Championship. Back in December, Neves opened up about his ambitions to play in the Champions League again â a competition that United could miss out on after struggling in recent weeks. In an interview with Portuguese publication Record, the 25-year-old admitted he misses it ""a lot"". ""I think any player that plays Champions League football and then spends a few years without competing in it will miss it,"" he added. ""It's a nice tournament to be part of, of course I miss it. It's a tournament every player wants to play in. ""Being able to play in the Champions League and being able to compete against all the clubs is probably the main goal of every player, and for me it's no different. ""Fortunately I was able to compete in the Champions League for three years with FC Porto and we did a brilliant and remarkable campaign but I do miss stepping out on the pitch and hearing the tournament's anthem.""

On a Saturday in January 2013, Filomena lost her life in a car accident. It left Cancelo, his younger brother Pedro and father Joseph, utterly devastated. Filomena had dropped Joseph off at the airport and on the way back along the A2 motorway in Seixal, near Lisbon, the Audi 3 vehicle she was driving was involved in a collision. Joao Cancelo:""Only I know what my brother and I went through, because when my mother passed away it wasnât a disease, it was nothing, it was a car accident. My brother and I were inside and I watched it all."" pic.twitter.com/Z9Mwd9RWAA Both sons were asleep in the car and suffered minor injuries. But Filomena died and Cancelo wrote a heartbreaking post on Facebook, explaining he had lost the ""light of my life"" and was ""dead inside"". At the time, Cancelo was just 18 years of age and playing for Benfica's B-team. Understandably, the loss took its toll on Cancelo and he thought about giving up. But he knew that she would have wanted him to continue playing as she was ""a big part"" of his love for the beautiful game. ""When I lost my mother, I felt like I was at the bottom of a well,"" Cancelo said in an emotional interview with Caroline De Moraesin Champions Journal, as relayed by Manchester City's official website. ""I felt like a robot that had to do its job, then go home, then another day â day in, day out. When I lost my mother, I didnât enjoy my football; I was playing because I had to. I really thought of giving up because it didnât make sense anymore. ""But the Benfica staff were constantly calling, asking me to come back because they believed in my potential. âMy father let things calm down, then he spoke to me. He said that both he and my brother needed me, they needed me to have the strength to continue because my father had to stay; he couldnât go back to Switzerland anymore. âI had already signed a professional contract with Benfica by then and much of my money was used to support my family, so I decided to play again. At first it wasnât easy. I had no strength, no desire, but that conversation with my father and the love I have for this sport made me overcome everything. âMy love for the game started to gradually come back; my smile slowly returned. Thatâs what life is about. However big our losses, we have to carry on. I read a lot of stuff about warriors and certain things really resonate with me. âI would really like to be able to talk to my mother because thereâs always something missing. Even when I achieve something important, thereâs always this feeling there. Itâs as if I always have an emptiness in my heart because she is not physically there. âIn Portugal, I always go to the cemetery to see her. Itâs like an obligation I have. Thatâs where I feel good, next to her. Even though she is not physically there, I feel good. It cleanses my soul, my bad energies, and helps me live happier. âA big part of my love for football is due to my mother. I had great moments with her. Often when I play at the stadium, here in Manchester or even with the national team, Iâve felt like I had her watching. I would always look over to the stands before a game started, but now sheâs not there."" It didn't quite happen for Cancelo at Benfica but he found success with Valencia, Inter Milan and Juventus before ending up at Manchester City, where he's been an utter revelation. Cancelo has gone on to become one of the best full-backs in world football and completely redefined the role under Pep Guardiola's tutelage. His mum would be incredibly proud of what he's achieved. The 27-year-old also has a family of his own - his girlfriendDaniela giving birth to their daughter Alicia in December 2019. The family were caught up in a frightening ordeal in December as thieves broke into their home and stole jewellery. Cancelo was left with a cut above his eye as he tried to protect his family. JoÃ£o Cancelo on Instagram. pic.twitter.com/VtrkUcTiDr Cancelo never forgets his mother and can always be seen pointing to the sky in celebration whenever he scores. ""In Portugal, I always go to the cemetery to see her... thatâs where I feel good, next to her. It cleanses my soul.""Joao Cancelo gave a beautiful interview about his love for his late mother ð And he's found a new type of love and devotion through his daughter, who is now three. He continued: âI thought that nothing would ever surpass the love I had for my mother â then my daughter was born, which is an inexplicable love. The best thing after a hard and tiring day at work is to come home and get a hug and a kiss from your daughter. âSome things are just priceless. No matter how much money we make and no matter how good our quality of life is, the best thing in life is the little moments that our children bring us. ""I just want to see her healthy. Iâm working hard today so that she can have a future and live peacefully. I do not want her to go through the hard times that my parents and I did.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Now he has been joined by Smolov, who has spent all but two seasons of his career in his home country, has become the first Russian to speak out. Taking to social media, the 32-year-old simply posted a black square with the caption 'No War,' and included a Ukraine flag and a broken heart to his post.

The Toffees hosted Manchester City in the the 17:30 kick-off and played the Z Cars theme as the players came out of the tunnel as has been the case for the number of years. Loadingâ¦ In 2019, the Merseyside outfit changed things up and had air raid sirens preceding the normal tune. Those sirens were used by former world champion boxer and staunch Everton fan Tony Bellew for his ring walk music and were adopted by the club. The first play of the remix track took place ahead of the Merseyside derby against Liverpool. However, the club felt as though it would not be in good taste for the sirens to play over the tannoy system due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the fact that emergency sounds were heard this week. Everton's January signing Vitaliy Mykolenko is from Ukraine, as is Manchester City left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko - and the two shared a powerful embrace before the game. Everton played the Hollies hit 'He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother' as the players line up on the pitch. The cameras panned to the bench where a tearful Zinchenko was clearly moved by the scenes.

Oleksandr Zinchenko was part of a vigil held in Manchester's city centre, protesting against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/IOV3sSe0Qv Zinchenko remained available for selection, with Pep Guardiola hailing him as ""an incredible, strong guy"".

How would you feel? Itâs what he feels [to protest]. Unfortunately around the world there are many wars â this is a new one. Itâs more than a pity because innocent people are dying when these innocent people just want to live in peace. âHe is worried. What would we feel if in our country, where we were born and have family and friends, innocent people are being killed? How will you feel? I guess thatâs what he feels. Of course, the team and the club is close to him, unconditionally.â Meanwhile, Everton boss Frank Lampard also said the decision on Mykolenko's availability was down to the player himself.

Not long after City had finally broken the deadlock through Phil Foden in the 82nd minute, Rodri committed a calamitous error under no pressure when he miscontrolled a simple ball inside the area. Loadingâ¦ The ball appeared to bounce up against the Spaniard's arm and the incident was referred to VAR. Rodri himself looked incredibly sheepish when play was halted. But the check was over fairly quickly, with Stockley Park ultimately deciding against awarding a penalty and referee Paul Tierney not going to the VAR monitor. The decision caused a huge stir with the home fans at Goodison Park, but fans of Merseyside rivals Liverpool were perhaps also equally as the call could be crucial in the close title race that has developed following recent results.

He has played for Ukraine more times than anyone else, with 144 caps, which is 33 more times than Shevchenko, and captained the team for four years. However, the 42-year-old is set to lose his legendary status in his own country, after failing to step down as his job as Zenit's assistant manager. The UAF have decided that Tymoshchuk has violated its Code of Ethics and Fair Play regulations and has âdamaged the image of Ukrainian football,' and have stripped him of all of his titles won in Ukraine. ""Since the beginning of Russiaâs military aggression against Ukraine, Tymoschuk AA, the former captain of the Ukrainian national team, not only did not make any public statements in this regard, but also did not stop his cooperation with the club of the aggressor,"" a statement from the FA said.

Moments later, Everton's physio ran over to the 25-year-old but instead of treating the centre-back, he proceeded to pull out a pair of scissors and cut holes in Holgate's socks to loosen them up. Why did they cut holes in Holgatesâs socks? Can anyone explain? Anything too tight or constricting on a player's legs could potentially cause muscle cramping in the calf so to avoid a possible injury, players have, in the past, cut holes in their sock.

Russia launched a full-scale military attack on its neighbour on Thursday, with intense fighting now raging for a seventh day in cities across Ukraine. Only one high-profile Russia international, Dynamo Moscow striker Fedor Smolov, has spoken out in opposition to the invasion. Loadingâ¦ Earlier this week, Everton left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko launched a blistering attack on Russia captain Artem Dzyuba, labelling him a âsilent b****â while also slamming his âs***headâ teammates. Yarmolenko has now released a similar statement, in which he alludes to Dzyuba infamous sex tape which was leaked in 2020. He said: ""Iâm Andriy Yarmolenko, a Ukrainian national player, I was born in Saint Petersburg but grew up in Ukraine and regard myself as 100 per cent Ukrainian.

Loadingâ¦ United have confirmed that they will be reviewing their partnership with Russian airline Aeroflot, following Thursday's declaration of war on Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The club usually fly to their European games with Aeroflot under an agreement with the company, but changed their travel plan for Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid due to sanctions by the UK government on Russia. At the time the Premier League club said they would continue their relationship with the company but Thursday's actions seem to have changed that. However the club are now set to end their deal with the Russian airline, after a review, even though the deal isn't set to end until summer 2023. The club have been sponsored by Aeroflot since 2013, and extended the partnership in 2017, in a deal worth around Â£40 million altogether. United's new CEO Richard Arnold, who took over from Ed Woodward at the beginning of the year, has no intention of renewing with the company. The club are aware of the damage the deal could have to its image and commercial appeal if it continued to be associated with Russia, following the invasion on Ukraine. There could also be legal issues if the US puts sanctions on Russian countries, with the Glazers involvement in United meaning the club's owners could be in serious trouble. The club will now likely be looking for a new airline to enter into a sponsorship with, to become the club's official carriers, with the Mirror claiming Qatar Airways could be a possibility, which has its own issues. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been condemned by all corners, with Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko speaking out against Putin, saying he hoped the Russian politician 'died a painful death.' Football has been affected by the invasion, with the Champions League final set to be moved, with Russia currently planned to host UEFA's annual showpiece event. The European governing body will meet on Friday to discuss the issue, though it's not expected that a new host will be decided so soon. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Zenit St Petersburg striker says he against all war but remains a proud Russian despite the actions of his country's armed forces in neighbouring Ukraine. âUntil recently, I did not want to speak on the topic of events in Ukraine,â said Dzyuba. âI didnât want to, not because Iâm afraid, but because Iâm not an expert in politics, I never got into it and didnât intend to (unlike a large number of political scientists and virologists who have recently appeared on the internet). A post shared by Artem Dzyuba (@artem.dzyuba) âBut like everyone else, I have my own opinion. Since I am being drawn to this topic from all sides, I will express it. âI am against any war.

Why one can do everything, but all the dogs are hanged on us. Why is everyone always shouting about sports outside of politics, but at the first opportunity, when it comes to Russia, this principle is completely forgotten? âAgain, war is scary. In stressful situations, people show their essence, sometimes negative. How much anger, dirt and bile has now poured out on all Russian people, regardless of their position and profession. Those thousands of people who write insults and threats - get in line! âIt is doubly strange to hear all this from people to whom Russia has given very, very much in their lives. All this only creates more negativity. The war will end, but human relations will remain. And it will be impossible to rewind. Remember this. Loadingâ¦ âP.S.

This seasonâs final is currently scheduled to take place at the Gazprom Arena on May 28. European footballâs governing body is under pressure to stop Russia from hosting the event after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two rebel-held regions in eastern Ukraine. Reports on Tuesday claimed that Wembley was already being lined up as the new venue for the final. However, UEFA released on statement on Tuesday denying this was the case. âUEFA is constantly and closely monitoring the situation.At present, there are no plans to change the venue,â read a statement. However, The Guardian claim that the âsituation is fluidâ and that UEFA officials are 'considering contingency plans'. Wembley last hosted the Champions League final in 2013, when Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1. There are doubts over whether the home of English football could stage this year's final, with the Championship and League Two play-off finals currently penned in for that weekend. Julian Knight, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, has called on UEFA to stop Russia from staging the final. He told The Telegraph: ""Itâs something that must be considered given this naked act of aggression. ""To host such a landmark event as the Russian tanks roll sends out all the wrong messages."" UEFA have already taken steps this season to avoid potential conflict, with Russian and Ukrainian clubs kept apart from each other in draws for European football. Last year's Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City was also moved, with the venue switching from Istanbul to Porto. The change came coronavirus restrictions placed Turkey on the UKâs red list, which would have prevented supporters from travelling to the country. Loadingâ¦ ",negative,liverpool,0

New Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo has got off to a dream start for Spurs and has guided the club to three straight 1-0 victories. For many, there is a genuine belief that the north London outfit could challenge the usual suspects for the title this season. Things have been different for Palaceâs new manager Patrick Vieira, however, who has so far added two draws and one loss to his CV - could it be another difficult campaign battling relegation for the Eagles? ð ð¦ðð§ð¨ð¥ððð¬ð @CPFC ð Selhurst Parkð @PremierLeagueâ± 12.30PM pic.twitter.com/voxsjeyeWo Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Crystal Palace vs Tottenham Hotspur to get your teeth stuck into. Crystal Palace are 16/5 to win, with Tottenham Hotspur priced at 10/11 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 12/5. Prediction: 0-1 (11/2) Half-Time/Full-Time: Tottenham Hotspur/Tottenham Hotspur (2/1) Crystal Palace have failed to topple Tottenham Hotspur in each of the last 12 Premier League encounters and the hosts head into this all-London affair as the overwhelming outsiders. As a result of that statistic alone, weâre backing Spurs to lead from the first to last whistle and cement their place at the top of the table. Win to Nil: Tottenham Hotspur (9/4) Tottenham have been fantastic at the back since Espirito Santo took charge and they have yet to concede in the league, chalking up three straight clean sheets. After three straight 1-0 wins, there is a sense that players are still getting used to new methods and we reckon another low-scoring victory could be on the cards again. Anytime Goalscorer: Lucas Moura (9/4) There could be an opportunity for Lucas Moura to start this weekendâs game, especially with Espirito Santo sweating over the fitness of Heung-min Son and Steven Bergwijn. The Brazillian forward has started two of Tottenhamâs three league games this season and, although he has yet to find the back of the net, he has looked lively and he will be itching to get off the mark. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Crystal Palaceâs transfer business went right to the wire as they struck late deals for Odsonne Edouard and Will Hughes, both of whom should feature here. Christian Benteke, however, will aim to hold his place up top for now, while Wilfried Zaha will finally aim to break his goalscoring duck against Tottenham at the 13th attempt. Tottenham Hotspur trio Davinson Sanchez, Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso can all reportedly expect fines for linking up with their South American teams during the international break and will not feature due to quarantine rules. The visitors have also been handed a scare over Son, who withdrew from the South Korea squad with a tight calf, while Oliver Skipp, Ryan Sessegnon and Bergwijn are also fresh injury concerns.

The Seagulls, who have failed to score in six of their last seven games, could only record a 0-0 draw against bottom of the league Norwich on Saturday afternoon, despite having a total of 30 shots on goal. Potter's side could only manage to hit four of those 30 shots on target throughout the Premier League clash â a stat that was questioned after the full-time whistle. Norwich have conceded 63 goals in 30 matches this season. Brighton nil... In fact, Brighton became the first team to have 18 shots off target in a Premier League game since Chelsea in February 2011, according to OptaJoe. And in an interview with The Telegraph, he addressed the stats. âThe build-up suggests weâre getting there. Of course, the longer you go, you can hear the crowd, âshoot, shoot, shootâ, you know, and that sometimes is a challenge for the players. âBecause sometimes thereâs an opportunity to shoot - sometimes itâs a chance for the block and then the transition. And sometimes maybe one more pass gets you in a better position but, if you miss the pass, you should have shot. âItâs just one of those things that weâre going through. A bit of pain and a bit of suffering. âSo, then, that does affect confidence. It affects a little bit of the final bit. âItâs the Premier League and Premier League defenders - it isnât so straightforward to create chances and score.

The cramped conditions meant players were forced to share the same room as management and staff.

The protests have forced Chelsea into spending thousands of pounds to expand the away dressing room to comply with the regulations. Chelsea have increased the size of the away dressing room by knocking through into the media area at Stamford Bridge.

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich announced he was putting the club up for sale following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 19 years after buying the club from Ken Bates. Sanctions placed by the government on the Russian billionaire put the sale of the club in some doubt but they have allowed it to still happen, and allowed the team continue playing despite the sanctions. The 55-year-old was reportedly hoping for around Â£3.5 billion to sell the club, which is said to include the Â£1.5 billion they 'owed' him in loans that he wasn't going to call in, instead passing it on to the potential new owners. Experts thought that the oligarch was likely to get less than that but, according to the Athletic, the club could now be sold for around Â£3 billion. That would make them the most expensive sports franchise in the history of sport, surpassing the Â£2.5 billion spent in 2019 by Joseph Tsai for NBA side the Brooklyn Nets. The report claims that around 20 interested parties came forward with bids to New York-based company the Raine Group, who are helping Abramovich sell the club. Worldwide interest from so many bidders is thought to have driven the price above the one Tsai paid for his basketball franchise. Whether or not the final price is as high as the Â£3 billion mark, the Blues are extremely certain to become the most expensive Premier League team. That current record belongs to Manchester United, with the 13 times Premier League winners being sold to the Glazers for Â£790 million, around the same time Abramovich bought Chelsea. The Raine Group are expected to make a decision on the winning bid by mid April and the club will then need to apply for an exemption from the sanctions on Abramovich. With the billionaire's bank accounts frozen the proceeds will not go directly to the owner, although there is no clear plan for what will happen. Abramovich does still have the right to pick who he sells to, or veto the Raine Group's decision, with claims he could veto the sale to anyone from a country that has placed sanctions on Russia. However, the billionaire does not want to see the Blues go out of business, and nor do the government, and he will likely sell to whichever bidder has the best bid in place for them. In the 19 years since he purchased the Stamford Bridge side, Chelsea have won the Premier League five times, the FA Cup another five, two Champions League titles and two more in the Europa League. Earlier this year they won the FIFA World Club Cup, meaning they had won every trophy possible under Abramovich. It is likely to be the final piece of silverware they win under his ownership, even if no one knows what will happen next. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Russian billionaire's stint owning Chelsea was in its infancy at the time and he was apparently partial to a bit Japanese cuisine. Loadingâ¦ Abramovich's favourite was said to be a restaurant called Ubon, based in the rather plush area of Canary Wharf. According to the Sunday Times, via The Mirror, he loved it so much that he was willing to do whatever was needed to bring it to him even if he wasn't local. While based in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital city, he must have got a serious craving and placed an order totalling Â£1200. Deliveroo and Uber Eats didn't even exist at the time but Abramovich was desperate for he and his friends to have a good old scran. Therefore, the dishes was taken to Luton airport via a chauffer-driven limousine and then placed on Abramovich's private jet. The journey totalled a staggering 2500 miles and would take more than five hours on a plane. Then the food needed to be transported to Abramovich and his pals, so there was even more of a wait time. Just imagine the absolute crushing feeling there would be if there was an order mix up of some sorts, but surely Abramovich had total trust if he was splashing out. Not that it would have been much cash to Abramovich, one of the richest men in the world. However, fast forward to the present and Abramovich has had his assets frozen by the government and in the process of trying to sell Chelsea. The sanctions on Chelsea have been imposed due to Abramovich's alleged links to Russia president Vladimir Putin, who engineered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a decision to that has led to many innocent lives being lost.

It indicates the billionaire is willing to stay in football after owning Chelsea for 19 years. He bought the Blues from Ken Bates in 2003 and has transformed them into a dominant force in England and worldwide. Abramovich was initially hoping to sell Chelsea for Â£3.5 billion but it'll likely be in the region of Â£3 billion. That'll still make Chelsea the most expensive sport franchise in history by quite a distance. The current record fee for a sport franchise is Â£2.5 billion, spent by Joseph Tsai to acquire NBA side the Brooklyn Nets in 2019. Chelsea are currently third in the Premier League and advanced to the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday after defeating Middlesbrough. Their form hasn't been hindered by the off-field drama and manager Thomas Tuchel believes his players are going from strength to strength.

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich has decided to sell Chelsea, after 19 years as the club's owner, in the wake of Russia invading Ukraine, with one MP calling for the club to be seized from him. The team's fans have thrown their support behind the billionaire who has bought all the success to West London in the past two decades, including some chanting his name on Saturday during the minute's applause in solidarity with Ukraine. Abramovich is obviously trying to repay the love the fans have for him by selling to the right person, or people, to take the team forward after he's left. According to the Mirror, amongst the criteria for any prospective buyer is that the new owner will continue the policy to invest in the playing squad. Abramovich has spent a huge amount on buying players since becoming owner, and it has been the driving force behind their five Premier League title and two Champions League wins in that time. Even in the past year he has spent around Â£106 million, although most of that was just on Romelu Lukaku, with the rest the loan price for Saul Niguez. He has occasionally pulled back on his spending but in recent years it has been back at its highest, as they attempt to keep pace with Manchester City and Liverpool. The 55-year-old was also originally going be building a new stadium for the Blues, but ended that project when his UK citizenship application was denied in 2018. Investment into a new stadium, or the development of Stamford Bridge, is also on the criteria for any new owner, with the Russian reportedly not in a rush to sell. Already it has been reported that the Saratov born owner was wary of selling to any one that would be considered 'politically controversial.' With the Premier League also looking into adding human rights record to their 'fit and proper persons test', it is thought to rule out any buyers from Saudi Arabia or China. Whilst Chelsea fans have been supporting Abramovich, former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan claimed he was 'one of the worst things to happen to English football.' ",positive,liverpool,1

Loadingâ¦ Chelsea were very unlucky to get knocked out of the Champions League quarter finals by Real Madrid, after their stirring performance in the Bernabeu. Had it not been for a moment of pure genius from Luka Modric then they would have won in normal time and then Karim Benzema did what Karim Benzema does and scored the crucial winner in extra time. Whilst it was a good night for most in Chelsea's yellow away kit, in terms of performance, Kante was rather lacking and was involved in both Real goals. He also had to be saved by Rudiger on another occasion. With the game level on aggregate, and the Blues 2-0 up on the night, the French midfielder sloppily lost the ball to Toni Kroos in the middle of the pitch. Kroos was able to get forward untroubled, once Kante had missed a tackle, and played a brilliant ball for Vinicius Junior, only for Rudiger to make a brilliant challenge, and then get to his feet and scream at his teammate. ð¡ pic.twitter.com/G71Q8kgbed Rudiger after his heroic tackle to kante.

Minutes after Timo Werner did put his side ahead, only for Modric to provide the ball of the night for Rodrygo to level things up on aggregate. Kante gave the ball away in the lead up to the incident and when Benzema scored the winner it was the former Leicester City man who was late to close down a loose ball in midfield in the build up. However Rudiger also slipped at the worst time, as Vinicius Junior played the cross in the box, towards the man Rudiger was marking, although Thierry Henry's brilliant analysis showed why it might not have mattered. Rudiger, who is expected to leave the club at the end of the season when his contract expires, focused on the mistakes him and his team made over the two legs. ""Over the two legs if you make these kind of mistakes you get punished,"" the centre back told BT Sports after the match. ""It was a do or die for us. Before the game not everybody thought we could get to 3-0 but then the individual class comes to light with Modric and Benzema, now we are here. ""The positive is we didnât give up.

The Brazilian centre-back has played a key role for Madrid this season, making 30 appearances in all competitions for the La Liga leaders. Spanish outlet AS claim Thomas Tuchel has been impressed by Militaoâs performances and has requested that Chelsea to make an approach for the 24-year-old. Loadingâ¦ Chelsea could be in need of defensive reinforcements soon, with Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen all out of contract at the end of the season. Rudiger has stalled on signing a new deal at Stamford Bridge and has held pre-contract talks with four foreign clubs: Real Madrid, Paris-Saint Germain, Bayern Munich and Juventus. Christensen is also yet to commit his future to Chelsea, while Azpilicueta has been strongly linked with a summer move to Barcelona. Loadingâ¦ Chelsea are hopeful they can convince the trio to stay but are preparing contingency plans, should one or more of them leave the club. AS claim Tuchel is a fan of Militao and has asked Chelsea to make an approach for the defender at the end of the season. Chelsea were previously linked with Militao before his â¬50m (Â£41m) move from Porto to Real Madrid in 2019. However, the Premier League club could find it difficult to sign the Brazil international, who is said to be happy with his life in Spain and is under contract with Madrid until 2025. Militao is believed to be on a relatively low salary at the Bernabeu and could easily negotiate an improved contract with Madrid if the club is determined to keep him. Another potential option for Chelsea is Sevilla defender Jules Kounde, who came close to joining the Blues last summer. Chelsea were in talks to sign Kounde but were unable to agree a fee with Sevilla, who reportedly wanted the Premier League club to pay a Â£68.5m release clause in the Frenchman's contract.

Loadingâ¦ It wasn't a happy time for Arsenal last season as the Gunners could only finish in eighth place in the league, and missed out on European competition for next season altogether. Arteta has already brought in Albert Sambi Lokonga, from Anderlecht, to improve his midfield and is hoping to add Brighton centre back Ben White. Once that transfer is confirmed, Arsenal will look to add to their attacking options, with reports of a double swoop from rivals Leicester City and Chelsea. According to the Daily Mail, Arteta wants to sign James Maddison from Leicester. The Foxes won't accept an offer of Â£50 million, the same price that White is being signed for, but the offer of players in a swap could help the deal. Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles could be included in the deal for Maddison, who signed a new contract last summer after Brendan Rodgers' side reportedly rejected Â£70 million for the 24-year-old. Nelson could be used as a direct replacement for Maddison and the club tried to sign Maitland-Niles on loan in January, before he went to West Brom for guaranteed first team football. The paper also say that the Gunners are ahead of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham in the race to sign Tammy Abraham from Chelsea. Abraham was one of Frank Lampard's regular starters but found his opportunities lacking when the former midfielder was replaced by Thomas Tuchel at the beginning of this year. He made only six appearances for the Blues after the German became manager, and it's no surprise that he's available this summer. The report claims that the 24-year-old striker is expected to join Arsenal on a year long loan with an obligation to buy the striker next summer for Â£40 million. Spurs and West Ham both wanted to sign the striker permanently this summer but have so far not been willing to meet the Blues' valuation. Chelsea are hoping to sign a top level striker this summer and getting Abraham's wages out of the club would certainly help with that. ",positive,liverpool,0

The 22-year-old who made 14 appearances during a four month loan at the North London club last season, is due to complete the move in the coming days with Mikel Arteta keen to bolster his side's creative armour. The clause means that all could not be lost on Odegaard's dream of starring for Real Madrid, and the player will move permanently to The Emirates Stadium knowing if he sets the world al light, the doors to the Bernabau may open up once more. Should he be a success in the Premier League and look to move on, Real Madrid will have the first say on whether they want to sign him back for their squad. The Â£34m fee Arsenal are stumping up shows faith in the player however, which he will want to repay and build on. Odegaard scored one goal during his first spell at The Gunners and contributed two assists. Arteta has already spent Â£50m on Ben White from Brighton this summer and is pushing for a move for Â£30m rated Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. Martin Ãdegaard will sign his contract as new Arsenal player today. The agreement will be until June 2026 [option included] - Real Madrid are also preparing their official statement ð´ #AFCAaron Ramsdale deal between Arsenal and Sheffield Utd will be also completed âvery soonâ. It was reported that the club's main target, James Maddison, was unavailable to sign from Leicester City which has led Arteta to now turn his focus to Odegaard with just weeks of the transfer window remaining. Carlo Ancelotti, installed as Real Madrid's manager for the second time this summer after his shock Everton exit, ran the rule over Odegaard during pre-season before making the decision to allow the player to depart. Odegaard will feel instant pressure to deliver from Arsenal supporters following the opening day defeat away to Brentford. If the move is completed in the coming days, he could have a chance of featuring in this weekend's London derby with Chelsea.   ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Odegaard spent the second half of last season on loan at the Emirates Stadium and he impressed manager Mikel Arteta. The Norway international wouldn't be against returning to the Gunners but Madrid want academy graduate Smith Rowe in exchange, according to the Daily Mail. Smith Rowe made 20 appearances in the Premier League and graduated through the club's Hale End academy. The likelihood of a straight swap is low given Odegaard's value, but Smith Rowe is highly-rated too. It's also been claimed the 20-year-old is a Â£25 million target for Aston Villa, which Arsenal have turned down. Villa have already got one over on Arsenal this summer, managing to sign Emi Buendia from Norwich City in a club-record Â£33 million deal. Arsenal finished eighth in the Premier League last season and they'll miss out on European football altogether. Movement is expected this summer and two targets include Brighton defender Ben White and Anderlecht midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga. David Luiz has already left on a free transfer with Granit Xhaka, Hector Bellerin and Willian are among the high-profile names departing. Arteta told reporters at the end of last season: ""Nothing is broken. Inside nothing is broken. I don't know how hard they are going to try from the outside but inside, no. ""They've tried to put things on me that I never said. You can see the spirit of the team from the first minute, it doesn't matter if we're playing to be seventh, eighth or ninth, you can see that. You can never doubt their efforts and how much they try. ""It's been a really tough season because we faced something unprecedented from outside the world of this football club but we put all our passion, our energy, our knowledge and our togetherness to get through any moment, any obstacles and try to be as good as we can.""

Former Blues goalkeeper Courtois returned to his old side and received a spiky reception by the home fans. What's more, the Belgium international wanted to face the music as he gave his skipper some tactical advice. He told Benzema to switch ends at Stamford Bridge because he wanted to play in front of the most hostile stand from the start. The 29-year-old started in goal in front of the Matthew Harding Stand which is considered as the main end at Chelsea. He also knows that his ex-teammates like to attack that stand in the second half of games, according to The Athletic. Courtois conceded a Kai Havertz header in the first-half, with his team running out 3-1 winners thanks to a stunning hat-trick by Benzema. Courtois, who was on the books at Chelsea for seven years and won two Premier League titles, was disappointed to be booed on his return to the club. ""Obviously I knew it wouldn't be friendly, especially in the stadium,"" he told BT Sport. ""Maybe if you see some people outside the ground they will be more friendly. ""It's obviously part of football, that's unfortunate because how they painted my departure was not how it went through. ""But I'm happy with the result and I will always care about the special moments here at the Bridge, two leagues. ""It's not easy to win two Premier Leagues in four years, so I'm happy for that and the moments here, so what happened today [the boos] I don't take it too much.""

Loadingâ¦ Having struck twice for Real Madrid against Alaves at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2018, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner had the chance to bag his 50th career hat-trick when Gareth Bale was fouled inside the area in the 80th minute. As Real's regular penalty taker, many assumed Ronaldo would step up from 12 yards in a bid to claim the match-ball. But he had other ideas. Instead, Ronaldo let Karim Benzema take the spot-kick. The Frenchman had been struggling in front of goal lately and missed a sitter earlier in the game, but got on the scoresheet thanks to Ronaldo's unselfish act. As soon as the penalty was awarded, Ronaldo grabbed the ball and passed it to Benzema, who was very grateful to his teammate for his gesture. The same be said for fellow Frenchman Griezmann, who was so happy that Messi let him take a 93rd minute penalty against Getafe when he had already bagged himself a brace. Cameras caught the heartwarming moment the former Atletico Madrid man approached Messi and gave him a hug.

The French World Cup winner was at his scintillating best against the Italian side. He played a pivotal role in the majority of United's build up play and even found the back of the net with a rare header. Despite a rocky start to the semi-final first leg, it turned out to be fairly straightforward affair at Old Trafford as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side dominated in large spells. And it was that man Pogba who gave arguably the performance of the match. Just check out his indivudal highlights below. To make Pogba's performance even more impressive, the 28-year-old didn't eat or drink anything until full-time. The Frenchman has explained in the past how he suffers no ill-effects of fasting during Ramadan when it comes to his efforts on the pitch. ""I've been doing it (Ramadan) for years."" he told Manchester United's official website. ""I have a professional nutritionist as well here, who helps me with what I have to eat and also when I train, he gives me some stuff, some protein, so I don't lose too much muscle and it's okay.

Similarly, Mario Balotelli had to wear No.9 for Marseille and Nice because No.45 was not allowed. ""The numbers 1, 16 and 30 are exclusively and necessarily reserved for goalkeepers, ""the LFP rule #670 states. ""Ultimately, the number 40 can be assigned. All teams must have a jersey with number 33 that is not assigned to a player and reserved for breaking replacements. A directory is established early in the season and available to referees and delegates by the LFP."" Many had urged Barcelona to retire the No.10 shirt, currently vacant, in honour of Messi. However, Barca legend Ronaldo de Boer believes Barcelona should hand the shirt to a youngster who aspires to be ""as good as Messi."" Speaking to talkSPORT, De Boer said: ""We had it with Johan Cruyff No 14 [at Ajax], of course. ""In another way, no, you have to always dream to be just as good as Messi. I think the No 10 must stay alive, not to say okay we'll put it some place and nobody's going to touch it. ""I mean, Messi's Messi. [...] If I think about Messi, it's about his football skills, so not his shirt. Try to give it to a youngster who wants to be just as good as Messi."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Messi has endured a difficult debut campaign at Paris Saint-Germain and has managed just three goals in his 20 appearances in Ligue 1. But while his goals return may be down on previous years, he is still able to play an important role for PSG - as shown in Saturdayâs 6-1 win over Clermont, in which the Argentine provided three assists without getting on the scoresheet. Loadingâ¦ A new graph, posted to Twitter by user gasipo_opinions, has proved just how effective Messi remains at the age of 34. The graph, which uses data from statistics website FBref, ranks players from European footballâs top five leagues by their progressive passes per 90 minutes and expected assists per 90 minutes. For players to be included, they must have played a minimum of 13 90-minute matches this season. The graph shows that Messi is one of the best performing players on both axis and an outlier when the two metrics are combined. Best passers in world football pic.twitter.com/IYWWrGMouD Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold also scores highly on the chart, along with Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich and Messiâs teammate at PSG, Neymar. Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is also in the same elite group, dubbed the 'Double Threat' passers, along with Lazioâs Luis Alberto and Athletic Bilbao winger Iker Muniain. While he still has at least one year left on his current deal at PSG, Messi continues to be linked with a return to Barcelona. His former teammate Dani Alves has urged the seven-time Ballon dâOr winner to return âhomeâ when the summer window opens. âI donât know what he thinks or wants to do. He could come back for a little year with me for a 'last dance'. Why not? Thereâs nowhere better than here,â Alves told Sport. âHe cannot be better off than at Barcelona.

Every time they touched the ball, the pair of PSG stars were met with a chorus of boos and whistles from the home supporters. The Brazilian even received boos when he scored his side's second goal in their 3-0 win. Kimpembe, though, says he 'understands' the fans' 'disappointment' and 'hatred' as he addressed the spiky reception following the match. ""Inevitably we hear the whistles, even if weâre focused and concentrated on our match.

That's despite heading into the game with a 1-0 advantage, which was increased following Kylian Mbappe's opener. But the French giants, who've yet to win the prestigious Champions League since an extreme amount of moneywas pumped into the club, blew their lead -losing 3-2 on aggregate. âMessi and Neymar's former Barcelona teammates Luis Suarez and Cesc Fabregas leapt to the defence of the PSG players.

Loadingâ¦ It has not been a good few weeks for Neymar in Paris, with PSG's owners apparently wanting to get rid of the most expensive player in the history of football. That decision reportedly came in the wake of the club's latest embarrassment in the Champions League, as they once again failed to win their top priority, having led Real Madrid by two goals with only half an hour of the tie left. It's not just the owners who are fed up of the Brazil forward either, with fans booing the 30-year-old after he scored against Bordeaux last week, where they also booed Lionel Messi. Anyone wanting to sign the former Barcelona man would likely have to pay a lot of money, as close to the Â£198 million the Parisiens paid in 2017, limiting the places he can go. According to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Newcastle are interested in adding Neymar to their squad and are eyeing up a possible move in the summer. Following the takeover of the club last year, by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Eddie Howe's team are one of the few who could afford Neymar. It would also be a huge signal of intent in the first summer of the new owners and show they're already to kick on from the relegation battle they found themselves at the time of the takeover. Howe's management, along with the Â£90 million they invested in January, has taken them into 14th spot in the league, and 10 points clear of the bottom three. Fichajes do also have two other locations for Neymar to end up next season, if he does actually leave PSG and Newcastle don't sign him. The outlet claims that Manchester City is a possible destination for the forward, and their wealth does make them another one of the few sides who could afford him. Pep Guardiola is reportedly still in the market for a forward, having missed out on Harry Kane last summer, and Erling Haaland is said to be his priority, but should he miss out then Neymar could be an option. The third place the Brazilian could end up is at the Spotify Nou Camp, with a return to Barcelona potentially on the cards for the man who previously starred for the Catalan giants. How they'd actually afford his wages is anyone's guess, considering their wage cap for next season is set at negative â¬144 million. They have also been linked with a move for Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, following his poor form for Ralf Rangnick's side. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Mbappe also registered a hat-trick of assists in a virtuoso attacking performance and it was the first time that the star-studded trio had all been on the scoresheet in the same game for PSG. Messi scored PSG's fourth in the 73rd minute, thwacking one into the cop corner after a lovely cut-back from Mbappe. But his best piece of play came wasn't a goal or assist, it was another instance of his inexplicable, matrix-like dribbling ability. Ese â¨ giro de Messi â¨ nunca le fallÃ³ en toda su carrera.

Messi then made off with the ball and had time to play a pass straight through to a free Abdou Diallo down the left.

In the top five leagues, he has received 21 red cards - eight more than nearest competitor Sulley Muntari, who played for Portsmouth, Inter and AC Milan. When they build the Sergio Ramos statue, it should either be of him sneering at a fallen forward or him disgusted at being carded. It was a typically cynical foul from the former Real Madrid captain, who knew exactly what he was doing when he impeded the opposition forward. He had only been cautioned a few minutes earlier. Still, he was not happy with the decision and protested to the fourth official after leaving the pitch.

Loadingâ¦ Aguero sadly had to retire from football on Wednesday morning, after suffering from a problem with his heart following Barcelona's game with Alaves in October. The striker hadn't been seen since then and rumours started circulating that the end of his career was coming, before the official announcement. He will most fondly be remembered for his time in England with Manchester City, where he won the league on five occasions, but the first one will remain one of the greatest moments in Premier League history. City looked to have blown the title on the final day of the season, as they were losing to QPR whilst rivals Manchester United were beating Sunderland. The full time whistle had blown at the Stadium of Light when Edin Dzeko equalised at the start of injury time for City, meaning the title was still heading to Sir Alex Ferguson. However, with literally seconds to go Aguero scored the winning goal and produced one of football's most dramatic season endings ever. Everyone has heard Martin Tyler's brilliant 'Aguerooooooo' commentary but the goal from fan footage may be even better. You don't even see the ball go in from the fan footage inside the Etihad but it's the pure joy unconfounded from the rest of the crowd that makes the moment. It was City's first league title since 1968 and it really kicked off a period of dominance for the club, in which they won five titles in the next nine years. During his time in England, Aguero scored 260 goals in 390 appearances for the club and also won the FA Cup and six League Cup trophies. Despite his incredible record at City, he was amazingly never named the PFA or FWA Player of the Season and was only twice in the team of the year.

He left the Etihad last summer to join Barcelona, where he expected to play with his good friend Lionel Messi, before the seven time Ballon d'Or winner left for PSG before that was the case. The 33-year-old managed just five appearances for the Catalan giants before having to call it a day but he did manage to help win the Copa America last summer. ",positive,liverpool,0

Aguero, 33, called time on his playing career at an emotional news conference on Wednesday due to a heart condition. His retirement leaves Barcelona with limited options up front and head coach Xavi is said to be keen to sign another striker in January. According to The Independent, Barcelona are considering a move for Aubameyang, whose future at the Emirates is now in doubt after he was stripped of the club captaincy on Tuesday. Aubameyang, 32, reportedly failed to arrive back on time from a trip abroad last week to visit his mother. While Barcelona are interested in signing Aubameyang, the Gabon international is said to be unwilling to take a pay cut to facilitate a move to the cash-strapped Catalan club. Due to their current financial limitations, Barcelona may instead seek a swap deal with Arsenal which could involve Ousmane Dembele, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Another option for Barcelona is Manchester United striker Edinson Cavani. The 34-year-old scored 17 goals in all competitions for United last season but has found first-team opportunities harder to come by following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta may allow his players to have a say in who replaces Aubameyang as captain at the Emirates. Alexandre Lacazette is expected to skipper the side against West Ham in the Premier League on Wednesday night, according to the London Evening Standard, but Arteta is yet to name a permanent captain. When asked if he would allow his players to vote on who they would prefer, Arteta said: âThere are so many different ways to do it. âSometimes the manager can decide the captain, or can decide the second or third captain, and the group has to defend who is going to represent them in that dressing room. âThey are good [ways] and they can all work if you have the right people. âI have seen and have participated in both of them, and at the end what is important is not the journey or the destination. âThe important thing is the company, thatâs the most important thing.â ",positive,liverpool,0

The Argentine striker held an emotional press conference where he revealed that he had to end his career prematurely on doctor's advice due to heart problems. ""My health comes first, "" Aguero said as he wept on stage. ""Medical staff have told me itâs best to stop playing and so Iâm now leaving Barcelona and retiring from professional football."" In what proved to be his final game as a footballer, Aguero was substituted against Alaves last month after experiencing chest pains and breathing difficulties. He was optimistic of carrying on playing but will now have to embark on a new chapter in his life. According to Argentine outlet Ole, Manchester City are ready to bring him back to the club in a global ambassadorial role. The club have already confirmed the five-time Premier League winner will have a special statue erected outside the Etihad Stadium alongside fellow legends Vincent Kompany and David Silva. The 33-year-old is City's record goalscorer with 260 goals in 390 appearances, and memorably scored the dramatic goal that secured the club's first league title for 44 years in 2012. MARCA say Aguero will be offered an opportunity to remain with the Argentina national team as part of Lionel Scaloni's coaching team, or a role within La Albiceleste's youth sides. As he comes to terms with the fact that he has kicked his last ball, Aguero will now spend time with his family - while he also recently set up an eSports team. However, he could well follow many former players in becoming a TV pundit. At Barca, Aguero scored once in five appearances. He will be paid the remainder of his salary for this season but has agreed to forego the final year of his Â£100,000-a-week contract. ",positive,liverpool,0

The iconic shirt, previously worn by Romario and Ronaldinho at the Nou Camp, has been a hot topic since the six time Ballon d'Or winner completed his dramatic move to PSG. Phillipe Coutinho, so often linked with a move away from the Catalan club this summer, has also been mentioned around filling the shirt, more so after his no.14 was worn by Rey Manaj for the opening weekend's victory over Real Sociedad. Rumours Ousmane Dembele has been offered the shirt are unconfirmed. Loadingâ¦ With La Liga rules stating that all players must wear shirts numbered 1-25, it means that the no.10 is currently the only available option at Barcelona. Club officials are thought to prefer offering the shirt to a La Masia graduate, after Messi's ex-teammates have respectfully declined following his decorated legacy at the club. It has been an overwhelming start to life at his club for 33-year-old AgÃ¼ero since signing as a free agent from Manchester City this summer. Complications around the rules and regulations of Barcelona registering new players have delayed the player making his debut, whilst he has also had to see his close friend Messi depart. All this after his Argentinian compatriot was a huge influence on him joining the club. Rumours he is already looking for a swift exit are said to be false with the player confirming he will wear the no.19 shirt in his debut season via Instagram. Captain Gerard Pique admitted via Twitch that he would like to see the club's new signing take the number, but understands the players' decision of one out of respect for his friend and the fact that the shirt 'now weighs another 30 kilos' thanks to Messi's exploits during 13 seasons wearing the no.10. For now the shirt remains vacated and with the transfer window closing for all European clubs at the end of August, a lot can still happen. Whether it be Coutinho, another new signing or a La Masia graduate, Barcelona fans will be hoping whoever takes the jersey will help the club begin to navigate through a currently turbulent new chapter.

As Aguero drove in, parked and was getting ready to hand over the keys, before the kit man had some final words of friendly advice: ""Don't forget your stuff inside!"" A pro to the end.

Loadingâ¦ When Messi collected the award on Monday night - for a record-breaking seventh time - he acknowledged Bayern Munich and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. The 2020 edition of the award was cancelled due to the pandemic, but Messi pleaded with France Football to award Lewandowski the title retrospectively. ""Robert, you deserve your Ballon d'Or,"" he began. ""Last year, everyone was in agreement to say that you were the big winner of this award. Hopefully, France Football will give you the 2020 Ballon d'Or. We all believe you deserved it and I hope you can have it at home."" Lewandowski scored 55 goals in 2020, more than any other player, but the award was cancelled due to Covid-19. Now, France Football's editor-in-chief Pascal FerrÃ© is considering reversing his decision and handing Lewandowski the 2020 title. ""What Messi said was nice and clever,"" he admitted to Watson via Bulinews. ""I think we do not have to make very quick decisions. We can think about it and at the same time we should respect the history of the Ballon d'Or, which is based on voting. ""We can't be sure if Lewandowski would have won the Ballon D'Or last year. We can't know because there was no vote. But, to be honest, Lewandowski would have had a great chance of winning last year."" Lewandowski admitted he was enjoying the best season of his career to date shortly after the decision was made to cancel last year's Ballon d'Or. However, he has continued in fine fettle this term, scoring three goals at Euro 2020 for Poland and a further eight during qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. For Bayern, he has conjured up an unbelievable 25 goals and two assists in just 20 games for the Bavarian giants so far this season. This is why he was a leading contender to take home the recent 2021 Ballon d'Or as well. Whether Lewandowski does get the 2020 edition retrospectively - or indeed whether he ever wins the Ballon d'Or - remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: he can hardly do much more to deserve one... Words by Dom Smith ",positive,liverpool,0

Earlier this week it transpired that Simeone had copied every exact detail from the win over Manchester United, for the defeat to Manchester City.

In December, Guilherme Siqueira, who played for Atleti for three years, shed light on what Simeone is like behind the scenes. According to the defender, the Argentine had to stick to a pre-match schedule and the same playlist had to be played on the bus and in the changing rooms. What's more, he always had a superstitious act involving the ball following the warm-up. âAtleti have the most superstitious coaching staff I have seen in the history of football, I have never seen anything like it,â Siqueira toldESPN Brasil, via Squawka. âWe had a protocol when leaving the hotel, on the bus and until the moment of the game. On the bus the same list of music had to always be played. Also in the locker room. âWhen we came back from our warm-up, Simeone was always hitting a ball with his hand against the ground. Before making a circle with the players, he gave the ball to the captain. The captain did the same and it had to be that way, he couldnât change. âIt took me a while to assimilate his pre-match rituals. When I arrived I was only looking at what I could and what I couldnât do.â The music would normally be Reggaeton, Spanish, and Latin music. And on the occasion it went off and there was silence, Simeone lost it. âOne day the music on the bus stopped and he went crazy, like we were already 1-0 down,"" Siqueira continued. ""He shouted âput the music on!â I had to tell him to calm down.â Seemingly always wearing all black, 'El Cholo' also refuses to shake hands with the opposition manager after the game and immediately darts down the tunnel.

Thomas Tuchel's side, who held an away-goal advantage having drawn the first leg in Madrid, dominated for large periods on Wednesday night. Los Blancos, meanwhile, struggled to make any sort of impression as the likes of Eden Hazard and Vinicius Junior made very little impact on the semi-final second leg clash. Even the return of Sergio Ramos, who started his first Real Madrid game in seven weeks, couldn't rally the troops as a goal from Timo Werner opened the scoring for The Blues. After a season of ups and downs, the German striker found the net as Chelsea went 1-0 up after just 28 minutes. He netted a 12th goal of the season from close range after some brilliant work from N'Golo Kante and Kai Havertz. Despite dominating possession for the majority of the game, Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy was forced to make a number of big saves for the home side, in particular from the in-form Karim Benzema. Chelsea continued their domination in the second-half and really, it could have easily been three or four if it wasn't for the heroics of Thibaut Courtois on his return to Stamford Bridge. Mason Mount, who has been outstanding all season, then put the nail in Madrid's coffin with five minutes remaining when he made it 2-0 on the night with a simple tap in.

European club footballâs showpiece event was originally due to be held at the Gazprom Arena in St Petersburg on May 28. But UEFA has decided to move the final to the Stade de France in Paris in the wake of Russiaâs invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. ""It's a pity, of course, that such a decision was made. But [the decision] has been made, so it is accepted,â said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. When asked whether he considered the decision to be politically motivated, Peskov added: ""No, I didn't say that. I just expressed regret."" UEFA had come under huge pressure to move the final, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson among those calling for Russia to be prevented from hosting the event. On Friday, UEFA confirmed the final would be moved to Paris, while also announcing that Russian and Ukrainian club and national sides would be required to play at neutral venues in European competition this season. A UEFA statement read: ""The UEFA Executive Committee decided to relocate the final of the 2021/22 UEFA Men's Champions League from Saint Petersburg to Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

""At today's meeting, the UEFA Executive Committee also decided that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams competing in UEFA competitions will be required to play their home matches at neutral venues until further notice. ""The UEFA Executive Committee further determined to remain on standby to convene further extraordinary meetings, on a regular ongoing basis where required, to reassess the legal and factual situation as it evolves and adopt further decisions as necessary.""

The Qatari businessman would want to see that win played alongside an opening ceremony that is akin to the halftime show seen at the Super Bowl, as he's worried the American annual game is bigger than Europe's showpiece. ""The final should be bigger,"" Al-Khelaifi told The Athletic, apparently forgetting the reported 400 million who tune into the Champions League climax every year on tv. ""I can't understand how the Super Bowl can feel bigger than the Champions League final. ""The Super Bowl, and the US generally, have this mindset, creativity and entertainment. ""That's what I have suggested, to have an opening ceremony to the Champions League, to have one match on the opening night where the winners take on a big team â maybe it is not a good idea, but at least let's challenge the status quo. ""Each match needs to be an event and entertainment."" Football fans have often been against the idea of a big pre show before the Champions League final, with bans having played ahead of kick off in recent years. Fans in the past have argued that the football should be the entertainment and that it doesn't need anything alongside it to make it better. However, the NFL over the years has become huge news, even outside of America, for the halftime show and lots of viewers, especially outside of the US, tune in to watch. This year's edition really stole the show, as Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, Mary J Blige And KendrickLamar wowed the audiences SoFi Stadium, as the Los Angeles Rams won the title. It's not the first idea that's been made to make the Champions League seem like a bigger deal, and potentially make the game more appealing to an American audience. In the past there has reportedly been talks to take the biggest game in European football to be played outside of the continent, with New York talked about as a potential venue. The US is set to be hosting the World Cup, alongside Mexico and Canada, in 2026, the second time the country will have hosted the tournament, having done so in 1994. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ After a year and a bit of issues on and off the field, Barca under Xavi are getting closer to being back to their best, as a couple of performances recently have hinted. In a post Lionel Messi world, they're still not quite at the peak of their powers but Pedri's performance against Athletic Club just shows they've got some really talented players at the Nou Camp. Even Xavi didn't turn things around straight away though, and he needed time, and investment in January, to get things going under his management, after Ronald Koeman's sacking in October. Koeman has now hit out the club for not backing him in the same way, giving his successor more time and claimed that club president Joan Laporta told the Dutchman that he wouldn't have Xavi as manager. ""He had told me a thousand times that Xavi would not be his coach, because he lacked experience,"" the former Everton boss told Mundo Deportivo. ""But he needed a shield, someone to hide behind."" The 58-year-old also added that the club's new boss had been given the time he wasn't, and bemoaned the return of injured players he didn't have in his last days as manager. ""They didn't give me the time they gave the new coach, Xavi.It's still painful for me,"" the Dutchman added. ""I was working with many injured. Now Pedri is back in shape, and Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ©... You can see everything. Every coach needs time and patience from the board."" Dembele had looked on his way out of the club in January, after they announced that he had to be sold in the wake of the two parties not agreeing a new contract for the forward. The forward could still leave on a free at the end of the season but he has featured in the team's most recent five games, including a goal against Athletic. Koeman was at the club at the beginning of the cost cutting and had to oversee Messi's departure last summer, after desperately trying to keep him. Xavi has had to do some of the same cutting, but has also seen quite a few players come in, and Koeman added that he wasn't happy having to get rid of players, only to see the team bring in a â¬55 million forward, Ferran Torres, arrive when he was gone. ""It was at the insistence of the club management that I agreed to the departure of some players to put the finances in order. ""But then when you see that they attract someone for 55 million euros shortly after letting Lionel Messi go then you wonder if there wasn't something else going on. Why did Messi have to leave?""

Ronaldo terrorised the Blaugrana during his nine-year spell with Real Madrid - but the headline is nothing to do with that. Instead, it's to warn players of Covid-19 risks and it reads: ""Cristiano returns to test positive for Covid-19 and is low against Barca."" It's believed the message is there to show Barcelona players that even elite athletes can suffer from the virus. Beneath that is the message of: ""The competition is at stake."" And: ""The rules are to be met."" The headline is referring to Ronaldo having to miss a Champions League clash between Barcelona and Juventus due to testing positive. Barcelona won that game 2-0 and Juve missed Ronaldo in front of goal. Both sides still progressed in the competition and were eliminated at the last-16 stage by Paris Saint-Germain and Porto respectively. Ronaldo's future is up in the air this summer and he's been linked with a move away from Turin. Juventus finished fourth in Serie A and parted ways with manager Andrea Pirlo, with Max Allegri returning to the dugout. Messi, meanwhile, looks ready to commit his long-term future to Barcelona.

Less than a year ago Messi made it public that he wanted to leave the Nou Camp, after the club had been embarrassed in the Champions League by Bayern Munich. Messi was hoping to be allowed to leave for nothing, due to an agreement with the club, but the request was denied. It then looked like he would wait to the end of the season, with PSG and Manchester City both linked.

That is according to former Belgium star Marc Degryse, who believes Hazard needs a ânew boost to his careerâ after his ill-fated spell at Madrid. Loadingâ¦ Hazardâs career at Madrid has been curtailed by various injuries since his initial Â£89m transfer from Chelsea in 2019. The 30Â­-year-old Belgian winger, who is under contract with Madrid in 2024, has registered one assist in 10 La Liga appearances this season. Hazard has been linked with a move to Newcastle after the Saudi Arabia-backed takeover of the Premier League club. Read More: Degryse has now urged his fellow countryman to leave Madrid and backed him to keep Newcastle in the Premier League. âHazard has to go to a team in January where they count on him, where they make him important,â he told Het Laatste Nieuws (via Sport Witness). âNewcastle is ideal. All the balls will go to him. If he can keep Newcastle in the Premier League, it could give a new boost to his career.â Newcastle languish in 19th place -- level on points with 20th-place Norwich City -- and are five points adrift from Premier League safety. Steve Bruce has been sacked as Newcastle manager and replaced by former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe under the Saudi-led owners of the club. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is chaired by Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, spearheaded the consortium that snapped up Newcastle. Read More: Former Arsenal and Bournemouth midfielder Jack Wilshere believes that Hazard âwould love playingâ under Howe at Newcastle. âHe was great with me [at Bournemouth] because it was tough for me there because I was coming from a big club,â he told talkSPORT. âI stepped into a group that had been together since they were in League One, they were all friends. They were all great with me, but Eddie made sure they were. He was great with me. âEden Hazard is another level, but I think Eden would love playing for a manager like Eddie Howe [at Newcastle]. Heâs the type of manager you want to play for. âI worked with him at a club that I see now are quite similar to Newcastle -- not in terms of the size of the club, but in terms of the players. âNewcastle have got a few ex-Bournemouth players and that is what Eddie does, he gets the best out of those types of players, gets them going and he gets the fans on side. âHeâs a great manager. I think he deserves a chance. If he goes in and does really well, in a few years they could be pushing the top six, which I think he can do. âWhen I played under him at Bournemouth, we arguably had a worse squad and we finished ninth, so he can definitely do that. âItâs down to him when he gets that chance to take them to the next level.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Spanish media have slaughtered Hazard for his actions and believe it is proof his heart isn't with 'Los Blancos'. It couldn't be further from the truth, however. Hazard was actually the Madrid player who covered most ground and was fourth overall on the pitch. Only Kai Havertz, N'Golo Kante and Jorginho managed to outwork the 30-year-old. Hazard didn't deliver a vintage performance as Madrid looked rather toothless in attack on Wednesday evening. But it wasn't through a lack of effort despite the uproar back in Spain. What's more, El Chiringuito suggest the La Liga club have had enough Hazard and have decided to transfer list him. Yes we know what you're thinking. The video is incredibly dramatic and over the top. They say he's on the market while claiming if one good offer is received then Hazard will be sold in the summer transfer window. Speaking after Madrid's European exit, one reporter said: ""Two years of taking the pi** out of Real Madrid fans... two years of being overweight... just another Gareth Bale. ""Real Madrid are out of Europe as Hazard finds time to laugh and joke. ""We are angry, we don't understand him. He cannot stay at Real Madrid for another second."" Spanish football expert Terry Gibson has countered that however by claiming Hazard 'owes' Madrid fans in the coming months. ""The first thing is to who? Who's got the money and who would buy him after two years ravaged by injury? So I think that's the big problem but I can understand the frustrations of the Real Madrid fans,"" Gibson told Sky Sports News. ""I think he was an easy target last night anyway because his form at Real Madrid has been disastrous and the way that he's been injured for the last couple of seasons. ""When he's played he hasn't been effective so he was always going to be an easy target, he hasn't adhered himself to the Real Madrid fans. ""I can understand that as well, losing a Champions League semi-final, not that I would know, but being involved in semi-finals myself, if you were to lose you should be devastated. ""For him to have been as happy as he was after the final whistle with former teammates! It's fine but if you want to congratulate them perhaps it's best done behind the scenes but to do it in full view of the media, the cameras, which everybody in the world can then see. ""You can understand the frustration of the Real Madrid supporters and the club. ""I would imagine the club wouldn't look too kindly on the way he behaved after the final whistle so that hasn't helped him. ""He should be doing everything in his power to make sure that he can get back into some sort of favour with the Real Madrid fans. ""It's not often I say it but I do think Hazard does owe Real Madrid, does owe the Real Madrid supporters, and that wasn't a good look after the game last night."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Prediction: 0-2 (11/2) Half-Time/Full-Time: Switzerland/Switzerland (13/8) Switzerland had a successful European Championship campaign, reaching the quarter-finals under Vladimir Petkovic and have cemented themselves into a formidable side. The Swiss come into this game after beating Greece 2-1 in a friendly before holding European champions Italy to a goalless draw on Sunday - proof that they are among Europe's elite. First Goalscorer: Haris Seferovic (10/3) Despite Northern Ireland's recent upturn in form, this is clearly a big upgrade for them against a Swiss team who very rarely taste defeat. With that said, Benfica hitman Haris Seferovic is the main danger for the Swiss and he is our pick to draw first blood in this one. Match Result and Under/Over Goals: Switzerland and Under 3.5 Goals (5/4) Only five of Northern Ireland's last 40 international games have seen four or more goals, while 13 of Switzerland's last 40 have seen four or more. Eight of Switzerland's last 15 international wins have seen under 3.5 goals, and a fair few of those have come against sides that are much worst defensively than Northern Ireland. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Despite making the headlines on Sunday night, Shane Ferguson will likely remain among the replacements, as will forward Kyle Lafferty. With Paddy McNair serving a one-match suspension, Tom Flanagan could be handed a start in a back three. Denis Zakaria is in line to be handed a recall in midfield, while Remo Freuler is available again after serving a one-match suspension. Experienced defender Fabian Schar will likely remain on the substitutesâ bench, but forward Andi Zeqiri may be given an opportunity from the start. ",positive,liverpool,0

Former England international Steve Hodge exchanged shirts with Maradona in the Azteca Stadium, Mexico after the forward scored two goals to knock Sir Bobby Robson's side out of the 1986 World Cup. Hodge, who made 24 appearances for the Three Lions, recalled the meeting with Maradona in an interview with FIFA. âI thought, I wonât be here again. Iâll try and get a shirt,"" he said. ""I shook Maradonaâs hand. He was being mobbed by his team-mates. So I thought, âThereâs no point, just leave it.ââ Hodge then had a second chance encounter with Maradona after speaking to the media. âAfter the interview, I went down, behind the goal, to the changing rooms. And as I went down, Maradona was walking with two of his team-mates,"" he added. ""I looked him in the eye, tugged on my shirt as if to say âany chance of swapping?â, and he came straight across, motioned a prayer, and we exchanged shirts. And that was it. It was just as simple as that.â In the past, Hodge has claimed the famous shirt from the World Cup quarter-final game was not for sale. ""I have had it for 34 years and have never once tried to sell it,""Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham in 2020. ""I like having it. It has incredible sentimental value."" But after 35 years of treasuring the jersey, former Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest midfielder has decided to auction it off, with Sotheby's valuing âThe Hand of Godâ & âGoal of the Centuryâ World Cup match worn shirt at Â£4,000,000 - Â£6,000,000. âI have been the proud owner of this item for over 35 years,"" Hodge said. ""It has deep cultural meaning to the football world, and Iâm certain that the new owner will have immense pride in owning the worldâs most iconic football shirt.â Steve Hodge swapped shirts with Diego Maradona after the infamous World Cup clash between England and Argentina in 1986. Heâs finally selling the shirt and it has an estimate of $5.2m ð¤¯ pic.twitter.com/wMHg4EuPlk The unique item has certainly peaked huge interest from around the world, although Maradona's eldest daughter, Dalma, has claimed the purported 'Hand of God' shirt is actually from the first-half of the 1986 World Cup clash. Maradona, of course, scored both of his famous goals in the second-half against England. Speaking on Argentine station Radio Metro, Dalma said her father had changed shirts at half-time because of the high temperatures in the Azteca Stadium. ""That ex-England player thinks heâs got my dadâs second-half shirt but there's a confusion,"" she said. ""He has the first-half top. I wanted to explain that to people so that whoever wants to buy it knows the truth."" Dalma was then asked about the whereabouts of the second-half shirt. âMy mum hasnât got it. I know who has but Iâm not going to say whoâs got it so as not to expose that person,"" she added. ""All I can say is that the one thatâs being auctioned is not the one my dad scored his goals with.â On their official website, Sothebyâs say part of the challenge in evaluating the shirt was pinpointing the shirt to the two historic goals from the 1986 World Cup quarter-final. And as part of this endeavor, they worked with Resolution Photomatching in order to match the shirt to both goals examining unique details on various elements of the item, including the patch, stripes and numbering. Resolution Photomatching was able to make a conclusive photomatch to the celebration following âThe Hand of Godâ goal. In fact, Resolution Photomatching determined that Maradona switched shirts during the match, but that Maradona did wear this shirt for both historic goals in the second half of the match. Sotheby have since released the following statement to clarify the situation. A spokeswoman said: âThere was indeed a different shirt worn by Maradona in the first half but there are clear differences between that and what was worn during the goals. âPrior to putting this shirt for sale, we did extensive diligence and scientific research on the item to make sure it was the shirt worn by Maradona in the second half for the two goals.â She added: âThis object has clear provenance, it is being consigned by the man that kicked Maradona the ball on the Hand of God play. âMaradona acknowledges the provenance himself, in his book âTouched by Godâ, and he recalls giving it to Steve Hodge. âItâs been in the National Football Museum for 20 years, where countless people have seen it. There has never been a claim that itâs not the shirt.â Maradona's shirt from the World Cup quarter-final in 1986 has been housed inside the National Football Museum in Manchester. The National Football Museum have also released a statement. âWe feel honoured at the National Football Museum to have had the pleasure for 18 years of housing the shirt worn by Diego Maradona when he scored his âfamous goalâ against England at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. âWe would like to thank former England player Steve Hodge for kindly allowing us to loan the shirt. It has been seen and enjoyed by many thousands of people over the years thanks to Steveâs generosity. ""Like everyone else, we will be very interested to see where the shirt goes next following the sale, and would love to have it back on display at the museum if the successful buyer should need a safe keeper.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ There hasn't been an international football tournament held on these shores since England hosted the Euros in 1996, when Terry Venables' side were a penalty shoot-out away from the final. Last year group games in Euro 2020 were held in England and Scotland, with the semi-finals and final also at Wembley, whilst Ireland was originally supposed to play host to games as well, before Covid regulations saw them move elsewhere. Now though the five countries that make up the British Isles are set to come together in a joint bid to host the tournament in six years time. ""Following an extensive feasibility study, which assessed the potential opportunities in international football,"" a statement by the FAI said. ""The football associations of the Republic of Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have agreed to focus on a bid to host UEFA EURO 2028, the third largest sports event in the world. ""The feasibility study included an analysis of the economic impact, the political football landscape and likely costs of hosting major international tournaments. ""On balance, the five associations have decided to focus solely on an official bid to host UEFA EURO 2028, and have agreed not to bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. ""Hosting a UEFA EURO offers a similar return on investment, with the European tournament carrying a far lower delivery cost and the potential of the benefits being realised sooner.â The home nations and Ireland were initially expected to compete to host the 2030 World Cup but this decision will see them step aside from that instead. The Euros in 2028 is set to see an increase from 24 teams to 32, having gone up to 24 in 2016. Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia have reportedly discussed co-hosting the event, whilst Turkey are also said to be interested in hosting, the date for applications closes on March 23rd. ""It would be an honour and a privilege to collectively host UEFA EURO 2028 and to welcome all of Europe,"" the FAI's statement continued. âIt would also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the true impact of hosting a world-class football tournament by driving positive change and leaving a lasting legacy across our communities. ""We believe the Republic of Ireland and the UK can offer UEFA and European football something special in 2028 â a compact and unique five-way hosting collaboration that will provide a great experience for the teams and the fans. âWe continue to collaborate with our Government Partners of Ireland and the UK about the next steps.â The crowd trouble at Euro 2020, specifically at the final where unticketed fans forced themselves inside, has seen England pick up a stadium ban, meaning their next UEFA game at Wembley will be behind closed doors. However, those problems are not thought to have any negative repercussions to the bid for an international tournament. ",negative,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Davis scored with a lovely heel kick against Luxembourg on Friday to prove age is just a number. The Rangers midfielder became the most-capped British player of all time last summer and he's showed no signs of slowing down, despite turning 37 in January and already having 133 caps to his name. Chris Brunt, who played with Northern Ireland captain Davis at international level, told Sky Sports he deserves to be up there as one of the best ever. ""Without a doubt, I think he is probably the greatest we've had,"" the former West Bromwich Albion midfielder said. ""I know that's a big call considering some of the players we've had in the past in our history. I think his record speaks for himself. ""The number of caps he has the way he conducts himself around the place, the way he conducts himself at his club, the way he looks after himself professionally. He keeps grounding it out doesn't he?"" Everyone's minds will immediately go to former Manchester United winger Best, who was one of the finest players of his generation. Best made 37 appearances for Northern Ireland between 1964 and 1977, scoring nine times. He's regarded as one of the best players to never play at a World Cup and he was surrounded by players who weren't up to his standard. Brunt then brought up Davis' performance against Italy back in November, which helped Ian Baraclough's side keep a 0-0 draw against the European champions at Windsor Park. He continued: ""The last few games I've watched of the national team, especially the Italy game, it was like he was 25 again the way he covered ground and the way he helped the other lads out. ""The young lads that are coming through as well, having someone like that in the squad to help them along is brilliant. He's a credit to himself and our country."" Some are furious with Brunt's claims and can't believe he didn't name Best. One commented: ""Better than George Best? You need your head testing son."" A second said: ""I dunno, I reckon George Best was a bit better than Steven Davis."" While someone put: ""Does he realise George Best played for Northern Ireland?"" ",positive,liverpool,0

One of the reasons he was unhappy in the first place was reportedly the decision to get rid of Suarez, with the striker's transfer to Atletico being confirmed on Thursday. It was quite clear that Suarez was upset at leaving and would have prefered to stay and now Messi has posted his displeasure on Instagram. Alongside a few pictures of the pair together, Messi wrote, ""You deserved a send off for what you are: one of the most important players in the club's history, achieving important things both as a group and individually.

Of Ronaldo's 450 goals for Los Blancos, the underrated Benzema assisted 47 of them and proved to be a great foil for the Portuguese forward. However, 32-year-old has admitted he did have to adapt his game for the benefit of Ronaldo, who did what he does and scored a hatful of goals. Speaking on Movistar + program Universo Valdano, he said: ""In Lyon I played in another way. Now I'm free on the pitch, I like to touch the ball. ""With Cristiano I changed my style, I played for him. I had someone who did double or triple my goals and I had to adapt. ""I thought it wouldn't cost me anything, I just had to change my way of playing and pass it on to him more. ""I put my goal scoring aside."" In Ronaldo's final season in the Spanish capital, Benzema only notched but five goals in 32 appearances but when he made a Â£99 million switch to Juventus in 2018, the Frenchman stepped up and became Real's main source of goals. With Ronaldo in Turin, he scored 21 goals in consecutive La Liga campaigns - with his strikers helping Zinedine Zidane's side to a 34th Spanish league title last term. Still, goals are not the be-all-and-end-all for Benzema, who idolised the great Ronaldo Nazario. Benzema: ""My father told me he just wanted goals, goals and goals. Now he understands my football and knows everything I do. People think the striker has to score goals but if he doesn't put them in, what happens? Doesn't he do anything else? R9 did everything, he was my model."" pic.twitter.com/vPwlvd9mpJ ""A striker has to now how to do lots of things, not just score goals,"" he added. ""I can score goals but, if I don't touch the ball for 90 minutes, that's a problem. ""If I'm on the field and I score okay but I want to show people more things and not just goals. I watched football for Ronaldo Nazario. I was watching and trying to imitate him. It was hard to clear... He was the best. I didn't see anything like it, there isn't."" ",positive,liverpool,0

The list compiled by football magazine FourFourTwo features some truly hapless footballers, but the man at No 50 is an undoubtedly great striker. Yet - judged purely on his wretched Premier League form - it's easy to see why Radamel Falcao deserves a spot. Loadingâ¦ It just gets worse after that, however. Culminating in No 1: a player who wasn't actually a professional footballer: Southampton's Ali Dia. The story is simply insane. ""Dia had been calling round a number of clubs claiming to be George Weah's cousin in 1995 - he had a trial at Coventry, and another at Bournemouth - both of whom swiftly turned him down when they saw him play,"" explain FourFourTwo. ""But Southampton boss Graeme Souness took the bait, and after an early injury to Matt Le Tissier he threw Dia into action against Leeds. The Senegalese forward managed 52 minutes of running around aimlessly before being hauled off again."" That was his entire top-flight career. At least Dia was free - which is more than can be said for second-place man Savio, who reportedly cost West Ham Â£9 million in 2009. The striker failed to score in 10 games before he was sold for a discount Â£3 million only six months later. Gaffe-prone goalkeeper Massimo Taibi - a name that would make any Man United fan shudder - is in third place. A Sunderland double (naturally) round out the top five: striker Milton Nunez and MLS legend Jozy Altidore. Chelsea wage snaffler Winston Bogarde also makes the top 10 (""I may be one of the worst buys in the history of the Premiership but I don't care,"" he said, so at least he's honest). Igor Stepanovs, described as ""the Latvian Titus Bramble"" is the highest Arsenal entry, while Liverpool's is South African forward Sean Dundee.

421,https://www.sportbible.com/football/best-midfielders-fifa-22-20210929,"39 Best Midfielders In FIFA 22: Career Mode CDM, CM & CAM","It's all well and good being solid at the back and having pace out wide, but the real glue that holds a team together is the midfield. There are plenty of great centre mids in the world, but we're basing this list of the best CDM, CM, and CAM players on their current and potential ability, as well as the longevity of the success they'll have at your club. We're looking for players with a long career ahead of them, so for the purposes of this list we're going for midfielders aged 28 and under. That's not to say you can't have a massive amount of success with the likes of N'Golo Kante, it's just that everyone knows he's the best holding midfielder in the world. You don't need us to tell you that. More guides in this series: It's hard to take a pick of the 'premium' CDMs in FIFA 22. Fabinho, Rodri, even older stars like Casemiro are all going to be amazing additions to any side. To overlook Kimmich would be utterly criminal, though. The guy is just amazing, all round. He can run for days, so you'll rarely have to rest him, he'll find himself in the perfect position for the tackle immediately, and has the technical ability to start attacking moves when the ball has been won. If you're building a blockbuster team of greats, Kimmich is the one. A physical powerhouse with a great deal of technical skill, Wilfred Ndidi is a fantastic CDM in FIFA 22. You can keep it simple, get the challenges in, and use him as a defensive rock to take the pressure off of your CBs, or you can bring him into the game a tad more. Ndidi can embark on surging runs from deep with his strong dribbling stats, before playing it wide or through for other players to latch onto. It's sometimes said that the pass before the assist is an underrated part of the game, and Ndidi is the sort of player who'll get you a whole lot of them. He's only 24 too, so expect him to keep rising to even further greatness. England's future captain Declan Rice had a great Euros. Working as an essential part of the double pivot with Kalvin Phillips, he displayed grit, passion, and physical prowess both on and off the ball. In FIFA 22, he's rated 82. It's an overall some might say is too low, but it won't stay that way for long. If you can get Declan Rice signed to your squad he'll swiftly develop into the rock of a holding midfielder he's destined to be. If you're looking for a player who is already the finished article, look no further than Frenkie de Jong. Barca's Dutch midfielder has 4 star skills, decent pace, and strong stats across the board. Aside from shooting on goal, de Jong has whatever you need in his locker. He's great on the attack as an advanced playmaker, but can be chucked back to CB if things get dicey too. Frenkie is the premium purchase who'll last your club a decade. Ajax's Ryan Gravenberch is a really strong all-rounder, with 4 star skills and weak foot, a good enough current overall rating to get a lot of starts at most clubs, and the potential to become one of the greatest central midfielders in the game. The world's biggest clubs are looking at him in real life right now, and it's easy to see why. Great in a holding midfield role or surging up the pitch to cause problems for defences, Gravenberch has the necessary ability for any role through the middle of the pitch. England's next superstar, Jude Bellingham is up there with the best buys in your FIFA 22 career. He's agile, physical and can run about for days. This'll only get better with more and more playing time - at just 18 he's got over a decade to reach that enormous potential. Remember, the potential overall rating isn't a hard ceiling if you're a good manager, and Jude Bellingham could grow an absolutely enormous amount very, very quickly. The Stockport Iniesta is a joy to use in FIFA 22. He nips around the attacking third, equally adept in spraying balls around the pitch and taking on challenges from defenders. Phil Foden has the potential to be rated 92 overall, so the sooner you're able to get him to that level, the better. It's hard to find a weakness in his game too. He might get muscled off the ball on occasion, but if you're using him correctly and playing to his many strengths, this won't happen at all. Chelsea's 22-year-old German attacking midfielder enjoys being the focal point of your attack. He's got 4 star skill moves and weak foot, as well as some excellent dribbling and ball control making him a great option to get the ball to in order to get your offence firing. He's surprisingly fast once he gets up to speed too, so look out for searching runs behind the opponent's back line and send through-balls his way. With time and development, Havertz is a superstar in the making. If you want the biggest impact, right now, United's Portuguese star Bruno Fernandes is the only option. At 26 he's well and truly in his prime, and will be able to continue at a high level for years to come. If you've ever watched him play for United, you'll know just what Bruno can do: everything. It's brought into FIFA too, so don't be afraid to drop perfect through balls onto your strikers' plate, or find space in the box to get a beautifully-hit shot on goal. He'll even keep growing in ability and contribute in defence when things get tricky. Chelsea's Champions League winning central midfielder can play in a number of positions across the centre of the pitch and even as a left winger if you need him. With finishing already at 79 and elite level passing, Mount's growth has a potential to reach and exceed 89. Wirtz is a creative midfielder, who at just 18 years of age looks to be the future of both his club and country. Four star skills and four star weak foot, the youngster has an incredibly high potential at 90. Nurture him correctly through training and game time, he'll become a staple of your team for years to come. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ However, PSG punched their ticket to the semi-finals thanks to the 3-3 aggregate scoreline across the quarter-finals. While Mauricio Pochettino's men failed to win at home, Neymar produced a dazzling performance against last season's Champions League winners. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting might have fired Bayern into the lead in the first half, but Neymar came very close to adding his name to the scoresheet. Neymar managed to hit the woodwork twice and even had three big chances to score for PSG before half-time. The 29-year-old Brazilian winger ensured on the night that Bayern didn't overlook the attacking threat that he and teammate Kylian Mbappe posed in the first half. The Neymar compilation showed why he deserved the praise, but fans equally lauded the former Barcelona star's performance on social media. One fan tweeted: ""Best I've seen Neymar in a big game for a long time at club level. Prefer to watch him for Brazil where he carries the team, but he's been nothing short of awesome tonight..."" Someone else boldly claimed: ""Neymar in full form is [the] best player in the world."" While a third posted: ""Could watch Neymar dance through players all day long."" And a fourth added: ""Neymar [is] probably the Ronaldinho of our generation. Change my mind."" PSG will now face the winner of Manchester City vs Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. City will clash with the German side at the Westfalenstadion on Wednesday in their second-leg quarter-final match. City defeated Dortmund 2-1 in the first-leg Champions League match at the Etihad. Meanwhile, Chelsea knocked Porto out of the Champions League and will face either Real Madrid or Liverpool in the semi-finals. The two-leg semi-final clashes will be played in April and May.

The 28-year-old Egyptian winger failed to make his initial impact in the Premier League in 2014 during his ill-fated spell at Chelsea. Loadingâ¦ Salah was loaned out to Roma before he made the switch permanent in 2016 as the Liverpool star shone during the 2016-17 campaign with the Italian side. The Egypt captain's excellent form caught the attention of current club Liverpool, who splashed out a then-club-record fee of Â£36.9m to sign him in 2017. Salah has remained an integral part of Liverpool's squad since his arrival at Anfield, forming a superb partnership with Mane and Roberto Firmino in the Reds' front three. The Daily Star compiled the star-studded list of wingers in the world right now, with the former Roma star beating out Bayern Munich's Serge Gnabry to the top spot. The newspaper pointed out that Salah has performed at an ""unbelievably high level for four seasons straight"" and he has ""made a mockery of those that have tried to stop his attacking advances."" Salah has continued to excel this season for Liverpool, despite Jurgen Klopp's men failing to defend the Premier League title. The Liverpool winger has made 47 appearances across all competitions this season and scored an impressive 29 times and registered five assists. Salah is still in contention for the Premier League Golden Boot as his 20-goal haul leaves him one shy of Tottenham striker Harry Kane in the goalscoring charts. Posted below are The Daily Star's picks for the 10 best wingers in world football right now. 10. Gerard Moreno (Villarreal) 9. Angel Di Maria (Paris Saint-Germain) 8. Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli) 7.

424,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-best-left-wingers-in-the-world-20210726,"âThe 10 Best Left-Wingers In The World Right Now, Named And Rankedâ","The final of Euro 2021 saw two of the world's best left-sided attacking midfielders tee-off in the shape of Raheem Sterling and Lorenzo Insigne. The pair were just two of the world-class wingers on display at the tournament, including a returning-to-form Eden Hazard and some of England's young talent. Here we pick our top 10 on the planet. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. All images are credit to PA Images. 10 Eden Hazard 2020/21 Season Stats: Since Eden Hazard joined Real Madrid for a reported Â£100million in 2019, it's fair to say the Spanish fans haven't been as lucky as fans of the Premier League. Injuries have robbed La Liga of watching the quicksilver Belgian for chunks of the last two seasons but Euro 2021 showed glimpses that he may be on his way back to form. When fit, his trademark runs from halfway can transform games as they did when winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a Europa League trophy at Stamford Bridge. 9 Lucas Ocampos 2020/21 Season Stats: An attacking force, Lucas Ocampos contributed to 26% of Sevilla's goals in 2019/20 and he added 14 himself. A versatile right-footer, last season, he was employed on the left 24 times in all competitions - where he scored all five of his goals and made all of his assists - and 11 on the right (10 as a forward, one as a defender). 8 Kingsley Coman 2020/21 Season Stats: Bayern Munich's right-footer can play either side of the pitch but from the left, his cuts inside tend to square up defenders in one on ones, allowing him to put in his quality crosses. He was joint sixth in assists in last season's Bundesliga and ninth in dribbles. He's played at PSG (where he was their youngest ever player at 16 years, eight months and four days), Juventus and Bayern Munich in his career and has won a league title every season since becoming a professional. 7 Jack Grealish 2020/21 Season Stats: Now you may not have heard this - presumably you've just returned from your holiday on Mars and missed all of ITV's England commentary - but Jack Grealish was the most fouled player in the Premier League last year. It's easy to understand why, with excellent control, acceleration and change of pace, his directness causes defenders fits. Used mainly by Gareth Southgate as an impact sub, his appearance in England's Round of 16 match against Germany turned the tide as he was involved in both goals. Only Kevin de Bruyne made more key passes in the Premier League in 2020/21. 6 Phil Foden 2020/21 Season Stats: ""I didn't meet Messi at 17 years old like when I met Phil,"" says Pep Guardiola. ""And at that age, I never saw a player with this potential."" High praise indeed for the Manchester City star who created 75 chances for his side in 2020/21. In April this year, Foden became only the second player under 21 after Kylian Mbappe in 2017 to score in both legs of a Champions League quarter-final (v Borussia Dortmund) after Kylian Mbappe. And his pair of goals against Iceland at Wembley in November 2020 made him the youngest England player in history to score multiple goals in a game at Wembley. 5 Yannick Carrasco 2020/21 Season Stats: Yannick Carrasco would have come to the attention of the casual football fan after his stand-out performance on the left for Belgium against Russia at Euro 2020/21. Using his pace and trickery, he propelled Belgium forward on the way to a 3-0 win in their campaign opener. Tall for a winger, the 27-year-old completed the sixth most dribbles in La Liga and finished 10th in key passes ahead of the likes of Mikel Oyarzabal, Luka Modric and David Silva. 4 Sadio Mane 2020/21 Season Stats: Sadio Mane's athleticism and off-ball movement make him perfect fit for Jurgen Klopp's system at Liverpool and the German boss has described his left-winger as ""a complete player"". A consistent goal threat (64 Premier League goals since 2016/17, including 22 in 2018/19). Mane averaged 2.7 shots per game (which was sixth in the Premier League) and averaged the sixth-most dribbles. He's made 75 appearances and scored 23 goals for Senegal. 3 Neymar Jr 2020/21 Season Stats: Is age catching up to the Brazilian maestro? A year or two ago, he'd have been at the top of this list by some distance but multiple injuries took their toll last season, restricting him to just 1,417 minutes of Ligue 1 action. When fit, he was his usual lethal self, putting away nine goals and adding five assists on his 15 appearances and he led the league in dribbles. The sixth highest-paid athlete in the world, he's the third most popular sportsman on social media (282million combined followers). 2 Raheem Sterling 2020/21 Season Stats: Raheem Sterling left a frustrating domestic season behind him instantly after reporting for international tournament duty. The Manchester City winger scored England's first three goals at Euro 2021 and helped lead Gareth Southgate's young side to a historic final at Wembley. His 28 Premier League starts, goals and assists were all his lowest contributions since his second season at City in 2016/17 but for England this summer, he's been reborn. His 248 sprints at Euro 2021 were more than all but Joakim Maelhe, and 63 of them came in the semi-final, the highest total of any player in the last-four games. 1 Lorenzo Insigne 2020/21 Season Stats: Napoli's pint-sized captain carried his relentless form from the 2020/21 season in Serie A into the summer tournament with finalists Italy. The 30-year-old has been the creative inspiration for Roberto Mancini's Azzuri side from the left flank. He led Napoli in scoring, key passes and dribbles, while he topped Serie A in shots from outside the box. At Euro 2021, no player was more proactive at getting into the opposition penalty area - 14 times - and his efforts have been rewarded with two goals in five games, including the screamer that won the semi-final against Belgium.

England boss Gareth Southgate has some difficult decisions to make ahead of the tournament, which begins on November 21, with there set to be fierce competition for places in his squad. Rashford and Sancho face a battle to be on the plane to Qatar after they were dropped for last monthâs friendlies against Switzerland and the Ivory Coast. Loadingâ¦ But Crouch, who scored 22 goals in 42 appearances for England, believes both players should be included in Southgate's final squad for the tournament. Speculating over potential selection headaches for the England boss, Crouch wrote in The Daily Mail: âThe biggest is Harry Kane's understudy. âTammy Abraham is a shout, a possible wildcard given what he has produced at Roma, as is Ollie Watkins. âYou only need one of those guys behind Kane to offer something different to the rest. But Dominic Calvert-Lewin edges this presently as he loves to attack the sort of crosses our wide men whip in. âAs we sit here now I would also choose Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, on reputation more than anything and a lack of options beneath them. âIf Emile Smith-Rowe is banging them in at Arsenal next season he goes ahead of them, but beyond that there is not quite the depth.â Crouch believes England could play a back three at the tournament, which would allow Southgate to include Kyle Walker, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Reece James in his squad. âHarry Maguire has never let England down either and could benefit from England persisting with a back three,â Crouch added. âI'd go with Kyle Walker on the right of that three personally. It allows us to choose the best trio of right backs as well, with both Reece James and Trent Alexander-Arnold allotted places on Crouch Tours. âAll three are versatile and there are few better in world football.â FIFA is expected to announce that team squads for the World Cup will be expanded to 26 for the tournament in Qatar and Crouch has named Ben White and Conor Gallagher as the two players to benefit, if the change is confirmed. England will come up against the United States, Iran and one of either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine in Group B, and Crouch believes the Three Lions will have no problem reaching the knockout stage of the tournament. Loadingâ¦ âEngland should breeze through and will not be scared of anybody,â he added. âFrance are the only really menacing opposition. You'd prefer to avoid them and it's not ideal that a worst-case scenario could see us play them in the quarter-finals. Let's not think about that.â Goalkeepers: Aaron Ramsdale, Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope Defenders: Kyle Walker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady, Luke Shaw, Ben Chilwell Midfielders: Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount Forwards: Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho Extra two: Conor Gallagher, Ben White Possible wildcards: Emile Smith-Rowe, James Maddison ",positive,liverpool,0

To put his record into further perspective, the Brazilian scored 77 free-kicks during a 20 year career, scoring for the likes of Vasco da Gama, Al-Gharafa and his hometown club Sport Club do Recife. Juninho will no doubt go down in history as the best free-kick taker of his generation, scoring double the amount of Andrea Pirlo, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. I mean, just look at this compilation of his very best strikes. His technique and accuracy is something else. It's Juninho Pernambucano's birthday, so here he is nonchalantly pinging free-kicks like he's scratching his arse on a Sunday afternoon.pic.twitter.com/SwmAWor1cX The only person that even comes close to the Lyon legend is goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni, who netted 61 career free-kicks. The former Sao Paulo man holds the record for the most direct free-kicks scored by a player with one club. But the laser-accurate Pernambucano reigns supreme in the all-time list. Italian legend Andrea Pirlo admitted to idolising the man from Recife, in his 2014 autobiography, 'I Think Therefore I play', as he wrote: ""During his time at Lyon, that man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things. He'd lay it on the ground, twist his body into a few strange shapes, take his run-up and score. ""He never got it wrong. Never. I checked out his stats and realised it couldn't just be chance. He was like an orchestra conductor who'd been assembled upside down, with the baton held by his feet instead of his hands. ""He'd give you the thumbs up by raising his big toe - somebody at Ikea was having a good laugh the day they put him together."" But what does he put his incredible free-kicks down to? The Brazilian spoke to Four Four Two in December about when he realised he was a free-kick specialist, and his technique. ""I started by copying free-kicks taken by Marcelinho, who played for Corinthians. He was one of my inspirations, and the first player I had ever seen hit the ball head on and make it dance in the air."" he told the publication. ""That tells you that the technique isn't mine, either! Didi, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 1958 and 1962, was doing it back then, too. Everyone since has just been tweaking the formula. ""I was always great at shooting, but as a child I didn't have enough power to score free-kicks. I played futsal until I was 13 and didn't really score much, but it was around then that I started to take some free-kicks. ""The wall was too close, though, so it was rare that I'd hit the goal. It wasn't until I got to France that I mastered my technique."" He scored 131 goals in 507 appearances for a host of clubs, making a name for himself as the free-kick king. The midfielder will go down in history, for sure, as the best set-piece taker of all time. Do you agree with that statement? Let us know in the comments. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Spain international isn't known for his distribution or building from the back but he had the chance to do so against Norwich. Diogo Dalot played the ball back to de Gea who had time to pick out captain Maguire to his right. DDG saw Maguire on his right and decided to kick the ball other way. Good decision ð¯ https://t.co/f0hbRmrkDS Instead, he saw Teemu Pukki pressing and decided to kick it out for a throw-in. Cameras then caught a furious de Gea looking to be in conversation with Victor Lindelof before turning his back. Maguire is comfortable in possession but is having a poor season by his high standards. Supporters believe de Gea made a conscious effort to put the ball out of play as a 'safe' option. One commented: ""Don't blame de Gea at all for that."" Another added: ""I'd have probably done the same thing."" A third put: ""Didn't think of it this way but yeah."" While someone tweeted: ""People don't get that this thing matters a lot. When you can't trust your defender, a lot is wrong already."" Cristiano Ronaldo's 50th club hat-trick ensured United remain in the top four race. The 37-year-old turned home his first of the game seven minutes in after a mix-up in the Canaries defence, before heading home a second after 32 minutes. Kieran Dowell would half the deficit just before halftime and Pukki converted an equaliser early in the second half. De Gea kept United level with a fine save from Milot Rashica before Ronaldo stepped up to rifle home a free-kick. It was his first free-kick back in England and his first in general since July 2020. United interim manager Ralf Rangnick paid tribute to de Gea's performance despite Ronaldo's hat-trick. He explained per Manchester Evening News: ""The 2-0 lead shouldâve made life easier for us. ""But it didnât because we didnât defend well. Both goals we shouldâve defended much better and David de Gea kept us in the game with a brilliant save. ""If not for David De Gea we could have been 3-2 down, and then probably even lost the game. This should not happen. All respect to Norwich, I know there are no easy games in the league, but we have to defend better than we did today. ""Even more so if we think about the next two or three games."" United sit fifth in the league and return to action on Tuesday evening against bitter rivals Liverpool. They're three points outside the top four following Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal's defeats on Saturday. ",positive,liverpool,1

Chelsea reached the Champions League final for the third time in their history after beating 13-time champions Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate, with Kante absolutely instrumental over the two legs. He covered every blade of grass in the 1-1 draw at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium last week, before producing another Man of the Match display as Chelsea won 2-0 in the second leg courtesy of goals from Timo Werner and Mason Mount. While fasting for Ramadan, the World Cup winner buzzed around the pitch and made key tackles and interceptions as per usual - Luka Modric and Toni Kroos unable to influence the game as they normally would. The former Leicester City midfielder played a crucial role in both goals. It was his superb link-up in midfield that led to Werner heading home the rebound after Kai Havertz's deft dink kissed the crossbar. Then, in the 84th minute, he raced to win the second ball before playing in Christian Pulisic, who picked out Mount to set up an-English final with Manchester City. Loadingâ¦ Kante was rightly awarded another Man of the Match award for his marvellous display. And he showed just why he's the most humble footballer around when he drove away in his Mini. In footage posted on social media, the Frenchman was in his modest vehicle while Chelsea fans lined the streets and sang his name in sensational scenes. No matter what team you support, you just can't help but love Kante. Kante could no doubt afford an Aston Martin or Range Rover but being a man of simple pleasures, he prefers cruising around in a little mini. Explaining why he bought the Mini, Kante told BBC: ""I was at Leicester City and it was my first car in England. One person advised a Mini, I tried and I liked it so I bought one."" Kante purchased the white Â£20,000 Mini upon his arrival in England in 2015 and has driven it ever since - even turning up to training in it when there was a dent in the front wheel arch. What a man.

The Euro 2020 Group D decider was poised at 1-1 when Bruno Petkovic delivered a deft touch, then fed the ball to Modric. Running on to the pass at the edge of the box, the Real Madrid star unleashed an outrageous finish: hitting the ball with the outside of his right boot and curling it into the top corner. Sheer genius. The 35-year-old Ballon d'Or winner showed he's still got the class as he put Croatia in pole position to qualify for the last 16. Ivan Perisic then made the game 3-1 with a towering header off the post as Croatia - inspired by their talisman's strike - began to take control of the tie. Shout for a goal of the tournament that. Absurd. https://t.co/m2LMLn1w0s that's sexy https://t.co/CLKw2i6y5V The power on the outside of his right foot, Brilliant! What a baller https://t.co/1E09zmtYwz Earlier in the game Nikola Vlasic had put Croatia into a first-half lead, then Callum McGregor equalised before the break, scoring Scotland's first goal of Euro 2020. However the hope of Scotland winning and qualifying for the last 16 was snuffed out by a moment of sheer brilliance from Luka Modric. Luka Modric at the age of 35 is an absolute pleasure to watch.

The two sides played out a hugely entertaining first half at Wembley, which somehow ended goalless. Liverpool came close to taking the lead after half an hour. Loadingâ¦ Naby Keita, who started the game after Thiago Alcantara was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up, let fly from 25 yards out but his shot was well stopped by Mendy. The Chelsea goalkeeper could only parry Keitaâs shot back into play, however, allowing his Senegal team-mate Sadio Mane the chance to put Liverpool ahead. Mane fired a shot on target but Mendy showed incredible reflexes to get back to his feet and deflect the ball over the bar. AMAZING DOUBLE SAVE!!Take a bow Mendy ð pic.twitter.com/X9FIIj8gtN ""I can't believe Mendy got across to that!,â said Sky Sports commentator Gary Neville. Chelsea fans on social media were equally impressed with Mendy, who was playing his first match in the Carabao Cup this season in place of Kepa Arrizabalaga. âSave of the season by Mendy there.

The Reds served up a superb set-piece routine that paid dividends in the second half and looked to have brought the game's first goal.

However, the Dutch defender strayed offside and after referee Stuart Attwell went to the VAR monitor, the goal was chalked off. While Van Dijk was not directly involved in the sense that he didn't touch the ball, his action was deemed to be an act of affecting the play. The incident was eerily similar to one involving Harry Maguire against Burnley earlier this month. Same thing happened at Burnley recently with Harry Maguire #CarabaoCupFinal Exactly the same situation as Harry Maguire at Burnley. Raphael Varane headed home against the Clarets at Turf Moor but United skipper Maguire was in an offside position and adjudged to have interfered by blocking off Jay Rodriguez. Maguire disagreed with the decision and said at the time he didn't think Rodriguez ""would have affected the goal"". He told BT Sport: ""He said it wasn't a foul. Interfering with play, I don't know. I actually made my run earlier and it didn't end up being a little bit of a block. I don't think Rodriguez would have affected the goal from which Rafa scored."" ",positive,liverpool,2

Every player scored, including Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, until opposite number Kepa Arrizabalaga smashed his over the bar to give Jurgen Klopp's side the win. Kepa had taken the place of Edouard Mendy just before the end of extra time in a repeat scenario of the UEFA Super Cup in the summer. Konate, a summer signing from RB Leipzig, got his hands on his first medal and trophy in Liverpool colours. But the Frenchman enjoyed it a little too much.

Chelsea took on Manchester City at Wembley in 2019 and the game finished 0-0 after extra-time. Just before it went to penalties, Kepa went down with an injury and Sarri looked ready to replace him with Willy Caballero. Kepa caught his number on the fourth official's board and gestured he was fine to continue - shocking his Blues teammates and the coaching staff. Sarri stormed off down the tunnel and Kepa remained on the pitch - with City managing to win the game on penalties. The Spaniard has explained the entire misunderstanding in a column for the Players' Tribune, explaining: ""It was all a big misunderstanding. ""Manchester City were dominating the game in extra time and there was barely any time left until penalties. ""After making a save, I felt something in my leg and I called for the physio to make sure it was nothing. Above all, though, I wanted to make sure that we as a team could catch our breath. ""Suddenly, I saw that the coach, Maurizio Sarri, had sent Willy Caballero to warm up. ""He thought I couldn't go on. My intention, right or wrong, had only been to waste time to help the team. I didn't have any serious problem that was going to keep me from continuing to play. ""I tried to signal that I was ok, that I wasn't injured. But we were at Wembley in front of more than 80,000 people, so of course Sarri didn't understand me. ""When the fourth official raised the board, clearly I should have come off, and I'm sorry I didn't."" Many accused the 26-year-old of disrespecting his manager and lamented his poor attitude. But it's clear to see he regretted the entire situation and has apologised to fans and colleagues alike. He continued: ""I was wrong, and I am sorry for everyone who was involved: for Maurizio Sarri, who it seemed like I had undermined in public; for Willy, a teammate and a great professional; and for all my teammates and Chelsea fans who had to put up with everything - all the noise that was generated during the game and then in the days after. ""Inside the club it was no big deal. I had a chat with the boss, we talked about how we had each seen the situation, and we cleared the air. After that I got dropped for one game, but a week later I was back in the team. ""I remember playing a great game against Fulham, and that was it. A couple of months later we knocked Frankfurt out of the Europa League semifinals and I saved two penalties in the shootout. Internally, everything was fine again. ""But outside the club, it got out of control. ""When I picked up my phone in the dressing room after the League Cup final, I realised that I had become worldwide news. For the next three or four days it didn't stop. It was overwhelming. And clearly, most people who saw the pictures thought that I had disrespected Maurizio. ""I felt misunderstood, because it had never been my intention to snub the coach. I had only tried to tell him I was O.K.. I tried to explain this to the press, but I couldn't.""

Loadingâ¦ Klopp will currently be worrying which of his team is available to play in the FA Cup this weekend, following the postponement of Liverpool's Carabao Cup semi final on Thursday. After that though the German has to work out how to replace Mane and Salah in his first choice XI for the next few weeks, whilst they're at the African Cup of Nations, while trying not to lose any more ground on league leaders Manchester City. Whilst Diogo Jota, Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino will be important to their chances of keeping up their form, Klopp will need some sort of reinforcement. It looks like that will come in the form of Porto forward Luis Diaz, with the Sun claiming that the forward is 'close' to a move to Anfield this month. The report says that Dias has a Â£67 million release clause but that the Premier League title challengers are hoping to get him for slightly less. They expect the 24-year-old to cost closer to Â£60 million, and his arrival is only imminent because of AFCON, as Klopp originally preferred to wait for the summer to sign the forward. Liverpool were likely to have to freshen up their forward line in the coming years, with Mane, Salah and Firmino all nearing or in their 30s and having played as a trio for a few years now. The introduction of Jota was first part of that boost to their attacking ranks, with the former Wolves striker now arguably ahead of Firmino in the pecking order. Dias is seen as the next part of that, and the perfect back up to Mane and Salah, having impressed the manager during two games against the English team in this season's Champions League. The Colombian, who signed for the Primera Liga side in 2019, has scored 12 goals in the league so far from just 15 games, and grabbed another two in Europe. No one scored more goals than him at last summer's Copa America, with Lionel Messi level with him on four goals but winning the Golden Boot due to having more assists than Dias. With the team now nine points behind Manchester City and potentially a couple more league games before their two main forwards are back at Anfield, Liverpool will be hoping any new signing can hit the ground running.

Wolves,"Ederson got so bored in net, he went in midfield for a moment but Pep Guardiola wasn't happy with his keeper. In the 86th minute, Ederson rushed out of his goal to intercept Adama Traore. He then carried on his venture by tackling Morgan Gibbs-White. He ended up in midfield, and completed three passes. The Brazilian keeper clearly wanted some action after literally doing nothing between the sticks. Though Pep Guardiola's reaction says it all. He looked furious on the touchline and didn't seem too pleased in his post-match interview. Just interviewed Pep Guardiola. He was not impressed with Ederson trying to come out and play in midfield towards the end. I asked him about it and the answer was:""No... no, no, no, no.... no.""#bbcfootball Ederson joining City's midfield for a moment got people talking on social media. :camera_with_flash: ' Pep's reaction to Ederson's halfway line adventure. :unamused: pic.twitter.com/rqMitN1h0w Pep's face after that Ederson stunt :joy: Best part of that by far was Ferna giving it back to Ederson Ederson's body language then. Like an indifferent teenager who just can't be arsed, all 'meh - whatever', just stood 40 yards from goal playing 1-2s without a care in the world. The man is a freak. A genuinely crazy bastard. And I love him. Big fan of Ederson coming up to the half way line and playing a few one touch passes because he's bored. City secured all-three points in an easy victory. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring and he then doubled his sides lead from the spot. The visitors were also reduced to 10-men after Willy Boly received a straight red card for a reckless tackle on Bernardo Silva. City got a third in the second-half thanks to an own-goal from Conor Coady. Pep's charges are now four points off league leaders Liverpool. ",positive,liverpool,1

The former Benfica man has displayed a frightening confidence on the ball with his passing out from the back and even chipped in with two assists last season for Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. What's more, he got so bored on one occasion against Wolves in January that he rushed out from his goal and sat in midfield for a bit, exchanging three passes. But how would the 25-year old fare if he played outfield for 90 minutes in a game? Well, Ederson gave us a glimpse of what he's capable of in a charity game he organised in his hometown alongside Brazilian singer MC GuimÃª. Wearing the No.10 shirt and playing in the same side as his teammate Gabriel Jesus, Ederson scored twice in a 5-4 victory for his side. First he justified just why he's desperate to take a penalty for City when he coolly stroked home from 12 yards in the first half, and he followed it up by completing mugging off the opposition goalkeeper with some ridiculous footwork in the second. The aforementioned highlights have only made his even more desperate to see Ederson in midfield in a competitive fixture. The former Rio Ave man, who idolises the great Rogerio Ceni, used to play as a full-back but realised it wasn't quite for him so asked to have a go in goal - which turned out to be the correct decision. But he also had vast experience playing futsal to help him grow into the world's best distributing goalkeeper today. ""I started playing as a full-back, but it's difficult to chase quick forwards, especially for me that I'm not particularly quick!"" he told The Telegraph. ""I asked my manager if I could switch my position to the goal. When I did my first training session, it was love at first sight. I liked it since minute one and then my career as a goalkeeper started. But I think my footwork is influenced from having started as a full-back. Also I played futsal and that helped me a lot. ""I used to play as a 'goleiro-linha', it's a goalkeeper that plays a lot with his feet. So we used to attack with five players and defend with five players. From that period, I had my shooting skills and good footwork."" ",positive,liverpool,0

The club partnered with Nivea Men UK for their 'Dear Liverpool FC' series, and the latest instalment sees the club facilitate a wonderful moment between Libbie Booker and Ethan Beckley. Libbie's family wrote to the club asking them to 'do something amazing' for Ethan, who answered her call for a life-saving bone marrow transplant to cure her leukaemia. She was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 13, and relapsed again after two years of chemotherapy treatment. The pair had previously exchanged messages where Ethan's love of Liverpool came to light. He thought that he was just meeting Libby at Anfield, before casually crossing paths with the Reds' shot-stopper, Alisson. Alisson was then present when Libbie and Ethan embraced on the pitch, and the latter was reduced to tears after it was revealed that he would be returning to Anfield for an all-expenses-paid VIP experience at the stadium for an upcoming match. Meanwhile, Nivea agreed to pay for Libbie's student accommodation for the year, as she trains to become a nurse. They also agreed to promote awareness of the Anthony Nolan charity on their channels, which helps to save the lives of those living with blood cancer. It's wonderful to see just how football can be used as a power for good and bring people together. ",positive,liverpool,3

Salah's strike, which showed incredible speed, flair and power, was one of the best goals of the season and worthy of some classic commentary, which Drury brilliantly delivered. ""Salah... escaped Cancelo,"" he said. ""Oh that's brilliant from Salah! And still... Salah! Oh sensational! Absolutely sensational! Stellar! That is PlayStation football! It's ridiculous. You cannot do that without a joystick."" Liverpool fans were full of praise for Drury's words after the match. ""This man is a poet,"" one Red tweeted.  ""Just love Drury,"" another said. ""An absolute legend."" ""Peter Drury is a vibe,"" a fellow Kopite commented. This is not the first time Drury has received universal acclaim for his work behind the mic. In 2018, he was commended for his commentary of Roma's stunning comeback against Barcelona in the Champions League, with one fan arguing that 'this commentary deserves the Ballon d'Or'.  ""It is a Greek from Mount Olympus!"" Drury exclaimed after Kostas Manolas put his side 3-0 up and thus ahead on away goals. ""Who has come to the seven hills of Rome and pulled off a miracle."" Unfortunately for Liverpool, Drury still had time to deliver another exquisite narration in the last 15 minutes of yesterday's match, after Kevin de Bruyne fired home an equaliser with 9 minutes to play. Chaces to take all three points fell for both teams, with Fabinho denied by a sensational Rodri block and Gabriel Jesus cornered well by Andy Robertson. The result maintains Jurgen Klopp's side's unbeaten start to the new season and leaves them in 2nd place, a point and position ahead of Pep Guardiola's champions. ",positive,liverpool,3

Rafael Benitez's side have showed early promising signs during his short tenure and have won two of their opening three matches and remain unbeaten. Burnley, meanwhile, have failed to pick up a win so far this season, suffering defeats against both Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool. The Clarets will want to get points on the board early and avoid the potential of getting dragged into a relegation scrap, however, Everton harbour their own aspirations of challenging for a European place. COMEONYOUBLUES! ðµâªï¸#EVEBUR pic.twitter.com/2jpbkN62sX Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Everton vs Burnley to get your teeth stuck into. Everton are 4/6 to win, with Burnley priced at 9/2 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 13/5. Prediction: 2-1 (7/1) First Goalscorer: Demarai Gray (6/1) Having scored in just two of his previous 32 appearances, Demarai Gray has founded the back of the net twice in his three appearances for Everton. His creativity and flair could offer one or two issues for Sean Dyche's Burnley and we're backing the 25-year-old to draw first blood tonight. To Score 2+ Goals: Everton (10/11) Everton have scored at least twice in each league match so far this campaign and there are signs that Benitez is instilling the consistency that the Merseyside outfit need. As a result of their recent form, we're backing the Toffees to score at least twice again here tonight, especially with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison both in hot form. Headed Shot On Target: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (5/6) Calvert-Lewin has been in excellent form for Everton over the past year and has proven himself to be almost unstoppable in the air. He scored a header against Southampton on the opening day of the season and thereâs no reason why he canât repeat that feat again tonight. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Calvert-Lewin was forced to withdraw from the England squad over the international break due to a quadricep problem, but Benitez has revealed that the striker could feature here. There is also optimism thatSeamus Colemanwill be available, whileYerry MinaandBen Godfreycould also be in contention, butFabian DelphandJames Rodriguezare expected to remain sidelined. ShouldDwight McNeilfeature, he will become the youngest player to play 100 Premier League games for Burnley at just 21 years and 295 days of age.

Well, football fan Alex Taylor experienced those levels of pain and disappointment during trips to see Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi play live. The 24-year old first booked flights in the hope of seeing Messi weave his magic at the Nou Camp in October, he and his friend Josh Patterson buying tickets for the La Liga game against Sevilla and the Champions League visit of Inter Milan a few days later. 12 minutes in and Messi had set up Philippe Coutinho for the opening goal and then scored the second himself. It was all going swimmingly. Mere minutes later, however, the Argentine suffered a nasty injury to his arm and was forced off early in the 4-2 win. Decked in his Blaugrana colours, Alex had flown nearly 700 miles to realise his dream of watching Messi up close and personal but 14 minutes in and it had become a nightmare. ""When Messi went down it was horrible,"" he told SPORTbible. ""Everyone in the stadium went silent and then chants of 'Messssssssi, Messsssssi' rang round - willing him to his feet. But it was obvious... he wasn't getting up. One of the worst feelings of my life. Heart-break."" Messi, with his arm in a sling, then had to watch the 2-0 win over Inter with his son Thiago in the stands and missed the 5-1 El Clasico thrashing of Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Loadingâ¦ Alex had enjoyed the experience of seeing the mighty Barcelona and even said he only needed 14 minutes to further illustrate his view that Messi is the greatest of all-time. But still crestfallen from how things had panned out, a few months down the line and the former Staffordshire University student had decided to turn his attentions to the other five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. Josh was once again aboard the trip for Turin, while his other pal Dale Hillhouse also got in on the act. Flights, tickets and accommodation was all arranged for the three to watch Serie A leaders Juventus host Empoli at the Allianz Stadium. Yet, just a couple of weeks after Bianconeri tickets were purchased, disaster struck for a second time during the dreaded international break. Playing for Portugal, Ronaldo pulled up with a muscle injury in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Serbia and was therefore ruled out for the next game for his club. What's more, Douglas Costa, Sami Khedira, Juan Cuadrado, Andrea Barzagli and Paulo Dybala were all sidelined for the fixture. You couldn't write it. Having only just got the game in time for kick-off because of protests in the city causing huge disruption to public transport, Alex and his mates did get to be part of a roar for young Moise Kean's winner in the 72nd minute But the fact that he had seen Messi for just a quarter of an hour and then didn't even get to appreciate the dollops of gel on Ronaldo's hair, has him wondering whether he is cursed. ""My plan now as a Manchester United fan is to go back to Barcelona next week and get Messi injured again before the Champions League game in April,"" he joked. ""They'll have to play the under 23's against us with my luck. Everyone will be injured. Probably best for Alex to hold off on booking flights to Paris to see Neymar and Mbappe, isn't it? We all know how the story ends... ",positive,liverpool,0

As United cleared an Arsenal corner in the 88th minute, they sensed a chance to counterattack, already 3-2 up at the time. Loadingâ¦ Jadon Sancho dribbled almost the full length of the pitch before squaring for Bruno Fernandes - one of the goalscorers. The Portugal international struck a weak shot against Gabriel, meaning United didn't extend their lead. But Unseen by Sancho and by most of the Arsenal defence was Ronaldo, who had busted a gut to belt it down the left flank, offering support. As soon the ball was played not to him but to Fernandes, he leant down and took a breather, visibly struggling with hamstring pain. He came off just seconds later with a hamstring injury. ""He'll need to phone Manchester cabs!""Despite being injured, Cristiano Ronaldo bust his gut to join Man Utd's counter-attack. Elite mentality! #PLonPrime #MUNARS pic.twitter.com/Zk138plYDn It was a moment that just exemplified the United legend's elite mentality. There is little chance of Ronaldo still being the top scorer in men's international football history - along him holding most of his other ridiculous records - did he not possess such an elite, professional mentality. The biggest names at Manchester United were saying before his arrival that they can't wait to see how the Portugal talisman trains. That says it all. While more players have scored higher numbers of goals - many more goals, in fact - Ronaldo's double against Arsenal were his 800th and 801st top-level goals. He is the first player in the history of the sport to score that number of goals at the elite level. The second-half double took his personally career tally against the Gunners up to eight goals. United supporters now have a slightly uncomfortable wait on their hands as they prepare to find out how badly injured their No 7 is. However, it did seem like the sort of muscle twinge older players get from time to time, rather than a pulled hamstring which might be more serious. Ronaldo now has six Premier League goals this season. Only Mohamed Salah, Jamie Vardy, Diogo Jota and Sadio ManÃ© have more. Words by Dom Smith ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ There was some surprise on Sunday afternoon when Carrick, in charge for only the second time after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking last week, decided to drop Ronaldo to the bench. It's a rarity for the five time Ballon d'Or winner not to start, and Solskjaer was criticised from all sides, even from Sir Alex Ferguson, when he did the same against Everton earlier in the season. However, talking on Sky Sports, Liverpool legend Carragher felt the temporary boss had to do it, in order to prove that he isn't the same as Solskjaer. ""I think he had to do that to be honest,"" the former England defender said pre match. ""Even when you're part of a coaching set up, everyone has different views on the team or how the team should be set up.

He will be pleased how that game [Villarreal] went."" Whilst Carragher clearly felt the decision not to pick Real Madrid's all time top goalscorer was Carrick's, fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville didn't agree. The United legend wasn't on commentary or punditry duty on Sunday but took to social media to explain his theory that it was actually Ralf Rangnick who picked the team. Neville argued that the pressing from the front suited the incoming interim boss far more than Carrick, and there has been talk Ronaldo could struggle to get into the German's starting XI when he moved to Manchester. United were pegged back for much of the first half at Stamford Bridge, and failed to really have much impact in Chelsea's half. However Carrick clearly inspired them with his words at half time and the away side started to look more threatening in the second period. They took a surprise lead in the 50th minute, thanks to Jorginho's disastrous attempt at a clearance. Jadon Sancho ran onto the ball unopposed and slotted past Edouard Mendy. After Ronaldo replaced Sancho, due to injury, the Blues equalised through a Jorginho penalty and the game ended 1-1, only after Antonio Rudiger blasted a brilliant chance over the bar in the final minute of injury time.

Loadingâ¦ Rangnick is set to become the club's interim manager for the rest of the season following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking on Sunday. The German coach has a reputation across Europe for having a clear philosophy and manner he wants his teams to play - which could be a disaster for Ronaldo. When asked if he would sign Ronaldo or rival Lionel Messi back in 2016, Rangnick replied: ""It would be absurd to think that it could work with them here [Leipzig]. ""They are both too old and too expensive."" Since those comments were made, Ronaldo has won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid and moved on to Juventus and United respectively. Messi, meanwhile, carried Barcelona for a number of years before his shock transfer to Paris Saint-Germain during the summer. This season has seen Ronaldo be a standout performer for United despite their struggles domestically. Ronaldo has scored four goals in nine Premier League appearances and six in five in the Champions League. Scoring in every Champions League game so far means it's a record for a player in an English side. Rangnick is set to stay on for two years in a 'consultancy role' at Old Trafford as the club attempt to restructure at the top. The 63-year-old famously helped Hoffenheim reach the Bundesliga while overseeing the Red Bull system's rise, while also managing Leipzig over two separate stints. It's an appointment that has many fans excited, but some United players are said to be 'unhappy' with how the deal was conducted. News of Rangnick being drafted in by United emerged prior to the players actually being made aware of the situation. There was no word from officials in person or in the United WhatsApp chat as a deal was completed very quickly. Michael Carrick will take charge of Sunday's game with Chelsea and could be in charge for the midweek clash against Arsenal.

After being unveiled as a PSG player, Messi met many of his teammates and took part in his first training session on Thursday. He linked up with Mbappe, who welcomed him to the club with a post on Instagram and shared pictures of the pair embracing. Messi has already expressed excitement over the opportunity to play in a devastating front three alongside Mbappe and his close friend Neymar. But according to Gazzetta Dello Sport, Mbappe has a very different feeling and is ""bothered"" about the sensational capture of Messi, who has signed a two-year contract with the option of a third. A world star in his own right, it's said the 22-year-old is worried he might end up being in the shadow of Messi and Neymar, who were part of that glorious Barcelona trident alongside Luis Suarez. Loadingâ¦ The World Cup winner joined PSG from Monaco in a Â£163 million move and has developed into one of the most exciting attackers around, scoring an incredible 132 goals in 172 appearances for the club. His future in the French capital is very much up in the air, however. Mbappe has a year remaining on his PSG deal and continues to be linked with a switch to Real Madrid. In fact, AS say PSG expect to lose Mbappe for free next summer and, in a quite sensational plan, want to bring in Cristiano Ronaldo as his replacement. It's claimed Mbappe and Real have said ""I do"" to one another in private. During the press conference for Messi's unveiling, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was asked about Mbappe's situation and was adamant he would be staying put. ""Everyone knows the future of Mbappe. He is a PSG player,"" he said. ""Kylian is very competitive, he wants to win, he has publicly said that he does not want to leave the team and there are no doubts or excuses of any other kind.

Loadingâ¦ But the seven-time Ballon d'Or' winner's teammates are well aware of what he can do with a football at his feet. A video on YouTube from a couple of weeks ago has garnered just short of 4 million views thanks to some utter pre-match brilliance from Messi. Ahead of the 1-0 Ligue One win over Rennes, where Mbappe scored the only goal in the 93rd minute, the World Cup winner was left in awe by Messi's quality. A slew of players were taking free-kicks when Messi decided to put on a masterclass. The Argentine is easily the best set-piece taker in world football and he curled two efforts into the top bins with perfect precision. And Mbappe was in utter disbelief, with he and midfielder Marco Verratti both producing superb facial expressions. You'll notice there was a little finger point from Messi, who knew exactly where he was going to put the ball. His accuracy from dead-ball situations is simply ridiculous. He's scored 58 free-kicks in his career - 50 for Barcelona and eight for Argentina - from all different ranges and angles using the same meticulous preparation and effective technique. Messi's leg when taking a free-kick has an angle of 50 degrees. He plants almost his entire boot on the ground before hitting the ball, giving him stability and control in the shot. Then, to improve his accuracy, Messi arches his shoulders and chest to caress the ball, hunching his body into a more compact position. In recent years defenders have even started scrambling back to the goal-line, which is perhaps the biggest compliment to Messi's free-kick prowess. He's yet to score one for PSG but you sense it's coming soon. ",positive,liverpool,0

Mbappe has enjoyed a stellar career to date after already winning the World Cup, four French titles and three French Cups at the tender age of 22, but Ibrahimovic says the Frenchman can push himself further. ""I love Mbappe but he isn't doing enough. He can become very strong if he hurts himself. He needs to taste blood and walk on fire,"" Ibrahimovic told French outlet Telefoot in quotes published by The Mirror. ""Surround yourself with people who tell you you're not good enough and you will become the best."" The legendary striker certainly knows what it takes to succeed in the game after scoring 62 goals in 118 caps for Sweden. He also found the net 156 times in 180 appearances for Paris Saint Germain and won four consecutive Ligue 1 titles during his time in the French capital. The Swede reflected fondly on this time at PSG and believes the squad he was part of is superior to the current collection of players at the Parc des Princes, despite the recent arrival of Lionel Messi. ""It's a good challenge for Messi. He will try something new after a long period at Barcelona and he's going to a very ambitious club that wants to win and is rising,"" he added. ""Is today's team better than the one in my era? No, we were a team. These days, it's not a team."" Ibrahimovic is still going strong at the age of 40 and has scored two goals in five appearances across all competitions for AC Milan so far this season.

Loadingâ¦ Real are believed to have submitted a total of three bids, the highest of which was â¬200 million on transfer deadline day, but PSG refused to sell their No.7. Mbappe's deal at the Parc des Princes expires at the end of the season, however, and he is allowed discuss pre-contract terms with non-France based sides in January. Real are still the favourites for his signature but according to El Nacional, via Sports Mole, the 22-year-old is not quite sold on the idea of playing Ancelotti. The experienced Italian returned to the Santiago Bernabeu for a second spell in the summer and has seen his side win eight of their 12 games in La Liga, where they sit one point behind leaders Real Sociedad in second. But Mbappe is apparently ""disappointed"" with the appointment of Ancelotti as Zinedine Zidane's replacement and hopes there will be a change of manager. El Nacional claims that Kylian Mbappe has told Madrid he will only join them on the condition that they make Jurgen Klopp their manager, replacing current boss Carlo Ancelotti with the German. In his ideal scenario, he would play under Liverpool boss Klopp in the Spanish capital. It's said the Frenchman would be delighted to play under the 54-year-old and feels his high-octane style of play would give him constant space to run into and showcase his key abilities. Klopp's name has been mentioned before by Florentino Perez as a managerial candidate but the German is more than comfortable at Liverpool, where he is contracted until 2024. Klopp has seen out his contracts at both Mainz and Borussia Dortmund and has stressed he will take a year off once his stint at Anfield is up. After failing to secure an exit in the summer, Mbappe has hit seven goals in 16 games in all competitions for PSG this term. ""I'm not going to be the hypocrite, my ambition was clear. We will see what happens - my future is not my priority now. Discussing his situation in October, Mbappe said: ""I am attached to PSG, and if I had left this summer, it would have only been for Real Madrid. ""I thought my adventure was over.

The PSG forward theatrically threw himself to the ground after a collision with defender Joe Rodon in the 31st minute; a simulation that was quickly waved away by Portuguese referee Luis Godinho. Mbappe didn't pick up a yellow card for his antics, although commentator Craig Burley was convinced his ""nonsense"" in the penalty area should have been punished. In the rant, Burley says: ""Oh, get up, get up! He's got a bad habit of that him you know, keep your eye on him. Look, Mr.Innocent Kylian Mbappe... Watch this, watch, cheat - absolute cheat. ""Watch this... Look at him... Embarrassing. A player of his talent throwing himself over like that, the referee was spot on... he should've given him a yellow card. ""Give him a yellow for nonsense like that, if you're going to send young boys off like Neco Williams in a friendly like that, yellow card him (Mbappe) for diving."" ""Let's put a stop to it before these Euros start. Sorry, rant over."" Mbappe's antics in the penalty area - and Burley's subsequent reaction to the PSG forward's dive - certainly got people talking on social media during the clash. Away from the 'diving' incident and Didier Deschamps' side managed to record a comfortable 3-0 win against Wales thanks to goals from Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele. It was a result made far more straightforward following the bizarre dismissal of defender Neco Williams. The 20-year-old was given a harsh red card in the 26-minute mark when referee Luis Godinho deemed the Liverpool full-back's handball as deliberate after a lengthy VAR check. After the final whistle, Wales winger Daniel James couldn't quite believe the controversial red card decision. ""I'm not one to talk about referees, but it's a friendly game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""He took 10 minutes to look at it and then decided it's clear and obvious. I don't know how it's clear and obvious. ""He's two yards out and I'm not even sure it's a penalty. We've been told that if he's in a natural position and he can't do anything about it it's not a penalty. ""Even their players were saying 'don't send him off'.

By mentioning Inzaghi, Mbappe clearly isn't referring to the former Juventus and AC Milan striker - instead many think he's talking about Giroud in a negative way. Inzaghi was known for being a pure poacher who didn't offer much other than pop up with goals in the six-yard box. A whole host of French supporters reckon Mbappe sees Giroud in the same mould and that he has grown frustrated with the Chelsea man.  The video has emerged after Mbappe and Giroud have become embroiled in a surprise row ahead of Euro 2020. It started when Mbappe felt Giroud, who bagged a brace off the bench, was having a go at him after his post-match comment following the 3-0 friendly win over Bulgaria. The former Arsenal man said: ""Sometimes you make the runs and the ball is not arriving. Perhaps we could have found each other better, there it is."" Incredibly, Mbappe was so angry about the remark from Giroud that he reportedly wanted to organise his own press conference to defend himself. RMC Sport, via GFFN, say that Giroud attempted to patch things up with Mbappe by speaking to him and ""forcing a hug upon"" his teammate following a training session in which he set him up twice during a small-sided game. Giroud admitted he made a mistake and felt pressured in the interview and manager Didier Deschamps spoke to them individually before addressing the matter in front of the squad. However, it's said that Mbappe is still not convinced and the PSG star's body language and mood were not normal on Thursday afternoon, with ""the tension still present"" going into Tuesday's opening game against Germany.

With just one minute left of injury time in the game, and Real looking to take a 0-0 draw back to Madrid, the 23-year-old forward took the perfect moment to come up with a moment of truly sublime skill. Mbappe got the ball from Neymar, jinxed in between two opposing defenders and then slid the ball in between Thibaut Courtois' legs to make it 1-0 with a piece of pure magic.

Their plan seemed to be going fine in the first half, with Courtois only having to make one save, which was one more than Gianluigi Donnarumma. Los Blancos' keeper did have more to do in the second half but it looked like he'd passed his biggest test of the game, when he saved from the penalty spot.

We've attempted to come up with the answer using stats sprinkled with a little opinion. First of all, we've walked the divide between 'striker' and 'forward' pretty precariously, but we've tried to limit this list to genuine strikers. That means the likes of Marcus Rashford and Lionel Messi don't make this list. We've used stats like goals scored, goals per game and goals per 90 to quantify each player's contribution, but that doesn't mean whomever has the best stats wins. We've also considered the importance of each player to their sides and their overall contribution, including assists. All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: This season's displays in the Bundesliga have reignited Andre Silva's vision for the back of the net after experiencing a torrid time at AC Milan - scoring just twice inside 25 appearances. However, the Portuguese hitman has been clinical this season, converting 28 goals and five assists in just 32 league games for Eintracht Frankfurt. Not a bad turnaround, eh? Taking his sizzling form into account, the 25-year-old will be, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the hottest strikers in the European market today. Could he be a shrewd signing for an ambitious Premier League side this summer? 2020/21 Season Stats: The 2020/21 season has been an average one by Ciro Immobile's recent standards. He scored 20 goals in the league compared to the Serie A record equalling 36 he scored in 2019/20. Still, those 20 league goals were a third of Lazio's 61 season total goals, showing their dependence on the Italian striker. The Italian forward was in strong form throughout the majority of the season, only suffering an eight-game goal drought from mid-February to mid-April. 2020/21 Season Stats: Cristiano Ronaldo's departure from Real Madrid in 2018 marked the end of an era for Los Blancos. The club's European dominance was coming to a close, players were leaving and it was time for others in the side to step up. And that is exactly what Karim Benzema has done following Ronaldo's exit, developing into Madrid's go-to man upfront. The French forward found the net in the win over Villarreal to bring up his 30th goal of the La Liga campaign. It's his second-best Madridista tally, equalling his 2018/19 numbers and just two shy of 2011/12 when he hit 32 for the season. His superb performances have seen him earn a recall to the French national team for the Euros in June. 2020/21 Season Stats: Kylian Mbappe has justified the hype that surrounded him following his breakthrough season at Monaco four years ago. A ruthless finisher in front of goal, the Frenchman has a coolness to his play that makes it challenging to believe he is only 22. As well as routinely punishing Ligue 1 defences, Mbappe has also terrorised some of Europe's best backlines in the Champions League with right goals in 10 games. His speed, clinical nature and dribbling ability ensures that, on his day, he is unplayable. And, while he sometimes plays on the left, the majority of his appearances this year have come through the middle so we feel the 'striker' label applies here. 2020/21 Season Stats: One of the best, if not the best, to have ever graced a football pitch. Cristiano Ronaldo has performed at the highest level for over a decade, featuring as the central figure for Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. Approaching the end of his glittering career, some predicted a downturn in form for the Portuguese forward at Juventus. But the 36-year-old has simply carried on doing what he does best: scoring for fun. He scored 41 goals in 55 games in the 2020/21 season and at a rate of more than one every 90 minutes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Barcelona agreed to let Luis Suarez leave the club for free last summer without kicking up too much of a fuss. Viewed as a striker in decline, the Uruguayan has emphatically responded to those his questioned his ability by firing Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title. There are more prolific players on this list, but none had the impact Suarez had this year. At 34 years of age, Suarez is showing no signs of being a player who has lost his touch as he continues to mesmerise with his unpredictable nature. 2020/21 Season Stats: Romelu Lukaku has been the driving force behind Inter Milan's quest for a first Serie A title in 11 years. The Belgian bagged 23 league goals in his first season in Italy and has surpassed the 20-goal mark once again as he continues to prove his lethal ability. He also provided 12 assists, a number only bettered on this list by Harry Kane's 18. Lukaku showcased his talent in the Premier League at Chelsea, West Bromwich Albion, Everton and Manchester United and has fully embraced the challenge of operating in a new environment. 2020/21 Season Stats: Erling Haaland is, undisputedly, the most in-demand player in world football at the moment. The Norwegian superstar has been simply sensational in every way and, regardless of the opposition or the competition, he has managed to find the back of the net time after time. With that said, the 20-year-old has become of the most sought-after strikers in the world since signing for Borussia Dortmund, having taken his game to the next level. Haaland has his whole future ahead of him and could well become of the greats if he continues to replicate his current numbers. It's terrifying to think how good Erling Haaland will be when he's 21 years old, let alone 25 or 30. 2020/21 Season Stats: For a while, we wondered what kind of striker Harry Kane was. He once felt like a throwback, an Alan Shearer-type box-dweller who could hit the ball really hard but not much else, but these days he's much more than that. The England captain has gradually developed to become a Swiss Army knife of a forward, with a passing range to make the average deep-lying playmaker weep and off-the-ball movement to tear defences apart. He has 30 goals this season and frankly, Tottenham Hotspur have been propped up by him. He used to be the best player in the league in the penalty area, but he's pretty close to being the player out of it as well, right now, as his 18 assists prove. 2020/21 Season Stats: As players enter the latter stages of their playing days, a gradual reduction in contributions is to be expected. But Robert Lewandowski is an individual who has bucked that trend in a rather significant manner, reaching a level that has propelled him to the top of this list. The Polish striker netted 55 times in all competitions on Bayern Munich's way to achieving the treble last year and has scored an incredible 53 goals in 47 appearances, including internationals, this season. He's averaging 1.4 goals per 90 minutes. Insane. Image credits: PA ",positive,liverpool,0

""Mbappe's dribbling in tight spaces and his change of pace are stunning. It really looks like he has gears in his legs. ""Even more, it looks easy for him to make the difference, even in one meter. He can be devastating, whether he has space or not. ""However, Cristiano's heading and ability to lose his marker are unreachable, and he is so accurate whether he shoots with his right or left foot. This is something Mbappe still needs to improve."" Mbappe has yet to open his goal account at Euro 2020, with Les Bleus already through to the last 16.

According to AS, Carlo Ancelotti's team don't want to anger PSG, or add pressure to Mbappe, by making any announcement until after their Champions League last 16 clash. In normal circumstances, the Spanish giants would make an announcement instantly but Monday's draw certainly makes things trickier. Confirming that Mbappe was about to play against his new team would no doubt increase pressure on the whole occasion, and on the player. The two sides are set to meet in Paris on February 15th and the return leg will be just over three weeks later on March 9th, so there will no announcement until after that. Florentino Perez reportedly did similar with David Alaba and Bayern Munich last season, when the two European giants also met in the Champions League. Perez and Real were already annoyed at the fact they have to face Mauricio Pochettino's side, after the farcical scenes during the draw. La Liga leaders Real were originally drawn against Benfica, before the draw went completely wrong and Manchester United were drawn with Villarreal, which wasn't actually allowed. When UEFA decided to redo the draw, the 13 time champions wanted their match with their Portuguese opponents to stand because it happened before the mistakes. However, the European governing body decided that the whole draw had to be reset and instead Real didn't come out until the end, when they were drawn with PSG. As well as the Mbappe conundrum, Real will also be reunited with former club captain Sergio Ramos and chief El Clasico tormentor Lionel Messi will also be back at the Bernabeu.

Over the last year, amid ongoing uncertainty over his contract situation at Le Parc des Princes, Mbappe has been heavily linked with both Madrid and Liverpool. But in an interview with PSG's club magazine, the superstar striker opened up on his dream, which is to win the Champions League with the Ligue 1 giants in the foreseeable future - despite rumours of him wanting to leave the club. In a joint interview with Neymar, which took place in May, the pair spoke to PSG's official magazine about their future goals and aspirations within the game. During his exchange with the Brazilian, Mbappe said: ""I'm not very good as a journalist. What would I ask Neymar? What is your big dream for you after everything you've achieved?"" Neymar responded: ""My biggest dream with PSG is to win the Champions League and with Brazil to win the World Cup. And for you, Kylian, is it to win the Champions League, right?"" Mbappe then admitted he is also set on tasting European glory with PSG, saying: ""My biggest dream is to win the Champions League with PSG, that would be fantastic."" While Neymar won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Mbappe has never won the coveted European showpiece. There has been a lot of talk about Mbappe's future as he only has one year left on his contract with PSG, but it seems like he will remain in France, at least for another year. Interest in Mbappe should come as no surprise, too, especially after the French phenomenon scored an impressive 42 goals and assisted 11 more in 47 games for PSG last season. The 22-year-old striker, widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, has been touted by many to be the next best player on the planet after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo eventually retire.

The La Liga club are now in position to snap him up on a free transfer next summer when his contract expires.

On the superstar forward's future, PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino said: ""Mbappe is our player. ""The football industry is full of rumour. Our president and Leonardo are very clear.

Even though Mbappe can leave PSG on free transfer next summer, Madrid are reportedly keen to get the deal over the line this summer and have made a bid of up to â¬160 million. It has been widely known that Mbappe was always dreamed of playing Madrid after idolising Cristiano Ronaldo as a child. According to Marca, PSG were aware of his desires and therefore made a promise to Mbappe in 2017 which essentially meant that they would help negotiate a transfer to Real Madrid if they made an approach. However, at this moment in time it seems as if PSG will not accept Madrid's first offer. French journalist Julien Laurens said: ""PSG don't want to sell Kylian MbappÃ© this summer. They have rejected Real Madrid's 160m euros offer for him today. ""Will Real come back with a higher offer? PSG say they would reject it too. But would they really?"" With a very short amount of the transfer window left, it seems increasingly unlikely that the deal will be able to happen. However with Mbappe reportedly desperate to leave to the French capital, PSG may consider a higher off in order to not lose the forward on a free transfer next summer. When Mauricio Pochettino was asked about Mbappe's state of mind last week, he was seemingly very relaxed about the situation: ""I think he's very good, he's working hard to have a good season. As I've said in recent weeks, Kylian is our player and I don't see why he wouldn't be with us this season. ""This period is part of football, a lot of things are said, some things happen and others never do. The most important thing is that Kylian is very calm. He has a year left on his contract, he's a PSG player. We're happy with him and, from what I see, he's also happy with us."" ",positive,liverpool,0

There was even some surprise when Mbappe moved to PSG in 2017, initially on loan, for a fee of â¬145 million, such was the expectation that he would move to Real. With his contract expiring in 2022, rumours have recently intensified again, despite an offer to extend from PSG, and, according to reports in Spain, Mbappe does want to make the move to the Spanish capital now. Cuatro and Cadena SER, via AS, report that the World Cup winner has made up his mind and doesn't want to sign a new deal or wait until next summer to move for free. Whilst Liverpool, and others, are also believed to be interested in the forward, his desire is to join Real. The decision means that PSG would have a huge decision to make, in either agreeing a deal for him to move this summer or see him leave for free next summer. Even with just one year left on his contract the Parisiens would be expected to fetch a large fee if they allowed their star man to leave before his deal expired. AS report it as a 'economically complicated but feasible operation' to make the transfer happen this summer, despite the buying club's reported financial issues. Florentino Perez is ready to make one or two big signings as he attempts to rebuild Zinedine Zidane's squad and Erling Haaland is also on their radar, with the club having spoken to the Borussia Dortmund player's agent. Zidane has reportedly stayed stayed in touch with Mbappe over the years, although the three time Champions League winning manager's future has also been rumoured to be questionable in the past. Mbappe's performance against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night proved exactly why Real will be desperate to sign him and exactly why PSG want to keep hold of him. The 22-year-old scored twice against the Champions League holders, including a goal that Manuel Neuer really should have kept out, and caused problems all night for the Germans, as PSG won the first leg 3-2 in Munich.

But he was not named as a 'Designated Player' in their squad list - meaning he was earning more than allowed. Clubs in the MLS are allowed three 'Designated Players' that don't count towards the salary cap and failing to register Matuidi means Miami were operating with four.

Miami have also failed to register former defender Andres Reyes correctly and it has seen managing owner Jorge Mas hit with a $250,000 fine. In addition, the salaries of Leandro Gonzalez Pirez, Nicolas Figal and Julian Carranza were not fully disclosed.

Fans have flooded to the ground, and onto the internet, to buy shirts with the five time Ballon d'Or winner's name on the back of them, racking up Â£187 million worth of sales, according to reports, although not everyone is quite as happy to see him back in England. His impact on the pitch was pretty much instant as well, although it did take him until the second minute of added on time in the first half to score.

493,https://www.sportbible.com/football/the-records-cristiano-ronaldo-could-beat-on-manchester-united-return-20210911,The Records Cristiano Ronaldo Could Beat On Manchester United Return,"Cristiano Ronaldo makes his first start for Manchester United for 12 years on Saturday, against Newcastle United, but he'll also have his eyes on a few records he could break in the future. Loadingâ¦ Ronaldo has broken many records during his career, with the latest being the reported Â£187 million his shirt sales have already made since his move to United was confirmed 11 days ago. The last time Ronaldo played for the Old Trafford club was in 2009 and since then he's broken all sorts of records, becoming Real Madrid's all time top scorer, the men's international top scorer, the Champions League top scorer, to name just three. Now he's back in England, the 36-year-old will have his eyes on some more records that he could quite conceivably break, as per Planet Football. Possibly the easiest one is becoming the first player to score 100 goals in both the Premier League and La Liga, with the second part of that done with 311 league goals for Real Madrid. In order to break that record he'll need just 16 goals for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in the next two seasons, and he'll be hoping he breaks it sometime this season. If he does break that record in this campaign, and goes a bit further, then he has a chance to become the oldest winner of the league's Golden Boot. Jamie Vardy currently holds the record, having won it aged 33, and if Ronaldo can outscore everyone this season then he'll take that title off the Leicester City man. Another record in England's top tier is within touching distance, but he'll have to wait till next season for it, and that's to be the league's oldest hat-trick scorer. Former United forward Teddy Sheringham did it at aged 37 years and 146 days, when playing for Portsmouth against Bolton Wanderers in 2003. United's newest signing has actually only scored three goals in a game once whilst playing in England, but if he does it any time in the 2022/23 season then he'll better Sheringham. The rest of the records come in Europe, where Ronaldo could become the Champions League most successful player, should he win it a sixth time. The former Juventus man has won five to date, having won once with Sir Alex Ferguson's team in 2008 and four with Real, including three in-a-row. During his spell at the Bernabeu, the forward would often score double figures, or more, in a continental campaign and he needs 21 goals to top Ruud van Nistelrooy as United's all time scorer in the competition. The Dutchman once scored 12 goals in one season in the Champions League, and should Ronaldo better that, he's previously scored 17 in one term, then that's another United record gone. And for really optimistic fans, there's the possibility of the five time Ballon d'Or winner grabbing 136 goals in his second spell in Manchester, which would mean beating Wayne Rooney's 253 goals for the club, as their top scorer. Which records will Ronaldo break? ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Fernandes has signed an extension at Old Trafford that'll make him one of the club's highest earners until 2026, with an option for a further year. The 27-year-old has been a key player since arriving from Sporting CP in 2020 but Merson is shocked at the timing. He told Sky Sports: ""I'm flabbergasted if I'm being honest. You give him a four-year extension, more money, a manager comes in he might not like Fernandes, he might not like all the throwing the hands up, the moaning that he does when he doesn't get the ball. ""He might have someone, it might be the lad at Ajax [Erik ten Hag], who's got someone else and thinks 'I've got someone who I want to bring in who wants to play my way'. ""I'm completely and utterly shocked. I cannot believe what's happening. Everything is just being done off the cuff. It's been being done off the cuff for the last couple of years at Man United."" Fernandes will now earn Â£250,000-per-week compared to his last contract which was worth Â£120,000-per-week. It makes him one of United's highest earners ahead of Marcus Rashford and captain Harry Maguire. Fernandes' performances have dipped this season but there's no denying his status as one of the Premier League's best. Only Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane have been involved in more goals since he moved to England. The Portugal international would likely be welcomed by any manager who takes over from Ralf Rangnick in the summer. Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino are the two frontrunners right now but a decision isn't imminent according to sources. United currently sit sixth in the Premier League and four points behind fourth place Arsenal. Mikel Arteta's men also have a game in hand and look favourites to qualify for next season's Champions League. The Red Devils haven't won a trophy for five years and it's their longest barren run in 40 years. Fernandes is hoping to change that, having already suffered Europa League final heartbreak last year. He told United's official website: ""Even after two years, it still feels amazing to step out at Old Trafford, to hear the fans sing my song and to score in front of the Stretford End. It is a true privilege to wear this shirt and to fight for our incredible club. ""There is so much more that I want to achieve here, and I know that is the same for the rest of the squad and staff. More than anything, we want to give the fans the success that they deserve. ""We have shared some great moments over the last years, but the best is yet to come from myself and this team.""

The ball was cleared from a Chelsea corner and Jorginho attempted to trap the ball on the halfway line. However, the Ballon d'Or contender's touch was wayward and allowed Sancho to dart towards goal.

Blues skipper Jorginho made amends for his mistake, however, when he sent David De Gea the wrong way with a typically calm penalty in the 69th minute.

Along with Messi, Chelsea midfield pair Jorginho and N'Golo Kante have been high on the list for most likely winners, with the former winning the Champions League and Euro 2020. Robert Lewandowski is also well fancied, after breaking a near 50 year-old Bundesliga goal scoring record, a year after he was robbed of the award. However Ronaldo Nazario, believed that the award should go to final player ranked in the top five most likely winners, Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The youngest ever winner of the award took to Facebook to say, ""Without a doubt, my candidate for the Ballon d'Or is Benzema. The best striker, brutal level for 10 years and champion above all. Don't you think?"" Without Cristiano Ronaldo, Benzema has become more and more important to Los Blancos over the past couple of years, becoming the main goalscorer. Sergio Ramos' departure in the summer, with the club captain moving to PSG, has added even more pressure to the French striker's shoulders at the Bernabeu. The 33-year-old has so far scored 35 goals for club and country this calendar year and helped France win the Nations League at the weekend, after Paul Pogba's rousing half-time speech in the final.

It's actually Lionel Messi who is favourite to add to his six titles, but of course some people believe it's the Argentina star's rival Ronaldo who should win it. Amongst those are the player's agent Mendes, who believes that, despite winning it five times previously, Ronaldo deserves it more now than ever before.

""All of this together makes him absolutely unique. From my point of view, the Golden Ball has only one name: Cristiano Ronaldo. ""Heâs never deserved it more than this year."" Mendes does make some decent points, the Manchester United striker was top scorer in Serie A and the Euros this year, but the records he broke were predominantly done in other years. The 36-year-old didn't win any silverware with Juventus, United or Portugal this year either, whereas his competitors for the title have all won something in 2021. On four of the previous five occasions the former Real Madrid star has taken home the award, he'd won the Champions League in the same year. Mendes isn't the only one who believes CR7 deserves to win it though, with former boss Sir Alex Ferguson also throwing his vote behind the player he brought to Old Trafford in 2003.

Mendy was left off France Footballâs 30-man shortlist for the Ballon d'Or, despite his impressive form in Chelseaâs Champions League triumph last season. Loadingâ¦ The 29-year-old Senegalese shot-stopper, who arrived from Rennes in a reported Â£22m deal, kept nine clean sheets in 12 Champions League matches. And Mendy equalled the record held by Santiago Canizares and Keylor Navas for most clean sheets in a single Champions League season. Mendyâs Chelsea teammates N'Golo Kante, Jorginho, Romelu Lukaku, Mason Mount and Cesar Azpilicueta feature on the 30-man shortlist, but the Senegal international failed to make France Footballâs selection. Mane, who also didnât make the Ballon d'Or shortlist, said it was âunacceptableâ that the Chelsea star wasnât nominated. Read More: During his international duty with Senegal this week, the Liverpool star said: âIt is unacceptable. I do not understand.â France Football did recognise Mendyâs achievements last season with his nomination for the Yashin Trophy, which is awarded to the best âkeeper in the world. The award, which is named after the legendary Lev Yashin, was first introduced in 2019 and was won by Liverpool star Alisson. Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly, 30, echoed Maneâs remarks over Mendyâs absence from the Ballon d'Or shortlist. The Senegal captain said: âItâs a real shame that Edou isnât one of them. He is the first African goalkeeper to win the Champions League. âWe must continue to work and move forward. We have to do the double [the work] of some people to be well judged. âEdou is a very positive person. We talked about it together. He will continue to fight to be part of it. For me, he has a place among these 30 players.â Mendy was humble over his absence from the 30-man Ballon d'Or shortlist and welcomed his nomination for the Yashin Trophy. Read More: âHonestly, I am already very proud to represent my country and be among the 10 best goalkeepers in the world,â he said. âIn just one year [at Chelsea], itâs a very good thing. Iâm not satisfied with that, I have a lot of ambitions but itâs already a good step. âThere will always be debates, whether itâs about me or someone else. It is down to the freedom of the votes of the [Ballon dâOr] journalists and they must be respected.â The winners of the 2021 Ballon d'Or and Yashin Trophy will be announced at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris on 29th November.

Despite playing in a poor Barcelona side last season, Messi still banged in the goals and then captained Argentina to a long-awaited Copa America triumph in the summer. Loadingâ¦ He collected both the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards and though he's not set the world alight in his new surroundings at Paris Saint-Germain, the 34-year-old is the favourite to win the gong yet again. But interestingly, Messi isn't so sure about his chances of being named as the winner by France Football and isn't too fussed if he does not come out on top. ""If I'm honest, I don't think so [he can win it],"" Messi admitted in a wide-ranging interview with SPORT, as per The Mirror. ""My biggest prize was what I was able to achieve with the national team. After having fought and fought so much for that achievement, it was the best for all it cost. ""If the golden ball arrives it would be extraordinary for what it would mean winning one more. The seventh would be crazy. If not, nothing happens. ""I have already achieved one of my great goals. I am very happy for what happened and now that whatever has to happen, happens."" Leo Messi to @sport regarding the Ballon d'Or:""The truth is, I don't think about it.

In a recent interview with German publication Kicker, the 67-year-old touched on a number of subjects, including Financial Fair Play and talks of UEFA bringing in a salary cap and 'luxury tax'. He also spoke about the future of Kimmich and Goretzka - two players who have been key in Bayern's success over the past few years. Goretzka, who has just 11 months remaining on his current deal at the Allianz Arena, has been heavily linked with a transfer this summer, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona all linked with a move. Kimmich, meanwhile, is reportedly close to signing a new three-year deal at the German side, although negotiations appear to have stalled in recent months.

And they can win titles here too, now and in the future"" As mentioned earlier, Hainer also mentioned UEFA's plans to reportedly scrap Financial Fair Play. Since the start of the pandemic, UEFA have conducted an internal review of its FFP rules and has concluded that there must be a greater focus on the extortionate levels on spending on wages and transfers. There have been suggestions that there will be new measures such as salary caps and luxury tax on transfers. Bayern's chief isn't a fan of the idea. ""I'm not at all convinced by this luxury tax. In the event of violations, a club pays 100 million euros in luxury tax, which is shared among the other clubs. ""This money does not help them decisively and does not really hurt the financial giants. We need valid regulations with clear consequences for fair competition.

Goals from Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala saw Bayern repeat the result they beat Barca by earlier in the season and handed the Spanish side their third defeat of the group stage. Coupled with Benfica's 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv, it meant that for the first time in 17 years, the Catalan giants won't be in the knockout rounds of the competition, and will instead drop into the Europa League. Barca's loss at home to Benfica essentially sealed their fate and dropping out of the top European competition shows their fall from grace. Despite their problems on the pitch, and issues with finances off it, they have remained linked to Erling Haaland and Ferran Torres and one pundit was so angry at those suggestions he launched on epic rant about the club.

Diaz has attracted interest from a number of clubs in the Premier League, including Spurs, Manchester United and Liverpool, after scoring 16 goals in 28 appearances this season. According to Portuguese outlet O Jogo, Tottenham have now submitted a formal bid for the Colombia international. Loadingâ¦ However, it is likely to be rejected as it is significantly lower than the Â£67m release clause in the winger's contract at Porto. The Portuguese league leaders are said to be 'analysing' the offer, which could potentially rise to more than Â£40m with bonuses. Diaz has two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract with Porto and the club are reluctant to sell him midway through the season. Sergio Conceicaoâs side are currently six points clear of Sporting Lisbon at the top of Portugalâs Primeira Liga. Loadingâ¦ Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte is keen to sign attacking reinforcements in January, with Spurs managing just 26 goals in 20 league games this season. Portuguese channel SIC Noticias claim Tottenham have given Porto a 48-hour deadline to respond to their bid, which could suggest the Premier League club has other targets if Diaz is unavailable. Liverpool have also been linked with a move for Diaz, who has scored 41 goals in 125 games for Porto since joining from Colombian side Junior de Barranquilla in 2019. However, Liverpool are reportedly willing to wait until the summer before making an approach for the 25-year-old, who was part of the Porto side that lost 2-0 at Anfield in the Champions League earlier this season. Meanwhile, Manchester United reportedly sent scouts to watch Diaz last week, while Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have also been monitoring the forward. ",positive,liverpool,3

The remote Senagalse village has never had such a medical facility before. A fact Mane knows all too well, as his father died when he was seven years old after he could not reach a hospital in time to be treated for a stomach complaint. The 29-year-old footballer has already previously donated Â£250,000 to build a school in Bambali. Now he has doubled that amount to help construct a hospital, meeting the president of Senegal, Macky Sall, to officially gift the facility to the state. Sadio ManÃ© met with the President of Senegal, Macky Stall, where they discussed Sadio's proposals of him wanting to build a new hospital and a new stadium for the national side.

Mane has previously spoken about the death of his father around the release of a documentary,Made in Senegal, about his life. ""He'd had a stomach ache, but because there was no hospital, we tried traditional medicine,"" said Mane. ""They took him to the village and he died there. There were a lot of rebels at the time, so there was no way to bring him home. They chose to bury him there."" Sadio Mane has presented the President of Senegal with his plans to build a brand new hospital in the city of Bambali. What a role model this man is. :pray: pic.twitter.com/x5Lvzk5zqH It's this type of tragedy that the hospital Mane has funded and given to the state will hopefully be able to prevent. Mane grew up in a small farming village, playing football with rocks or grapefruits when there were no balls to be found. It's a world away from a major city like Senegal's capital, Dakar. The young Mane's ambition to become a professional footballer was considered an outlandish dream, he admits. ""People found me abnormal,"" Mane said last year. ""When I told my mother: 'I want to be a footballer', she thought I was crazy. To her it was a child dreaming."" Mane had to run away from home at one point to fulfil his dream. However he's gone on to become one of the world's best players, winning African Player of the Year in 2019 and being crucial to Liverpool's Champions League and Premier League victories. ""I'm struggling to describe how proud and how motivated I get when I am back home,"" Mane told SPORTbible last year on the incredible reception he receives when he returns. ""Because all these people show me love and they are so happy to see me at this level [in football]... It's unbelievable for myself."" It seems, with a school built and a hospital opening this month, Mane is making his hometown proud with much more than just his legacy in football.

There was a breathless end to Saturday's action-packed game at Anfield, with Liverpool clinging on to a 1-0 lead. Wilson thought he'd given Newcastle an equaliser in injury time after he followed up Alisson's parry to put the ball into the net - however the ball had accidentally bounced up and touched Wilson's arm, so the goal was chalked off. But just when it appeared Liverpool had escaped with three points, Dwight Gayle headed the ball down to Joe Willock - whose deflected shot found the back of the Liverpool net as the clock ticked up towards 96 minutes. It was yet another vital strike by Arsenal loanee Willock, as Newcastle put nine points between them and 18th-place Fulham and kept up their fine run of late-season form. But it was a massive blow to Liverpool's top-four hopes. They had led for almost all of the match via Mohamed Salah's superb strike in the opening minutes. However Jurgen Klopp's side missed a host of chances and were punished as Newcastle came back into the game late on. Liverpool also dropped points in midweek against Leeds United. Sadio Mane gave them the lead in that game but, once again, they could not add to their total or see the match as it finished in a 1-1 draw. The decision to rule out Wilson's goal appeared harsh, as it was entirely accidental and nothing the England forward could have avoided. However it was correct by the letter of the law (for now), so Liverpool thought they had escaped a near miss. Until Willock's strike with the last kick of the game saw the match finish 1-1.

The German won his second major European trophy in a matter of months with Chelsea as the Blues defeated Villarreal 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in 120 minutes of action. As extra time came to a close and penalties loomed, Tuchel took a leaf out of Louis van Gaal's book when he took off first-choice goalkeeper Mendy and sent on Kepa for spot-kicks in the 119th minute. It proved to be a quite sublime call as the Spaniard saved two penalties, denying Aissa Mandi and Raul Albiol, to win the trophy in Belfast. Incredibly, Tuchel admitted the substitution was completely planned and something he had been thinking about since his first knockout game back in February. ""It was not spontaneous,"" Tuchel told BT Sport post-match. ""We talked about it with the goalkeepers when we came in the first cup game against Barnsley. We had some statistics. ""We were well prepared that Kepa has the best percentage at saving penalties. ""The analysing guys, the goalkeeper coaches showed me and introduced me to the data and then we spoke to the players and told them it could happen in cup games. ""We spoke to the players and Edou was fantastic. We do what we need to do for the team.There is proof that Kepa is better in this discipline and these guys are true team players. ""I am happy for Kepa and for Edou to have a goalkeeper like this that does not show the pride to not step off the field. He is happy to do this for the team and take this for the team."" For Kepa, the contrast to the 2019 Carabao Cup was quite remarkable. On that day at Wembley, he was set to be make way for Willy Caballero ahead of the shoot-out against Manchester City but refused in an infamous incident that had Maurizio Sarri losing his head. This time, however, he was the hero and finally got his moment in Chelsea colours after coming in for criticism ever since his Â£72 million move from Athletic Bilbao. And Mendy's attitude was nothing short of brilliant. He supported his teammate before the spot-kicks and raced over to celebrate when he made the match-winning save. ""I'm happy because we won and we worked for this success,"" Mendy said while he and Kepa took part in a joint interview with BT Sport. ""I knew since last year that if Kepa came on the pitch he would help the team. He did today and I'm really happy."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Conte took over at Tottenham in November and managed to bring in Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur to the club in the January transfer window. It was all part of the push for Champions League football next season, along with getting rid of the likes of Dele Alli and Tanguy Ndombele. However there's no way that will be all for Conte when it comes to boosting his squad in the near future, and he did also miss out on several targets in the winter window, including Luis Diaz who instead moved to Liverpool. According to a report in Italy, the former Inter Milan boss is eyeing up a move for a Nerazzurri star, with Inter Live, via Sport Witness, claiming Arturo Vidal is a target for Spurs. The piece also says the Chilean, whose departure from the San Siro in the summer is considered a 'certainty,' wants to move to north London to join up with Conte. Vidal's current deal at the San Siro expires in the summer, although he does have an option for an extra year, meaning Spurs could sign him without a transfer fee. Inter are currently more focused on getting Marcelo Brozovic to sign a new deal, with the midfielder's deal also up, and he has previously been linked with Tottenham. Simone Inzaghi's side have also been linked with a move for Franck Kessie from rivals AC Milan when his deal expires in the summer, having also signed Hakan Calhanoglu from them under the same circumstances last year. Kessie was one of Conte's targets in January but reportedly rejected the chance to move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and has also been rumoured to fancy a move to Barcelona. Tottenham's battle to finish in the top four and take the final Champions League's spot has certainly been given a boost since Conte took over. However they have now lost back-to-back Premier League games, having lost to Chelsea before the international break and then to Southampton in midweek. They threw away the lead against the Saints, with Ralph Hassenhutl's side scoring twice in a minute to secure a 3-2 victory over Conte's side. ",positive,liverpool,1

Let's be honest, though: most Red Devils fans felt the same way when the 46-year-old Norwegian came in as JosÃ© Mourinho's successor and turned their season around. Loadingâ¦ When United created a major upset in the Champions League after knocking Paris Saint-Germain out of the competition in March, Ferdinand made it clear that he wanted SolskjÃ¦r to be appointed on a permanent basis. ""Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there -- given what he's done since he's come in -- and let him sign the contract and go,"" he said. ""Ole's at the wheel, man -- he's doing his thing. Man United are back!"" Oh dear. While it's unclear whether the 40-year-old BT Sport pundit still feels the same way, there were many, many United fans calling for SolskjÃ¦r's head after the Red Devils' 1-1 draw to Huddersfield Town at the John Smith's Stadium on Sunday. United will officially miss out on Champions League football now, with the former Molde and Cardiff City head coach admitting that his side doesn't deserve to finish in the Premier League's top four. ""It hurts whenever you don't win a game of football. In a stadium like this with loads of energy, their last game of the season at home, we gave them some hope and we couldn't reach our level again,"" he told BBC Sport after the match. ""There was always going to be a period in this game Huddersfield would press us because of the energy of the crowd. ""We had a spell we couldn't get going, now it's done, we're disappointed but we have to look forward. ""We haven't deserved to be top four, we've chased the pack and been given chances, the league is so tight. ""When we got the opportunities we weren't able to really grab them. In the end, the table doesn't lie."" Did United make the wrong decision in appointing SolskjÃ¦r as the permanent manager before the end of the season? Let us know in the comments.

Dissectingtheloss, Ferdinand took aim at his old side's recruitment and highlighted the structural issues. He also went ontosay thatBruno Fernandes is the only signing in the past decade that has improved after moving to Old Trafford. On his YouTube show, the former Red Devils defender exclaimed:""I just feel that, when you look at it, Man United -you can talk about training grounds and all that stuff -but please, youâve got to get the football stuff right. ""Youâve got to get the culture at the football club right, youâve got to get the players that you recruit right. ""And if you look at the players that have been coming to this football club for the last eight or 10 years, if you were going to do a list of all of them on paper, how many of these players have come to this football club and actually grown in value or got better?"" When Fernandes was mentioned as the only Man United signing to improve at the club, he replied:""I would 100 per cent agree with that. ""I donât know any others that have come and you actually go, 'Oh heâs actually miles better! Weâll get more money for him now!'Thereâs none. ""And that goes down to coaching, that goes down to recruitment, and so those areas need to be improved drastically for us to be able to improve. ""Because you could go in and buy three or four players this window, but if weâre going to continue in the same vein as what was before, those players that you bring in are going to be declining rather than getting better and improving your team - so that needs to be changed.""â Even Fernandes is struggling this term.

Loadingâ¦ City and Liverpool are set to face in a huge clash that could even go as far as deciding where the Premier League title will end up this season. Only one point separates the two teams going into the match at the Etihad and they'll just be seven games left of the season come full time. There's no doubting the incredible talent that both Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have at their disposal and it's tough to separate the teams, who have dominated England's top tier in the past four years. That's why making a combined XI of their players would be really tough to do, especially to find universal agreement, but it helps if you don't put Kyle Walker at centre back. The Match of the Day pundit picked his XI for the Premier League and he chose a 5-3-2 in order to crowbar the England full back into a position he hasn't played too regularly. I feel sick to my stomach pic.twitter.com/exLF7nOWQC The fact that Jermaine Jenas made it says it all really... pic.twitter.com/ojanv5TyuZ My man put hooferson..... walker at cb? and no dias? Jenas is stealing a living pic.twitter.com/fe45AENfQG All my jermaine jenas hate tweets are excusable just for this alone https://t.co/GBHCa0QSsi Jermaine Jenas is a menace to society https://t.co/A2fUKT1v9O Ahhh yes the traditional 5-3-2 that city and Liverpool play. All that fucking about just to shoehorn Walker in :joy: how does this joke get a job pic.twitter.com/gXGa8wmpnH Jermaine Jenas has managed (some how) to pick a combined 11 of #MCILIV that's is worse than either teams regular 11. pic.twitter.com/J7kL065Jeh what actually went wrong with jermaine jenas did he get dropped on his head as a baby or something pic.twitter.com/PSpPYOlheA I don't know what is worse Henderson ahead of Fabinho, Thiago, Rodri, gundogan OR going to a back 3 and then leave out Dias and Matip but have walker in there:joy: With players this good, a back three formation is beyond horrible. Jenas must've scribbled this while sat on the toilet immediately before The One Show. Usually when someone picks a combined XI it's done in the formation of one of the two teams, or a generic 4-2-3-1/4-3-3, depending what works best in the situation. Neither Guardiola or Klopp ever use a 5-3-2 system and to pick it in order to crowbar a right back in to play centre back, whilst ignoring some very good centre backs like Ruben Dias and Joel Matip is bizarre to say the least. There was also plenty of debate about the inclusion of Jordan Henderson, even from Liverpool fans, with Rodri and Fabinho both missing out in central midfield. Of course Jenas isn't the only pundit to cause huge debate ahead of the big game, with Jamie Carragher claiming the rivalry as the 'greatest' in English football history. Klopp agreed, but only jokingly after finding out who made the claim. On Sunday we'll get to find out if Carragher and Jenas were anywhere close with their opinions or if the court of social media was correct. ",positive,liverpool,4

The Red Devils have made three signings so far this summer, with high-profile recruits Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho as well as the arrival of goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Many have been calling for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to bring in a central defensive midfield player to strengthen their side but former United winger Lee Sharpe believes they need another striker. They have Edinson Cavani, Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial as potential options through the middle and yet Sharpe reckons they ought to try and sign Vardy from Leicester. âI definitely think they need another goal scorer, I would like them to bring in another striker, a no.9, a goal scorer who can bang in 20/25 goals a season,"" Sharpe told The Mirror. ""Obviously Cavani is world-class, we know heâs not going to play every game, every minute. âThe rumour mill is still floating around about Haaland potentially coming next year so that makes you think twice about bringing someone in this summer, but if United are short anywhere, itâs in the No.9 area. Someone like a Vardy, I donât know if we will get Vardy, but I think he would be an ideal choice for a couple of seasons.â Vardy, now 34, recently signed a new contract with the FA Cup winners until 2023. He joined the Foxes from Fleetwood Town in 2012 for Â£1 million, which was a record transfer fee for a non-league player. In 354 appearances, the former England star has scored 148 times, including 119 in the Premier League.

Throw in the fact that six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi is Aguero's best friend and it's clear that 13-year-old Benjamin is well connected to some serious footballing talent. But you might be surprised to learn that one of his favourite players is none other than Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy. Loadingâ¦ In a video from Manchester City's 'All or Nothing' Amazon Prime documentary that is doing the rounds again, Aguero - who retired earlier this year - explained that his son is well aboard the Vardy hype train. The Argentine had just scored the 12th hat-trick of his City career in a 5-1 thrashing of Leicester in 2018 and he made sure to get hold of Vardy's shirt, as per a request from his little one. ""My son asked for it,"" Aguero tells the cameras in the changing room. ""He texted me asking for Vardy's jersey. He is a phenomenon."" The fact that Aguero's son loves a former Stockbridge Steels player who used to drink half a bottle of Lucozade filled with port is quite brilliant. But then again, the former Fleetwood Town man's stats speak for themselves. Just the 128 goals in 263 Premier League games, including 40 against the league's traditional 'big six'.

The 34-year-old striker, who has scored 15 times for The Foxes this season, is one of the most prolific goalscorers in recent Premier League history. He lifted the Golden Boot award for the first time in his career last campaign after scoring 23 goals and continues to bang them in on a regular basis. But in his first year at Leicester, after signing from Fleetwood Town for a non-league record of Â£1 million, Vardy was 'going through a rough patch' and was desperate for a change of scenery. And when I say scenery, I mean the party island of Ibiza. Vardy had only scored five goals in his debut season in the Championship and his on-field struggles led him to believe his future lay in a job away from football. The late-bloomer from Non-League has opened up about almost leaving football to make a new life in Ibiza. ""Moving to Ibiza felt a good idea at the time,"" he said via The Daily Mail. ""It felt a really good idea. Thank God I didn't. ""It was one of those things. I'd never been in that environment - playing in the Championship, struggling, the performances and the goals not coming and it does make you think. ""I had a chat with Nigel Pearson at one point and I was trying to get him to loan me back to Fleetwood, just because I'd had success there. He said, ""Listen, you're good enough, just knuckle down, you can play a lot higher"". ""At that stage, I knew he believed in me and after that, it all clicked together. It was a learning curve. The big jump in standard took a bit of time getting used to and then the season after we got promoted."" In a recent chat with YouTube channel Under The Cosh, former Leicester winger Ben Marshall 'made some huge revelations' about Vardy, including his plans to find a job in Ibiza. ""I remember when he was saying he's going to jack it in and go away. He had a job offer to go over to Ibiza and be a rep. He was all over that."" Marshall recalls. ""He'll tell you that himself."" The 29-year-old, who now plays in the 12th tier of English football for West Lancashire First Division side Stoneclough FC, went on to speak about Vardy's dress sense and the size of 'his length'. In terms of Vardy's plans to ditch his life as a professional footballer to become a party rep, former Leicester coaches Craig Shakespeare and Steve Walsh, along with manager Nigel Pearson, managed to persuade the striker to stay. Shakespeare opened up about Vardy's on-the-field struggles in 2017. ""Our job is to support players. Sometimes they do have self-doubt and Jamie would be the first to admit he was going through a rough patch."" he said. ""Myself, Nigel [Pearson] and Steve [Walsh] were here to support him. All we did was told him about his attributes and that we thought he could go on. ""We even mentioned then about not only playing in the Premier League but also he had the attributes to play for the national team. We told him we wanted him and believed in him. ""Thankfully he didn't go to Ibiza. I think he has made the right decision!"" Vardy's route into professional football has been anything but normal, and so too is the Leicester City striker's matchday diet. In an in-depth interview with Sky Sports as part of their 'Making it Pro' feature, the former England man revealed he still opts for a caffeine fix prior to games. ""I wake up in the morning and then [have a] Red Bull. Literally, I get out of bed, get the kids up and downstairs, get their breakfast sorted and then I'm straight into the Red Bull,"" he said: ""After that, we meet at the stadium for pre-match and while I'm getting changed I'll have a coffee - it's better than taking ProPlus. Red Bull, coffee and then when we get over to the pre-match lounge, I'll have my cheese and ham omelette with another can of Red Bull."" Asked how his stomach is able to process and deal with the caffeine coming his way, Vardy replied: ""I think when you've done it for so many years I think it just gets used to it, it's not an issue whatsoever. It's one of them things, it's not going to work for everyone."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Youri Tielemans incredible strike on Saturday was worthy of winning any game and the fact it won the FA Cup for Leicester made it all the more special. The Foxes had been to the final on four occasions in their past and each time had come away empty handed, although the previous occasion was as far back as 1969. Tielemans goal means they can finally put the FA Cup trophy in their cabinet next to the Premier League trophy, three League Cups, Community Shield and eight title trophies from the second and third tiers. It also means that ground staff can change their corner flags from regular square ones to triangle ones, thanks to an unofficial tradition in English football. The tradition has no links to the FA's rules in anyway and clubs aren't strictly made to have square corner flags, but teams tend not to change unless they have won the FA Cup. According to Wikipedia, the tradition may come from Cardiff City's victory in the FA Cup in 1927, with the Welsh side adopting the triangular corner flags after beating Arsenal 1-0 at Wembley. The Bluebirds changed their flags to commemorate the win and supposedly to rub it in the faces of their rivals Swansea City, that they'd had some success. Some clubs are known to have triangular corner flags although Liverpool, despite winning the cup seven times, do not have them. AFC Wimbledon have adopted the winning corner flags despite the fact it was the original Wimbledon side who beat Liverpool to win the competition in 1988.

""For Vichai and for Top, this is what we have talked about for so many years and today, for the fans, it is amazing."" Youri Tielemans' thunderbolt was good enough to win any cup final and he also dedicated his strike to Vichai in a post-match interview. ""What a moment. I'm really happy with this. I can't think of a better goal than this,"" the Belgian international explained. ""I did it for all the Leicester fans. Khun's father would be very proud. It's his legacy. ""I'm really happy watching the fans from home. Now we can celebrate. Thank you VAR! What an amazing thing that is. It was tight, but it was offside (the Chelsea goal).

The idea is that, after years of speculation, Celtic and Rangers would head south to compete against the top clubs in England. According to the reports the Premier League feels it needs a shake up, with or without a Super League, and the top league in Scotland would instantly become more competitive without the two Glasgow powerhouses. Steven Gerrard ended nine years of Celtic domination earlier this season but if the two teams did move to England then that apparently wouldn't transfer so well. According to a Supercomputer, via the Sun, Celtic would be in 11th place after 32 games this season whilst Rangers would be down in 19th of the 22 teams. The bettingexpert.com computer worked out the table based on the two clubs points-per-game record against English opposition. A spokesperson for the website said, ""Rangers have typically struggled when facing Premier League opponents, but one caveat is their impressive title win this season, as well as a strong run in the Europa League that could give them a better chance in the Premier League than history suggests. ""Celtic have experienced a dip this year, but recent results against English clubs suggest they might be better suited to coping with a significant step up in quality."" Despite their historical advantage though, there is no doubt that Gerrard's current crop is better suited to the step up in quality than their cross city rivals. Not only did the Gers wrap up the title at the beginning of February, but they also proved their ability against teams in Europe by reaching the Europa League quarter finals. Former Spurs midfielder Jamie O'Hara believes that the Ibrox side would be the ones to stay up from the Premier League but thinks the Hoops would be relegated.

Loadingâ¦ The Old Firm rivals have been linked with a move to English football for years with many fans wondering how they'd fare in the Premier League. But Bennett has suggested both sides should be allowed in the EFL's competition as part of a massive shake-up. He told the Price of Football podcast: ""I think the Carabao Cup would be very interesting for the Old Firm to be invited to, but also to participate in because I think of the colour, the fans and the excitement it would bring. ""And I actually think the attraction it would bring to broadcasters. I'm not sure it's limited to the Old Firm. ""Could it be an invitation that's extended to, say, the top four clubs in any given season in the Scottish Premiership? ""I think that's something we should explore, it's something I'm keen to explore and I think it's something the EFL should be keen to explore. ""Forecasting is always a dangerous game but I'll give you this forecast - we would sell out our away allocation, no problem."" All 92 teams in the Premier League and EFL currently compete in the Carabao Cup, with EFL sides entering at the first round and top-flight sides not in Europe entering in the second. The third round is when teams competing in Europe enter. Manchester City are current holders of the trophy and have dominated since Pep Guardiola arrived in 2016. Victory over Tottenham Hotspur in April gave them their fourth consecutive win, as well as their sixth in eight seasons. Domestically, Rangers went unbeaten in 2020/2021 and they clinched their first Scottish Premiership in a decade. Manager Steven Gerrard has become a popular figure at Ibrox since arriving as a rookie manager. He told Sky Sports: ""As a kid, I thought it was one club for life. ""I've come through at Liverpool and had a career there which I'm immensely proud of. I came up here with my eyes wide open to learn about the club. ""I had a good idea from the outside but this has grabbed me. It's a club like very few in the world. This has got a special place in my heart. I'm happy here. I had to make a lot of sacrifices family wise, but I want more."" Celtic finished 25 points behind Rangers and parted company with boss Neil Lennon at the end of the season. Ange Postecoglou has since been confirmed as their new manager. ",positive,liverpool,1

The 79-year-old iconic Scot managed a plethora of world-class talent during his time in the United dugout, which included the likes of Paul Scholes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Eric Cantona. Loadingâ¦ Gascoigne is fondly remembered by fans and enjoyed successful spells at Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Middlesbrough and Everton. The 53-year-old ex-England international was once linked with a sensational move to Old Trafford in the late-1980s, but a move to United failed to materialise. During SPORTbible's interview hosted by United legend Gary Neville, Ferguson admitted ""without question"" that he wished the Red Devils had landed Gazza. The former United manager went on to praise Gascoigne as the ""best English player since Bobby Charlton."" Ferguson explained: ""Gascoigne, without question. I think he was the best English player since Bobby Charlton. I think he was a fantastic player. ""Unfortunately, we didn't get him and I think, looking back now, he made a big mistake. He recognised it himself years later. ""But we had Geordies in the camp. We had Bobby Charlton, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, even Gary Pallister from Middlesbrough. ""We had people there who would have taken care of him, particularly Bryan Robson who is fantastic with players. ""Instead, he goes to an island in London, and you're easily swallowed up there as a young lad. I think that was a big mistake by him. ""He was a marvellous player. I loved his strength. We played Newcastle up there and he had just come back from injury ""As soon as he came back, they started winning games. I played three in the middle of the pitch -- Whiteside, Robson and Remi Moses and he destroyed them. ""He nutmegged Moses right in front of the dugout and patted him on the head. ""He was unbelievable and I said to [former Manchester United chairman] Martin Edwards on the way home: 'Sign this boy. Get on the phone to him on Monday.' ""And by that time, he had already done a deal with Tottenham, which was really unfortunate. ""That was a disappointment because he agreed to sign and then Tottenham changed his mind by buying his mother and father a house."" Ferguson's remarkable life will be the focus of the eagerly awaited documentary film Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In.

To celebrate the club's 150th anniversary, a team of Rangers legends went up against a pretty decent World XI, with the likes of Luis Figo, Nuno Gomes, Ricardo Quaresma [who scored a Trivela, obviously] and Kaka featuring. The second biggest cheer of the afternoon arrived when Gascoigne, who spent three years in Glasgow between 1995 and 1998, replaced Michael Mols in the 80th minute. And the biggest cheer of the afternoon happened minutes later; when the 54-year-old managed to beat former England goalkeeper David James with a relatively tame effort. Who is cutting onions in here? A number of Gers legends returned to be part of the squad, including Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Jorg Albertz, Barry Ferguson and Ronald De Boer, who all pulled on the famous blue once again. Rangers opened the scoring on Saturday through Shota Arveladze, but former Spain international Carlos Marchena equalised for the World XI. Nuno Gomes then made it 2-1 before former Barcelona, Inter Milan and Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma made it three with a trademark Trivela strike. Just check this out. Rangers managed to pull one back through Gascoigne, who grabbed the headlines with his appearance at Ibrox, but it wasn't enough as Luis Figo's side came out on top. Still, we got to see a Gascoigne goal and after the final whistle, former manager Alex McLeish said 'Gazza' was reduced to tears by the reception. ""The banter was brilliant,"" McLeish said. ""I told them: 'That's a pretty tasty team in there, guys, be careful' but as I said, we'll get them when we go away and beat them then! ""When you come back, everything drifts back in your memory of all the really good times you've had. ""Craig Moore, the boys were buzzing. Gazza, there was a tear in his eye before the game. And coming on, the reception he got and getting the goal, again he was shedding a tear or two."" It was great to see Gascoigne on the pitch again after some difficult times.

It has been a wild month for the former AC Milan and Rangers midfielder, who left his job as Fiorentina's first-team manager on Thursday because of a reported row with the club's owners over transfers. The surprising news came just 23 days after he was appointed. But it appears the 43-year-old could step into a new role sooner rather than later, with Spurs ready to appoint the Italian as Jose Mourinho's successor. That's according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, who claims Gattuso has been identified as the ""ideal"" candidate for the vacant position previously held on and interim basis by Ryan Mason. Former Roma boss Paulo Fonseca was expected to take over at the North London side after days of negotiations but those talks broke down at an advanced stage, with tax reasons being cited as a reason behind the collapse. Gennaro Gattuso is now odds-on to become the next Tottenham manager pic.twitter.com/88mu8sq3jD In fact, Fonseca had already verbally agreed terms over a two-year contract with Spurs before the deal was called off because of financial issues, claim Sky Italia. According to The Athletic, Gattuso's sudden departure from Fiorentina alerted Tottenham's new managing director Fabio Paratici. It comes after the club failed to strike a deal with former manager Mauricio Pochettino after trying to make contact with the current Paris Saint-Germain boss. It was also reported earlier this month that former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was in 'advanced talks' to replace Mourinho but he was 'unconvinced' by the Spurs project.

The Italian had been in conversation with Tottenham about the vacant role. However there was a backlash from some Spurs fans as past comments of Gattuso - on subjects such as same-sex marriage, racism and women in football - began circulating on social media. Now Gattuso is definitely out of the running, report The Athletic. But the failure to once again make an appointment - after talks with Antonio Conte, then Paulo Fonseca, broke down - have left the club looking as though it is in absolute chaos. The total indecision on a new full-time manager after Jose Mourinho was sacked in April was branded ""beyond Spursy"" by Telegraph journalist Matt Law, who listed some of the main candidates linked to the role. Julian Nagelsmann, Brendan Rodgers, Hansi Flick, Erik ten Hag, a returning Mauricio Pochettino, plus Conte, Fonseca and Gattuso are all listed. Nagelsmann, Rodgers, Flick, Ten Hag, Pochettino, Conte, Fonseca, Gattuso...have I missed anyone? This is beyond Spursy. The sheer diversity of managers spoken to - or considered strongly for the position - does present, from the outside, the look a club that is in a state of total confusion behind the scenes. The club made the decision to get rid of Mourinho and Ryan Mason was only ever likely to a temporary appointment, it isn't a great sign that chairman Daniel Levy and co. did not have a replacement plan lined up. Or at least, not one that worked. 3 more and Spurs can put a manager's XI team. https://t.co/VZhDaGVOZU They'll be after Sol Campbell by the end of the week! https://t.co/TjOfJ2B6qA Spurs are a circus :sob: https://t.co/O0UUyD6NFh Wish we could just go back to Fonseca at this point Only manager they haven't tried for is Ted Lasso.

Both teams were packed with superstars with the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Juan Sebastian Veron, Roy Keane, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Iker Casillas, Roberto Carlos Zinedine Zidane and Guti amongst the starters. However it wasn't any of those men who stole the show it was of course the greatest of all time...O'Shea! Oh sure 'R9' might have earned a standing ovation for his part to play in the match but really, who can forget ultimate utility man O'Shea getting one over on 2000 Ballon d'Or winner Figo, truly masterful skill!

Millions watching at home leapt from their sofas. John Francis O'Shea just nutmegged one of the greatest players of a generation! It's a moment that really should go down in the annals of history. Sure, to the English, April 23rd is St George's Day but to the Irish it is celebrated as John O'Shea Day! Why is there no statue of the great moment outside of Old Trafford? Another shining example of the malaise the Glazers have allowed at United! O'Shea made his debut in 1999 and went on to win 14 major honours during his time at Old Trafford. The former Sunderland player played in literally every position during his time with the Manchester club, which helped earn his cult hero status. He went in goal against Spurs in the last few minutes, after they'd used up all their subs and following an injury, and he scored against Arsenal in the match best remembered for Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira's pre match argument. But the incredible scene involving Figo, like a scene out of a movie, will be many people's favourite memory of the Irishman. The former defender will never be in any dream XI's but Sir Alex Ferguson absolutely loved O'Shea and could always depend on him to do a job in either defence or midfield. ",positive,liverpool,0

Terry is one of England's most successful players of the last 20 years, after winning 17 major honours across a glittering spell with Chelsea that included: five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Community Shields, one Champions League and one Europa League title each.The former Blues and England captain was welcomed to the platform by former England cricketer and big Chelsea fan, Kevin Pietersen. He said: ""A warm welcome to a captain who would have laughed his head off at how poor Man Utd are, having watched the former champions well beaten by Man City at home,"" in quotes published by talkSPORT. Terry replied: ""Thanks mate. Two teams who are worlds apart. Man City are a joy to watch in possession, and a great example to teams nowhere near as good as them out of possession. ""[Manager Pep Guardiola] drives and demands that from every single player, every ship needs one captain and he is the best."" Terry clearly enjoyed the banter which flowed his way and certainly gave as good as he got, after being trolled by Man United fans who referenced the skipper's agonising defeat in the 2008 Champions League Final.  The former Aston Villa assistant manager was pictured crying in Moscow following the defeat in a tweet shared by a United fan, to which he replied: ""That's the Man Utd fans after today and realising your (sic) 5 years away from catching Chelsea.""  Meanwhile, there was an even cheekier dig directed at Terry made by a Newcastle United fan in response to Pietersen's welcome tweet, which said: ""Best make sure wife doesn't follow him."" The former Blues' skipper brilliantly, but rather harshly shut down the fan and replied: ""Your safe David, just seen yours on your account."" This also included a crying laughing and a pig emoji.

Loadingâ¦ Terry was criticised by Chris Bryant, after the former Chelsea captain posted a picture with him alongside Abramovich, in the wake of the announcement the Russian would sell the club. The 55-year-old made the decision in the wake of Vladimir Putin declaring war on Ukraine, with the possibility of sanctions against the billionaire hanging over him. Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, in Wales, was the first politician to call for sanctions on the Blues owner to include seizing the Premier League club off him. After that he wasn't happy with Terry's social media post, and now the ex England centre back has responded, criticising Bryant's role in the expenses scandal and voting on the Iraq war.

Also the same MP who voted that we invade Iraq,"" Terry tweeted in reply to a Chelsea fan who had defended the 41-year-old. 100% mate ðThe same MP that claimed fortunes in expenses of the tax payers money. Also the same MP who voted that we invade Iraq. ð¤¡ Abramovich's era at Stamford Bridge began in 2003 and he has seen unprecedented success in west London since his arrival, for a team that were previously only top four challengers and occasional cup winners. They won their first Premier League title in 2005, the first time they were English champions in 50 years and they've gone on to win five league titles in all. The billionaire also helped the team win several FA Cup and League Cup trophies, and have captured two Champions Leagues and two Europa League titles. It's no surprise that his players have backed the Russian, despite everything that's going on in the world, especially as he continues to deny any involvement with Putin. Fans have also been upset with the news that their owner, who has brought all the success back to Stamford Bridge in the past 19 years, is having to sell. Club legend Pat Nevin has criticised those fans, and past players, for their 'tears' and told them to 'put the violins away' over the team having to find a new owner.

The five time champions are in for a fight with Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, with the two sides having only lost three times in the league between them so far. Most people wouldn't see too many frailties with either side, but Guardiola has been extremely frank in saying that his team aren't particularly good defenders. Asked whether his City side are as good as his Barcelona team, which won two Champions League titles in three years, at keeping possession, the former Barca boss said, ""Itâs the ball. If you see our players individually, we are not good defenders. We are not. ""So individually Bernardo [Silva], [Ilkay] Gundogan, Kevin [De Bruyne], Raz [Raheem Sterling], Riyad [Mahrez], even Joao [Cancelo], Aleks [Oleksandr Zinchenko], we are not good defenders. ""But we have the ball. The ball is the only reason why you are stable. What you do with it - itâs the only reason. ""You create chances, itâs the ball. You concede few, itâs the ball. Itâs how you play in the middle of the game - if the midfield players handle that, youâll be stable behind and positive up front. ""Without that, the same players will concede a lot of chances."" On Boxing Day, his players partially helped prove the theory, as they faced Leicester City at the Etihad in a crazy game with eight goals. The hosts rushed to a 4-0 lead inside the opening half an hour, thanks in part to two penalties, and they should have had more goals before half time. However Leicester got back into the game with three goals, to tease a possible repeat of Cheick Tiote's famous goal in Newcastle United's 4-4 draw with Arsenal, proving the team can't defend, only for City to twice more and make it 6-3. Speaking about how his team play football, Guardiola also compared his team to Jurgen Klopp's and suggested the one part of the Reds' game that makes them most dangerous was something City couldn't match. ""We cannot attack quicker. We are not Liverpool. They are masters at that, we are not,"" the 50-year-old added. ""We donât know what we have to do with that. We know we have to drive, to drive, to drive and to play with the ball. ""...Patience doesnât mean lazy, slow. Itâs the ball. If you have the ball, you are in order and everything is stable. Stability is the ball. Itâs not about defending 40 metres behind or 40 metres up front, or high pressing, or defending, or long balls, or whatever. ""To be stable as a team, itâs the ball, no more than that."" ",positive,liverpool,2

But the likes of Terry Butcher and Tony Adams would be unlikely to survive in today's game. The role of the old-fashioned stopper and header of crosses has evolved into a ball-playing footballer with lightning defensive reflexes and a sixth sense for sniffing out danger before it happens. Here we pick our top 10 centre-backs in the world. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: It's hard to believe that the same player that made 260 appearances for Southampton and 60 for Crystal Palace had arguably his best season at the age of 37. Captaining a Lille side that won its first Ligue 1 title since 2010/11, the 6ft 3in veteran provided key leadership for Christophe Galtier's young team. His form was rewarded with a place in Fernando Santos' Portugal squad for Euro 2021. 2020/21 Season Stats: Watchers of Euro 2021 would have seen Aymeric Laporte's trademark cross-field switch time and again in the tournament as he and his Spanish teammates progressed to the semi-finals. Manchester City fans will hope that his performance at the championships doesn't give him itchy feet despite Barcelona's recent interest dwindling. The left-footer looked set to form a dream team with Ruben Dias at the heart of Pep Guardiola's defence only for COVID and injury to allow John Stones' renaissance to begin. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 32-year-old German may be on the verge of international retirement but the 2020/21 season proved he has plenty in the tank in domestic football. The 2014 World Cup-winner led Dortmund in blocks, aerial battles won, clearances and interceptions, was the second most prolific tackler and third most accurate passer. Oh and he chipped in with five Bundesliga goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: A year ago, John Stones looked to be an afterthought for both Pep Guardiola and England's Gareth Southgate. On the outside of the England squad, looking in, Manchester City had just splurged Â£61million on Benfica's Portugal star Ruben Dias. With Nathan Ake incoming and Aymeric Laporte in place, Stones' City career seemed to be slipping away. But his partnership with Dias gelled instantly when thrust together in November as Stones returned to the classy, ball-playing 26-year-old that caught the eye of Guardiola before he joined City and the duo helped the Premier League champions to 19 clean sheets. 2020/21 Season Stats: Notable in their absence from this top 10 are former Spain mainstays Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique. Pique's 2020/21 season was error- and injury-filled while Ramos was let go by Real Madrid after 16 extraordinary years. Part of the reason for that was the presence of Frenchman Varane. With the ideal build for a central defender, he's able to outmuscle attackers but is also cultured enough to play out from the back, which he did for France at Euro 2021, completing 271 of his 288 passes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Not blessed with tremendous pace, Slovakian Milan Skriniar uses his 6ft 2in frame, timing and positional awareness to get the job done. As a passer, his skills are up there with the best and he's been pushed into central midfield for Slovakia at times. On their way to ending their 11-year title drought, Skriniar and co conceded a league-low 35 goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: There were worries over the fitness of Manchester United captain Harry Maguire going into Euro 2021 but after missing the first two group games, he slipped in alongside John Stones and calmly led England to three more clean sheets and a semi-final victory. One of the leaders in Gareth Southgate's camp, the world's most expensive defender was dominant in 2020/21 for United, finishing second among Premier League defenders in aerial battles won. 2020/21 Season Stats: It's a mark of the immense talent of Virgil van Dijk that he's still in the top three of this list after a season in which he started just five Premier League matches and missed Euro 2021 entirely. The horror tackle from Jordan Pickford in the Merseyside derby in October sent van Dijk to the surgeon's table and left Liverpool's championship defence needing medical intervention for the rest of the season. He's expecting to join Jurgen Klopp's side for preseason training in July but acknowledges that he's faced ""a long road"" and may not be fully up to speed come season kick-off. 2020/21 Season Stats: Centre-back is not perhaps the position you immediately associate Brazilian footballers with but Marquinhos has followed in the footsteps of Lucio, Aldair, Luis Perieira and former PSG teammate Thiago Silva as a defensive rock. His technical ability and agility ensure he stands out even on a team of galacticos like Mbappe, Verrati and Neymar. An elegant defender with a Brazilian's comfort on the ball, the PSG captain scored three times in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League and netted for Brazil in the first game of their Copa America campaign, where they conceded just two goals on the way to the final. 2020/21 Season Stats: Pep Guardiola had spent freely in an attempt to solidify the Manchester City defence since his arrival in 2016, but it wasn't until last year's arrival of Ruben Dias that he solved the issue. Dias had a similar effect on the Mancunians that Virgil van Dijk had on Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in 2018 as his composure helped power his team to the title. At ease bringing the ball out, he's seldom caught out defensively, using his anticipation to nick possession either with a tackle or interception. His maiden season at City was crowned with Football Writers' Association and Premier League Player of the Season awards.

The Manchester United left-back conjured up a superb showing for the Three Lions in the 4-0 Euro 2020 quarter-final win over Ukraine in Rome. Loadingâ¦ Shaw set up two goals in quick succession during the resounding victory, following up an assist for Raheem Sterling in the historic 2-0 win over Germany at Wembley days earlier. He's been likened to legendary Brazil and Real Madrid defender Carlos by fans for a while now but it's not only the supporters who are jumping on the moniker. In a video posted on England's Twitter, Declan Rice can be heard by calling his teammate 'Roberto Shaw' before skipper Harry Kane got involved and said, ""Shawberto"". A separate clip from the Lions Den series saw Jadon Sancho join in when he namechecked Shaw after picking Carlos as the full-back he would have the most difficulty playing against. ""We got Shawberto Carlos here, Luke Shaw, yes we do,"" Sancho said. Carlos himself gave Shaw the ultimately seal of approval for his sensational performance on Saturday night. After the Southampton youth product posted on Instagram, the 48-year-old responded with a slew of clapping emojis. Having put his injury and fitness problems behind him, Shaw has been incredibly consistent for the past couple of seasons. But in terms of the Carlos comparisons, Shaw played them down when he was asked about them earlier this year. ""I'll be honest I've seen some things on it on social media and sometimes in my group chats my mates send me some stuff and I just laugh about it!"" Shaw told ManUtd.com. ""I can't be compared to him, he was unbelievable! ""I'm aware of it and it's nice to be even mentioned alongside his name, but I just laugh about it!"" ",positive,liverpool,0

Shaw's performances have been key to England's progress to the semi-finals, none more so than his two assists in Saturday's last-eight victory over Ukraine. The Manchester United man took to social media after the game to celebrate England's win and among those to respond was Brazil icon Roberto Carlos, widely recognised as the greatest left-sided defender in history who tweeted a number of clapping hands emojis. Luke Shaw Roberto CarlosGame recognise game. pic.twitter.com/xRdBoatxlZ  ""His [Shaw's] delivery was great,"" said England boss Gareth Southgate after the Ukraine win. ""We talked a lot in the week about set-piece goals and we put more emphasis on it. ""It looked like we would be dangerous in training and usually that transfers into the game and that's what happened.""  Luke Shaw provided more assists in 3m 51s vs Ukraine than Zinedine Zidane did in 14 appearances at the Euros  Coming off the back of a superb season at United, Shaw is arguably in the form of his life right now. The 25-year-old has been revitalised under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after a torrid time during Jose Mourinho's tenure, with the Portuguese regularly criticising Shaw in public. It's a feud that continues to rumble to this day. Shaw's two assists in four minutes are as many as he managed in 2542 of them in the Premier League under Mourinho. How apt that they came in his old manager's new backyard of Roma's Stadio Olimpico, although Mourinho did begrudgingly admit that Shaw had a good game.  Manchester United will offer Luke Shaw a new contract in the next months. He's considered a key player and Solskjaer wants Luke to be 100% involved in the project. :red_circle: #MUFCThere's still nothing agreed with AC Milan for Diogo Dalot. Trippier price tag from Atleti - always â¬40m.  Meanwhile, United are reportedly lining up a fresh contract offer for Shaw to reward the star for his stellar season. According to reporter Fabrizio Romano, Shaw could be offered a new deal in the next few months with Solskjaer seeing the former Southampton man as a key part of a project to challenge for the Premier League title. Shaw featured 47 times at left-back under Solskjaer last term in all competitions, providing six assists and scoring once. ",positive,liverpool,0

Gareth Southgate's men will face underdogs Denmark on Wednesday night after goals from Harry Kane (2), Harry Maguire and Jordan Henderson sealed their place in the semi-final stages of Euro 2020. It was a dominant performance from start to finish from in-form England and, like he has done on numerous occasions this tournament, full-back Luke Shaw played a key part throughout.

Then just minutes later, Shaw assisted Harry Kane with a scooped cross from the left to make it three. In fact, in the three minutes and 51 seconds it took to record two assists in the quarter-final clash, Shaw achieved a quite remarkable stat involving Zinedine Zidane. You can see it below, posted by Duncan Alexander. Luke Shaw provided more assists in 3m 51s vs Ukraine than Zinedine Zidane did in 14 appearances at the Euros That's right. The 25-year-old recorded more assists against Ukraine than Zinedine Zidane did in 14 appearances for France at the European Championship. After the final whistle, Shaw played down the Zidane stat in his post-match interview, calling it a 'strange' one. ""A very strange stat,"" he laughed. ""A nice one, I think. Obviously, Zidane was one of the best midfielders ever and I can't compare to him, like I've said before about different people. ""It's a nice stat to obviously hear but the most important thing for me tonight was reaching the semi-final, getting another game at Wembley in front of our own crowd and hopefully making them happy again.

The experienced four-time Champions League winner has officially completed a reported Â£42 million move from Real Madrid after passing a medical at Carrington earlier this week. And after penning a four-year deal at the club, Varane was presented as a Manchester United player on Saturday afternoon before-kick off. Goosebumps. With three La Liga titles to his name, the French centre-back will certainly bring a wealth of experience to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in the coming months. The 28-year-old has picked up 79 appearances for France and was, of course, part of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018. Former Manchester United centre-back Rio Ferdinand is a huge fan of Varane but he also questioned whether the Frenchman will be able to adapt to the quicker and more direct style of play of some Premier League teams. ""He's got to understand the English game is very different. You've got to go to Burnley and places like that,"" he said on Rio Ferdinand Presents FIVE. ""Sometimes it can be up and at 'em, a different style of football in the Premier League to anything he's played in before. Can he deal with it? They're the questions he's going to get asked. ""Balls getting wrapped around his ear holes, crosses from different angles that he hasn't seen on a consistent basis in Spain where they play more on the floor, slower football, slower build up. ""So he's going to be asked to defend in a different way and that's where he's going to have to show his real class, can he adapt? That""s the real question. ""I genuinely believe he's got the tools to do that."" Former Manchester City and England full-back Danny Mills thinks it may take some time for Varane to adapt to life in the Premier League. Take a look at his thoughts below. This isn't the first time Mills has expressed concern about whether the centre-back will be able to adjust to life in England's top tier. In an interview with talkSPORT, the 44-year-old questioned whether Varane is robust enough for Premier League action. ""If all those other teams [in the Premier League] are getting stronger, they're more likely to take points off Manchester United as well,"" the former Manchester City full-back said. ""Their away record, Manchester United, was superb [last season], wasn't it? I don't think that's going to be the same [in the coming season] with fans back in grounds and everything else that's happening. ""You know, Varane is a good player, but again we don't know what he's gonna be like, how robust he's gonna be in the Premier League week in, week out."" ",positive,liverpool,0

On Tuesday United announced they had agreed a deal with Real for the 28-year-old, with the transfer set to officially go through once a medical and final personal terms have been completed after a mandatory quarantine period is observed. Loadingâ¦ Varane's transfer fee is said to be an initial Â£39 million and he will also be among United's highest-paid players once he puts pen to paper on a four-year deal. However, James Ducker from The Telegraph reports that Varane turned down a healthier pay packet at Los Blancos. Real were desperate to extend Varane's stay at the Santiago Bernabeu and offered him a significant pay rise. They presented many proposals and then tabled a final offer in March of this year. It was much better - financially - than what United will be paying him but Varane, despite even being in contention to become Real's new captain, was keen on a new challenge and so knocked back the offer. Fast forward a few months and Varane is now on his way to United, ten years on from when the club tried to sign him back when he was a rising prospect at RC Lens. Varane comes with a wealth of experience at the highest level, with Champions League and World Cup winners medals in his collection. And United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is understandably delighted over the capture, which follows on from the Â£73 million signing of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. ""Of course very happy that we've managed to get a deal with Real Madrid,"" Solskjaer told MUTV on Wednesday. ""The medical should hopefully be OK and he's a proven winner. He's a player we've followed for many, many years. ""I know Sir Alex (Ferguson) was very, very close to signing him, so this time around we've got him at the other end of his career. ""He's proved over his whole career what a good person he is first of all, professional and he's won what there is to win. I'm very happy getting both our players in."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Varane had been expected to join United from Real Madrid for much of the summer, with the two clubs having agreed a fee a couple of weeks ago, but there had been a delay in the announcement. On Saturday afternoon, the Premier League club finally revealed that the France centre back had officially signed, in the best possible fashion, as they presented him on the pitch ahead of the first game of the campaign, against Leeds United. During the presentation Varane held up his brand new United shirt with the number 19 on the back of it, a departure from the number five he wore with Real, and the number four he wears for France. According to the Manchester Evening News, the 28-year-old did request the number four shirt from Jones but the defender, who hasn't played for nearly 19 months. Jones has had injury troubles in the past but has also completely fallen out of favour at the club under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and is fifth choice at best. His chances of playing were partially boosted by Axel Tuanzebe's loan move to Aston Villa, but with Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Eric Bailly and now Varane ahead of him it's unlikely he'll play at all. The 29-year-old's most recent performance came in a 6-1 win over Tranmere in the FA Cup, in January 2020, and his most recent league game was a 2-0 loss to Burnley just a few days prior. In the past two years he has only started two league games for United but his contract doesn't expire until July 2023, and it seems unlikely anyone will buy him right now. Varane's number 19 was worn by Amad Diallo in the second half of last season but the winger has now been given number 16, he is expected to go out on loan this season. âï¸ He's here.

Roy Keane is NOT happy with Man Utd pair Harry Maguire and Raphael Varane wearing gloves during their pre-match warm-up routine ð¡ð§¤ pic.twitter.com/YBBDtacSFn Keane vented: ""Are they gloves? Are they wearing gloves? Is that what Iâm seeing? Am I seeing things? Thatâs a great message, yeah."" Presenter Kelly Cates then stuck up for the pair by stating: ""Maybe theyâve just got cold hands."" That saw Keane reply with: ""Two big strong centre-halves, I donât mind full-backs [wearing gloves] but your two centre-halves."" There'll never be a more Roy Keane sentence than that, will there? For those concerned about what players wear, Varane kept his gloves on for the game and also wore an undershirt. Maguire ditched the gloves and sported his usual short sleeve shirt. United ran out 3-2 winners thanks to a stunning Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick. Ronaldo opened the scoring inside 12 minutes with an incredible strike from outside the penalty area. Tottenham made it 1-1 through Harry Kane's penalty before Ronaldo scored his second of the game three minutes later. An own goal from Maguire in the second half saw Spurs level once again, but Ronaldo popped up with a crucial header nine minutes from time to seal all three points. Keane did end up defending Maguire for his part in the own goal during his post-match analysis, despite 'Glovegate' a few hours prior. Sergio Reguilon's cross was intended for Cristian Romero and the England international had to do everything he could to stop the cross reaching him. ""You just canât be too critical of Maguire,"" Keane admitted. ""I've been critical of him, but heâs doing his best, itâs an honest mistake. These things happen in football."" He also took issue with Romero celebrating the own goal right in Maguire's face. The Irishman said after watching the footage back: ""Not good, no, no, no. You remember. When youâre a player you take note of that, donât worry. ""You take note of that."" United are back up to fourth in the Premier League, but have played four more games than Arsenal in fifth.

The Man United captain failed to keep out the ball which set up Pasalic and lost his marker from a corner kick moments later. The Italian visitors took the lead through their Croatian midfielder who scored from close range. Maguire's defensive position was slammed by fans as the Serie A club opened the scoring in the 15th minute. Atalanta made it 2-0 from a set-piece, with Demiral heading home after Maguire lost his man. Again, the England international was subject to criticism for his defending.

Check out their embrace below. Loadingâ¦ Brady announced his shock return to the NFL on Sunday, confirming he'll be playing his 23rd season. The 44-year-old called time on his career after two years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but he'll be starring in Tampa once again. Interestingly, Brady was asked about his status by Ronaldo after watching United defeat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 on Saturday. Ronaldo gave his match-worn shirt to Brady's son and asked the five-time Super Bowl VIP: ""Youâre finished, right?"" Brady didn't reply and instead let out a wry smile. The writing was on the wall then and there. Ronaldo turned 37 last month and scored the second hat-trick of his Red Devils career to keep United's top four hopes alive. Supporters are convinced Brady saw that performance in the flesh and chose to make a swift career U-turn all because of 'CR7'. One commented: ""If Tom Brady went to watch Messi instead of Ronaldo heâd still be in retirement."" Another said: ""Ronaldo knew about Brady before any of us."" A third put: ""Brady saw Ronaldo going crazy and said run that s**t back."" While someone tweeted: ""Tom Brady saw one Ronaldo masterclass and came outta retirement."" Brady is one of the most successful American footballers in history, winning seven Super Bowls. Six of those came with the New England Patriots while he won one with the Buccaneers. The tweet announcing his return has amassed over 540,000 likes at the time of writing and it reads: ""These past two months Iâve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands. ""That time will come. But itâs not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. ""They make it all possible. Iâm coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG."" The Buccaneers are owned by the Glazer family, who also own United, which is why Brady was a guest of honour for this weekend's contest. Signing Brady back could come at a big cost however, as the two-time Super Bowl champions are over the $11 million salary cap right now. Key players Rob Gronkowski, Leonard Fournette and Ndamukong Suh are all set to become free agents. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Red Devils kicked off their Premier League campaign with an emphatic 5-1 demolition of Leeds United at Old Trafford. Loadingâ¦ However, United failed to build on their opening momentum after they salvaged a 1-1 draw against Southampton at the St Mary's on Sunday. The Red Devils splashed out this summer to secure Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund in a hefty Â£73m deal and Raphael Varane from Real Madrid in a Â£34m transfer. Kane has been subject to intense transfer speculation linking him with Premier League champions Manchester City this summer. The 28-year-old wantaway Tottenham striker, who is under contract with Spurs until 2024, revealed his desire to exit his boyhood club. However, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is playing hardball in the Kane transfer saga and demanding a hefty Â£160m fee for the England captain. Neville has questioned why United are not in the race to sign Kane before the transfer window shuts on 31st August. The 46-year-old Sky Sports pundit believes that United âcould do withoutâ Martial, Lingard, Dan James and Juan Mata. Read More: Speaking on Monday Night Football, Neville said: âMy gut feeling is no -- they wonât have the same impact on Manchester United as [Virgil] Van Dijk and Alisson [at Liverpool] to get them up to 90-95 points they will need to win the league.

Sanchoâs Â£70million was last yearâs money.

Because if I think Harry Kane entered Manchester United, you could get up to 90-95 points, without him [they wonât]. âTheyâre still going to have to replace [Edinson] Cavani and Martial next summer. Martialâs not going to do it, Cavani has only got one year left [on his contract]. âTheyâre going to have to buy a centre forward at some point.

Manchester City have been touted as one potential destination for Pogba, with manager Pep Guardiola previously describing the midfielder as a âtop, top playerâ. Guardiola once claimed he had been offered the chance to sign the World Cup winner by his agent Mino Raiola back in 2018. âTwo months ago he offered me (Henrikh) Mkhitaryan and Pogba to play with us,â said Guardiola. âHe was interested in Mkhitaryan and Pogba to play with us.

It has prompted plenty of debate on Twitter, with fans accusing of Rangnick of not sticking to his guns, while others called for him to play a 4-2-3-1 that was favoured by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

The aforementioned draw with Newcastle saw another insipid performance from the Red Devils, who were lucky to leave St James' Park with a point.

Mundo Deportivo reported that Barca's football director Mateu Alemany and CEO Ferran Reverter made an enquiry about the Frenchman during a recent business trip to Manchester, meaning Martial's largely disappointing spell at Old Trafford could end soon. The 25-year-old has struggled for game time this season after only making nine appearances across all competitions, and scoring once in a 1-1 draw with Everton in October. Xavi is also a fan of Martial, and he may head to Catalonia as soon as January, which could be on a loan deal. The former Monaco man has struggled for consistency since arriving at the club in a Â£36million deal in September 2015, despite scoring a superb goal on his Premier League debut against Liverpool. In total, he has found the net 79 times and registered 50 assists in 267 appearances for the club, with his finest season coming in the 2019/20 campaign. He scored 23 goals in 48 appearances across all competitions, as United secured a Champions League spot on the final day of the season. But he failed to continue that form in 2020/21, as a knee injury halted his progress and he scored only 7 goals in 37 appearances. New interim manager Ralf Rangnick will hold the final say on Martial's future though, and it remains to be seen if he features in the German's plans. His current contract at Old Trafford runs until June 2024 and is valued at Â£31.5million according to transfermarkt, so it will be interesting to see if the cash-strapped Catalans can strike a deal for the forward.

Wolves completely nullified United's threat and manager Bruno Lage expertly broke down their tactics post-match. Since Rangnick was appointed as interim manager of the 13-time Premier League winners following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the 63-year-old has been deploying a 4-2-2-2 formation.

And ahead of the FA Cup third round clash with Aston Villa, Rangnick has hinted at a switch to a back three. Loadingâ¦ However, he believes the system change would depend on having centre-backs fit and available. ""Well, I think most teams have their system in England and they stick to it,""Rangnick told the club's official website, as per the Manchester Evening News. ""But there are also teams who switch from a back three to a back four, or from a back four to a back three, or even like Bayern Munich, for example, or Leipzig also did it last season with Julian Nagelsmann, even if they play defensively in a back four, they try to rotate within this system, this formation, to a little bit of an asymmetric back three. ""I think with our team, we have those two options, in order to play with a back three, we need to have most of our centre-backs available, I think even under Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], the team did it, for example in games like Tottenham, Atalanta away, or against Manchester City, in the derby. ""I think we can play in the back three, this could be an option for us, but, as I said, it also depends on the players available, on the current shape and form of the players and also, to a certain extent, to the team against which we are playing.""

To add to that expected top four finish, the Reds are actually set to receive a trophy at the end of their league campaign as the cleanest club. Liverpool have only picked up 38 yellow cards this season and not a single red card. That puts them well behind, or ahead depending how you look at it, of second place Burnley, who have 47 yellows and also no reds.

""When you are a centre-back and a great centre-back - and he is a great centre-back - the great ones just don't play their own game, they almost play other people's games and they're always talking to people, moving people about and they're in charge of a back-four. ""John Stones next to him is 27-28 and you feel like it's the other way around with John Stones and that's no disrespect to John Stones. Just looking at the stats, 31 clean sheets this season and you've got to go back to the 28th minute of the first leg for the last time PSG had a shot on target. ""In the other semi-final you've got two of the greatest centre-backs of their generation hopefully playing in Thiago Silva and [Sergio] Ramos, they're coming towards the end. ""We have seen van Dijk over the last couple of years win the Champions League. I think the new breed is coming and this guy [Dias] is a massive part of it. The biggest thing for a centre-back, in terms of body position, I think he's the best by a long way in the Premier League."" When asked if Dias could reach van Dijk's level in the future, Carra replied: ""Without a doubt. I think in his first season that he has produced at Man City, I think he's at that level. What I would say is that van Dijk has been blessed with physical attributes that Dias hasn't so in some ways I'm more impressed with Dias. ""When you watch van Dijk, it's like watching a Rolls-Royce, you just think the way he moves. 'Most players don't have that and Dias probably hasn't got that so probably has to concentrate more and be side on constantly."" ",positive,liverpool,1

The Reds' Champions League qualification hopes were handed a major boost on Tuesday after Chelsea's 2-1 victory over Leicester City at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool are fifth in the Premier League and are three points behind Leicester, though Klopp's men have a match in hand. Now, one Reds supporter has claimed that a top-four finish for Liverpool would eclipse their 2019-20 Premier League success and 2018-19 Champions League triumph. Speaking to talkSPORT, Liverpool fan 'Klobby' said: ""If we achieve the top four this year, I'm going to go as far as to say that it will the greater than winning the Premier League and the Champions League."" Jason Cundy hit back at the Liverpool fan's claim, saying that his side have been ""garbage"" and they have had the ""worst run"" of home matches. Responding to the talkSPORT host, 'Klobby' responded: ""Exactly... and look how many points we were behind Everton. ""This is not just me, I've spoken to my friends about it."" Liverpool have bounced back and built on their momentum by winning all three of their Premier League matches this month. The Reds defeated Southampton 2-0 at Anfield before sealing a sensational 4-2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Liverpool secured a superb 2-1 comeback on Sunday against West Brom at the Hawthorns thanks to a stunning injury-time header from Alisson. Klopp has stressed that securing Champions League football for next season would be ""one of the biggest achievements"" for Liverpool. Liverpool will return to action on Thursday as they clash with Burnley at Turf Moor.

In 17 years at Anfield, Gerrard played 710 times for the Merseyside club, captained them to Champions League success in 2005 and won multiple other honours with the club. He is often considered one of the best three midfielders the Premier League has seen, alongside Paul Scholes and Frank Lampard, and a bunch of quotes, via Give Me Sport, prove just how high esteem his fellow professionals held him in. Paolo Maldini - ""What I have always liked of Steven is that on the pitch he was very quiet, but was capable of inspiring all his team-mates with great strength, not so much with words,"" ""The real example - and that is what I've learned from players like Steven and Franco Baresi - is to do rather than talk. ""And he was indeed one who did a lot and since he also had great talent, he was easy to follow. His story is one of those stories to be told, one of those fairytales, to be narrated to your children and grandchildren."" Loadingâ¦ Pele - ""The fans, they look only for forwards, always a forward. Somebody who scores. Sometimes you have a player like Gerrard. For me, for the last five years Gerrard has been the best player in the world. ""He is a midfielder, he plays very good. People didn't mention Gerrard, now they mention Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Messi because they are forwards."" Thierry Henry - ""It was a disgrace he didn't win European Footballer of the Year after Istanbul in 2005 and, for me, he will be regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time."" Andrea Pirlo - ""While at Milan he Ancelotti came to me and said, 'I want to sign Steven Gerrard to play next to you in midfield - what do you think?' Without any hesitation I told him, 'Do it - go and sign him.' ""At this stage he was probably the most complete midfield player in Europe, of course I wanted to partner him. ""I remember asking Carlo a few weeks later how it was going, and he told me Gerrard had given a very firm no, that his bond with Liverpool was unbreakable. ""At the time Milan were the champions of Europe and probably had the best team in the world - it says a lot about Gerrard's loyalty."" Zinedine Zidane - ""There was a point when Gerrard was the best midfield player in the world. It is unusual to get complete midfield players who can do everything, but that is what he was."" Sir Alex Ferguson - ""If you were looking for the player you would replace Keane with, it would be Gerrard, without question. He has become the most influential player in England, bar none. More than Vieira. ""Not that Vieira lacks anything, but I think that Gerrard does more for his team than Vieira does, and has way more to his game. ""I've watched him quite a lot. To me, Gerrard is Keane. Everywhere the ball is, he seems to be there. He's got that unbelievable engine, desire, determination. Anyone would love to have Gerrard in their team."" Francesco Totti - ""Steven Gerrard would be the captain of my World XI dream team. Gerrard is a complete player because he can play in every position and can do everything with a football at any time in a game. ""He's a player who scores goals, who builds the play, he's a sensational player."" Zlatan Ibrahimovic - ""I think Steven Gerrard is a fantastic player. He has been loyal to his club, he has won some big trophies with the club. He feels more an international player rather than a normal English player. ""English players have big hearts, always fighting, very aggressive, but Gerrard, for me, feels more international. He has more skills than the normal player. ""Every time we play against Steven, the coach always says to be careful with that player because he is the player who makes the difference."" Kaka - ""I like Gerrard. Because we had this challenge between ourselves in 2005 and 2007, I really admire him. Of course, Lampard was pretty amazing, Scholes the classic. But I'll have Gerrard.""

Ramos will be joined by club president Florentino PÃ©rez at the ceremony before appearing before the media at a telematic press conference. The Spanish defender, who made 671 appearances for Real in 16 seasons, lifting 22 honours, has been linked with a move for some time but the question remains; who will he join next? It was reported last week that former club Sevilla have offered the 35-year-old centre-back a five-year deal. That proposal from the La Liga outfit includes the possibility of Ramos remaining at the club in a different capacity once he retires, according to Spanish outlet El Primero Palo, with a salary of â¬7 million per year on the table. Ramos has also been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United in recent months, as well as a surprise rumour involving Liverpool. Back in January, it was reported that Ramos wanted a move to Manchester United after a chat with club legend David Beckham, who told him about life at Old Trafford during their time together in Spain. And a few months later, he fueled the PSG transfer rumours by commenting on Neymar's contract extension, as well as following a host of their current players. Who should Ramos join next?

The video, titled 'Thank you for everything Sergio Ramos', chronicles his entire career since arriving from Sevilla in 2005. Ramos arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu as a 19-year-old full-back and while talented, he lacked the physicality and mentality we all know him for nowadays. He would eventually become a central defender and key figure in the team, making 671 appearances. The 35-year-old lifted 22 major honours during his time in the Spanish capital, including five La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.

Los Blancos confirmed on Wednesday that the 35-year-old centre-back would leave the Spanish club this summer. Loadingâ¦ Ramos' future was unclear last season ahead of his contract expiring at the end of June. But now the Spaniard will become a free agent after he bid his farewell to Madrid in his emotionally charged press conference on Thursday. Ramos' remarkable playing career at Madrid and on the international stage with Spain has made him one of the most formidable defenders in the world. The outgoing Madrid captain is also considered by some fans as one of the best defenders in history. However, some fans have dismissed the idea that Ramos could be considered the 'GOAT defender,' despite his success for club and country. Fans have flocked to Twitter to slam the world-class Spanish defender, with one supporter claiming that a prime Gerard Pique was better than a prime Ramos. Ramos lifted an impressive 22 major honours during his 16 years at the Santiago Bernabeu, which included five La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies. The Spain captain enjoyed silverware with his country as he captured two European Championship titles and lifted the World Cup in 2010. However, Ramos missed out on representing La Roja at Euro 2020 this summer after he failed to make Luis Enrique's 24-man squad for the competition. The 2010 World Cup winner has been linked with former club Sevilla alongside the likes of Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United. Ramos has already ruled out a potential move to Sevilla as he added that signing for Madrid's fierce rivals Barcelona would be ""impossible.""

Ronaldinho showed no love was lost with Ramos as he attempted to troll him on social media. The 41-year-old Brazilian superstar uploaded an image of the outgoing Madrid captain watching him strike the ball during an El Clasico match. Ronaldinho wrote on Twitter: ""Hey @SergioRamos - remember this night?!"" The 2005 Ballon d'Or winner might have been attempting to refer to his brace in Barcelona's 3-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu during the 2005-06 season. However, it appeared Ronaldinho used an image from the 2006-07 season when Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-0 at the Bernabeu. Ramos assisted Madrid legend Raul with a superb cross before Ruud van Nistelrooy sealed the win for Los Blancos.

Defender Ramos is searching for a new club after leaving Real upon the expiry of his contract following 16 seasons at the Bernabeu. Loadingâ¦ The 35-year-old has been strongly linked with PSG, but Eto'o believes the Camp Nou would be an ideal - if somewhat controversial - destination. As a PSG fan, Cameroonian Eto'o would also like Ramos to move to the French capital, but he suggested that Barcelona ought to make a move for the Madrid legend as they look to earn an elusive first Champions League title. Eto'o, who played for both Barca and Real, told AS: ""Hopefully Sergio goes to PSG. If I could sign him for Barca, I would. ""If he goes to PSG, I will be happy and I know that he will help us win the Champions League, which is proving very difficult for us."" Ramos picked up five red cards with Real's rivals over the years, but he also scored some memorable goals. However, he struggled for fitness last season after making just 15 league appearances. That lack of game time saw Luis Enrique leave Ramos out of his Spain squad for Euro 2020. ""It was a very difficult decision but he [Ramos] has not been able to play this season and has hardly trained since January,"" Enrique said. ""I called him - it was hard, difficult. ""I feel bad, because he is very professional, and he helps the national team a lot. And he can still help it in the future. But I have to look for the best for the squad.""

Whether thatâs through a key stop at a vital time or just filling a defensive unit with an extra level of confidence, the last line of defence is key. Here we pick our top 10 goalkeepers in the world right now. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings (clean sheets, save percentage, goals against and expected goals against), as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. If you enjoy this list, you may also like our list of the top 10 keepers of all time and our look at the best Premier League keepers of all time. All stats supplied by FBREF.com are for the 2020/21 domestic season and are correct as of the publish date More articles in this series: 2020/21 Season Stats: Following knee surgery and with a suddenly old and leaky defence in front of him, ter Stegenâs form took a dip from his usual world-class standards in 2020/21, keeping fewer clean sheets than the two previous seasons. Despite that, he marked his 100th clean sheet and 250th for Barcelona. Further surgery in May meant he was left out of Joachim Lowâs Germany squad for Euro 2020. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 31-year-old Peter Gulacsi may be reaching the twilight of his career, but that didnât stop him leading the Bundesliga in clean sheets in 2020/21. It also didnât prevent him from telling it like it is, âI think if we look at my performances over the last few years, I can say that I'm really among probably the best keepers in Europe.â His journey to the top hasnât been the smoothest, with loan stops at Hereford United, Tranmere Rovers and Hull City sharpening his skills for his Bundesliga arrival, but he's making it count now. 2020/21 Season Stats: Possibly overshadowed by the arrival of Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos and Georginio Wijnaldum, PSGâs best piece of summer business may have been signing the 22-year-old AC Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma for free. Valued at around Â£60 million, the Italianâs contract expired, allowing him to join Mauricio Pochettinoâs side for nothing. Fresh from his Player of the Tournament performance at Euro 2021, the first keeper to win the award, Donnarumma kept three clean sheets and saved three penalties in the knock-out phase of the competition. 2020/21 Season Stats: Keylor Navas led the French league in save percentage in 2020/21 but for the first time in a long time, wasnât the most eye-catching man between the sticks. Without him, however, the lopsided PSG defence would have conceded many more in 2020/21. âKeylor is one of the best goalies in the world,â said his manager Mauricio Pochettino. âI'm very happy he's with us.â His outstanding form wasn't enough to prevent the signing of Donnarumma, though Keylor's advancing years â he'll turn 35 in 2021 â and not his quality is the main motivator there. 2020/21 Season Stats: Mike Maignan was the best goalkeeper in Ligue 1 last season, the 26-year-old achieving a ridiculous 21 clean sheets for Lille, one short of the season record. His solid presence helped Lille to their first title in a decade and made him the hot goalkeeper in the summer transfer window. With Donnarumma on his way out of the door, AC Milan made their move in May, grabbing Maignan on a five-year deal. 2020/21 Season Stats: Like his Barcelona counterpart, Thibaut Courtois saw the players in front of him felled by injuries, with Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal and Fede Valverde all missing time. Unlike ter Stegen, however, that didnât cause Courtoisâ performances to suffer. His dominance at set pieces and his use of his 6ft 7in frame to stop shots were a bright spot in Real Madridâs second-place finish in La Liga. 2020/21 Season Stats: The original sweeper keeper, Manuel Neuer padded his trophy room with more accolades and silverware in his 15th top-flight season. The 35-year-old was instrumental as Bayern won Septemberâs 2020 UEFA Super Cup and the German Super Cup and was awarded FIFAâs Best Goalkeeper award in December. A ninth straight Bundesliga title and a DFL-Supercup win followed for Neuer, who passed German legend Oliver Kahn for the most clean sheets in Bundesliga history in January. Bayern's defence kept him busy last season, though he still conceded fewer goals than expected. 2020/21 Season Stats: The perfect goalkeeper for the Pep Guardiola system, Edersonâs ability to start attacks from Cityâs own box is at a different level to the rest of the worldâs goalkeepers. Blessed with lightning reflexes, his shot-stopping and ground coverage are up there with the best. His performance was comparable with his 2018/19 stats, coincidentally the last time the Sky Blues won the Premier League. 2020/21 Season Stats: Itâs not often a goalkeeperâs season is better remembered for a goal than a save, but Alissonâs late late header from Trent Alexander-Arnoldâs corner against West Brom kept Liverpoolâs dream of a last-minute Champions League qualification alive. It was the highlight of what was a difficult season for the player who lost his dad during lockdown and was unable to fly home due to coronavirus restrictions. On the field, his late-season clean sheets helped the Reds secure third place despite the casualty list in the middle of defence. He conceded an impressive 5.9 goals fewer than expected. 2020/21 Season Stats: The Slovenian stopper helped Atletico to a La Liga-low 25 goals conceded in 2020/21 as Diego Simeoneâs side clinched their first title since 2013/14. His 18 clean sheets led all La Liga goalkeepers and his 0.66 goals conceded per appearance saw him awarded the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for an incredible fifth time in six years, making him La Ligaâs most decorated non-Spanish goalkeeper. At just 28, the best in the world may be yet to hit his prime. Incredibly, he conceded 6.8 goals fewer than expected last season. Immense. Choosing just 10 keepers is a tough business, which means a few good candidates didn't quite make the cut. Edouard Mendy and Emiliano Martinez both had excellent seasons, with the latter's great numbers standing out. If Martinez keeps that form going this season he could easily be in the mix. Hugo Loris and David de Gea have both fallen out of 'elite' status recently, but could regain it with strong seasons. ",positive,liverpool,1

The 27-year-old, who inked a new contract until 2025 in February, created more chances than any Everton player last season. He faces a battle for fitness ahead of the new Premier League season after injuring a thigh during France's match against Portugal at Euro 2021. 2020/21 Season Stats: Nicknamed The Battery for his all-energy style up and down the left, Guerreiro is reportedly a transfer target for Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid. The French-born Portuguese opened his country's Euro 2021 scoring against Hungary, but notched an own goal during the following battering at the hands of Germany. Graduated from France's Clairefontaine academy, whose former attendees include Kylian Mbappe, Olivier Giroud and Thierry Henry. 2020/21 Season Stats: Made an immediate impact after his move to Chelsea from Leicester last summer. After an injury hitch kept him out of the line-up, his first appearance, in the Carabao Cup, saw him cross for Olivier Giroud to score against Barnsley. He then became the first Chelsea defender to score on his Premier League debut and played every minute of the Champions League semi-final and final. Only two outfield players started more for the Blues in 2020/21. 2020/21 Season Stats: At 32, it's a testament to Jordi Alba's tenacity and consistency that he's still on this list. The Euro 2012 champion, and scorer in the final, was still an ever-present in the team during Spain's run to the semi-final in 2021. One of the 18 Barcelona stars reportedly on the transfer list, according to president Joan Laporta, the Catalonian may have to agree a pay cut or move on later this summer, which should prick up the ears of managers all over Europe. 2020/21 Season Stats: Despite a season disrupted by a positive COVID test, the Brazilian completed 87.7% of his passes in Serie A and 85.4% in Juve's five Champions League appearances. The 30-year old scored one and conceded only two goals for the Selecao as Brazil progressed unbeaten to the Copa America final against old rivals Argentina, where they will seek a second-straight and 10th total continental title. 2020/21 Season Stats: Joint second with 12 crosses completed at Euro 2012, David Alaba captained Austria to their first Euros knockout stage in their history, while appearing at left-back, centre-back and left-midfield. His acceleration and stamina have seen him make over 400 appearances for Bayern, including 10 Bundesliga titles plus Champions League victories last season and in 2012/13. Austrian Footballer of the Year seven times, the 29-year-old has also been selected to the UEFA Team of the Year on three occasions. 2020/21 Season Stats: Speed kills and Alphonso Davies has it to burn, literally - reportedly reaching a top speed of 35.6kmh as he chased back during a match against Arminia in February. The youngest player since Roque Santa Cruz in 1999 and the first Canadian to score for Bayern, the explosive youngster started life on the wing at Vancouver Whitecaps. Since joining Bayern in January 2019 he has established himself at left-back where his closing speed helps him press as well as making him dangerous in the attacking third. Has scored nine goals in 23 appearances for his country. 2020/21 Season Stats: With Jose Mourinho's 'special' brand of man-management firmly in his rear-view mirror, Luke Shaw has blossomed under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United and Gareth Southgate for England. The 25-year-old has been one of the stars of Euro 2021, lucky slippers and all, earning the nickname Shawberto Carlos from his England teammates. Going into his side's semi-final with Denmark, Shaw was joint second in assists in the tournament, ahead of veterans such as Jordi Alba and David Alaba, while his crossing accuracy was ahead of both Alaba and Andy Robertson. 2020/21 Season Stats: Persuaded by technical director Paolo Maldini, who knows a thing or two about playing left-back, to join AC Milan in 2019, Theo Hernandez rapidly emerged as one of Europe's best left-backs. Full of clever runs going forward, his defensive vision and strength make him a tough proposition for attackers. PSG had made an agreement in principle to sign him before Euro 2021 but Milan are understandably not willing to countenance the move. 2020/21 Season Stats: In October 2020, when the Liverpool defence was cratered by Virgil van Dijk's injury at the hands/feet of Jordan Pickford, it meant other members of the unit needed to step up. Cue 27-year-old Andy Robertson growing into a leadership role for the Anfield outfit to go with his 37 assists in four seasons. His energy and work-rate saw him become the first Scottish captain to lead his side out at a major tournament in 23 years at Euro 2021.

One of the positions in world football that has suddenly become cool again is right back. As Jamie Carragher once said: ""no one wants to be a Gary Neville"". Or do they? A right back's contribution on the pitch has changed vastly, no longer just another defender, full backs on either side can contribute hugely to a team's balance and performance.

That said, he started the Champions League final ahead of the Portuguese. A blend of power and pace, Walker's versatility has seen him become a regular for England. 2020/21 Season Stats: Barcelona wrestled Dest away from Ajax ahead of Bayern Munich in 2020 and he quickly set about erasing memories of his predecessor Nelson Semedo in Ronald Koeman's system. The 19-year-old American international's dribbling and pace on the right were a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing season for Barca. 2020/21 Season Stats: A veteran compared to some of the youngsters on this list, Cuadrado continued his Italian renaissance after a lost two years in the Premier League with Chelsea. Juve's Mr Reliable was impressive in Andrea Pirlo's side's short Champions League campaign, with six assists in six appearances and an average of 4.3 crosses a game. 2020/21 Season Stats: Something of an outlier on this list of offensive talent as Centonze is very much a defender first, attacking threat second. Positionally perfect, the 25-year-old Metz star has been linked with Roma and Marseille over the last two years. 2020/21 Season Stats: French giants Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United are apparently in a race for Kieran Trippier's services following his impressive title-winning season with Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid. After his 10-week ban, he transformed Atletico's defensive unit. While he was out of the side, the team kept one clean sheet in eight league games, conceding 12 goals. After his return, Atletico kept 11 clean sheets in 20 games. 2020/21 Season Stats: In his third season with Lyon, Dubois was a genuine attacking threat, showing all the hallmarks of a marauding modern full-back, nailing 1.7 crosses a game in Ligue 1. But with Lyon not in the Champions League next season, he's another potential target for right-back hungry teams. Manchester United, we're talking to you. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 22-year-old Moroccan Hakimi was a rock in 2020/21, making 45 appearances in all competitions for Inter after joining from Real Madrid for â¬40million last season. His seven goals and eight assists helped Antonio Conte's side to end Juventus' era of dominance in Serie A, clinching their first title since the 2009/10 treble-winning season. With Chelsea rumoured to be in the market for him, he could find himself lining up next to No10 on our list. 2020/21 Season Stats: It's fair to say that watchers of Euro 2021 were robbed of seeing one of the game's best attacking full-backs when the buccaneering Liverpool star sustained a thigh injury in the closing stages of his country's friendly with Austria. Alexander-Arnold averaged 1.9 crosses per game (joint second-best in the Premiership) and his return to 2019/20 form coincided with Liverpool's improbable end-of-season run. 2020/21 Season Stats: Arguably Pep Guardiola's shrewdest move in the 2020/21 season was tweaking Cancelo's role to allow him to push into centre midfield when City played out from the back, then beyond. The switch allowed Cancelo to morph into a creative force averaging 1.6 key passes per game, behind only Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez, and saw him named to the PFA Team of the Year.

Zidane moved the German talisman into a deeper role which allowed Kroos to influence the game from the very start of attacks. Boringly accurate with his passing, expect the 31-year-old to enjoy a new lease of life under Carlo Ancelotti, the manager he left Bayern Munich to play for.

The Dutchman grew into his new role in his second season at Barcelona and cemented his position as one of the best central midfielders on the planet. 2020/21 Season Stats: With Manchester City, Liverpool and Barcelona among the teams hovering, Leon Goretzka disappointed them all by reportedly signing a new deal to remain at Bayern Munich until 2026. A dynamic midfield presence, the 26-year-oldâs work in tandem with Joshua Kimmich, also 26, provides the Germans with a solid heart for years to come. 2020/21 Season Stats: In a mirror image of his United teammate Pogba, Bruno Fernandes is electric when playing for the Red Devils but an enigma when on Portugal duty. Given licence to roam behind the frontmen in Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâs system, his eye for goal and the ability to play in his forward players, heâs one of the Premier Leagueâs best. 40 goals and 26 assists in his first 80 games for United tell the tale but his role changes when playing for the national team, shifting him deeper to allow Cristiano Ronaldo to do Cristiano Ronaldo things. Will that happen now he has joined United, too? 2020/21 Season Stats: The future of the German midfield now that Toni Kroos has stepped aside, Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka set the tone in the middle of the Bayern Munich team that won its ninth consecutive Bundesliga title in 2020/21. Employed at right-back, centre-back, centre-mid and on the right of midfield, Kimmich is able to ping the ball all over the pitch but is also not shy when it comes to putting it to the opposition. 2020/21 Season Stats: The driving force behind Thomas Tuchelâs glorious end to Chelseaâs 2020/21 season, NâGolo Kante was able to add an FA Cup final and Champions League title to his resumÃ© that already included a Premier League title with Leicester and World Cup win with France. Able to single-handedly destroy opponentsâ game plans, Kante should be even more explosive with a full season of Tuchelâs tutelage. 2020/21 Season Stats: âFor me, De Bruyne is the best playmaker in world football. The capacity he has to read the game, to play with appreciation of time and space is unique,â so says Belgium manager Roberto Martinez. Whether itâs linking play for Manchester City or his country or firing one of his laser-guided passes, the Belgian is world-class, hence his short-listing for the UEFA Menâs Player of the Year for last season. Despite missing a chunk of the season through injury (and ending his Champions League Final early), he led the Premier League in chances created from open play and had twice as many assists as any of his City teammates.

Sitting ahead of the back three or four, clearing up the mess, taking out the trash and basically doing the dirty work before moving the ball to the creative players. There may never have been a crop of holding midfielders as good as the one we have now - most on our list can also play further up the pitch or even at the back. Here we pick our top 10 defensive midfielders in the world. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: Rumours of Sergio Busquets' slowing down were firmly put to bed at Euro 2021 as the 32-year-old put on a masterclass of midfield play. A positive coronavirus test forced him out of the first two games, a goalless draw with Sweden and a 1-1 stalemate with the Poles. On his return, he earned man of the match honours as Spain crushed Slovakia 5-0 and repeated the feat pulling all the strings during the 5-3 Round of 16 victory over Croatia. 2020/21 Season Stats: One aspect of Declan Rice's game is his ability to run. And run. And run. The West Ham star covered 324.6km in the Premier League last season, good for fourth in the league. But it's his penetration and confidence with the ball that have evolved under David Moyes. At Euro 2021, Rice started every game in the holding midfield role for England on the way to the final, making concerns over Jordan Henderson's fitness irrelevant. Just 22, the future is bright for the hard-working Hammer. 2020/21 Season Stats: When you've drawn comparisons to the likes of Xavi and Franz Beckenbauer, you know you're doing something right. That's the case for Frenkie de Jong, who followed Dutch greats such as Frank de Boer and Johan Cruyff through the Ajax to Barcelona pipeline. In his second season at Barca, the 24-year-old grew in influence, especially after a formation switch in January, which allowed him to bring his passing ability to the fore. He finished fourth in pass success in La Liga among players with more than 20 appearances despite a stint at centre-back in place of an injured Gerard Pique. 2020/21 Season Stats: While Antonio Conte's Inter Milan returned to the top of Serie A in 2020/21 for the first time in a decade, his switch of Marcelo Brozovic to a holding role may have been the coach's finest masterstroke during his time at the club. The 28-year-old, who has been suggested as a partner for Paul Pogba in the Manchester United midfield, is blessed with the stamina to run all day and was one of Croatia's stars on their way to the 2018 World Cup final in Russia. 2020/21 Season Stats: Perhaps the most underrated member of this list, Leicester City's Wilfred Ndidi was tasked with the impossible - replacing N'Golo Kante when the latter was sold to Chelsea in 2016. The Nigerian has ploughed his own path and led the Premier League in tackles last season as the Foxes missed out on Champions League football, but scooped an FA Cup victory. The powerful 24-year-old made his debut at 18 for Nigeria and he has since appeared 40 times for his country. 2020/21 Season Stats: Another player impacted by the injury of Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho was perhaps the most instrumental performer in the revival of Liverpool's 2020/21 season. Initially employed as van Dijk's replacement while injuries laid waste to the side's centre-backs, his switch back to defensive midfielder late in the season saw the Reds regain their title-winning mojo and complete an unlikely run to third. 2020/21 Season Stats: Despite a disappointing season in Zinedine Zidane's final year as Real Madrid boss, Casemiro stood tall. Joint fifth in La Liga in tackles, the Brazilian's strength and work-rate ensure he's the protector of the Real defence. 2020/21 Season Stats: The world's most expensive defensive midfielder when he joined Manchester City from Atletico Madrid in 2019 (Â£56.4million), Rodri provides the platform from which City's wealth of attacking options take flight. The Spaniard's positioning rather than his tackling prowess deters opponents' passes through the lines. When he's on the ball, he's one of the Premier League's most gifted passers. 2020/21 Season Stats: The driving force behind Bayern's treble in 2019/20, Kimmich is perhaps 1a to Kante's top-ranking. Sixth in the Bundesliga in assists, the 26-year-old's versatility is a key weapon in his armoury, having moved from right-back to midfield, not unlike German great Philipp Lahm. Described as a ""mentality monster"" by outgoing Bayern manager Hansi Flick, Kimmich's aggression belies his 5ft 10in frame, while his passing range and football intelligence are second to none. 2020/21 Season Stats: If this list was just midfielders, N'Golo Kante would still be top-three, but as a gameplan-wrecker the Chelsea player is without peer. A Premier League winner with Leicester, World Cup winner with France and Champions League winner with Chelsea - success follows him wherever he goes and it's no coincidence. Injured under Frank Lampard, the 5ft 6in ball of energy was rejuvenated under Thomas Tuchel, allowing his dynamism to drive the Blues to an FA Cup final and European glory.

From top to bottom, there is playmaking quality throughout - with a mixture of experience and youthful exuberance represented. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: It's not so much what Aaron Ramsey does on the pitch, it's how he does it. The Welshman plays with a smile on his face and, while his 2020/21 season at Juventus didn't pull up any trees, he's still a gifted attacker. That was evident at Euro 2021 where his incredible timing and running saw him combine with Gareth Bale again and again against Turkey before he put Wales ahead. 2020/21 Season Stats: Dortmund's 2020/21 trio of young attacking talent - 18-year-old Giovanni Reyna, Erling Haaland (20) and Jadon Sancho (21) - combined for 39 Bundesliga goals. Sitting behind them at number 10, pulling the strings, was Dortmund's 32-year-old captain Marco Reus. ""It's good to have him on the pitch talking to me and giving me advice,"" said Sancho. ""Because when he tells me things I listen."" The two-time winner of Germany's Footballer of the Year award has the experience, finishing and vision to make him worth listening to. 2020/21 Season Stats: The Argentinian playmaker has come up the long way but is finally getting his due. From Argentina via Italy then Ukraine, Papu Gomez spent seven seasons at Atalanta (setting the Serie A season record for assists in 2019/20) before landing a deal to take him to Sevilla in January. Used mainly as an attacking midfielder or secondary striker, the Argentinian's movement off the ball and finding pockets of space make him invaluable. Scored twice and had an assist in Argentina's victorious Copa America campaign. 2020/21 Season Stats: Able to play any of the forward positions, Mason Mount has seen his career take off in the last three seasons. On loan at Derby under Frank Lampard, he stepped his game up when the pair returned to Chelsea and became a vital cog in Thomas Tuchel's machine. He was instrumental in England's run to the Euro 2021 final and Gareth Southgate understands his value to the national team: ""He is an exceptional player, he finds space intelligently, he creates chances, he scores goals,"" said the coach. 2020/21 Season Stats: It may seem to England fans that Thomas Muller has been around forever but the most decorated footballer in German history is still only 31. Thirteen Bundesliga titles, a World Cup Golden Boot (2010) and a 2014 World Cup winner, Muller can play anywhere on or behind the forward line. Despite his late miss against England, the German is known for his icy veins, ability to create chances and his scoring - 39 for Germany in 106 caps and 129 for Bayern in 383 appearances. 2020/21 Season Stats: Scoring the winner in the Champions League final is the perfect end to a debut season with a new club, but Kai Havertz's first year at Chelsea didn't go completely smoothly. A change of managers, injury and catching COVID-19 were a few of the setbacks that the 21-year-old overcame to establish himself as a Thomas Tuchel and fan favourite. 2020/21 Season Stats: When he first switched Madrid teams from Real to Atletico, Marcos Llorente was used as in a defensive midfield role but when Diego Simeone moved him forward, he blossomed. ""He can play anywhere,"" said Simeone, but it was his pace, first touch and movement that saw him finish second in La Liga in assists. At Euro 2021, he completed 94% of his passes as Spain reached the final four. 2020/21 Season Stats: Playing just off the striker at Manchester United, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation since arriving at Old Trafford. Last season, he finished behind only Harry Kane and Mo Salah in scoring and only Kane in assists. His lethal set pieces and trademark move of attacking the spaces between a full-back and central defender and then shooting have made him a hero in Manchester. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has built his 4-2-3-1 formation around the Portuguese and has been rewarded with 38 goals and 25 assists in all competitions. 2020/21 Season Stats: Kevin de Bruyne ""sees things others cannot see"" according to Pep Guardiola (thankfully not dead people) and that's what, simply put, makes him the best attacking midfielder in the world not named Lionel Messi. Since joining Manchester City six years ago, the Champions League may have eluded him but he's won the Premier League three times, five League Cups and an FA Cup. His vision and range of passing are matched only by his timing and the intelligence of his runs, and his playmaking is behind Belgium's rise to the No1 ranking. 2020/21 Season Stats: Now that Argentina's Copa America campaign has ended in victory, football's decision makers can turn their attention to trying to lure free agent/best footballer on earth Lionel Messi to their team. Messi's contract with Barcelona expired at the end of June making him available for nothing. PSG and Manchester City have been on alert as talks over a new deal with Barcelona drag on. What else is there say about the man himself when it comes to forward play. His 672 goals in all competitions for Barca are more than the next four players on the scoring list combined and he's the proud owner of six Ballon D'Ors. At 34, he may be closer to the end than the beginning of his career, but he remains at the top of the tree.  All images are credit to PA. ",positive,liverpool,0
609,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-best-goalkeepers-of-all-time-20210518,"The 10 Best Goalkeepers Of All Time, Named And Ranked","Behind every great football team is a world-class goalkeeper, but who are the best to have ever played between the sticks? Playing in arguably the most underrated position in football, goalkeepers are often overlooked for the more glamorous spots in the team. It is one of the toughest jobs on the field that requires concentration, composure and the ability to pull off saves at any given moment in a game, but do they get enough credit? You'll often hear the names of Pele, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and dozens more outfield players. But what about the goalkeepers? Shouldn't the likes of Manuel Neuer, Gianluigi Buffon and Lev Yashin at least be part of the conversation? We certainly think so and this is our take on the best goalkeepers of all time and, once your'e done with this, head to our list of the best goalkeepers in the world right now or the 10 best Premier League goalkeepers ever. Career honours: Gordon Banks is widely regarded as the greatest England goalkeeper. The Sheffield-born shot-stopper died in 2019 at the age of 81 and will be forever remembered for that save against Brazil in the 1970 World Cup. Producing a save that stopped the world, Banks pulled off an incredible reflex save against the powerful and directive header from Pele - with fans and pundits around the world dubbing it 'the save of the century'. Seriously, though, just how on earth did he save this? Career honours: Edwin van der Sar was a truly outstanding goalkeeper who arguably shone brightest during the final years of his career with Manchester United. Saving here, there and everywhere, the Dutchman was a force between the sticks for the Red Devils where he won four Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. Before United, he also starred for Ajax in the 1990s before moving on to Juventus and Fulham. Some of these saves during his early Ajax days are incredible to watch.  Career honours: Alongside Edwin van der Sar, Peter Schmeichel is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's most legendary goalkeepers. The world-class Dane was one of the best reflex savers that the world has ever produced, and won five league titles with Manchester United, as well as the Champions League in 1999. He is among the all-time greatest footballers in the history of Scandinavian football and is widely known for his trademark shouts at defence to command them. His son Kasper Schmeichel followed in his footsteps and is another outstanding goalkeeper - famously winning the Premier League and, most recently, the FA Cup with Leicester City as their captain. Career honours: Oliver Kahn is best remembered for his 14-year spell with Bayern Munich, where he won multiple titles including eight Bundesliga titles and the UEFA Champions League. Kahn was a runner-up with Germany at the 2002 World Cup, but won the Golden Ball that tournament. He also finished third in the voting for both the 2001 and 2002 Ballon d'Or awards. Some of these saves defy all odds.  Career honours: Arguably the greatest goalkeeper of the Premier League era, Petr Cech won four league titles with Chelsea, plus the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Cech was as important as John Terry in their superlative defensive record between 2004 and 2006, in which they conceded just 15 and 22 goals in back-to-back Premier League title wins. The 38-year-old spent the final four years of his career with Arsenal, although he is listed as Chelsea's current emergency goalkeeper. His top five saves have been ranked during his time at Chelsea and they are, to put it simply, outstanding.  Career honours: Manuel Neuer, an unorthodox but supremely talented goalkeeper, has enjoyed huge success with Bayern Munich and Germany over the past decade. The 35-year-old is one of the greatest and most decorated goalkeepers in the world and was the best German footballer in the first half of the 2010s. It's not unusual to see him 30 plus yards off his line, too, playing a sort of sweeper-keeper role - making him one of the bravest and most confident goalkeepers we've ever seen. I mean, come on, just look at the balls he has to do this.  Career honours: Dino Zoff is one of the best goalkeepers the world has ever seen - and that's a fact. The Italian, now 79 years old, famously played for the likes of Napoli and Juventus. He won the World Cup in 1982 and the European Championship 14 years earlier. Incredibly, he boasts the record for having kept a clean sheet the longest amount of time (1,142 minutes) from September 1972 to June 1974. To put his tremendous career into context, he has kept 360 clean sheets from 720 first-level club games, which is truly outstanding. Career honours: Gianluigi Buffon was the greatest goalkeeper in the world in the 2000s and is considered by many as the greatest Italian shot-stopper ever, even above the great Dino Zoff. Still going strong at the age of 43, Buffon is a much-loved figure in the world of football. The Juventus legend played 178 times for Italy between 1997-2018 and lifted the World Cup in 2006. He is also the all-time most capped player for Italy and has made around 350 clean sheets in first-level club games - just ten behind Zoff. Maybe he's still playing at 43 for his love of the game or to break Zoff's record, who knows? Career honours: The Champions League, European Championship and World Cup, you name it and Iker Casillas has won it. His trophy haul says a lot and the rest of the talking was done by his sheer brilliance showcased on the pitch. Best remembered for his glittering 16-year senior career with Real Madrid, Casillas played 725 times for Los Blancos before moving to FC Porto in 2015. Casillas was also Spain's first-choice goalkeeper during the country's most successful period in their history between 2008-2012, when La Roja won two European Championships and the World Cup. A more than worthy runner-up, but some of these saves suggest that he could have been our number one.  Career honours: Lev Yashin is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game and is regarded as Soviet Union's greatest football ever. One of football's truly legendary names, Yashin spent his entire professional career with Dynamo Moscow, but it was his performances at international level with the Soviet Union that caught the world's attention. During his career, he had stopped around 150 penalty kicks, which is the best record of all-time, while keeping an incredible 270 clean sheets from approximately 420 career games played. More importantly, he remains the only goalkeeper in history to win a Ballon d'Or and it is likely that it will be some time before that is replicated. ",positive,liverpool,0

But the likes of Terry Butcher and Tony Adams would be unlikely to survive in today's game. The role of the old-fashioned stopper and header of crosses has evolved into a ball-playing footballer with lightning defensive reflexes and a sixth sense for sniffing out danger before it happens. Here we pick our top 10 centre-backs in the world. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: It's hard to believe that the same player that made 260 appearances for Southampton and 60 for Crystal Palace had arguably his best season at the age of 37. Captaining a Lille side that won its first Ligue 1 title since 2010/11, the 6ft 3in veteran provided key leadership for Christophe Galtier's young team. His form was rewarded with a place in Fernando Santos' Portugal squad for Euro 2021. 2020/21 Season Stats: Watchers of Euro 2021 would have seen Aymeric Laporte's trademark cross-field switch time and again in the tournament as he and his Spanish teammates progressed to the semi-finals. Manchester City fans will hope that his performance at the championships doesn't give him itchy feet despite Barcelona's recent interest dwindling. The left-footer looked set to form a dream team with Ruben Dias at the heart of Pep Guardiola's defence only for COVID and injury to allow John Stones' renaissance to begin. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 32-year-old German may be on the verge of international retirement but the 2020/21 season proved he has plenty in the tank in domestic football. The 2014 World Cup-winner led Dortmund in blocks, aerial battles won, clearances and interceptions, was the second most prolific tackler and third most accurate passer. Oh and he chipped in with five Bundesliga goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: A year ago, John Stones looked to be an afterthought for both Pep Guardiola and England's Gareth Southgate. On the outside of the England squad, looking in, Manchester City had just splurged Â£61million on Benfica's Portugal star Ruben Dias. With Nathan Ake incoming and Aymeric Laporte in place, Stones' City career seemed to be slipping away. But his partnership with Dias gelled instantly when thrust together in November as Stones returned to the classy, ball-playing 26-year-old that caught the eye of Guardiola before he joined City and the duo helped the Premier League champions to 19 clean sheets. 2020/21 Season Stats: Notable in their absence from this top 10 are former Spain mainstays Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique. Pique's 2020/21 season was error- and injury-filled while Ramos was let go by Real Madrid after 16 extraordinary years. Part of the reason for that was the presence of Frenchman Varane. With the ideal build for a central defender, he's able to outmuscle attackers but is also cultured enough to play out from the back, which he did for France at Euro 2021, completing 271 of his 288 passes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Not blessed with tremendous pace, Slovakian Milan Skriniar uses his 6ft 2in frame, timing and positional awareness to get the job done. As a passer, his skills are up there with the best and he's been pushed into central midfield for Slovakia at times. On their way to ending their 11-year title drought, Skriniar and co conceded a league-low 35 goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: There were worries over the fitness of Manchester United captain Harry Maguire going into Euro 2021 but after missing the first two group games, he slipped in alongside John Stones and calmly led England to three more clean sheets and a semi-final victory. One of the leaders in Gareth Southgate's camp, the world's most expensive defender was dominant in 2020/21 for United, finishing second among Premier League defenders in aerial battles won. 2020/21 Season Stats: It's a mark of the immense talent of Virgil van Dijk that he's still in the top three of this list after a season in which he started just five Premier League matches and missed Euro 2021 entirely. The horror tackle from Jordan Pickford in the Merseyside derby in October sent van Dijk to the surgeon's table and left Liverpool's championship defence needing medical intervention for the rest of the season. He's expecting to join Jurgen Klopp's side for preseason training in July but acknowledges that he's faced ""a long road"" and may not be fully up to speed come season kick-off. 2020/21 Season Stats: Centre-back is not perhaps the position you immediately associate Brazilian footballers with but Marquinhos has followed in the footsteps of Lucio, Aldair, Luis Perieira and former PSG teammate Thiago Silva as a defensive rock. His technical ability and agility ensure he stands out even on a team of galacticos like Mbappe, Verrati and Neymar. An elegant defender with a Brazilian's comfort on the ball, the PSG captain scored three times in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League and netted for Brazil in the first game of their Copa America campaign, where they conceded just two goals on the way to the final. 2020/21 Season Stats: Pep Guardiola had spent freely in an attempt to solidify the Manchester City defence since his arrival in 2016, but it wasn't until last year's arrival of Ruben Dias that he solved the issue. Dias had a similar effect on the Mancunians that Virgil van Dijk had on Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in 2018 as his composure helped power his team to the title. At ease bringing the ball out, he's seldom caught out defensively, using his anticipation to nick possession either with a tackle or interception. His maiden season at City was crowned with Football Writers' Association and Premier League Player of the Season awards.

611,https://www.sportbible.com/football/best-defenders-in-the-world-right-now-20211111,"The 10 Best Defenders In The World Right Now, Rankedâ","Legendary Liverpool manager famously once said, âform is temporary but class is permanentâ and the men on the list below are definitely world-class. But they are also the defenders across the globeâs best leagues that have shown the best form in the 2021/22 season. Here we pick our top 10 defenders in the world right now. We've used a number of stats from the start of the season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2021/22 Season Stats: 2021/22 Season Stats: At the heart of the stingiest defence in La Liga â seven goals against and three clean sheets in 11 games â is the exciting young Frenchman Jules Kounde. The centre-back who turns 23 in November, made his international debut at Euro 21 thanks to an impressive second season at Sevilla and has continued his form into Spainâs domestic competition. 2021/22 Season Stats: ""I'm still on the way,"" says Virgil van Dijk, who missed all but five games of Liverpoolâs title defence thanks to Jordan Pickfordâs horror tackle devastated his right knee. ""I'm my own biggest critic and I know exactly when I can do better, and when things are going well too. How I see it is to just improve as much as I can, and I'm fairly confident in the way I see things.â Despite Jurgen Klopp talking about managing the Dutchmanâs workload ahead of the season, van Dijk has played every minute of the Redsâ 10 Premier League games, matched only by Mo Salah. 2021/22 Season Stats: In Antonio Conteâs first week at Spurs, rumours were already circulating about his desire to bring his former Inter Milan centre-back Milan Skriniar to North London in the January transfer window to lead his trademark three-man backline. Itâs not the first time the 6ft 2in Slovakian has been linked with a move to Tottenham â Jose Mourinho offered Â£30 million for the 26-year-old in the summer of 2020 â but the natural centre-back is also reportedly a New Year target for Manchester United. 2021/22 Season Stats: Despite a position switch, Joao Cancelo has been one of Manchester Cityâs best players so far in 2021 â leading the team in tackles and interceptions. A lock at (right-footed) left-back after spending most of last season at full-back on the other flank, the Portuguese has started the 2021 term on fire to put the disappointment of missing out on Euro 21 behind him. He currently ranks fourth among Premier League defenders for interceptions for Pep Guardiolaâs second-placed City. 2021/22 Season Stats: Thomas Tuchel may have been fired from his last two jobs by Borussia Dortmund and PSG respectively, but at Chelsea, heâs proving to be a perfect fit and has worked wonders with many of the incumbent squad. Antonio Rudiger has been the pick of a Blues defence thatâs conceded just four goals in 11 matches to lead them to the top of the Premier League (and just one in four Champions League clashes) and the German centre-back could have easily been joined on this list by the rejuvenated Thiago Silva or up-and-comer Trevoh Chalobah, whoâve also impressed. 2021/22 Season Stats: While the addition of the likes of Hakimi, Ramos, Wijnaldum, Donnarumma and Messi to a squad already containing MbappÃ©, Verratti, Neymar and Di Maria may have given Mauricio Pocchetino the most talented group of players in Europe, the defensive standout this season has been his captain Marquinhos. Joint third in Ligue 1 in blocks and seventh in clearances, the calming presence of the 27-year-old Brazilian at the back has helped PSG extend a 10-point lead over second-placed Lens. 2021/22 Season Stats: Unbeaten and top of Serie A after 11 matches, Luciano Spallettiâs Napoli side have been on an impressive run to begin the new season. The organiser of a defensive unit thatâs only conceded three goals so far, Kalidou Koulibaly, has only enhanced the reputation thatâs seen him linked with Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea in the past 12 months. Spalletti describes the 30-year-old Senegalese player âan exceptional leaderâ. 2021/22 Season Stats: While some players might bemoan a summer tournament and the lack of rest and recovery time, Aymeric Laporte couldnât be happier. While he found himself out of the Manchester City line-up in 2020, a switch of international allegiance from France to Spain through his great-grandparents saw him picked for Euro 21. Regular football was just what the doctor ordered and heâs hit the ground running in the Premier League, displacing John Stones alongside Ruben Dias. 2021/22 Season Stats: Ruben Dias cleaned up in awards season 2020/21 scooping the Football Writersâ Association and Premier League Player of the Season awards after his storming first year at Manchester City. He was rewarded with being added to the City roll of captains before the new season and has continued to be a strikerâs worst nightmare in the Sky Bluesâ first 11 Premier League matches.

612,https://www.sportbible.com/football/best-premier-league-centre-backs-of-all-time-20211011,"The 10 Best Centre-Backs In Premier League History, Rankedâ","Every team needs a down-and-dirty central defender, or preferably two. Someone whoâs going to put their body on the line when necessary to keep their goal intact. Old-school centre-backs were able to chop opponents in half but since the advent of the Premier League being physical has evolved and requires plenty of technical ability. Here we pick our top 10 Premier League centre-backs of all time, all of whom are footballers, not just defenders. We've used a number of stats from over the seasons to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in history. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from premierleague.com and are correct as of the publish date. More articles: A true Roy of the Rovers story, Steve Bruce started his footballing career as an apprentice with third-division Gillingham, working his way up to the first division which would become the Premier League. At Manchester United, he would team with Gary Pallister to form the foundations upon which three Premiership titles were won (1992/93, 1993/94 and 1995/96). Known to pop up at crucial moments to score key goals, no more so than his double against Sheffield Wednesday late in their first Premier League title season. Brought to Chelsea by Gianluca Vialli in 1998, Marcel âThe Rockâ Desailly was already a World Cup winner, double Champions League winner with Marseille and AC Milan (where he also won two Serie A titles). He and fellow Frenchman Frank LeBoeuf provided the Blues with a rock-solid central defensive pairing, as well as a shining example for an 18-year-old prospect by the name of John Terry. âDesailly was virtually impossible to play against,â said former Liverpool striker Michael Owen. âHe was strong, quick, and good on the ball. I tried kicking him once and hurt my foot â which shows what sort of game I had against him.â Jaap Stam only spent three seasons in the Premier League but won titles in every one of them with Manchester United, including the famous treble in his debut season. With Steve Bruce having left two years earlier and Garry Pallister departing in the offseason, Alex Ferguson made Stam the worldâs most expensive defender and got his moneyâs worth. Peter Schmeichel would go on to call the Dutchman the best defender he ever played behind at OId Trafford. In 2001, Ferguson, in what heâd acknowledge was his worst transfer regret, sold Stam to Lazio, because he thought heâd lost a step on return from injury. When the skinny Serb Nemanja Vidic arrived at Manchester United from Spartak Moscow for Â£7million in 2005, his teammates werenât blown away. But the 25-year-old, quickly acclimatised to the Premier League and to the weight room, forging one of the worldâs best-ever defensive partnerships with Rio Ferdinand and bagging five Premier League winnerâs medals. âHe became a defender that was feared,â said Ferdinand. âHe could fight with the most physical, he crunched into tackles, he attacked the ball better than anyone Iâve ever seen. But as he will tell you with a smile, he could also play with the ball too, which made him complete and a great defender.â âThere are some players you wish played for your club,â said Gary Neville, not known for his appreciation of the noisy neighbours in blue. âVincent Kompany was one of them.â Kompany spent 12 seasons at Manchester City having been bought by Mark Hughes from Hamburg and initially played as a defensive midfielder. It wasnât long before he moved to his natural home becoming the heart and soul of Manchester City under Pep Guardiola, winning four Premier League titles. âI always dreamed of winning the league at White Hart Lane, so I left and joined Arsenal,â so said Sol Campbell when he left Spurs to join Arsene Wengerâs Gunners in 2001, compounding the fury directed at him by one half of North London. He did exactly that three years later, his second title with Arsenal. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder and Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool fans will know exactly how that feels. After the colossus that is Virgil Van Dijk helped the Reds to their first top-flight championship in 30 years, his injury in 2020 cratered any chance of repeating. âWe all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world,â said Man Cityâs Sergio Aguero. âHeâs strong, tall, and, because of his long legs, he can reach everywhere. He is so smart when defending. Heâs not anxious when marking, heâs very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for strikers.â A mark of Tony Adamsâ greatness was his consistency under two very different types of manager â old-school George Graham and renaissance man Arsene Wenger. Graham called Adams, who spent 14 years as Arsenal captain and won league titles in three different decades, âmy colossusâ. Wenger, meanwhile, described him as a âprofessor of defenceâ. He was the captain of Englandâs most successful tournament team before Gareth Southgate and coâs summer exploits, the Euro 96 side. âCaptain. A great defender and a great leader,â said former teammate Ian Wright. âHe was so inspirational and was able to get the best out of those around him.â âHe was a great player, without a doubt the best centre-half I ever played with,â said Rio Ferdinandâs Manchester United teammate Paul Scholes about the defender. âI would say for a time as well he was the best centre-half in the world. He was such a pleasure to play with and play in front of. He made your job so easy.â Ferdinand blossomed under Alex Ferguson, winning six Premier League titles with United. Only Jamie Carragher played more games among defenders than Ferdinand, who captained his country seven times and was selected for four consecutive World Cup squads (albeit not playing in France 98 and missing South Africa 2010 through injury). Despite his dubious behaviour â and thereâs plenty to consider both on and off the pitch â thereâs no questioning John Terryâs footballing ability. âJohn Terry is the toughest defender Iâve played against,â said Wayne Rooney, who sits at 491, one Premier League appearance behind Terryâs 492. âHe reads the game really well, heâs physical, heâs big, good in the air and heâs powerful. You come off feeling like youâve been in a real game.â A one-club player and Chelsea legend, Terry lifted the Premiership trophy five times and only eight men have captained England more times. Respected by his world peers, he was named to the UEFA Team of the Year on four occasions. ",positive,liverpool,2

'Good' contains the likes of John Stones, Harry Maguire, Joel Matip and Ben White, among others. A host of centre-backs make up the 'average' section including Eric Dier, Conor Coady, Eric Bailly and Phil Jones to name but a few.

In today's early-kick off against West Ham, Stones and Dias were unable to keep yet another clean sheet but instead they were both on the scoresheet as City made it 20 wins in a row in all competitions. Former Benfica defender Dias opened the scoring with a powerful header from a glorious left-footed cross from Kevin De Bruyne, before Michail Antonio scored a rare goal past the league leaders on the stroke of half-time. But it was Stones who came up with the winner in the second half, finishing like a veteran striker for his fourth goal of the campaign after some great play from Riyad Mahrez down the right. Incredibly, it means that Stones and Dias have scored more goals (5) than they have conceded (3) in the 16 games they have started together. City supporters can't get enough of their first-choice centre-back pairing at the moment and were full of reaction to them following another historic victory: Speaking about his understanding with Dias in January, Stones told the Manchester Evening News: ""It's not easy coming to a major club like Manchester City and putting a stamp like he has done, the level he has shown in every game. I think it's a massive credit to him. ""It's been great for me to play alongside him. He is so easy to get on with on and off the pitch. ""We kept a lot of clean sheets and we have just clicked. When it happens like that, you just enjoy playing football. I'm definitely enjoying playing with him and hopefully we can continue for a long time.""

Last season City were well beaten to the title by Liverpool, but Pep Guardiola's side went about reclaiming the title in brilliant style. Loadingâ¦ On Saturday they knew a win would make them champions, after closest rivals Manchester United had their game with Liverpool delayed last week. But for the second time in a matter of weeks, Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea beat City to stop the title party at the Etihad Stadium. However, United's 2-1 defeat to Leicester City at Old Trafford meant the title has been handed to City. Despite winning the title with three games to spare, unlike their previous title win which went down to the wire, it hasn't all been plain sailing for City this season. Guardiola's team didn't start the season in great shape and were 10th following a loss to Tottenham Hotspur on November 21st, a result that left Spurs one point off the top. After a draw to West Brom on December 15th, the team were ninth in the league and behind rivals United by one point and one place, and six off table- toppers Spurs and Liverpool. The 2018/19 champions then went on an incredible 15 game winning run in the league, which was also part of a 28 game unbeaten run in all competitions. That was ended by United in March, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side winning 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, but it wasn't enough to derail the title charge. City did lose again, against Leeds United, and then Champions League final opponents Chelsea, but they have now secured a fifth league title since 2012 and a third since Guardiola took the reins five years ago. Having won the Carabao Cup for the fourth year in a row, City will seal a memorable treble if they defeat Chelsea in the biggest game in European club football on May 29. ",positive,liverpool,3

City had dominated the game but it took until the 80th minute to break the deadlock, when Kevin De Bruyne swung in a free-kick and defender Laporte beat marker Moussa Sissoko and rose to head the ball past the excellent Hugo Lloris. It was a painful moment for Spurs - particularly as Laporte was arguably lucky to be on the pitch after the first half. He should probably have been booked before his first yellow card (for stopping a Lucas Moura counter-attack). Yet City had by far the best chances, particularly in the first half, before Pep Guardiola's side finally broke through to win their fourth consecutive League Cup.

His form was rewarded with a place in Fernando Santos' Portugal squad for Euro 2021. 2020/21 Season Stats: Watchers of Euro 2021 would have seen Aymeric Laporte's trademark cross-field switch time and again in the tournament as he and his Spanish teammates progressed to the semi-finals. Manchester City fans will hope that his performance at the championships doesn't give him itchy feet despite Barcelona's recent interest dwindling. The left-footer looked set to form a dream team with Ruben Dias at the heart of Pep Guardiola's defence only for COVID and injury to allow John Stones' renaissance to begin. 2020/21 Season Stats: The 32-year-old German may be on the verge of international retirement but the 2020/21 season proved he has plenty in the tank in domestic football. The 2014 World Cup-winner led Dortmund in blocks, aerial battles won, clearances and interceptions, was the second most prolific tackler and third most accurate passer. Oh and he chipped in with five Bundesliga goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: A year ago, John Stones looked to be an afterthought for both Pep Guardiola and England's Gareth Southgate. On the outside of the England squad, looking in, Manchester City had just splurged Â£61million on Benfica's Portugal star Ruben Dias. With Nathan Ake incoming and Aymeric Laporte in place, Stones' City career seemed to be slipping away.

Pique's 2020/21 season was error- and injury-filled while Ramos was let go by Real Madrid after 16 extraordinary years. Part of the reason for that was the presence of Frenchman Varane. With the ideal build for a central defender, he's able to outmuscle attackers but is also cultured enough to play out from the back, which he did for France at Euro 2021, completing 271 of his 288 passes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Not blessed with tremendous pace, Slovakian Milan Skriniar uses his 6ft 2in frame, timing and positional awareness to get the job done. As a passer, his skills are up there with the best and he's been pushed into central midfield for Slovakia at times.

One of the leaders in Gareth Southgate's camp, the world's most expensive defender was dominant in 2020/21 for United, finishing second among Premier League defenders in aerial battles won. 2020/21 Season Stats: It's a mark of the immense talent of Virgil van Dijk that he's still in the top three of this list after a season in which he started just five Premier League matches and missed Euro 2021 entirely. The horror tackle from Jordan Pickford in the Merseyside derby in October sent van Dijk to the surgeon's table and left Liverpool's championship defence needing medical intervention for the rest of the season.

Maradona's stint as manager would come to an end shortly after and fans are grateful they got to see him manage Messi in that time. His influence on the six-time Ballon d'Or winner came in the form of his trademark technique - scoring from free-kicks. Speaking to LaSexta per Marca back in 2018, former Argentina fitness coach Fernando Signorini recalled an exchange between the pair. ""I started walking to where Diego was, and at the same moment I see Messi place the ball down. He takes three shots and misses all three and turned to us with a look of clear frustration. ""He turns towards the dressing room and I shout 'no' before hugging him and telling him that the best player in the world can't leave a training session like that. Diego arrives and they talk to each other, the world seems to stop at that moment. ""He places the ball in the same place and then gives some very paternal words. He told him not to take his foot off the ball so quickly when he takes a free kick."" The pair have shared a pitch in the past, although not in an official game.  A teenage Messi linked up with a 45-year-old Maradona for an Argentina All Stars team in a charity match. The likes of Sergio Aguero, Diego Simeone and Juan Sebastian Veron were also involved but it's the link up play between the two incredible 'number 10s' that really catches the attention.

One of the criteria they're judged on is mentality and getting their teams through crisis - something @Ronaldoalbi7 thinks Messi lacked compared to Ronaldo in 2018. His video shows the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's reaction during Barcelona's 3-0 defeat to Roma in the Champions League, attempting to win the game on his own. Messi looks to his teammates for inspiration, cutting a frustrated figure as Barcelona crash out of the tournament 4-4 on away goals. But in the case of Ronaldo, he attempts to keep his Real Madrid teammates motivated by gesturing and telling them to keep it up against Juventus. 'Los Blancos' were 3-3 on aggregate with the Italian giants, only needing one goal to advance to the Champions League semi finals. 'CR7' would score a penalty in the 97th minute to make the score 3-1 on the night, 4-3 on aggregate and send Madrid through. They'd go on to win the tournament and Ronaldo's penalty in the quarter finals went down as a key moment.   Messi recently spoke about their rivalry and said Ronaldo's time at Real Madrid helped create something special. ""The one with Cristiano Ronaldo was and is a special duel, which will remain forever,"" the 33-year-old told DAZN. ""It lasted many years and it is not easy to maintain certain levels for a long time. ""Our teams were also very demanding: Real Madrid and Barcelona, the two strongest clubs in the world. Competing as equals for so many years is something that will remain forever. ""The duel between me and Cristiano Ronaldo was very good on a personal level and I think people enjoyed it.""

The rest of the Italy players were clearly far less calm than their teammate and who can blame them, after becoming the champions of Europe!

It was a disappointing night for Roberto Mancini's European champions, who suffered their first defeat in 37 games after a brace from Manchester City forward Ferran Torres handed Spain a place in the Nations League final. A late goal from Lorenzo Pellegrini set up a dramatic finish but ultimately, the Italians lost their world record unbeaten run. From the opening minutes, Italy struggled to get a foothold in the game. You could even say the atmosphere affected some, especially Gianluigi Donnarumma, who was booed throughout. After leaving AC Milan on a free transfer this summer, the 22-year-old shot-stopper decided to sign a five-year deal at Paris Saint-Germain - a decision that was criticised by many Rossoneri supporters. And thousands of supporters made their feelings known when Donnarumma touched the ball for the first time against Spain. You can see the clip of that moment below. Even ahead of kick-off, Donnarumma, who was the hero for Italy in their European Championship final victory against England this summer - was pelted with abuse from fans inside the San Siro. Italy boss Roberto Mancini condemned the situation after the full-time whistle. ""It certainly won't have pleased him, just as it did not please us. Gigio did well,"" Mancini said.

""I hope he is satisfied because he is a player of the national team who has made a fundamental contribution to the European title,"" Capello told il Corriere dello Sport.

The Italy Euro 2020 hero has signed a five-year contract with the French giants and follows up the additions of Gini Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos and Achraf Hakimi. But the 22-year-old was unable to select his favourite shirt number at the Parc des Princes. Since he debuted with Milan as a 16-year-old, Donnarumma wore the No.99 in between the sticks as it was the year he was born. However, Ligue One rules prohibit goalkeepers from wearing such a number and infamously prevented Mario Balotelli from wearing No.45 at Nice and Marseille. The numbers 1, 16 and 30 are specifically reserved for goalkeepers but in this instance they are occupied by Keylor Navas, Sergio Rico and Alexandre Letellier, respectively. As per Footy Headlines, the No.40 and the No.50 are last resorts and so it appears as they a special reprieve has been granted. Courtesy of a rough translation from Balls.ie, the LFP rule #670 reads: ""Every Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 club must establish the number assignment list on Isyfoot 72 hours before the start of the competition. ""This list can not exceed 30 names, the number 30 is the last in the list may be supplemented and updated with every movement in the club. If a club justifies employ over 30 professional players under contract, the board may grant an exception to the preceding paragraph. Whimsical dials are prohibited (example: 45 - 82). ""The numbers 1, 16 and 30 are exclusively and necessarily reserved for goalkeepers. Ultimately, the number 40 can be assigned. All teams must have a jersey with number 33 that is not assigned to a player and reserved for breaking replacements. A directory is established early in the season and available to referees and delegates by the LFP."" Incredibly, Donnarumma is now the ninth goalkeeper in PSG's first-team squad, with manager Mauricio Pochettino just two players away from fielding a full XI of goalkeepers. However, Alphonse Areola, who spent last season on loan at Fulham, is said to be nearing a permanent move to West Ham. ",positive,liverpool,0

Juventus and Barcelona have been showing interest in the Italy international after he failed to agree a new contract at the San Siro, but The Sun are reporting that he also has admirers in the Premier League.

Milan are reportedly close to signing Lille's Ligue One-winning goalkeeper Mike Maignan as Donnarumma's replacement. Donnarumma made his Serie A debut as a 16-year-old and has gone to amass over 250 appearances for his boyhood club, keeping 88 clean sheets in between the sticks. Because of his relationship with Raiola, he's not always had the best rapport with the Rossoneri fans and was recently said to have been reduced to tears when some of the club's ultras threatened him at the training ground.

The Old Lady have become rather used to buying players for no transfer fee. Last season midfielder Adrien Rabiot played just 20 games in all competitions for PSG and the last one of those was on December 11th, when he came on as a late substitute in the Champions League game against Red Star. That was because the midfielder decided that he was going to leave the French champions at the end of the season, when his contract expired, for nothing, with Thomas Tuchel deciding to freeze the player out of the team. Loadingâ¦ Now, according to reports in France, it looks like Rabiot will be swapping Paris for Turin as he is rumoured to have agreed a deal to join Juventus. Earlier this year the Old Lady confirmed that they'd signed another midfielder for nothing in the shape of Aaron Ramsey, that's two very good signings for nothing. And it's hardly like it's the first time the Italian champions have used their transfer market filters on the expired contracts market. Since 2009 the Old Lady have signed Fabio Cannavaro, Andrea Pirlo, Paul Pogba, Kingsley Coman, Sami Khedira and Dani Alves- a pretty decent group of freebies. Cannavaro returned for just one season after his time at Real Madrid and it might not have been the greatest time in the defenders career but for a big fat zero euros that's a decent signing. Pirlo's move to Juve was rather more successful. AC Milan thought the midfielder was past his best but he defied that thinking winning four Serie A titles with the club and helping them to a Champions League final. Pogba made up an incredible midfield alongside Pirlo, and Arturo Vidal who only cost around Â£8 million, also winning four league titles before making the Old Lady a profit of around Â£90 million! Coman may have only played 15 league games for Juve but he did help them to win a Serie A title and still managed to make them â¬30 million in the process of moving to Bayern Munich, still a bit of a success. Having joined from Real Madrid German midfielder Khedira has gone on to win two league titles with the club and could win more silverware before his time in Turin is done. Loadingâ¦ Dani Alves might have only stayed for one season in Italy but during his time he was excellent for Juventus, helping them to yet another Serie A title and helping to propel them into the Champions League final, quite literally with his smashing goal against Monaco in the semi-final. It'll be interesting to see how Rabiot and Ramsey fit into Maurizio Sarri's team next season but if it doesn't work out at least they didn't pay too much for their two new midfielders.

Loadingâ¦ Donnarumma decided to walk away from AC Milan at the end of the season, when his contract expired, despite making his debut for the club's first team aged just 16 years and 242 days, The 22-year-old is showing at Euro 2020 why he is so well thought of but he is actually yet to decide on his future, although it's only a matter of time. Most reports seem to think that he will move to Ligue 1 side PSG, despite Juventus being the early front runners, and other sides also being interested. However if Donnarumma does indeed move to the Parc des Princes then it looks like he won't actually be the team's de facto number one choice in goal. According to TeleFoot, the Italian will actually be made to compete with Keylor Navas for the gloves, when initially he was actually going to be sent out on loan. The report goes on to say that some senior players, Neymar amongst them, were actually surprised by the links between the club and the Milan player. However PSG felt they couldn't miss out on a player of Donnarumma's quality, on a deal that wouldn't see them pay a transfer fee. The fact he's a 22-year-old with six years first team experience certainly works in his favour, if he plays as long as fellow Italian, namesake, and legendary keeper, Gianluigi Buffon then PSG could have a keeper for 20 years on their hands. PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino could have the most incredible bench ever next season, and not just because of his potential back up keeper. Reports have claimed that Kylian Mbappe wants to leave the French capital, with Real Madrid and Liverpool potential destinations, and has just one year left of his contract. The former Tottenham Hotspur manager has been urged to keep Mbappe on the bench for the entire season, if the former Monaco forward won't sign a new deal. That could lead to the 2018 World Cup winner being sat doing not an awful lot all year, next to Donnarumma, and with his contract running out anyway it wouldn't actually lead to his value dropping.

Former Uruguay youth international Schiappacasse was arrested in his homeland in January after being caught with a 9mm pistol in his car, according to The Sun. Reports at the time claimed he had told investigators he was taking the weapon to a fan of Uruguayan club Penarol ahead of a derby match against rivals Nacional. Schiappacasse was on loan at Penarol from Serie A side Sassuolo at the time of his arrest. According to the report, Schiappacasse was arrested after a gun was discovered in a coat on his lap during a routine traffic stop. Police later released photographs of the player being handcuffed, as well as image of the seized weapon. After admitting his guilt, Schiappacasse struck a deal with state prosecutors to allow him to serve six months of his sentence at the home of his parents. Once he is released on parole, Schiappacasse must also do four hours of community service a week and has been ordered to sign on regularly at a local police station. He had already spent two months and 12 days in jail on remand near the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo before Thursday's court hearing, which will now be deducted from his sentence. Schiappacasse still has one year remaining on his current deal with Sassuolo, who he joined in October 2020. The former Atletico Madrid youth player has reportedly been given permission to train and play with third division Uruguayan side El Tanque Sisley once he is released from prison. However, he must stay indoors at all other times until he completes his six-month house arrest. Speaking after the sentencing, Schiappacasseâs lawyer Karen Pintos said: âAt the beginning he was very depressed but afterwards he started adapting to prison life. âHe is very repentant and showed it at all times during the hearing.

The Italian newspaper reports that the former Tottenham manager wants to hold part of Roma's pre-season abroad. However, any Italian location has reportedly been ruled out for pre-season as Mourinho wants to 'maintain maximum privacy' around the Roma squad.

Another of the Special One's requests include his desire to see Roma play three friendly matches in one week, according to reports.

It has since emerged that Tomori's leap, which left Giorgio Chiellini & Matthijs de Ligt grounded, was a height of 2.63m (roughly 8.6 feet). In comparison, Ronaldo managed to reach 2.54m (roughly 8.3 feet) to score vs Sampdoria back in 2019.  Tomori has become the first Englishman to score for Milan since David Beckham over a decade ago and he's enjoying himself in Italy. Despite being used regularly by Frank Lampard last season, the 23-year-old fell down the pecking order after Thiago Silva's arrival in the summer. Limited game time saw him jump to the Rossoneri, for who he has made 14 Serie A appearances. A clause in his loan deal means the Italian outfit can sign him for around Â£23 million this summer, with manager Stefano Pioli keen. He told reporters per Daily Mail: ""We want to buy Tomori on a permanent deal from Chelsea. Our intention is clear and also Fikayo's decision (staying at Milan). ""We'll see what happens at the end of the season."" Meanwhile, legendary defender Franco Baresi said back in March: ""We will do everything possible to sign him on a permanent deal.

How does a young centre-back look making his debut with gloves? ""For sure he's not going to scare the striker."" Despite seeming harsh, Ibrahimovic's instructions seem to have worked. Milan kept a clean sheet and went on to win the game 1-0. Kalulu has since made seven more appearances for the Rossoneri, who are currently top of Serie A. Ibrahimovic is key player in the club's revival and has scored 10 goals this campaign, while only playing seven games. The 39-year-old continued: ""I'll decide my future at the end of the season with AC Milan. As long as I feel good on the pitch, I keep playing."" Milan advanced to the Coppa Italia quarter-finals on Tuesday evening after defeating Torino 5-4 on penalties. Ironically, Kalulu was named man of the match by Milan's official website.

""It is a pity we did not win the game in the 90 minutes. We still showed quality because even scoring 5 penalties is not random.

Giroud, who is currently enjoying a short break following France's shock Euro 2020 exit last week, scored 11 times in 31 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions last season. And his consistent form and keen eye for goal has, in recent seasons, seen him heavily linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge and even came close to joining Inter Milan last year. But rather than join Inter, the Frenchman has instead agreed on a two-year contract with San Siro rivals AC Milan worth â¬3.5million (Â£3m) per year, plus bonuses. Not too shabby, eh? That's according to Sky Sports in Italy, anyway, which claims that Milan are yet to agree a fee with Chelsea and hope the Blues may let Giroud leave for free in order to cut their wage bill down. Italian news outlet il Corriere dello Sport, also report that Giroud must hurry his transfer if he wishes to sign for the Italians or face his move falling through with the Serie A club. To make the move happen, reports claim that Giroud must force Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's hand as Milan have no intention to pay a transfer fee for the striker. With that said, the coming days will reveal Giroud's future as Milan are said to be willing to move onto other targets. Chelsea have already sold one player to Milan this window, with Fikayo Tomori making his move to San Siro permanent after a successful season-long loan. Meanwhile, the Blues are still thought to be targeting a new striker in the summer transfer window, with Erling Haaland sitting at the top on their wishlist, meaning that Giroud's playing time would be impacted further.

Ronaldo managed to score in the game, but a report from AS has revealed he missed Monday training for a bizarre reason. Juventus suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat to AC Milan and players were forced to attend training the day later - that is, players who aren't Ronaldo. The 36-year-old was given a day off to collect his new Â£1.4million Ferrari Monza straight from the manufacturer. Juventus president Andrea Agnelli accompanied Ronaldo and it's seen Juventus players voice their concerns. It's believed the team do not see Ronaldo as a leader on the pitch and his reaction to things not going his way is negative. Rumours of him being 'isolated' are also frequent following a poor collective season under Andrea Pirlo. Having made his name as a big game player in the Champions League, Ronaldo is uninterested in stepping down to the Europa League. Pirlo addressed rumours the five-time Ballon d'Or winner receives special treatment earlier this season. ""I treat him like I treat all the other players,"" Pirlo explained.

As a result of his sizzling form, the Belgian powerhouse is one of the hottest strikers in the European market today - with his former club Chelsea among the favourites to bag his signature. In his first season in Italy, the 28-year-old scored 23 league goals and has surpassed the 20-goal mark once again, as he continues to prove his lethal ability. Lukaku first showcased his talent in the Premier League at Chelsea, West Bromwich Albion, Everton and Manchester United - and has fully embraced the challenge of operating in a new environment at Milan. And with the Belgians form catching the eye of clubs around Europe, Chelsea are now leading the packs in terms of his previous clubs if he were to make a sensational move back to England. According to Belgian publication HLN, Chelsea is Lukaku's ""club of heart"" and have already had a word with his agent, though they have no made a ""concrete proposal"" as of yet. And with the Euros now well on the horizon, it won't just be Chelsea that will be queuing up for Lukaku. It is expected that an array of clubs from around the world will also be keeping a close eye on how the Belgian does during the tournament - and the betting suggests exactly that, too. Romelu Lukaku has been linked with a move away from Inter after another impressive campaign in Italy - with Chelsea favourites to bring the Belgian back to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea signed him in 2011, but he failed to make the grade and spent three seasons on loan at West Brom and then Everton before moving to Goodison Park on a permanent deal. Could a return to west London be on the cards? Well, the bookies sure seem to think so. Reports suggest Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola will be given a Â£200m cash injection this summer to bolster his ranks at the Etihad. And according to The Sun, top of his wishlist is Romelu Lukaku, as well as Borussia Dortmund talent Erling Haaland. Would Lukaku make the move to City having already played for fierce rivals United, though? Paris Saint-Germain already have a frighteningly talented side with world-class attackers such as Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, so it's hard to see them make a move for Lukaku. However, the Ligue 1 giants know how to spend their money - and if they spend it right this summer, then the Belgian will almost certainly be a name that will be high on their list. With Harry Kane's future up in the air, Tottenham Hotspur will be looking for a replacement if, of course, the England captain leaves. And with the mega-money that chairman Daniel Levy will demand, what better replacement is there than Lukaku? Will it happen, though? Probably not. 25/1 bar.

Unless they win the title next season, Milan will go longer than their San Siro city rivals in not winning the title for a decade, and Nocerino believes that's all down to a goal that wasn't given. In 2011/12, Milan were locked in a title race with the Old Lady and the pair came up against each other in February in Milan. Nocerino gave Massimiliano Allegri's the lead and it looked like Sulley Muntari had made it 2-0 when he headed home a second half corner past Gianluigi Buffon. The Juve keeper scrambled the ball away, but it had gone over the line, and the officials didn't give the goal, in a pre VAR and pre goal line technology era. Instead of going 2-0 up, Milan went on to concede a late equaliser to Alessandro Matri before going on to lose the title by four points to Conte's team, as he started a sequence of nine titles in-a-row in Turin, before breaking it with Inter. Nocerino believes that the goal didn't just change that title race, but also the history of the club. ""It wasn't after the game everyone went mad, it was straight after the goal,"" the Italian told The Italian Football Podcast. ""It was incredible, it was a goal. Buffon moved behind his goal-line when he clawed the ball. ""This moment changed the future of Milan. With this goal, Milan would have won the Scudetto. The big players - Zlatan and Thiago Silva - wouldn't have left the club that summer. ""The club would have invested more money to win as well going forward. So this ghost goal changed the history of Milan. ""If Milan had won the Scudetto, Zlatan and Thiago would have stayed, Milan for sure would have won more Scudetti."" Ibra and Silva were sold to PSG that summer, after a 4-2 loss in the Milan derby ended their title hopes on the penultimate weekend of the season, with Giampaolo Pazzini and Francesco Acerbi the main replacements in the transfer window. Since then the club have only had one top four finish, finishing third the season after, and have never returned to the heights they previously reached. Who knows what would have happened if Muntari's goal had correctly been counted. ",positive,liverpool,0

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner made a shock switch to Juventus in 2018, scoring 101 goals in 134 games and winning two Serie A titles. But in recent times Leonardo Bonucci said the club are playing better as a team without him and Giorgio Chiellini blamed his exit in the summer - and the manner of it - for the club's poor start to the season. Loadingâ¦ Woof, shots fired by Bonucci over Cristiano Ronaldo: ""In recent past Juventus didn't play as team: we all played to make him able to score. We had lost the ability to suffer together thinking he could have fix everything""Solskjaer, Manchester United, ringing any bell? And a new report from Italian outlet Tuttosport sheds light on how distant Ronaldo was from the rest of the squad. It's said that Ronaldo, unlike superstars that came before him like Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba, Andrea Pirlo and Gonzalo Higuain, did not follow suit in buying into defending as a unit. Despite his knack for winning games on his own with his unrivalled quality in the final forward, the 36-year-old apparently was ""never part of the pack' and did not participate defensively. Although he's hit six goals in eight games in his second stint at United so far, this very same accusation has been made regarding Ronaldo this season over a perceived lack of pressing and work-rate. On Wednesday night, after Ronaldo scored a stunning late header against Atalanta, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praised Ronaldo's off the ball work, saying, ""If anyone wants to criticise him for work-rate or attitude, just watch this game. Watch how he runs around."" Furthermore, while other Juve players would encourage if a pass was misplaced, Ronaldo was prone for criticising and his presence is reported to have caused ""cracks"" to appear in terms of discipline and team spirit. At the start of the season, the Bianconeri managed just one win from their first four games as rumours surrounding Ronaldo's future began to affect Max Allegri's squad. Things have improved recently though, with Juventus now undefeated in nine games - winning eight and drawing one. ",positive,liverpool,0

However, on a dramatic night in Turin, it was Sergio Conceicao's side who went through on away goals, with the former Lazio player guiding his side through despite going down to 10 men. Striker Taremi, who scored the first goal of the tie, was shown two yellows in two minutes at the beginning of the second half, the second for kicking the ball away. Having watched his teammates go on and win the game, the Iranian was clearly very sorry for his actions at full time and was consoled by his manager as the emotions overcame him.

Andrea Pirlo didn't have to wait long after half-time to see his side get back into the tie, with Chiesa scoring in the 49th minute.

And Ronaldo, the highest-scorer in the Champions League, was unable to influence either of the round of 16 ties. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has made a career out of producing on the big European nights, whether it be for Manchester United, Real Madrid or Juventus.

However, Portuguese newspaper A Bola reported that the incident involving Porto's stadium announcer came after Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League. Do Dragao speaker Fernando Saul pulled no punches towards Juventus and Ronaldo in two Instagram Stories. According to Football Italia, he branded Juventus as the ""Italian thieves"" and called out that ""pig Ronaldo"" in shocking remarks. The publication added that Saul even fired a disparaging insult to Ronaldo's mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, who he called a ""toothless"" crone. The Disciplinary Board of the Portuguese Federation condemned the behaviour and handed down a â¬1,430 fine that Saul would be required to pay to Ronaldo. A representative of Ronaldo's former club Sporting CP raised concerns over Saul's comments after spotting them on Instagram Stories, according to reports.

On Sunday night, a joint statement by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs confirmed their plans for a breakaway 'Super League' competition. The deal would mark the greatest revolution in European football since the 1950s, and could kill the lucrative Champions League, which was on Monday due to announce plans to increase in size. The Premier League's 'big six,' along with three sides from Serie A and three from La Liga, were the founding clubs to have signed their name to the new competition, with three more clubs potentially joining. Instead of replacing the domestic leagues, the new competition is set to be played in midweek and would therefore replace the Champions League, however, it won't be that simple. 12 clubs join European Super League In their statement on Sunday, European footballing governing body UEFA confirmed that teams would face bans from domestic competitions, whilst players involved in the Super League would miss international tournaments. ""As previously announced by FIFA and the six Confederations, the clubs concerned will be banned from playing in any other competition at domestic, European or world level, and their players could be denied the opportunity to represent their national teams."" And if that didn't serve as much of a deterrent, UEFA have also threatened to sue the clubs involved up to â¬60bn. With battle lines now drawn for a sport in civil war, SPORTbible explores the key questions and themes... England's so-called ""big six"" signed up with six other European teams for a plot that would change the game as we know it. Initially spearheaded by Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, the proposed new competition could generate Â£3.1bn for the first 15 members. To put that into context, UEFA currently distributes about Â£3bn in prize money and television broadcasting deals with clubs participating in all its European competitions each year. Secret talks have been taking place for years about generating a bigger prize pot for the biggest teams, but a plan has accelerated since last autumn. Atletico Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan have also signed up - but not Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund or Paris St Germain. The Premier League's big-six clubs - Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham - are all involved. AC Milan, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur have all joined as 'Founding Clubs'. It is anticipated that a further three clubs will join ahead of the inaugural season, which, according to the clubs, ""is intended to commence as soon as practicable"". The proposals appear to be an 11th-hour bid to derail sweeping Champions League reforms due to be rubber-stamped from 2024. That deal had already been branded by fans as an ""indefensible"" power grab due to increased matches and revenue for the top clubs but Ed Woodward, executive vice-chairman at United, and Ivan Gazidis, chief executive of Italy's AC Milan, were known to have objections over commercial arrangements. UEFA had been confident that the current changes to the format of the Champions League from 2024 were enough to see off a breakaway, having drawn up plans to guarantee more fixtures and - most controversially - more certainty that the biggest clubs would be involved in the lucrative competition in the first place. But, while clubs on Friday gave the governing body the green light to approve the plan on Monday, concerns remained among the giants around media and sponsorship rights. Under the last offer from UEFA, 51 percent ownership would remain with the governing body, with the rest controlled by the European Club Association. Jurgen Klopp comments on European Super League resurface Almost universal condemnation from everyone but the clubs involved. Gary Neville, the former Manchester United and England defender, was among those outraged by plans which could cause untold financial damage to smaller clubs - but create billions more for the top clubs. ""I'm a Manchester United fan and I have been for 40 years of my life but I'm absolutely disgusted,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I'm disgusted with Manchester United and Liverpool most. Liverpool, they pretend 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the people's club, the fans' club. ""Manchester United, 100 years borne out of workers round here, and they're breaking away into a league without competition, that they can't be relegated from? It's an absolute disgrace."" The Super League website reads: ""The Super League is a new European competition between 20 top clubs comprised of 15 founders and five annual qualifiers. There will be two groups of 10 clubs each, playing home and away fixtures within the group each year. ""Following the group stage, eight clubs will qualify for a knockout tournament, playing home and away until the single-match Super League championship, in a dramatic four-week end to the season. ""Games will be played midweek, and all clubs will remain in their domestic leagues."" In their statement, the clubs themselves have outlined the format in three stages: UEFA to ban clubs and players from participation in competitions According to the Super League statement released on Sunday night, the new competition ""is intended to commence as soon as practicable."" They are proposing a general August start for when the new Super League season does get underway but there are of course lots of hurdles to overcome, most notably from the likes of Uefa and Fifa, before anything is being close to being rubberstamped. About $5billion has been committed to this new project by the American bank JP Morgan. In their own announcement, the breakaways clubs state 'The Founding Clubs will receive an amount of â¬3.5 billion solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic.' This does feel significant, both for the future of English and European football. We have been here before - namely Project Big Picture - but what feels different this time is the level of planning and what may or may not have been signed. The furious reaction from the Premier League, UEFA and other European leagues signify just how much this threatens the integrity of domestic and European leagues. Clubs would need the approval of the associations, who govern the domestic competitions, to join an unsanctioned breakaway league. ""I cannot envisage any scenario where such permission would be granted,"" said Premier League chief executive Richard Masters in a memo to all 20 Premier League clubs. Well, in short, potentially huge. Under Premier League rule L.9, which all 20 clubs sign up to, clubs must obtain 'prior written approval of the Board' if they wish to enter to anything other than the Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, FA Community Shield, Carabao Cup or any other competition sanctioned by the county association. Any player whose club agrees to join an unsanctioned competition risks not playing in any UEFA or FIFA competition, including the European Championships and World Cup. In January, FIFA had said that a breakaway league would not be recognised and that ""any club or player involved in such a competition would as a consequence not be allowed to participate in any competition organised by FIFA or their respective confederation.""

This is intolerable under the rule of law"" https://t.co/rjru0vvKRB It reads: ""In relation to the statement released by UEFA on the 7th May in respect of the Super League and the position taken by 9 of its founding clubs, FÃºtbol Club Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid Club de FÃºtbol state the following:I- The founding clubs have suffered, and continue to suffer, unacceptable third-party pressures, threats, and offenses to abandon the project and therefore desist from their right and duty to provide solutions to the football ecosystem via concrete proposals and constructive dialogue. This is intolerable under the rule of law and Tribunals have already ruled in favour of the Super League proposal, ordering FIFA and UEFA to, either directly or through their affiliated bodies, refrain from taking any action which may hinder this initiative in any way while court proceedings are pending.II- The Super League project was designed jointly by its 12 founding clubs:a. with the aim of providing solutions to the current unsustainable situation in the football industry. The 12 founding clubs shared the same concerns -as other stakeholders in European football do-, particularly under the current socio-economic context, that structural reforms are indispensable to ensure our sport stays appealing and survives in the long-term. To that effect, on 18th April, they announced their willingness to create the Super League and establish a channel of communication with UEFA and FIFA, in a constructive spirit of collaboration between the parties, as it was so notified to each of them on such date;b. with the utmost respect for the current football structures and ecosystem. The founding clubs expressly agreed that the Super League would only take place if such a competition was recognised by UEFA and/or FIFA or if, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, it was deemed to be a competition duly compatible for all purposes with the continuity of the founding clubs in their respective domestic competitions. However, despite being aware of the above terms, UEFA and FIFA have so far refused to establish any adequate channel of communication; andc. to bring financial stability to the entire European football family, currently under the effects of a deep crisis that threatens the survival of many clubs. Testament of it, the announced commitment to establish annual solidarity payments for guaranteed annual amounts that materially multiply those distributed by UEFA, and the obligation to reinforce financial sustainability rules, through the creation of a clear, transparent and effective control system verified by experts.III- The 12 founding clubs also acknowledged that the Super League was a unique opportunity to offer fans around the world the best possible show and to reinforce global interest in the sport, which is not a ""given"" and is challenged by new generational trends. Moreover, one of its main objectives was to promote women's football on a global level, a tremendous, but currently underestimated, opportunity for the sector.IV- We are fully aware of the diversity of reactions to the Super League initiative and, consequently, of the need to reflect on the reasons for some of them. We are ready to reconsider the proposed approach, as necessary. However, we would be highly irresponsible if, being aware of the needs and systemic crisis in the football sector, which led us to announce the Super League, we abandoned such mission to provide effective and sustainable answers to the existential questions that threaten the football industry.V- We regret to see that our friends and founding partners of the Super League project have now found themselves in such inconsistent and contradictory position when signing a number of commitments to UEFA yesterday. However, given that the material issues that led the 12 founding clubs to announce the Super League weeks ago have not gone away, we reiterate that, to honour our history, to comply with our obligations towards our stakeholders and fans, for the good of football and for the financial sustainability of the sector, we have the duty to act in a responsible manner and persevere in the pursuit of adequate solutions, despite the unacceptable and ongoing pressures and threats received from UEFA.VI- Mostly, we reiterate to FIFA, UEFA and all football stakeholders, as we have done on several occasions since the announcement of the Super League, our commitment and firm will to discuss, with respect and without intolerable pressure and in accordance with the rule of law, the most appropriate solutions for the sustainability of the whole football family.

An own goal from Harry Maguire pulled Spurs level for a second time but Ronaldo then completed his hat-trick with a bullet header to seal a 3-2 win for the home side. Bican, whose career spanned from 1931 to 1955, scored the majority of his goals for Slavia Prague - finishing his career with an incredible record of 427 goals in 221 games for the Czech side.

Ronaldo moved to Juventus in 2018, after helping Real Madrid to their third Champions League title in-a-row, with the desire to bring European success back to the Old Lady. That has proved difficult for the five time Ballon d'Or winner and Juve are now on the verge of missing out on the competition next season, unless either Napoli or AC Milan mess up on the final day of the season. Juventus missing out would almost certainly lead to Ronaldo leaving the club and he has only accelerated the rumours with his latest move. Per Semper Calcio took video of the 36-year-old having his supercars packed up from his Turin home and driven away, at 3 o'clock in the morning. Loadingâ¦ The company being used by Ronaldo is Rodo Cargo, a Lisbon based Portuguese moving company, which is where the former Manchester United star started his career. There has already been talk that the Portugal star could be heading back to Sporting this summer, with his mum insisting he's about to go back to his first senior club, despite having a year left on his Juve deal. Moving his cars to Lisbon could simply be as an interim whilst he sorts out his future or it could be another major hint to where his future lies. His collection arriving in Turin, from Madrid, was in fact the first sign that he was heading to the then Italian champions, making their departure particularly relevant. Loadingâ¦ Another return is actually the bookies favourite for Ronaldo's future, with Real Madrid's all time top goalscorer 7/4 to head back to the Premier League with Manchester United. One issue there might be Monday night's revelation that Harry Kane wants to leave Tottenham Hotspur but stay in England's top tier, with United one of his potential destinations. PSG are second favourites to land Ronaldo should he decide to leave Andrea Pirlo's side with Real next ahead of Sporting.

The reason, according to newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, is that the player is seen to be given too many special freedoms and privileges when compared to his teammates. A prime example is the news that, while the rest of the Juve squad had to come in for an extra day's training the day after a 3-0 defeat to AC Milan earlier this month, Ronaldo went to pick up a Â£1.4 million Ferrari. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was reportedly accompanied by the Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, strengthening the belief that he is given special perks from the most powerful people at the club. This has left Ronaldo cut adrift as an isolated figure among his teammates with back-up goalkeeper Carlo Pinsoglio the only player he sees away from the football pitch, according to Gazetta. There has been plenty of speculation that the 36-year-old will leave Turin this summer, despite having another year on his contract with Juve. The goals have come - and Ronaldo is top scorer in Serie A this season with 29 strikes - but the team have gradually slid during his three-year spell. Even those in Italy who the Portuguese ace has upset acknowledge that it far from entirely Ronaldo's fault; Juve have a squad in need of refreshing and choosing the inexperienced Andrea Pirlo as manager has not paid off. However if it's true that Ronaldo is now isolated from his teammates, a summer move seems inevitable, with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United reportedly monitoring the situation, while others claim boyhood club Sporting CP or even a move to MLS is more likely.

And now, according to reputable French publication LâEquipe, the five-time Ballon dâOr winner is trying to engineer a move to Manchester City and Juve have named their asking price, too. Ronaldo, who is in the final year of his contract in Turin, was reported earlier this month to have been offered to the reigning Premier League champions by his controversial agent Jorge Mendes. LâEquipe suggests that City are keen to pay Ronaldoâs wages, but are unwilling to pay for a transfer fee, with the Italian giants holding out for around Â£25m for the 36-year-old. They also claim that Ronaldo is making moves behind the scenes and has spoken to Cityâs Portuguese stars in Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias and Joao Cancelo. Ronaldo has also been linked with a blockbuster move to Paris Saint-Germain, with the Ligue 1 powerhouses keen on linking him with fellow Ballon dâOr-hauler Lionel Messi. ï»¿ï»¿ According to Spanish outlet OK Diario, Nasser Al-Khelaifi wants to see Ronaldo play alongside a crop of superstars which include Messi, Neymar, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Marco Verratti. Their report, however, claims that the move will only be viable if Kylian Mbappe - who reportedly rejected a new five-year contract at Les Parisiens last month - trades the French capital for the Spanish, in a big-money move. With that lucrative move in mind, Real Madrid submitted an opening bid of Â£137 to sign the 22-year-old on Tuesday night, with the ball now firmly in PSGâs court. If that move does come to fruition, then football fans around the world could see Ronaldo and Messi - two of the greatest to ever play the beautiful game - link up as teammates, instead of opponents.

The Old Lady have struggled in the opening weeks of the season. Following their 3-0 defeat in the Joan Gamper Trophy final against Barcelona earlier this month, the club have since recorded two disappointing results in the league and currently sit in 13th place in Serie A. They could only pick up a point against Udinese in the opening game of the campaign and on Saturday night, they suffered a surprise defeat in their first home game, as a goal from Leonardo Mancuso in the 21st minute sealed all three points for Empoli. Things then went from bad to worse when footage of a clearly frustrated Chiellini emerged online. In the clip below, Allegri can be seen covering his mouth when he spoke to the Italian defender but Chiellini decided to let his feelings known to the cameras. Many believe the Italian centre-back said: ""It's not a team"" After the shock defeat in Turin - the first game of the post-Ronaldo era - Juve boss Allegri also blamed a lack of teamwork. ""We started off well but conceded from our first mistake then stopped playing as a team, handing space and the initiative to Empoli,"" he said. ""We should have played as team, not individually. We needed to fill the box better but we made lots of technical errors because our play became frenetic. ""You have to manage the game and the ball differently and you have to be patient when defending, because if you rush around trying to win back possession you leave gaps for the opposition.""

After the Welsh winger's involvement in Euro 2020, he has returned to Madrid after spending one season on-loan with Tottenham. During Bale's time back in North London, his Madrid teammate Marco Asensio swooped in for Bale's No 11 which left him without an official squad number when returning this summer and many fans started to further question his future at the club. Since the departure of Zinedine Zidane and the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, Bale looks set to be a far more prominent member of the squad which has been confirmed through the La Liga website as he is given the No 18 shirt. :exclamation:' Gareth Bale takes number 18, Luka Jovic takes number 16, Rodrygo takes number 21. pic.twitter.com/gv4RPmtzDT After Bale's transfer to China collapsed in 2019, he had a fractious relationship with Zidane and the Madrid fans. However, Bale has spoken in recent months of the great relationship he has with Ancelotti after they won the Champions League together in 2014 and how he has looked forward to working with him again: ""I know Carlo Ancelotti is a great manager.I get on with him really well, we had some great times in the past. ""He's returned to Real Madrid and he's a great guy. We had a great time together at Real Madrid and I'm sure he's going to be amazing in charge there.""

Despite his contributions in the Spanish capital, Bale does not hold a good rapport with the club's supporters - and there was of course the infamous 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order,' flag he held proudly when on international duty with his country. But when you look at all the big-game performances and clutch moments Bale has produced, you can't help but feel he's been treated a little harshly. A fan has shared a compilation of Bale's highlights at the Santiago Bernabeu, complete with the caption: ""History will be harsh on Bale because his own fanbase didn't get behind him. At other clubs he'd get a statue for what he's done."" Some of the goals, many of which were important ones, are just outrageous. The exquisite side-foot volley against Borussia Dortmund, the ruining of Marc Bartra in the 2014 Copa Del Rey final and THAT angry yet stunning overhead kick after coming off the bench in the 2018 Champions League final to name just a few. He's scored more goals for Real than both Ronaldo Nazario and Zinedine Zidane, his manager for a number of years, and yet there's a massive widespread disdain from Madridstas. The on-loan Spurs man was even booed by 80,000 fans Madrid fans in an El Clasico against Barcelona in 2019. Bale has opened about how the whistling affected him and expressed his perplexity at the antics from his own supporters. ""I just don't get it,"" he said on the Erik Anders Lang show. ""Because if you're not having a good time on the pitch, you would expect your fans to get behind you and try and make you do better because that will make them happy. But it seems to be they do the opposite. ""They just whistle you, which makes you feel worse, so you lose your confidence. They you play worse, which is going to make them even more upset. It's sort of a Real Madrid thing. Other clubs do it, but Real Madrid are especially known for it. ""So, I might have just missed an easy chance to score a goal. And the whistles come and you think: 'My confidence is already down because I missed an easy goal and now it's just going even more down.' And the next time a chance comes the goal seems tiny. It's like a putt. The goal just gets smaller."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ The 31-year-old has one more year remaining on his Real Madrid contract and has just spent a year back at Tottenham Hotspur. A shock report from Spanish outlet ABC detailed that Bale was ready to step away from football after this summer's tournament with Wales. However, Jonathan Barnett swiftly shot that down in a statement to talkSPORT which read: ""Sorry, I don't speak about rubbish reporting."" Bale had told Sky Sports following Sunday's 4-2 win over Leicester, a game in which he scored twice, that he'd decided his next move which would cause 'chaos'. ""I know what I'm doing but it will just cause chaos if I say anything,"" he explained. ""I am not thinking about anything, all I'm concentrating on now is obviously finishing this season off strong. ""We meet up straight away for the Euros and I'm not thinking about anything else other than Wales."" Bale has won it all with Real Madrid, including La Liga and multiple Champions League trophies. Despite this, his frosty relationship with manager Zinedine Zidane and 'Los Blancos' fans leaves his future in the balance. He isn't the most popular at the Santiago Bernabeu and recent comments regarding Eden Hazard won't have gone down well. The Belgian received pelters for celebrating with Chelsea stars after the Blues qualified for the Champions League final - at Madrid's expense. Spanish media went in hard on Hazard, but teammate Bale defended him when asked about the scenes. ""I've seen it,"" Bale told the Times of the reaction, ""It was literally as if he'd just murdered everybody. It's a game of football at the end of the day. ""In Spain, football is very magnified.

Loadingâ¦ Xavi's side ran riot in El Clasico thanks to a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang brace as well as goals from Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres. Los Blancos were without Karim Benzema up front and it meant attacking responsibility fell on the shoulders of Vinicius. With the score still only 1-0, the 21-year-old was put through one-on-one against goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. WOW... pic.twitter.com/LQOYYR79Ki Instead of trying to score, Vinicius went towards ter Stegen and flopped to the ground in search of a penalty. Disappointing to see from a player who has been in top form for club and country this campaign. Barcelona veteran Gerard Pique was immediately in Vinicius' face and wagged his finger before putting his arm around the youngster. Vinicius has scored 14 goals and registered nine assists in La Liga this season but failed to make an impact at the Santiago Bernabeu. Barcelona were scoring goals. Pique was telling Vinicius how he met his wife Shakira. #ElClasico #RMAFCB pic.twitter.com/zUZZJuxQL7 Fans have reacted to the incident and they can't understand why Vinicius didn't try to chip or round the goalkeeper. One commented: ""Still can't get over Viniciusâ dive when he was clean through on goal. One of the most pathetic things Iâve ever seen."" Another said: ""Vinicius Junior has come a long way, but one of the senior players or Ancelotti should give him an absolute bollocking."" A third put: ""Vinicius should have got a Yellow for that dive. Absolute disgrace, and he's complaining about it for long."" While someone tweeted: ""That dive from Vinicius is absolutely and utterly abysmal, shameful, disgraceful - all of those things. A moment of complete madness."" Real had won the previous five meetings between these two bitter rivals but they'll be wanting to forget this one in a hurry. Aubameyang opened the scoring 29 minutes in with a goal straight out of Borussia Dortmund circa 2017, heading home an Ousmane Dembele cross. Dembele turned provider once again in the 40th minute as Araujo doubled the away side's lead. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti attempted to mix things up after the break and replaced Toni Kroos with Eduardo Camavinga, but it was too little too late. Torres made it 3-0 in the 47th minute and Aubameyang grabbed his second in the 51st minute to ensure emphatic victory. Real are still nine points clear of Sevilla at the top with Barcelona in third. There's little chance of the Blaugrana mounting a title charge at this stage, but their turnaround under Xavi since he replaced Ronald Koeman in November is clear to see. ",positive,liverpool,0

El Chiringuito have obtained a clip of Bale perfecting his putting in Madrid whilst his teammates are in Manchester for a huge game. Bale's strained relationship with Zidane makes his Real Madrid future very uncertain. The 31-year-old has only started 14 games in all competitions and has played just twice since the restart in June. And a new report claims that Real Madrid regret blocking the winger's proposed Â£1 million-a-week move to China last summer. It's claimed Real Madrid have admitted they made a mistake in preventing his transfer to Jiangsu Suning from happening. Speaking about Bale in his pre-match press conference, Zidane revealed: ""It was a personal conversation I had with him. He preferred not to play. ""The rest remains between me and him but he said he didn't want to play."" When asked about the player's future, the Frenchman replied: ""I don't know. Now he is a current player at Real Madrid.

The Argentina superstar narrowly finished above the Poland and Bayern Munich striker, earning 33 more points than his counterpart. But the decision to award the 34-year-old with yet another Ballon d'Or title did NOT sit well with Real Madrid legend Casillas.

The 48-year-old laid into Messi for his conduct in those games, complaining the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner was quick to wind up his teammates alongside Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. Dudek explained: ""He was deceptive and provocative, the same asBarcelonaand Pep Guardiola. ""They were so ready to provoke you and they were able to do it to perfection. ""That hurtJose Mourinhoand the whole team a lot. ""I saw Messi say such rude things to Pepe and [Sergio] Ramos that you would not imagine from such a quiet and seemingly good person.""

Messi and Ramos are now teammates at Paris Saint-Germain and we still aren't used to it, nearly five months after it was confirmed.

He was videoed at a concert with his wife Antonela Roccuzzo and manager Mauricio Pochettino was unaware until being informed by third parties. Messi has been accused of disrespecting his coach and not giving him an update on the situation. Former PSG winger Jerome Rothen told Radio Monte Carlo: âYou must always respect your coach, this is what I was taught in Clairefontaine. âThe coach must be above everyone else, it does not matter if it is a star or a youth player -- the boss must be the head of the time. âPochettino was not updated as to where Messi was, and that explains a lot of things.

From 2010 to 2013, the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona really ramped up as Mourinho made the whole thing pretty personal. Loadingâ¦ Mourinho had been interviewed for the vacancy of Barca manager, before Pep Guardiola got the job in 2008, and when he arrived in Spain, to take over their rivals, things got really heated. In August 2011, the two sides faced each other in the Supercopa, after the Catalan giants had won La Liga the previous season and Real had won the Copa del Rey, beating Guardiola's side 1-0 in the final. The sides drew 2-2 in the first leg, so it was all to play for when they headed to the Nou Camp for the second leg. After Andres Iniesta and Messi scored, either side of Cristiano Ronaldo's goal, Karim Benzema looked to have sent the game to extra time when he equalised in the 82nd minute. However, Messi had a different idea. Having been in the receiving end of some usual Mourinho antics, the six time Ballon d'Or winner scored the winner in the 88th minute. Never forget when Mourinho beefed Messi, and paid the price. pic.twitter.com/isi7tX5Ivb No one has played in more El Clasico games than Messi, with only Sergio Ramos, who put in the most perfect tackle on Messi in the 2020 edition of the match, level with him on 45 appearances in the famous game. Incredibly, having been such fierce rivals for so many years, the two superstars are now teammates at PSG, although Ramos is yet to make his debut for the club. The 34-year-old forward also has the record for most goals in the competition by a long way, scoring 26 times in all, eight clear of Alfredo di Stefano and Ronaldo in second place. Things haven't gone brilliant for either Barcelona or Messi since the pair parted ways in the summer, with the club's all time top scorer moving to PSG. The players has already had a mini falling out with new manager Mauricio Pochettino, after being taken off in a recent game, but should return from injury for Tuesday's Champions League game with Manchester City. Barca have drawn three of their six La Liga games so far but were given a boost at the weekend with the return of youngster Ansu Fati from a long injury, with the teenager making his first appearance as the number 10.

A post shared by Shakira (@shakira) Marc-Andre ter Stegen did have to make one excellent save early on, but it was Xavi's side who started as the better and they deserved their opening goal. It came just before the half hour mark, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, already enjoying the beginning of his Nou Camp career, headed home from a cross by Ousmane Dembele. Just a few minutes later Vinicius Jr was adamant he should have a penalty, after surging into the box and being felled by Ter-Stegen, but it was clearly a dive, something Pique had a word with the Brazilian over. Ronald Araujo then doubled the visitors lead when he headed home from a corner, and already Carlo Ancelotti's team looked in disarray.

A minute later the former Manchester City forward did have his goal though, after Aubameyang had sent him through against Thibaut Courtois. The Gabon forward then had his second of the game after Pique found Torres, who offloaded to Aubu to strike past the onrushing Courtois. Real were incensed as the linesman's flag had been raised and felt the ball to Torres was offside, however VAR proved that it was onside and the defenders should have played to the whistle. If last night was a warning that Barcelona are back then no one heard it as loudly as those at the Bernabeu. ",positive,liverpool,0

A few in particular may be remembered slightly more than the rest though, and one of those is certainly his incredible solo effort in 2011. At what was possibly the peak of El Clasico, when Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola were going head-to-head for pretty much every competition available, Messi set alight a tight match between the pair in the Champions League semi-final first leg. 11 of Messi's 18 goals v Real Madrid in #LaLigaSantander have come at the Berbabeu. :alien:#LaLigaClassics takes us back to 2013 for #ElClasico tonight! :star::soccer: #LaLigaTV (6pm):house_with_garden: #StayAtHome:tv: https://t.co/RrB7w3YpjJ pic.twitter.com/hneRW1jl1D Pepe, in classic fashion, had managed to get himself sent off after just over an hour, and Mourinho quickly followed him, also in classic fashion, for protesting that decision.

The Spanish giants are arguably the most successful club in footballing history, having won 34 La Liga titles, and reigned European on 13 separate occasions. With their Bernabeu home looking slighted weathered in recent years, Real made the decision to invest heavily in giving the complex a face-lift, firmly bringing the club into the 21st century as they did so. They will certainly have a home befitting of their reputation in the sporting world, as new footage demonstrates. Earlier this week, the club posted a video to its YouTube channel, as well as its official Twitter page, one which shows all of the new features that are set to be introduced at the Bernabeu. This includes pitch removal for other sporting and musical events, with the designers seemingly taking inspiration from Spurs' new retractable pitch for NFL games. However, Real's design goes one step further, as it is the first of its kind to feature an ingenious storage solution for the turf when it gets folded away. :stadium:ï¸:soccer::football::basketball::tennis::microphone:The Santiago BernabÃ©u stadium of the 21st century!âï¸ Check out the pitch removal and storage system! pic.twitter.com/C7xxxvkqeR  In essence, the grass sections are packed with ventilation, air conditioning, an irrigation system, maintenance side walkways, LED lighting, control cameras and ultraviolet light therapy to ensure the pitch is always in good condition. Just as is the case with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, this would allow Real to host NFL, basketball and tennis events moving forwards. The venue will also enhance its hospitality offering with five new restaurants dotted around its upper section, with a sky bar and shopping mall also located on the concourse. The re-design certainly won't be cheap, totalling a reported Â£700 million, but it could be revolutionary in terms of generating income for the club moving forwards. The final stages are due to be completed in June 2022, with the new-look stadium ready to welcome players back for the 22/23 season in August of next year.    ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Whether to include or exclude Alexander-Arnold from the England squad for Euro 2020 has been the main talking point ahead of the summer tournament. There had been talk of the Liverpool star missing out despite his strong end-of-season form, where he helped his side qualify for the Champions League. But Gareth Southgate named the 22-year-old in his provisional 33-man squad - along with the likes of Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier and Reece James.

Unsurprisingly, Alexander Arnold also tops the attacking statistics for the 2020/21 term; from key passes to expected assists. Alexander-Arnold was snubbed of a spot in the England team in March, but he has made Southgate's provisional squad for Euro 2020.

Loadingâ¦ It was a huge controversy when Southgate left Alexander-Arnold, potentially the best right back in the world over the previous two years, out of his World Cup qualification squad back in March. The Three Lions beat San Marino, Albania and Poland without the 22-year-old, who is competing in one of England's most stacked positions. Alexander-Arnold's recent form for his club, including his brilliant performance vs Manchester United last week, led some to believe that he would get back in Southgate's plans for the summer, but that doesn't seem to be the case. According to the Athletic's David Ornstein, the England boss will most likely still pick tried and trusted pair Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier along with Chelsea's Reece James. The report claims that there are still defensive issues for the Liverpool full back to overcome, as even Jamie Carragher highlighted following the Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Southgate obviously thinks that the attacking advantages the Premier League winner might give him don't outway those of the current trio enough to counter such defensive worries. Both Walker and Trippier were part of Southgate's squad who reached the 2018 World Cup semi-final and are well trusted, whilst James is the man in possession right now. As well as being experienced, Southgate likes the fact Walker can play on the right of a back three, whilst Trippier has filled in on the left. James also played in a back three for Chelsea in the FA Cup final. An increase in the size of the squad from 23 players to 26 left many thinking Alexander-Arnold would get into the squad but it now seems that barring injuries he will still miss out. Whilst one Liverpool player is expected to miss out, there is more optimism for Jordan Henderson's selection, despite not playing since February 20th. The midfielder is expected to be called up to the squad, giving England a week to assess him before they have to name their final squad on June 1st, before their warm up matches. The Reds' captain will be given as much time as possible to prove his fitness, as will Harry Maguire, Jack Grealish and Declan Rice, although the final two have returned to club team action already.

On Tuesday afternoon, after he announced a delay in naming his final squad, the England manager released a provisional 33-man preliminary group, which will be trimmed down to 26 players on Tuesday 1 June. The following will join up with the Three Lions this weekend as their preparations for this summer's competition get underway. In terms of those chosen for the provisional 33-man preliminary group, England are sweating over the fitness of Harry Maguire, so Brighton's Ben White and Everton defender Ben Godfrey have both been called up for the first time. The likes of Jesse Lingard, Jude Bellingham and Jack Grealish got the nod in midfield. And despite doubts over whether he would make the team or not, Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold was chosen alongside three other right-backs; Kieran Trippier, Kyle Walker and Reece James. There were rumours that the 22-year-old would miss out on England's Euro 2020 squad despite his impressive form for Liverpool - and there is a chance he could still receive the chop. But during Gareth Southgate's press conference following the 33-man squad announcement, things looked promising for Alexander-Arnold, who could even be deployed as a midfielder, judging by some of the comments made. Speaking to the press on Tuesday afternoon, Southgate said: ""I could easily get drawn into talking about any number of individuals who might be in the 26 and then I'm going to get myself in a mess. ""What I would say is that you are looking at four right-backs, and I know people think I have an obsession with right-backs. ""I just see four good footballers. Trippier can play right-back or left-back, Trent can play right-back, wing-back... I think he can play in midfield."" He continued, saying: ""In the last few days I've also seen Reece James play right of the three at wing-back in the middle of midfield. ""We go into a tournament and those sorts of flexible players who can fulfil different roles but are good footballers are hugely important to us. ""We really don't know how the next few weeks are going to play out in terms of availability, injuries and what our best system will be with the people we have available. We've got too many question marks as I sit here today. ""But that will become far clearer - we know what we'd like to do and we've got good contingencies in place. ""With this squad, we've got a good balance of young players who will have a good experience with us, but we are also building towards a hugely exciting summer and we have to create a team that can win, so we're trying to balance all those decisions. Thoughts on Alexander-Arnold being potentially deployed in midfield for England? He certainly has all the necessary attributes to flourish in those areas. Let us know in the comments.

The England manager left Alexander-Arnold out of his squad entirely in March, sparking speculation that the 22-year-old might not make the summer Euros, despite being regarded as one of the best in Europe in his position. An unlucky seven players will be axed on Tuesday and new reports suggest Alexander-Arnold will be the highest-profile player to depart the Three Lions squad. To be fair to Southgate, he has four top right-backs to choose from. And it seems that Chelsea's Reece James, Atletico Madrid's Kieran Trippier and Manchester City's Kyle Walker are likely to be selected, leaving Alexander-Arnold the odd man out. Each are versatile players who have shown they can play in different positions (James, for example, at right wing, while Walker was used as a right-sided centre-back in a back three during the 2018 World Cup). However Southgate and his staff might believe that taking four players whose primary role is right-back is too many, even in a 26-man squad. Alexander-Arnold is widely regarded as one of the best attacking full-backs in world football. And, while his form suffered a dip this season alongside that of his club Liverpool, he looked just about back to his best again by the end of the campaign. The bookies odds also suggest that Manchester United's 19-year-old Mason Greenwood might not make the cut this time, while Jessie Lingard's goalscoring form at West Ham means he may well nick a spot. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Aston Villa striker Olie Watkins are also potentially facing the axe, while defenders Ben White and Ben Godfrey are expected to miss out. That just leaves one goalkeeper from four to go and Sheffield United's 23-year-old Aaron Ramsdale might have to wait his turn, with West Brom's Sam Johnstone taking the third goalkeeping place. Greenwood is the biggest 'maybe' on that list given his talent, given his regular starting spot for Man United and the fact that Southgate is clearly a fan. But it seems - unless there's a late, sudden change of direction - that Alexander-Arnold will be the right-back to miss out in a position where England are seriously well-stocked.

But earlier on in the second half, he made arguably his most important contribution through a crucial tackle on Ryan Fraser. Newcastle countered down the right and Josh Murphy crossed for the onrushing Fraser.

Jurgen Klopp to referee Paul Tierney at the final whistle: ""I have no problems with any referees. Only YOU!"" ""You have never played football.""#LFC #THFC #TOTLIV pic.twitter.com/QQg1W4nxVa Klopp can also be heard complaining to Tierney that he's 'never played football,' in his post match interview the former Borussia Dortmund manager repeated the complaint. The 54-year-old explained that it was due to the ref claiming that Jota had stopped in the box because he wanted to get the contact from Emerson in order to go down. That was essentially a claim that the Portugal forward was trying to cheat, when in reality he was attempting to get a shot away when the full back barged into him, nowhere near the ball, and caused him to hit the deck. The Liverpool boss can count himself a little lucky that he wasn't shown a red card for the incident, and some would argue his original yellow during the game might have been red. Should Harry Kane have been sent off? Should Liverpool have had a penalty? ðº Watch #TOTLIV live on Sky Sports PL pic.twitter.com/yKLtrBsJzX The whole game was full of controversy and incident, with Liverpool on the worst end of the decisions but also lucky not to concede more goals with Tottenham struggling in front of goal. Kane put the hosts ahead after 13 minutes, scoring just his second Premier League goal of the season so far, and his first one at home. He was lucky not to be sent for an early bath just seven minutes later. Alisson made a great save from Dele Alli on the half hour mark and Jota made it 1-1 just five minutes later. ð£ï¸ ""I really have no idea what's his problem with me.""

Son Heung-min then equalised when Alisson rushed out to get on the end of a through ball but missed it and allowed the South Korean to slot home. Robertson was then sent off for a foul on Emerson, with the referee this time going over to his screen, something he failed to do for the Kane incident. It was a hell of a match for the neutral, but that didn't help Klopp's mood at all. ",negative,liverpool,4

The Belgian midfielder was at his absolute best in a superb game packed with quality, opening the scoring with a strike that deflected in off Joel Matip. Loadingâ¦ De Bruyne showed just why many deem him to be the best midfielder in the world with a complete display and one full of incredible defence-splitting passes. It's quite astonishing that City's No.17 never had an assist. There would have been reason for disappointment from a City perspective given they had taken the lead twice and had a Raheem Sterling strike disallowed for an incredibly tight offside call. But De Bruyne remained upbeat afterwards in his interviews and also his social media content. Last week the former Chelsea man announced he had joined TikTok and would be using the platform to allow fans to get closer to his life on and off the pitch. And his first real upload did just that. De Bruyne posted a heartwarming behind-the-scenes video of his day, showing his wife Michelle and two young sons Mason and Rome. The 36 second clip, titled ""My biggest support"" sees De Bruyne say his goodbyes to his children as he makes his way to the Etihad Stadium. But the kids, wearing their full City kits with their dad's number on the back, travel to the ground and are seen cheering him on from the stands. After the clash ends all square, De Bruyne reunites with his family and shares hugs and kisses. He then drives to McDonalds and gets Mason and Rome a happy meal each - even signing something for one of the staff on the Drive-thru. The closing shot sees the four wave to the camera, capping off a very wholesome and insightful first post for De Bruyne, a humble family man and a genius of a player at the same time. The video has already garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and we look forward to many more uploads from arguably the best player in the Premier League. ",positive,liverpool,1

Although they were bitter rivals as players, Neville and Carragher have become the most entertaining punditry duo in the business and regularly produce the goods on Sky Sports. They go back and forth on screen and on Twitter and it's quite clear that the pair have actually struck up an unlikely friendship since they began working with one another. Loadingâ¦ And it seems as though Gerrard, Carragher's long-time Liverpool teammate who he shared the 2005 Champions League triumph with, is a little jealous.

These days they enjoy a drink after their TV work and are in frequent conversation over the phone. 'We were put together and I wouldn't say we had much a relationship before that,"" Carragher said of their relationship when speaking to Granada Reports.

His performances for Liverpool, helping them become European, world and Premier League champions, have led some to suggest he could even be the best ever in England's top tier since 1992. But in a battle of great defenders on Sky Sports, the Dutchman lost out to Nemanja Vidic after beating some illustrious opposition to get to the final. In the first round, Vincent Kompany celebrated his Manchester City testimonial by knocking out Jaap Stam, Van Dijk beat Tony Adams, Vidic had a close match-up with John Terry but snuck through and Rio Ferdinand beat Sol Campbell. The first semi-final saw a battle of the Vs as Virgil beat Vincent. Despite the former City captain winning the Premier League four times he narrowly lost out on the current number one defender in the league. In the second semi-final it was a case of former partners facing each other as Vidic beat Ferdinand to go through to the final. And in the final it was Vidic who reigned supreme after five league titles and the Champions League with United and forming one of the best defensive partnerships in the league's history with Ferdinand. At just 29-years-old Van Dijk does have plenty of time to add to his collection of medals and by the time his career ends fans may well hold him in higher regard than Vidic. Right now the former Celtic defender will be focusing on his rehabilitation and hoping that he can come back from injury very strong. Liverpool will certainly miss him at the back until he returns.

705,https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-top-10s-the-best-strikers-in-the-world-have-been-named-and-ranked-20210520,"The 10 Best Strikers In The World Right Now, Named And Ranked","Europe's top five leagues are blessed with some of the most dangerous forwards in the world, but who are the top ten best finishers on the planet right now? We've attempted to come up with the answer using stats sprinkled with a little opinion. First of all, we've walked the divide between 'striker' and 'forward' pretty precariously, but we've tried to limit this list to genuine strikers. That means the likes of Marcus Rashford and Lionel Messi don't make this list. We've used stats like goals scored, goals per game and goals per 90 to quantify each player's contribution, but that doesn't mean whomever has the best stats wins. We've also considered the importance of each player to their sides and their overall contribution, including assists. All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. Other Articles In This Series: 2020/21 Season Stats: This season's displays in the Bundesliga have reignited Andre Silva's vision for the back of the net after experiencing a torrid time at AC Milan - scoring just twice inside 25 appearances. However, the Portuguese hitman has been clinical this season, converting 28 goals and five assists in just 32 league games for Eintracht Frankfurt. Not a bad turnaround, eh? Taking his sizzling form into account, the 25-year-old will be, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the hottest strikers in the European market today. Could he be a shrewd signing for an ambitious Premier League side this summer? 2020/21 Season Stats: The 2020/21 season has been an average one by Ciro Immobile's recent standards. He scored 20 goals in the league compared to the Serie A record equalling 36 he scored in 2019/20. Still, those 20 league goals were a third of Lazio's 61 season total goals, showing their dependence on the Italian striker. The Italian forward was in strong form throughout the majority of the season, only suffering an eight-game goal drought from mid-February to mid-April. 2020/21 Season Stats: Cristiano Ronaldo's departure from Real Madrid in 2018 marked the end of an era for Los Blancos. The club's European dominance was coming to a close, players were leaving and it was time for others in the side to step up. And that is exactly what Karim Benzema has done following Ronaldo's exit, developing into Madrid's go-to man upfront. The French forward found the net in the win over Villarreal to bring up his 30th goal of the La Liga campaign. It's his second-best Madridista tally, equalling his 2018/19 numbers and just two shy of 2011/12 when he hit 32 for the season. His superb performances have seen him earn a recall to the French national team for the Euros in June. 2020/21 Season Stats: Kylian Mbappe has justified the hype that surrounded him following his breakthrough season at Monaco four years ago. A ruthless finisher in front of goal, the Frenchman has a coolness to his play that makes it challenging to believe he is only 22. As well as routinely punishing Ligue 1 defences, Mbappe has also terrorised some of Europe's best backlines in the Champions League with right goals in 10 games. His speed, clinical nature and dribbling ability ensures that, on his day, he is unplayable. And, while he sometimes plays on the left, the majority of his appearances this year have come through the middle so we feel the 'striker' label applies here. 2020/21 Season Stats: One of the best, if not the best, to have ever graced a football pitch. Cristiano Ronaldo has performed at the highest level for over a decade, featuring as the central figure for Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. Approaching the end of his glittering career, some predicted a downturn in form for the Portuguese forward at Juventus. But the 36-year-old has simply carried on doing what he does best: scoring for fun. He scored 41 goals in 55 games in the 2020/21 season and at a rate of more than one every 90 minutes. 2020/21 Season Stats: Barcelona agreed to let Luis Suarez leave the club for free last summer without kicking up too much of a fuss. Viewed as a striker in decline, the Uruguayan has emphatically responded to those his questioned his ability by firing Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title. There are more prolific players on this list, but none had the impact Suarez had this year. At 34 years of age, Suarez is showing no signs of being a player who has lost his touch as he continues to mesmerise with his unpredictable nature. 2020/21 Season Stats: Romelu Lukaku has been the driving force behind Inter Milan's quest for a first Serie A title in 11 years. The Belgian bagged 23 league goals in his first season in Italy and has surpassed the 20-goal mark once again as he continues to prove his lethal ability. He also provided 12 assists, a number only bettered on this list by Harry Kane's 18. Lukaku showcased his talent in the Premier League at Chelsea, West Bromwich Albion, Everton and Manchester United and has fully embraced the challenge of operating in a new environment. 2020/21 Season Stats: Erling Haaland is, undisputedly, the most in-demand player in world football at the moment. The Norwegian superstar has been simply sensational in every way and, regardless of the opposition or the competition, he has managed to find the back of the net time after time. With that said, the 20-year-old has become of the most sought-after strikers in the world since signing for Borussia Dortmund, having taken his game to the next level. Haaland has his whole future ahead of him and could well become of the greats if he continues to replicate his current numbers. It's terrifying to think how good Erling Haaland will be when he's 21 years old, let alone 25 or 30. 2020/21 Season Stats: For a while, we wondered what kind of striker Harry Kane was. He once felt like a throwback, an Alan Shearer-type box-dweller who could hit the ball really hard but not much else, but these days he's much more than that. The England captain has gradually developed to become a Swiss Army knife of a forward, with a passing range to make the average deep-lying playmaker weep and off-the-ball movement to tear defences apart. He has 30 goals this season and frankly, Tottenham Hotspur have been propped up by him. He used to be the best player in the league in the penalty area, but he's pretty close to being the player out of it as well, right now, as his 18 assists prove. 2020/21 Season Stats: As players enter the latter stages of their playing days, a gradual reduction in contributions is to be expected. But Robert Lewandowski is an individual who has bucked that trend in a rather significant manner, reaching a level that has propelled him to the top of this list. The Polish striker netted 55 times in all competitions on Bayern Munich's way to achieving the treble last year and has scored an incredible 53 goals in 47 appearances, including internationals, this season. He's averaging 1.4 goals per 90 minutes. Insane. Image credits: PA ",positive,liverpool,0

Brilliant first half lads and Felipe's red card was well deserved Excellent refereeing. Would love to see that more often. Too frequently we see players show disdain to the ref and ignore their authority. 3 times he gave Felipe the chance to talk to him, but he ignored him, so deserves what he got. Brilliant.#LIVATM Fair play to the ref for sending off Felipe. If you commit a foul, you don't ignore what the referee is saying. It's about time referees give serious punishments for disrespect. #LIVATM Canât understand why people are disputing the red given to Felipe 3 times the ref blew his whistle to beckon him over and he completely ignored what would have probably been a yellow cardDidnât ignore the red card though did hePrat Ref is absolutely spot on there. Four times he told Felipe to come to him and 4 times he refused. You can't just ignore the ref. One Twitter user wrote: âFelipe was naive to ignore [the] referee calling him.â While another tweeted: âFelipe is never going to ignore a ref again.â And a third added: âNot sure Felipe deserved a straight red, but his challenge was a yellow and his dissent was a yellow. Deserved to be sent off.â Someone else said: âFelipe deserved that red.â A fifth posted: âThe ref called him three times and Felipe decided he was bigger than the ref, so got sent off for not listening to him.â Joel Matip played Jota through minutes into the second half and the Liverpool forward had the ball in the back of the net, only for VAR to rule he was in an offside position. Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez thought he had pulled one back for Atletico in the second half, but he was ruled offside as Diego Simeoneâs men fell to a 2-0 defeat. Liverpool have booked their place in the Champions League round-of-16 stage, with Jurgen Kloppâs men sitting comfortably at the top of Group B.

The Germany international has been praised by Virgil van Dijk for his role in the Blues' recent success, but according to The Athletic, negotiations over a new deal have stalled. Rudiger's preference is to remain in west London, but the 28-year-old and his representatives were reportedly underwhelmed by the club's initial offer. If an agreement is not reached by January, he will be able to sign a pre-contract with another club, enabling him to leave on a free transfer the following summer - Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are among those interested. Rudiger understands the significance of his next move, but hopes to secure an agreement with Chelsea, after a quote resurfaced from a recent interview with Sky Germany. ""For me, this will now be the most important decision of my professional career. I haven't spoken to any other club than Chelsea."" The German's importance to Chelsea has been demonstrated after appearing in all seven of their Premier League games to date and scoring in the 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 19th September. He, along with Thiago Silva have been crucial in the Blues' improved defensive solidity since Tuchel's appointment as head coach, with the duo playing a prominent role in the club's second Champions League triumph last season. Van Dijk led the plaudits for his rival and ranks him alongside defensive partner, Silva among the best centre-backs in the game. ""There's so many good defenders out there. The old guys Sergio Ramos, Thiago Silva, Gerard Pique. The game has evolved and defending is different,"" he told Sky Sports. ""If you look at Laporte and Rudiger. I think he had a fantastic season last year and the way he came back from a knee injury, I have even more respect for him now."" Words by James Hilsum. ",positive,liverpool,0

PSG are currently 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and are also in a strong position in the Champions League, having beaten Real Madrid 1-0 in the first leg of their last 16 tie. However, the position of the clubâs current sporting director Leonardo is said to be under threat, according to French outlet Foot Mercato. Loadingâ¦ The report claims there are 'serious doubts' over his future at the Parc des Princes following Saturdayâs 3-1 defeat to Nantes. Leonardo was ridiculed on social media after criticising referee Mikael Lesageâs performance, claiming âeverything went against usâ. He is said to have a 'strained relationship' with PSG's owners, who are also frustrated with the club's transfer activity and the lack of progress in convincing Kylian Mbappe to remain at the club. According to the report, PSG's owners are now considering sacking Leonardo and have identified a potential replacement in Wenger, who is currently serving as FIFA's chief of global football development. Their 'dream' scenario would also see former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane replace Mauricio Pochettino as head coach. Pochettinoâs position at the Parc des Princes has been the subject of intense speculation this season, with the former Tottenham boss one of the favourites to become the next permanent Manchester United manager. In terms of the sporting director role, PSG are also said to be considering Tottenhamâs Fabio Paratici. Wenger has previously revealed that PSG had attempted the lure him away from Arsenal shortly after Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011. âIt was in the pipeline often since the start of the adventure when QSI took over at PSG,â Wenger told Canal+. âAt the time, Paris Saint-Germain was for sale, and not very expensive, â¬40m or â¬50m, it was a good deal, but the problem after that was lots of money needed to be invested. âIâve always thought it was odd that a city like Paris didnât have a great team. Itâs great that this has been changedâ¦ Why didnât it happen? Because I had a contract. âI was raised to keep my word and respect the contracts I sign. You canât ask your players for loyalty if you donât have any yourself.â Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

Paris Saint-Germain boss Pochettino has been repeatedly linked with the United job in recent seasons and was in the running to take over at Old Trafford following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November. United instead opted to appoint Ralf Rangnick on an interim basis until the end of the campaign, with Pochettino remaining in his role at the Parc des Princes. Loadingâ¦ The former Tottenham manager is one of the favourites to succeed Rangnick in the summer, along with Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag. According to the Daily Mail, Unitedâs players would prefer Pochettino to take over first-team duties. However, Rangnick is said to be an admirer of Ten Hag. Rangnick is set to move into a consultancy role at United in May and is expected to have some influence over who the club appoints as their next permanent manager. Pochettinoâs future at PSG is currently uncertain even though the club are on course to comfortably regain the Ligue 1 title. They are currently 13 points clear of closest rivals Marseille at the top of the table but Pochettino is also under pressure to deliver the Champions League trophy, which has so far eluded the French club. PSG take on Real Madrid in the last 16 of the competition, with the first leg to be played in Paris on Tuesday. Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag has also guided Ajax through to the last 16, where they will take on Benfica, while the Amsterdam club is also five points clear at the top of the Dutch Eredivisie. Speaking earlier this season, Ten Hag said he feels âreadyâ to take on a new challenge outside the Netherlands. He told Dutch outlet de Volkskrant: ""I think I'm ready for it [coaching abroad]. I would be happy to take up that challenge. ""But I'm not chasing it. If it turns out that that step will never come, I will not say that my coaching career has failed.

Loadingâ¦ United had a very strong summer of incomings in the window, adding Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo to the squad. Ronaldo's arrival in particular has been a boost to fans morale and to the team, with the five time Ballon d'Or winner already scoring three goals in just two games. However, it has been pointed out that the Premier League side still lack a defensive midfielder but if Solskjaer wants to buy one he may need to sell first. According to the Sun, the Red Devils are considering selling up to seven fringe players in January, with Lingard, Martial and Van de Beek all on the list. Lingard spent six months on loan at West Ham United, who Solskjaer's team face on Sunday, at the end of last season and many expected the move to become permanent for this campaign. Reports have claimed that the club turned down offers from six clubs for the attacking midfielder and there has been talk of a new deal for him. So far this term though he hasn't played much football and, despite scoring in the win over Newcastle United last week, his wayward pass set up Young Boys for their winning goal in United's shock Champions League loss in midweek. Martial scored 17 league goals in the 2019/20 campaign but he struggled last season and the additions of Sancho and Ronaldo, plus the emergence of Mason Greenwood has reduced his importance. The Frenchman has played in all four of the team's league games so far but only one of those was a start, and it came in the 1-1 draw with Southampton. Van de Beek has struggled to get game time throughout his United career so far, having been signed from Ajax in August 2020, and his future at the club has been questioned. As well as that trio, a defensive foursomes' futures are also in doubt, with Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Diogo Dalot and Alex Tellos all apparently potentially on the for sale list. Bailly is now fourth choice at the club, behind Varane, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, and, despite signing a new deal just a few months ago, could easily be sold. Jones hasn't played a game in 18 months but has found time to put down all the trolls who criticise him, in a brilliant way. Finally Dalot and Telles are both clearly second choice full backs, behind Aaron Wan Bissaka and Luke Shaw, respectively, but if they were sold Solskjaer would have little to no cover. How likely it is United actually sell any of the players remains to be seen, especially after a summer where they seemed to struggle to do exactly that. ",positive,liverpool,0

The 34-year-old Uruguayan striker will see his current United deal expire in June 2022, with Argentine side Boca Juniors wanting to sign him. Speaking to TNT Sports, Boca Juniors vice president Juan Roman Riquelme said: âIn January, Cavani called me saying that he wanted to come because he was playing little there. âIâve been speaking with him for a long time and he called me in January to come because he wasnât playing there. I remember we talked one day and the next day he came in and scored two goals in the last minutes. Read More: âHe made a comeback.

Read More: Anthony Martial, who rejected a move to Lyon in the summer on deadline day, is one of the targets for Newcastle in January. Joining Martial on Newcastleâs radar is Jesse Lingard, whose current United deal will expire in 2022. Both Lingard and Martial are battling for minutes at Old Trafford this season and could leave United in a bid to secure more regular first-team football. Donny van de Beek, who has been heavily linked with Everton, has endured a disappointing spell at United and could be offered a way out by Newcastle. Newcastle are expected to reinforce their defensive options and Eric Bailly, who has fallen down the pecking order after Raphael Varaneâs arrival, is the final member of the United quartet on the clubâs wishlist. Aaron Ramsey, James Tarkowski and Wilfried Zaha have all been subjected to intense speculation linking them with the Magpies since the PIF-led consortium purchased the club.

Staveley told The Daily Mirror: âWe are in the market to compete for world-class players, we have done it before. âBut we need the infrastructure around the world-class players. We will get there, and we already have world-class players, we want to make sure they have the support around them. âYou do need a big balance sheet in football, but we are not here to be irrational, it is a state investment fund and there to look after the people. âWe have to do a full review, where the operations are, what we are looking at in January, but it is going to take a little time.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Instead the national team are due to meet up for a training camp and play an intra squad friendly against the under 21s, though they'll be without their captain. Following Dzyuba's initial statement, saying he 'didn't understand' why the war should impact on athletes, Manchester City star Zinchenko hit back the 33-year-old striker. ""Why do Ukrainian footballers call for football sanctions against the aggressor's country? Do we really want to deprive you of the opportunity to do your favorite thing? No!

Loadingâ¦ Gandhi is most famous for his role in leading a successful campaign for India's independence away from British rule in 1947, but he did have a history with football too. The former lawyer had a hand in setting up three football teams in South Africa in the early 1900s, all of which were called Passive Resisters Soccer Club. And his story with the sport didn't end in Africa, with the Indian said to have been a 'big supporter' of West Ham United in England. Benjamin Robertsâ book âBottles â English Footballâs Boozy Story,' revealed that Gandhi even visited the pubs in the surrounding area before matches. ""It turns out that Gandhi was a keen football fan and having established three football teams in South Africa,"" the extract via the Daily Star said. ""There are reliable reports that during his stay he attended several West Ham United games and even visited the Boleyn pub where he socialised with the West Ham fans while drinking cream soda."" Gandhi moved to London to study law at the University College, London, late in the 19th century and became friends with the club's founder Arnold Hills. The club were formed in 1895 and the law student is said to have gone to many matches and socialised at the Boleyn Tavern outside of the ground. In their first three seasons in a league, the Hammers came second and first in the London League and then won the Southern League division two, meaning Gandhi was possibly a bit of a glory hunter... No doubt the Indian would not have enjoyed Moussa Dembele's antics on Thursday night, had he still been alive, with the Lyon striker accused of diving, before giving a cheeky wink, getting Aaron Cresswell sent off in the incident. West Ham thought they had another celebrity fan in The Queen, but recently found out that her majesty is actually an Arsenal fan instead. Despite that, Liz's favorite player was actually Michael Owen, according to former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson any way. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Liverpool and Manchester City made it through to the semi finals of the Champions League on Wednesday, as the two clubs continued their battle to fight it out for all of the major trophies in the next few weeks. They were then joined by Leicester City on Thursday evening, as Brendan Rodgers' side came from behind to beat PSV in the Europa Conference League. And later that night it was the turn of West Ham, as they defeated Lyon in France, to make it into the final four of the Europa League. The Hammers would have been eyeing a trip to the Nou Camp, if they were able to get past Lyon, but that disappeared as Frankfurt embarrassed Barcelona in Spain. Last week David Moyes' team had been left feeling aggrieved after their Ligue 1 opponents had left the London Stadium with a 1-1 draw. Whilst it wasn't a particularly bad result, the sending off of Aaron Cresswell, and Moussa Dembele's wink in particular, had annoyed them, and they'd even been stopped by their own fan running on the pitch during an attack. On Thursday they were lucky early on as Karl Toko Ekambi hit the post in the fifth minute, when shooting from inside the area, and the ball was cleared. They soaked up some early pressure but the visitors then took the lead on the night, and in the tie, when Craig Dawson headed home from a corner with just seven minutes of the first half left.

The players came out after the break as if they were very comfortable with their position, and Jarrod Bowen made it 3-0 just three minutes after the restart. Fornals found the forward with a lovely through ball and the man tipped to be part of Gareth Southgate's next England squad ran through with the ball and slotted home from the edge of the area.

Before kick off they'd have been expecting to face Barca, if they managed to go through, with Xavi's side playing hosts to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. The visitors had won 1-0 in Germany but the Spanish giants were still favourites to make it into the semis, having been knocked out of the Champions League at the group stages. However, Frankfurt, who made it through to the semis of the competition in 2019, went into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Filip Kostic and Rafael Santos Borre. They looked certain to shock their hosts until Barcelona hit back with two goals in injury time, from Sergio Busquets and Memphis Depay, but there was no time left and Frankfurt went through, where they will meet West Ham for a place in the final in Seville.

West Ham were reduced to 10 men before half-time when Aaron Creswell was sent off but the home side escaped with a deserved point - Jarrod Bowen putting them ahead before Tottenham loanee Tanguy Ndombele equalised for the visitors.

West Ham United continued their impressive run in the Europa League on Thursday night, taking on Lyon in the quarter finals at the London Stadium. Controversy reigned at the end of the first half as Aaron Cresswell was sent off for a challenge on former Celtic striker Dembele, as the full back grabbed the forward's striker just outside the box. The referee adjudged that the 25-year-old would have had a clear chance on goal had the full back not impeded him, and subsequently sent him off, whilst others weren't even sure it was a foul. Dembele played his role in the situation perfectly and further wound up fans by delivering a wink to camera, with fans jumping to the conclusion it was proof of a dive. Aaron Cresswell is shown a red card deep into first-half added time!He was judged to have pulled down Moussa Dembele...The wink from the Lyon striker says it all ð pic.twitter.com/0PefUWytIr That wink from Moussa Dembele though... ð#UEL pic.twitter.com/tuUl1rV152 Dembele winks at the camera after a referee previously found guilty of accepting bribes sends Cresswell offAbsolute joke how heâs even allowed to be in charge of a game of this magnitude (Btw itâs not just the red card every decision has been shocking) #COYI #WHUFC #UEL pic.twitter.com/y6QPp6bxoY Itâs the wink mate ð¤¬. Cresswell was stupid to force a decision but itâs a soft foul and never a red. Dembele knows it too. pic.twitter.com/SMvaWk7utn Dembele I'd love to knock that wink off your smug face you prick How a referee can stand and justify the Cresswell incident as red-card worthy is laughable. The fact Dembele winks at the camera after shows what a joke this is. UEFA seems to get more corrupt by the week. Disgraceful. Lyon have been a total disgrace tonight. That Dembele wink summed it all up.Rolling around, cheating, stopping the flow of the game.Feel sorry for West Ham and Cresswell. Never a red card. 1-1 a great result for 10-man West Ham. Very harsh red card for Cresswell. Ball going away from goal so hardly â denial of clear scoring opportunityâ. Dembeleâs wink rather incriminating. The wink was reminiscents of the one that Ronaldo had delivered to his own bench, after he 'helped' get Wayne Rooney sent off in the World Cup, 16 years ago. At the time the pair were Manchester United teammates, when Rooney stamped on Ricardo Carvalho whilst the defender was all over him. Ronaldo remonstrated with the referee telling him to produce a red card and when Rooney was given his marching orders he produced the infamous wink, maybe the lingering anger is why they're currently in a spat... On Thursday night, Hammers' fans argued everything from it being a 'dive,' to pointing out the fact that Dembele was going away from goal and using Kurt Zouma's presence as evidence it wasn't an obvious goal scoring opportunity, to argue against the red. However, if the referee deemed it to be a foul, and with the Frenchman running at speed any contact was able to take him down, then he had little choice but to send him off. VAR also was never going to overturn it, as it was in no way a 'clear and obvious error' from the man in the middle, no matter what the home fans said. David Moyes' side actually took the lead at the start of the second half, when Jarrod Bowen pounced on a ball on the box and a deflection from Jerome Boateng helped the ball into the goal. Tanguay Ndombele back on loan at Lyon from West Ham's rivals Tottenham Hotspur typically came up with the equaliser but overall the English side might be happy to take a draw back to France next week.

After a stellar campaign with the Hammers last season, as well as reaching the Euro 2020 final with England, the 22-year-old midfield maestro looks sure to attract lots of attention this transfer window. And that attention looks to have been heightened after Rice allegedly rejected the chance to sign a new contract at West Ham - with both Manchester United and Chelsea believed to be interested in securing his signature. There have been some suggestions that Hammers manager David Moyes has valued the midfielder in excess of Â£100m, but according to Eurosport, the capital outfit would consider offers in the region of Â£80m. Rice has shone for the Hammers since his debut back in 2016 and has established himself as a staple for Gareth Southgate in the England team, hence the interest from some of England's biggest clubs. Intriguingly, Rice spent time with Chelsea's academy earlier in his career with his best friend Mason Mount before he was released as a teenager. And it seems Mount is keen on his childhood pal making the switch to Blues, too, as he FaceTimed Rice following their historic Champions League in Porto in May to show off his winner's medal, according to The Athletic. Rice, who is contracted to the Hammers until June 2024, has made 145 appearances for the east London outfit in all competitions, scoring five goals, as well as assisting five in the process. Since then, as reported by the Telegraph, Rice has turned down two lucrative West Ham contracts and is expected to wait for either Manchester United or Chelsea to formalise their long-standing interest in him.

Loadingâ¦ Rangers vs Red Star Belgrade Braga vs AS Monaco Porto vs Lyon Atalanta vs Bayer Leverkusen Sevilla vs West Ham Barcelona vs Galatasaray RB Leipzig vs Spartak Moscow Real Betis vs Eintracht Frankfurt Sevilla have won the competition six times, all of which have come in the past 16 years, winning their first in 2006 and most recent in 2020. The Spanish side, who are Real Madrid's closest challengers for this season's La Liga title, will be hoping this season more than any they reach the final. That's because their Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium will play host to the final on May 18th. The last 16 ties will take place on March 10th and 17th, though Porto and Real Betis will play their first legs on the 9th, due to clashes with the Braga and Sevilla games. The competition took a slightly different format this year, with the eight teams who won the groups going straight through to the last 16. Those who finished as runners up in the group stage were drawn with the eight teams who finished third in their Champions League groups. That led to Barca being drawn with Napoli, in a match that was more reminiscent of a Champions League fixture, whilst Rangers had the difficulty of facing Borussia Dortmund. Xavi's side, having drawn 1-1 in the first leg at the Nou Camp, in a game they should have won, might have been in more trouble if the away goals rule was still in use. However, with the rule no longer existing, the Spanish giants certainly didn't feel under any pressure on Thursday night and defeated their Italian hosts 4-2, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goal including a 23 pass move, pure tiki-taka genius. Rangers certainly weren't favourites to make the last 16 as soon as they drew Borussia Dortmund, with the Bundesliga giants expected to have too much for the Scottish champions. Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side caused the shock of the round when they won 4-2 in the first leg in Germany but knew it would be tough at home, especially with no away goals rule. Dortmund led 2-1 at half time on Thursday, reducing the deficit to just one goal, but James Tavernier's second goal of the night made it 2-2, and was enough for the Scots to go through.

Tim Sherwood has made the bold claim that Ronaldo will be ready to take the Old Trafford hotseat sooner rather than later. He believes the 36-year-old will walk into management when he retires, with an incident during Sunday's 2-1 win over West Ham proving it. ""I think it's OK that Ronaldo's on the touchline and Ole's going to have to accept it. If he brings him to his football club you've got to know what you're bringing in,"" Sherwood told Ladbrokes per CaughtOffside. ""It's a completely different Ronaldo to the one who was at Old Trafford the first time around. ""He knows how he's needed and if he feels like he needs to stand next to the manager and give instructions then you've got to let him do that. ""I'm not sure he'd be doing that with Jose Mourinho mind you, it would be very different with him still in charge, but you'd also have to ask Ronaldo why he feels it's necessary to stand up and give some instruction in the first place. ""We've seen him do it on the international stage, most recently at the Euros, barking out orders. That boy will be a manager 100%. Five years ago today, Cristiano Ronaldo went full-on coach mode to help Portugal win EURO 2016 :trophy:(:movie_camera:: @EURO2020)pic.twitter.com/xbcANoqJAX ""I would have a bet on him being Manchester United manager in 18 months. Whenever Ronaldo finishes playing I think he will become a manager, it will be an automatic choice."" Former Tottenham manager Sherwood then said current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would likely be safe if he won a top trophy this campaign. If they didn't however, Ronaldo is right there waiting in the wings. ""If they win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, any of those trophies, then Solskjaer keeps his job, but if they don't win anything I think they've got a manager there in the making. ""He could bring an experienced coach in there with him - someone like Carlos Queiroz - as he'll know plenty of them, and I can see him being a manager at Man United in the future."" Ronaldo could be seen having a word with central defenders Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire prior to kick-off. He scored the equaliser after Said Benrahma's deflected effort had put West Ham ahead. A winner wouldn't come until the 89th minute when Jesse Lingard smashed home for his second goal in three games. Do you think Cristiano Ronaldo will ever manage Manchester United?

Loadingâ¦ Just when everyone thought Lionel Messi's move to PSG was the most unbelievable thing to happen in the summer transfer window, Ronaldo's move back to United, 12 years after leaving, suddenly cropped up. The news of the five time Ballon d'Or winner's return to the Premier League has been big news for the past couple of weeks, all leading up to his expected debut against Newcastle United this coming Saturday. Whilst the 36-year-old's move has been pretty popular amongst fans of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team, outselling all other Premier League players on shirt sales within 12 hours, it's not been universally popular. Compare.bet did a study into the most popular signings of the summer, based on the reaction on social media, and Ronaldo's post was only the 22nd most positive, despite its huge numbers generally. Shockingly, Chelsea's signing for former Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli came top, with a whopping 99.6% positive reactions. News articles about Ronaldo's announcement had far more engagements than any other player, with the former Real Madrid star earning a whopping 592,000 reacts to his move. That puts Sergio Aguero's move to Barcelona way back on 509,900 and Jadon Sancho's 430,900 third place in the very dark shade. Jack Grealish's move to Manchester City is fourth and Ronaldo's former Real teammate, and new United colleague, Raphael Varane rounds off the top five. The leading international scorer might have the most reacts, but his record for positive reacts is well behind Bettinelli, with just 77.4% positive reactions, leaving him 22nd overall. Of course, the numbers mean the new Blues keeper got 96,512 positive reactions, whilst Ronaldo still got 458,208, he just got many more negative reactions. At least the former Juventus star can take solace in the fact he's officially the Greatest Player of All Time, according to a mathematician. Negative reactions were in abundance for Odsonne Edouard and Daniel James as well, with the two least popular transfers, according to the report. Edouard's move from Celtic to Crystal Palace earned him just 40.8% of positive reactions and James move to Leeds United, two years after he nearly moved there, was also more negative, with just 48% positive reactions.

Enter Will Hughes. Manchester United are probably the best example of being linked with a player so much that you start to believe they must have signed, Nicolas Gaitan and Ezequiel Garay were announced as United players several times by Portuguese press over the the years. Wesley Sneijder was also destined for Old Trafford on a few occasions. Arsenal have been signing one of Gonzalo Higuain or Karim Benzema for the past five years and Robert Lewandowski is always moving to Real Madrid. Manchester United's Wesley Sneijder. Image: PA Slightly lower down on the glamour signings is Derby County's Will Hughes who, at just 22, seems to have been linked with a move to Anfield for the past five years. Instead the central midfielder hasn't moved out of the Championship. According to the Telegraph his six year spell as a first team regular for County is set to come to an end in the next few weeks with Watford close to an agreement for the player. The paper report that Hughes, who is currently playing for England at the European U21 Championships, will make the move to Marco Silva's side for around Â£8 million, rising to Â£10 million. Hughes at 16.

""Yeah,"" he says, he does think he could do a job in Liverpool's front line. He pauses again before offering an explanation. ""It's easy to say now because I play for Palace and they play for Liverpool, but when you train every day with the same players and the manager believes in you, it's easier."" The Belgian can only wonder what life at Anfield would have been like had Jurgen Klopp made him the focal point of Liverpool's fast and the furious front three. Instead, the German put his faith in Roberto Firmino and sold Benteke to Crystal Palace during the summer of 2016. ""People will say I'm making excuses, but everyone knows the club was going through a transition when I was there,"" he tells SPORTbible. ""If you compare the team from when I was there to the current team, I think there are only three, four players still in the first 11, most of them are new."" There are actually seven survivors from the 2015/16 squad, but it's fair to say the playing personnel has had undergone some major reconstruction. One of them, Firmino, who joined in 2015 alongside Benteke, has flourished under the conductor of heavy metal football. Nine games, three goals and four assists into this season and the Brazilian is being hailed as 'world-class' by fans and pundits alike. Benteke, meanwhile, has toiled under four different managers in three years at Selhurst Park, managing just four goals since the end of the 2016/17 campaign. He last found the net 160 days ago, on April 21st during a 3-2 win at The Emirates. This poor run of form has attracted criticism, ridicule and doubt. ""Let me tell you, it's been the hardest time in my career so far,"" he says. ""But I haven't lost my confidence. It's more frustration because the thing that I was doing before - scoring goals - I can still do it."" During our revealing chat at Palace's training ground, the 28-year-old explains the factors behind his barren run and why he believes he needs greater pressure and responsibility to rediscover his goal-scoring touch. For a striker that has scored four goals in his last 57 appearances for Palace, Benteke does not hold himself like a man short on self-belief. At 6ft 3in, he's an imperious figure, full of sinew and power. He's smiley, polite and articulate in his second language. But even he has a limit to the level of abuse he's willing to take. The trolls have been so callous during this difficult period, the Belgium international turned off the comments on his Instagram channel. He can't escape the vitriol on Twitter. The platform doesn't allow users to hide replies and the venom has been teeming through the keyboards of angry fans. ""You owe palace big time for sticking by you through some quite frankly, disgraceful performances"" tweeted one Palace supporter. ""People check the live scores, see that you haven't scored and say, 'oh he's shit', without knowing how you played,"" he says, imitating the action on his phone. ""Sometimes I feel like they (critics) are too hard with me, but in another way, it's because they know I can do better. ""If I was just a normal player they wouldn't even bother to criticize me."" Has he consulted a sports psychologist to help him cope with the criticism? ""No,"" he says shaking his head with a smile that suggests his mindset is not the problem. ""When I go on the pitch, I believe in myself, I know that I'm good,"" he adds, sounding like the Benteke who scored 49 goals in 101 games for Aston Villa. At the end of his debut season (2012-13) in the Midlands he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year, eventually finishing as runner-up to double award winner Gareth Bale. This was enough to convince then Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers to visit Belgium and meet Benteke's family as part of a charm offensive to secure his services in 2015. It worked and he signed for Â£32.5 million, which at the time, made him their second most expensive transfer ever. Unfortunately, Rodgers, who intended to make Benteke the centre-piece of his attack, lost his job in October 2015 after Liverpool won only four of their opening 11 games in all competitions. ""I started well, but he (Rodgers) was already under pressure from the previous season because they almost won the league and then Klopp came and everything changed,"" he says. Benteke could have been forgiven for thinking the arrival of the kooky cap-wearer would mark an upturn in fortunes - Klopp had tried to bring the striker and Kevin De Bruyne to Borussia Dortmund from Genk. ""When he came to Liverpool he said: 'Sorry, I want to play different football I want to have a quick, small, sharp player',"" explains Benteke. ""I tried to fight for my spot, but at the end of the season he said: 'It's best if you find a new situation too, I won't hold you up.'"" After Benteke finished the season with 10 goals in 42 games, Alan Pardew and Crystal Palace offered him the chance to take centre stage at Selhurst Park. He joined the south Londoners in a deal with Â£28 million and he repaid them with 17 goals in his first season. ""I scored a lot of goals because Pardew wanted me,"" he says, making a pointed reference to the effect of a manager's belief. ""Then it was Sam Allardyce and we know that when you have Zaha, he is the main player, but he knew 'Christian is up there, let's make sure we use him right'. Now we have Roy and he's a different manager with different ideas. You have to adapt and that's what I'm trying to do."" The adaptation hasn't quite clicked. He's made 53 appearances under Hodgson, scoring just four goals. While Benteke has to take responsibility for his lack of conviction in front of goal, he says he needs the right service and statistically, Crystal Palace aren't crossing the ball as much. ""Yeah, I know that,"" he says with a chuckle. According to stats from the Premier League, only Cardiff (562) and Watford (570) attempted fewer crosses than Palace (577) last season. The season he finished as the club's top scorer (2016/17) they crossed the ball 872 times - only Southampton recorded more (947). Rather than disrupt the team, the club's record-signing says he is following the manager's instructions, even if it hampers his own game. ""We're more compact under Hodgson,"" he explains. ""We defend really deep, really hard, but I don't blame him because he's the boss. If the manager wants me to do something that is not in my game, then I'm going to play like it's not me and I will not score, but he's probably happy because I defend, I work hard. ""Then people will say, 'Oh, he's not confident', and obviously you have to take part of the responsibility, but it's not about really about your qualities. I'm fighting against myself to find the right way. It's a team sport, but I need to think about myself too."" Injuries, the tactical preferences of different managers and his own dip in form has left Benteke bristling with frustration. He's a striker who feels like he's lost control of his mission to be the goalscorer he ought to be. In his eagerness to regain control he finds himself in a state of desperation. Game time is also an issue. He's only started three of Palace's seven games this season. Has he spoken to the manager? ""No, I didn't speak with him yet,"" he admits. ""But I spoke with him last season about the crosses and he agreed with me because it's a fact. It's not like I'm lying. I've got to change something, I've got to take a risk at some point."" Having missed out on the 2014 and 2018 World Cups he has one eye on making Belgium's Euro 2020 squad. Does taking a risk mean leaving Crystal Palace in the January transfer window? ""No,"" he says emphatically. ""It's too soon to talk about this. I don't feel that I finished my job. I can do well here. We've only played six games, there's another 32 to play. A lot of things can happen, that's the beauty of this game."" ",positive,liverpool,6

Loadingâ¦ Espirito Santo left Wolverhampton Wanderers at the end of last season and was close to joining both Crystal Palace and Everton, before eventually going to Spurs. The north London club were themselves linked with several different candidates, including a return for Mauricio Pochettino and the capture of Antonio Conte, before finally appointing the Portuguese manager. Spurs fans are waiting to find out what's going to happen with Harry Kane this summer, with the star striker wanting to leave the club, but instead it's six other first team players who are up for sale. According to the Athletic, Serge Aurier, Davinson Sanchez, Moussa Sissoko Lucas Moura, Erik Lamela and Toby Alderweireld are all up for sale this summer. In the case of Aurier and Sanchez, it's down to the pair not really adapting to life in the Premier League, since moving from PSG and Ajax respectively. It's also down to the fact that Spurs are hoping to add a right back and a centre back to strengthen the first team this summer. Bologna defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is expected to join for Â£15 million, with the 22-year-old able to play in a back five, as Espirito Santo played at Wolves. At centre back the club have been hoping to sign Sevilla's Jules Kounde, with the Spanish club willing to sell at less than his release clause, but there's been little movement. If Kounde can't be signed then Inter Milan's Milan Skriniar and Southampton's Jan Vestergaard are considered as potential alternatives. Alderweireld has told the club he wants to leave. As well as those mentioned previously, both Harry Winks and Hugo Lloris are set to have their futures decided in the coming weeks. Lloris, fresh from playing for France at Euro 2020, only has one year left on his contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and might be sold if he doesn't sign a new deal. Incomings will certainly change if Kane leaves. City were reportedly ready to offer Â£100 million plus the option of a player exchange but Spurs' price is believed to be Â£150 million.

747,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-cristian-romero-tottenham-transfer-latest-20210720,Tottenham In 'Advanced Talks' With Serie A Defender Of The Year,"Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly in 'advanced talks' to sign Serie A Defender of the Year Cristian Romero from Atalanta this transfer window. Slowly but steadily establishing himself as a dominant defender in world football, Romero recently starred for Argentina at the Copa America where he featured three times - including the 1-0 final victory against Brazil. Following that triumph, the 23-year-old - who was voted the best defender in the Italian top flight last season - is said to be open to a move to England, with Spurs now believed to be in talks with the centre-back. Romero, who has also been linked with Manchester United, is midway through a two-year loan from Juventus where he recorded the most interceptions in both the Serie A and Champions League last season. Pretty impressive, right? And according to football.london, Atalanta will activate a Â£13m option to sign Romero permanently from the Serie A giants as part of the loan deal, before selling him on for a profit. Italian publication Calciomercato reported earlier this month that Atalanta could then go on to sell Romero for a Â£39m fee, with any deal to potentially rise to Â£52m with add-ons. How's that for shrewd business? Tottenham's defence needs boosting as Toby Aldeweireld recently revealed his desire to quit the club and the signing of Romero will, almost certainly, give the north London outfit a big boost in that position. Tottenham are also interested in signing Romero's counterpart in Pierluigi Gollini - Atalanta's first-choice goalkeeper - on a season loan. The 26-year-old Italy international has been the main man between the sticks for Atalanta for the past three seasons, a period which has seen them emerge as Champions League regulars. Intriguingly, he has Premier League experience, too, having previously been on the books of both Manchester United and Aston Villa. With the new season on the horizon, the acquisition of both Romero and Gollini will be confirmed chemistry at the back for Spurs, with the pairing both paramount to Atalanta's defensive dominance last season.

The Blades midfielder then left his right foot on the face of the Argentine who was left writhing around in agony. Replays showed that Fleck caught Lo Celso on the head with his boot. Depending on which team you support, that was either completely accidental or very naughty. VAR reviewed it, but decided it was unintentional and - amazingly - there were no repercussions for Fleck. To add fuel to the fire, VAR later ruled out a Son Heung-min effort for offside. Spurs won the game 4-0 against the already relegated Blades. Gareth Bale hit a hat-trick and Son added a late fourth.    Meanwhile, Tottenham's rivals Arsenal have been more negatively affected by VAR than any other team in the Premier League this season. ESPN FC's Dale Johnson has done a full review of the top flight's VAR stats this season and revealed that only two goals have been overturned in the Gunners' favour up to now, the lowest of anyone. Arsenal are also second in the table when it comes to decisions being overturned in the opposition's favour. Nine times the Gunners have seen their opponents have a decision in their favour overturned, second only to Liverpool. ",positive,liverpool,1

Loadingâ¦ It was agreed by Premier League teams that players wouldn't be travelling to 'red list' countries during the international break, as it would have meant them being unavailable for their clubs for 10 days, and potentially missing three games. The decision meant that Brazil were without nine players based in England, including Alisson, Ederson, Gabriel Jesus and Fred, so some absences would have been felt more than others. However some players went against their teams' wishes and did travel for the World Cup qualifiers, including a trio from Spurs, with Giovani Lo Celso and Cristian Romero linking up with Argentina, and Davinson Sanchez going on Colombia duty. According to the Sun, the three men will all be fined by their club when they return, which could be sooner for the two Argentina players. When they arrive in London, the three players won't be allowed out for 10 days, which will mean not being able to train and missing out on fitness. That could potentially mean not being available for two league games and a UEFA Conference League match, with the former not ideal considering the team face Chelsea on September 19th. However, the Argentina pair could be available in time for the clash with their London rivals, in what could be a top of the table clash, after the farce in Brazil on Sunday. Lo Celso and Romero were two of the four English based players who were at the heart of the issue that saw the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina suspended after seven minutes of play. The players should have had to quarantine for 14 days but failed to do so, though Lionel Messi made a good point that the squad had been in the country for three days before the game. Just after kick-off, Brazilian health authorities have entered the pitch and brought a stop to the game between Brazil and Argentina ð¨Reports before the game suggested local authorities had ordered Argentina's UK based players to be deported due to a failure to quarantine ð® pic.twitter.com/aSuXZyzVPA The two Aston Villa players involved, Emi Buendia and Emiliano Buendia, both had permission to be with the international team for the first two games, Sunday's being the second, before returning. If the Tottenham pair return to Europe today, there was talk of them heading to Croatia to quarantine, where they'd be able to train before heading back to England with no quarantine here, then they could play against Chelsea in theory. When Sanchez will return is less well known. Colombia drew 1-1 with Paraguay on Sunday but don't face Chile until Thursday night, he wouldn't get back to Europe until at least Friday sometime. You can understand why Nuno Espirito Santo won't be too happy with his players. ",negative,liverpool,0

Spurs' summer has been far from ideal with Harry Kane's future up in the air, in addition to their frantic search for a new manager. Nuno Espirito Santo was eventually appointed and their first game of the season is against the reigning Premier League champions. Prior to kick-off, Spurs' official Twitter account posted an image of their players walking out with the caption of: ""Whatever happens, we'll give it absolutely everything. We're ready for battle."" While the intentions were pure, it hasn't gone down well with supporters. Spurs reached the Champions League final in 2019 under Mauricio Pochettinho and regularly finished inside the top four. However, last season saw them finish seventh and it means they'll be in the inaugural Europa Conference League. That mixed in with a perceived lack of investment from chairman Daniel Levy has many thinking they've gone backwards.      Despite the nerves, Spurs have matched City in the first half and stopped Pep Guardiola's men finding a rhythm. Summer recruits Cristian Romero and Bryan Gil are on the bench and youngster Oliver Skipp has started in midfield. When it comes to City, Â£100 million man Jack Grealish has made the eleven and Ferran Torres is up front. Who do you think will go on to win this game? Manchester City or Tottenham Hotspur?

Jurgen Kloppâs Reds picked up three wins and a draw from their opening Premier League fixtures and also made a winning start in the Champions League during midweek, overcoming old foes AC Milan 3-2. Palace, meanwhile, also come into the contest full of confidence after they registered their first win under Patrick Vieira last time out, beating Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 at Selhurst Park. This weekendâs game, though, will see Palace travel to Merseyside having lost three and drawn one of their last four Premier League away matches - conceding ten goals over that span - with that run including a 2-0 defeat in this fixture on the final day of the 2020/21 season. Shifting our focus back to @premierleague business ð¼ pic.twitter.com/I7KLmFOI5e Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Liverpool vs Crystal Palace to get your teeth stuck into. Liverpool are 1/5 to win, with Crystal Palace priced at 14/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 11/2. Prediction: 3-2 (22/1) Win to Nil: Liverpool (10/11) Liverpool have won the last eight meetings and have racked up a total of 24 goals in the process. The Reds opened the new season with three clean sheets in four league matches, and they should add another on Saturday against a Palace team who have failed to score on three of their previous four trips to Anfield. Anytime Goalscorer: Sadio Mane (7/2) Liverpoolâs current run of eight consecutive wins against Palace has a common trendsetter, with Sadio Mane scoring in all eight matches. Mane has also netted in two of his three most recent Premier League appearances against Burnley and Leeds United, and he should be fresh after being left out of Kloppâs starting line-up for the midweek victory over Milan. Under/Over Goals: Over 3.5 Goals (5/4) Fixtures between Liverpool and Palace have not been short of goals in the 21 times since the previous stalemate, which came in an FA Cup fourth-round tie in January 2003. Intriguingly, those 21 matches have yielded 76 goals at a remarkable average of 3.6 per game over such a long period.

Nuno Espirito Santo's men come into this game on the back of a 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers - Espirito Santo's former side - in their most recent league fixture. So far this season, Spurs have won both of their matches and even dispatched last season's Premier League champions Manchester City, with an impressive 1-0 win. Watford, meanwhile, will know that their aim this season is to survive relegation, and they have already shown early promising signs that they will, having already picked up three points with a triumph over Aston Villa. ð¡ð²ðð ðð½: A trip to North London#TOTWAT ð pic.twitter.com/I4v1kEmKpN Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Tottenham Hotspur vs Watford to get your teeth stuck into. Tottenham Hotspur are 2/5 to win, with Watford priced at 7/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 18/5. Prediction:2-0 (11/2) Half-Time/Full-Time: Tottenham Hotspur/Tottenham Hotspur (11/10) In 14 head-to-head encounters between the two sides, Tottenham Hotspur hold the clear advantage having won ten, lost one and drawn three. For that reason, we're backing the north London outfit to lead from the first to last whistle and cement their title challenge. Win to Nil: Tottenham Hotspur (5/4) Tottenham will be eager to continue their fine form at home, especially having beaten Pep Guardiola's City in their opening fixture. Interestingly, Spurs have won to nil in their last five home matches with Watford and, as a result of that, we're backing the same outcome to happen again once more this weekend. Anytime Goalscorer: Heung-min Son (1/1) Heung-min Son has had a strong start to the new season after he scored the winning goal in Spurs' opener against City. The South Korean international has already scored five times against Watford in his career and we're backing him to do so again when he faces a defence that has already conceded four in two games.

Prediction: 1-2 (13/2) Win to Nil: Chelsea (15/8) Chelsea travel to Tottenham full of confidence after another victory in midweek when they overcame Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League. We reckon Chelsea will earn another three points at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, with Thomas Tuchelâs side expected to go from strength to strength throughout the campaign. First Goalscorer: Romelu Lukaku (4/1) Romelu Lukaku has been hugely impressive since rejoining Chelsea this summer and the Belgium striker has already been prolific for the Blues. The former Inter Milan man scored in his first match back in a Chelsea shirt against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, before netting twice against Aston Villa last weekend. To Be Carded: Oliver Skipp (13/5) Oliver Skipp has picked up two Premier League bookings in four matches, against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Watford, and the star-studded midfield of Chelsea could test him once again. Arsenalâs Sambi Lokonga and Aston Villaâs John McGinn - two central midfielders - have already been booked against Chelsea this season, and we're backing Skipp to be the third to do so.

Nuno Espirito Santo's men kicked off their Premier League season in style, stamping their authority over reigning champions Manchester City in an impressive 1-0 win. But after travelling to Portugal to take on Pacos de Ferreira in Europe's third-tier competition just days later, Spurs were stunned in a 1-0 defeat after Espirito Santo fielded a shadow side. But this tie is far from over and Spurs are likely to see big names return to the starting line-up - including the likes of Harry Kane. Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Tottenham Hotspur vs Pacos de Ferreira to get your teeth stuck into. Tottenham Hotspur are 1/9 to win, with Pacos de Ferreira priced at 16/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 6/1. Prediction:4-0 (7/1) Team Most Booking Points: Pacos de Ferreira (4/5) Last week's first leg was a fiery occasion, with six yellow cards dished out in total. We reckon that the Portuguese side to receive the most booking points is a certainty this evening, especially given Spurs' electric pace going forward. To Score 4+ Goals: Tottenham Hotspur (7/4) Pacos de Ferreira's triumph in the first leg is not in keeping with their other results in recent weeks, having only scored twice in 270 minutes of football. Expect Espirito Santo to call on a few key men to steady the ship and get an early goal, including Kane following his decision to stay at the club this season. First Goalscorer: Harry Kane (15/8) The Kane transfer saga has, as you can imagine, cast a shadow over the north London club, but the 28-year-old has since revealed that he will be staying at Spurs - for the time being, anyway.

Diallo hit the headlines this week when she was taken into police custody over an incident involving Hamraoui, with the latter attacked by two men. The accused player is said to have been driving her teammate home when they were ambushed by two masked men, who attacked Hamraoui's legs. Diallo was taken into police custody over accusations that she'd organised the attack, with both players vying for the same spot in PSG's team. The 26-year-old has now been released from custody and put out a statement about the accusations. ""Aminata Diallo deplores the perfectly artificial dramatisation of a rivalry between her and Kheira Hamraoui which would justify her taking it out on her team-mate,"" the statement read. ""This theory does not correspond in any way to the true nature of their relationship. ""Other much more serious leads are now being looked at by investigators, which do not implicate my client in any way. ""Aminata Diallo regrets the media uproar which had already sentenced her, with no basis, and she would like to emphasise that she will not hesitate to defend her rights through legal action, if necessary, against all defamation."" Hamraoui's injuries, suffered during the attack, meant she missed the recent Champions League game with Real Madrid, which Diallo started before she was questioned. PSG were hoping to get their game against Lyon, the most successful women's team, postponed but instead face their rivals on Sunday. A statement from the club earlier in the week said, ""Paris Saint-Germain notes the release of Aminata Diallo from police custody. ""The club continues to support its players to allow them to overcome this ordeal as soon as possible. ""Paris Saint-Germain reiterates its confidence in the justice system to shed full light on the events. ""The club would like to thank everyone for showing restraint and respecting the presumption of innocence as well as the privacy of the team.""

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich has been in the middle of looking for a buyer for Chelsea in recent weeks, having had the threat of sanctions hanging over him. On Thursday morning it was confirmed that sanctions had been placed against the Russian billionaire, which seemed to put an end to his chances of selling the club. It also means that the Blues can't do any transfer business or even sell tickets to fans, meaning only season ticket holders can actually go to games for now. However, Abramovich could still sell under one circumstance, according to iNews, if none of the proceeds of the sale actually benefit the 55-year-old then in theory the club can be sold. The report says that the billionaire's accounts will be 'monitored closely' by officials, and that he wouldn't be able to gain in any way from any sale. He would also have to apply for a special licence in order to sell the club, declaring that he won't be benefitting from selling the side he's owned since 2003. Abramovich had originally claimed that any 'net profits' from the sale of the club would go towards 'victims of the war,' although he hadn't said what charity that would be too. The Russian was also reportedly asking for up to Â£4 billion for the club, which is said to have included the Â£1.5 billion of debt the west London side owe him. The club have been given a special licence to carry on working as a football club, meaning they can play tonight's league fixture with Norwich City. However they can't even sell merchandise at the club shop, or sell tickets, and that has led to them confirming an appeal to amend the licence. A number of other sanctions have been placed on the club, which includes the amount of money that can be spent on travel to away games, or putting on home games.

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich has been officially looking to sell the club, who he bought in 2003, for the past few weeks, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The billionaire has since been put under sanctions from the UK government, meaning their fans can't even buy tickets to games or merchandise, but the club is still for sale. Abramovich hired The Raine Group to help sell the club and, despite the sanctions, is set to have a say in who can buy the club, and that's where the issues could be. According to the Daily Mail, the 55-year-old could veto any bids that come from countries that have sanctioned Russia in the past few weeks. If he did that it would mean that he refused to sell to any British or American bids, or even from the EU, leaving minimal potential buyers left. If Abramovich can't find a seller soon then there is a chance of the club going into administration, with them not currently being able to make money, and the owner's accounts having been frozen, whilst players still need to be paid. The problems are added to by the fact that the UK government, and particularly Chancellor Rishi Sunak, are overseeing the sale of the Blues. That will be to make sure that Abramovich isn't actually benefiting from the sale, but it could also mean that certain other buyers are ruled out. Sunak could be reticent to sell to any bidders from Saudi Arabia, especially with the Premier League considering making human rights a part of their fit and proper persons test for new owners. They would have to be careful denying any Saudi bid, considering that Newcastle United were only recently bought by the country's Public Investment Fund and Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked to intervene to help with that sale, though his part is unknown. Considering the PM also visited the country earlier in the week, as part of a mission for the UK to rely less on oil and gas from Russia, it could be tough for the government to get involved. It was reported several weeks ago that Abramovich could also refuse to sell to potential buyers from 'politically controversial' countries, as he wants to leave the Blues in good hands following his successful 19 years at the helm. John Terry has joined one of the consortiums attempting to take over at Stamford Bridge, and he seems like one British person Abramovich wouldn't refuse to sell to.

According to the publication, Raine and the UK government will âresumeâ the process of selling the club as they planned to do before the sanctioning of Abramovich. It has been suggested that there is âconfidenceâ that a deal for Chelseaâs sale can be achieved âwithin the next four to six weeks.â Read More: The Athletic added that âseveral credible interested partiesâ are eyeing up Chelsea, but no formal bids have been launched at the time of writing. Raine is aiming to secure a second licence for Chelsea if a âpreferred bidderâ is found, which would allow it to push through the sale of the club. It is believed that the UK government will only allow the sale of Chelsea if Abramovich can prove that he âwill not personally benefit from the transaction.â Read More: Under the current measures in place on Chelsea, the club can allow season ticket holders and existing ticket holders to attend matches and cover costs for staff. However, the licence aims to cut off any revenue that Abramovich can receive from Chelsea, meaning the club cannot sell any further tickets or merchandise and will belimited on travelling costs to and from matches.

Loadingâ¦ Manchester United fans were no doubt cocahoop about Tampa Bay Buccaneers winning the Super Bowl in 2020, with the Glazers at the helm. Likewise Arsenal fans will have been just as happy to see Stan Kroenke lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy a year later with the LA Rams. And Fulham fans, well they don't get to celebrate the Jacksonville Jaguars success anywhere near as often as they get to celebrate their biannual promotion to the Premier League... Chelsea fans could soon become the latest English team who are linked to an American Football team, with one owner eyeing a move for the Blues. According to ESPN, New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson is 'readying' a bid for the Premier League team, and he is very knowledgeable about the club, having previously lived in London. Abramovich is looking to sell the club in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, having initially just handed over the 'stewardship' over to the trustees. However he then changed his mind and officially put the club up for sale, with an official statement, although he's not said to be in a rush. As well as not selling to anyone from a 'politically controversial' country, the 55-year-old also wants to make sure that whoever comes in next is willing to invest in the playing side of things, and a new stadium. The billionaire is also reportedly after around Â£3 billion, which is said to include the Â£1.5 billion that is owed to him from the club, with Johnson's net worth said to be around $3.5 billion. Last year the NFL announced UK home marketing access for six teams, with the Jets one of those six, meaning more access commercially for the teams in the UK. That makes a crossover between the Jets and Chelsea an attractive prospect for the NFL side's owner, with the Jaguars and San Francisco 49ers, whose owner has a part ownership of Leeds United, also amongst the six. If Johnson did buy the club from Abramovich then they would be the 10th current Premier League side with at least part ownership from the US. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich had all his assets frozen on Thursday morning, but Chelsea can still function thanks to a special licence from the UK government. The 55-year-old is alleged to have ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who launched an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine last month. Abramovich has frequently denied links to Putin but Syed, who writes for the Times, questioned Abramovich's presence in the Premier League years ago. The views below are those of Matthew Syed and not SPORTbible. This from @matthewsyed is an incredible watch on Roman Abramovich and why he bought Chelsea Football Club. This interview is from 2013. pic.twitter.com/xpRkSzBCKl Syed said during an appearance of Sky Sports News: ""Well heâs definitely spent a lot of money thereâs no disputing that. But one has to look at how heâs amassed his wealth and his QC, Jonathan Sumption admitted in open court in his case against Boris Berezovsky that he had secured his money in a rigged privatisation. ""Essentially, the Oligarchs did a deal with Boris Yeltsin, who was running for re-election. âWe will back your campaign, we will give you free advertising if you sell us the mineral wealth of the Russian people at a knockdown price.â ""Sumption admitted this, itâs not in dispute and thatâs stolen money â if it can use the word. Certainly, fraudulently got. ""Itâs what is bankrolling Chelsea which has paid for the academy, inflated first-team football salaries and you canât look at this in a purely footballing context. You have to look at the wider moral context and, in that sense, itâs been a deeply corrosive influence on British football."" He continued: ""Tony [Cascarino] talked about the fact that he has continued to invest and reinvest. He was never in Chelsea to make a profit. He wasnât investing in order to make a return which is the way most people operate commercial assets. He bought Chelsea for protection. He knew there was a risk that Putin would come after him like he has with other Oligarchs for his role in this very dubious business practice under Yeltsin. ""And he knew one of the best ways of protecting himself from being got at by the Russian authorities was to associate himself with a highly visible British asset â and he chose Chelsea Football Club. Thereâs no real emotional background to that. ""That was a straight-forward hard-headed decision from a very ruthless and manipulative businessman. ""So to talk about it in terms of âOh heâs great because heâs invested in British footballâ look at the reason he did and look at the money heâs using."" Abramovich purchased Chelsea in 2003 for Â£140 million, with Â£60 million of that for the club and Â£80 million for any outstanding debts. The club hadn't won a league title since 1956 before Abramovich's arrival, but have become one of the must successful clubs in England. Chelsea have won five league titles under Abramovich's ownership as well as the Champions League twice. All in all, they've amassed 19 major honours in the last 19 years. Chelsea can still be sold but Abramovich cannot benefit from the money generated in any way. The Blues are currently third in the league and return to action on Sunday against Newcastle United.

Loadingâ¦ On Thursday morning, the government finally announced that they were sanctioning Abramovich, and freezing his assets, which included Chelsea FC. The news means that the billionaire can't currently sell the club, it also means that they can't buy or sell players, or even renew any contracts. They have been allowed to continue to operate as a football team, meaning they can still fulfil their games, and players and staff can be paid, under a general licence. However, with the team unable to even sell merchandise or tickets to games, they have confirmed they've applied to the government to change their licence. ""Chelsea Football Club has been advised that its owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK Government,"" a statement on the website said. ""By virtue of his 100 per cent ownership of Chelsea FC plc and affiliated entities, Chelsea FC would normally be subject to the same sanctions regime as Mr Abramovich. However, the UK Government has issued a general licence that permits Chelsea FC to continue certain activities. ""We will fulfil our menâs and womenâs team fixtures today against Norwich and West Ham, respectively, and intend to engage in discussions with the UK Government regarding the scope of the licence. ""This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible. ""We will also be seeking guidance from the UK Government on the impact of these measures on the Chelsea Foundation and its important work in our communities."" Abramovich had been in the middle of attempting to sell the club, with a number of potential bidders linked with a move for the two times Champions League winners. There had been interest from American Robert 'Woody' Johnson, the owner of NFL side New York Jets, and the current Blues' owner was said to have wanted to avoid owners from 'politically controversial' countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia. Right now all his plans to sell will have to be put on hold, unless sanctions are lifted or he can get special dispensation proving he won't benefit from the sale. The club will be desperate to get their licence amended, otherwise only those with season tickets will be able to go to games. ",negative,liverpool,0

The billionaire is said to be looking for a buyer as the risk of sanctions from UK parliament rise. Chelsea kept themselves on course for a top four finish with an emphatic victory over the Clarets.

Loadingâ¦ Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calls for the Premier League owner to be put under sanctions came from MPs and the public alike. With the threat of that happening, and the club being seized from Abramovic, the 55-year-old announced this week that the club was up for sale. The sale has led to fans and former Blues players, including John Terry, backing the owner, something that has been slammed by club legend Pat Nevin. However, that sale isn't likely to happen quickly. According to Joe Ravitch, the banker helping Abramovich find a seller, the billionaire won't be rushing. ""We are not going to rush anything. It is very important that Chelsea have the right owner to guide the club forward,"" Ravitch told Reuters. A source also told the news agency that the club do not want to find themselves with owners that will be 'politically controversial,' considering the ending of the current owner's time in charge. That means that Abramovich won't be selling to owners from China and Saudi Arabia, and it could also include other countries with poor human rights records. Newcastle United's recent change of ownership was delayed due to the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, over an argument over Premier League television rights. However there was a greater backlash from football fans for the new Saudi ownership, due to the close connection with the country's own governance. Whoever does buy the five times Premier League winners, whose success in the league all came under the Abramovich era since 2003, will have to spend big. It is reported that the Russian billionaire is looking for Â£3 billion in order to sell, with Â£1.5 billion of that thought to be the debt the club owe him. Britain's richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, was linked with a potential move to buy the club, but sources close to the Nice owner have since denied them. A Swiss billionaire claimed to have been approached by the club but said he needed several 'investors,' but if all else fails they can always sell to Conor McGregor, although the Irishman also certainly counts as 'politically controversial.'

The German boss made seven changes to his line-up on Wednesday night ahead of this weekend's FA Cup final against Leicester City. Despite having 62 per cent possession and 19 shots throughout, The Blues fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat following a 16th-minute winner from Emile Smith Rowe. It has been a busy schedule for Tuchel's side following their Champions League semi-final clash against Real Madrid last Wednesday. They secured a deserved win against Manchester City just three days later, where the Chelsea manager made five changes, but he admits to chopping and changing too much in this instance. Check out Tuchel's post-match interview below. He told Sky Sports after the game: ""We had three days, we are on a good run, we had a good mood. The choices were not so good today from my side for the line-up so that's on me. ""We were unlucky, of course. But we did everything today to lose. ""I'm not happy with my line-up. It's easy to say afterwards. But it was too many changes, I should not have done it like this. It's something in particular - but I will not tell you. ""I felt it a little bit coming yesterday in training. I'm a bit unlucky that it's proven today on the pitch. I regret... but it's like this. 'We could have [done this], we could have [done that]', and that's what it's all about. ""I did not feel us in the same way involved, sharp with intensity and energy like the last game and these are the per cents who are missing today.""  In his post-match press conference, Tuchel was again critical of his decision to make wholesale changes. ""We all lacked concentration and focus, that is very unusual,"" he said. ""Maybe I gave some signs to the team that Saturday is on my mind, even if it's only five per cent or one per cent, that is not how you approach things and you get punished because you cannot be naive."" Do you think Chelsea can win the upcoming FA Cup final against Leicester after such a performance against Mikel Arteta's underperforming Arsenal side? Let us know in the comments.

The German boss made reference to niche Winter Olympic sport curling - where teams rapidly sweep a broom beneath a hefty stone to let it travel quicker and straighter across the ice - while his Chelsea squad were trying to complete a tricky passing challenge on the pitch in Porto, ahead of their clash with Manchester City. As one pass didn't quite make it, Tuchel bent over with the pole he was holding and mocked frantically scrubbing the pitch. It certainly got the Chelsea team laughing, particularly goalkeeper Edouard Mendy (although it was possibly let's-laugh-at-the-boss-even-though-we-don't-get-the-joke type chuckles). We didn't actually realise that curling was such a popular pastime in Germany. The Scottish sport is a big deal in Canada and various other colder-climate countries. It involves sliding a granite stone across the ice towards a target, and the competitor who unleashed the stone can shout ""sweep!"" to encourage their broom-wielding teammates to polish the path if they want the stone to travel that bit further before coming to a stop. As Chelsea boss Tuchel is clearly all too aware. Tuchel seems like a joy to work with Imagine the meltdown if this was United :joy: https://t.co/JsWbwjScM4 While they are rehearsing set pieces we are playing games .. we are doomed https://t.co/Z1fACCC31t The 47-year-old is clearly determined to create a happy, light-hearted atmosphere around the camp before the crunch match with City. A day before Saturday's evening kick-off, Tuchel was filmed doing what appeared to be an impression of Pep Guardiola on his hotel balcony to the amusement of his coaching staff. Thomas Tuchel is so jokes :sob::sob: pic.twitter.com/dwqZQ2vgoB So it's curling and Pep impressions so far.

Blues owner Roman Abramovich, who is Russian,announced on Saturday that ""stewardship and care"" of the clubwould be in the hands of Chelsea's charitable foundation for the foreseeable future. Ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup clash with Luton Town, Tuchel was questioned about the last five days and he decided to put his foot down. When asked about Abramovich's position as owner, Tuchel quickly intervened with: ""Listen, you have to stop. I'm not a political. Honestly. I can only repeat it and I feel bad to repeat it because I haven't experienced war. ""To talk about it, I feel bad because I'm very privileged. I sit here in peace... I do the best I can but you have to stop asking me these questions. I have no answers for you."" The 48-year-old looked frustrated at the end of his speech and Chelsea's press officer asked for the remaining questions to be on tomorrow's game. Earlier in the press conference, he'd spoken at length about the conflict and the suffering it's caused across the world. ""It's horrible. It's horrible,"" Tuchel explained. ""There can't be any other opinion about it, but why should we be more distracted by you. It's out there. We know there are more important things out there. This will never change. ""Everyone in Europe has noise in their head that nobody likes. Still you try to come to work and try to do the best in your job as possible."" Abramovich is one of the richest men in Russia and allegedly has ties to president Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. A spokesperson representing Abramovich claims the 55-year-oldis currently speaking with Ukraine in an attempt to reach a 'peaceful solution'. The spokesperson said per BBC: ""Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.""

It comes after Labour MP Chris Bryant called for the Russian billionaire to be prevented from owning the Premier League club, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Bryant called on the UK government to seize assets from Abramovich, using his parliamentary privilege to claim he had seen details from a leaked Home Office document from 2019 that had expressed concerns about alleged links between the Chelsea owner and the Russian state. Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, has denied having links with the Kremlin. The Russian released a statement on the club's website on Saturday, which read: âDuring my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the Club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities. âI have always taken decisions with the Clubâs best interest at heart. âI remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelseaâs charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. âI believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans.â The six trustees who are now in control of Chelsea are understood to be chairman Bruce Buck, women's head coach Emma Hayes, head of the National Lottery Sir Hugh Robertson, director of finance Paul Ramos, Piara Powar and John Devine, according to the Daily Mirror. Abramovichâs statement comes on the eve of the Carabao Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool at Wembley. It is not yet clear if the Russian plans to sell the Premier League club, which has been valued at around Â£1.6bn.

The Real Madrid playmaker has started just five games for the Spanish giants this season after returning from a successful loan spell at Real Sociedad. Odegaard flourished under the management of Imanol Alguacil, who had hoped the midfielder would stay put, but the 22-year-old was recalled from his loan spell at the end of last season at the request of Zinedine Zidane. The Norwegian international was seen as a player to freshen things up in midfield areas by Zidane, although he has used the player sparingly since returning, with the player seemingly frustrated with a lack of first team opportunities. Reports this week suggested that the midfielder has 'demanded' another loan move to secure more time on the pitch. And just days later, it appears Real Sociedad have lost out to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal in the race to sign Odegaard, according to Spanish publications El Confidencial, El Diario and AS. It's said that Sociedad wanted an option to buy clause included in the loan deal, but Los Blancos do not want him to move permanently. The Daily Mail report that Arsenal's technical director Edu began negotiations last week to sign the Norwegian playmaker. Dani Ceballos, who is currently on loan at Arsenal from Real Madrid, recently spoke about Odegaard's situation amid transfer speculation. ""I can tell you about what happened to me at Madrid,"" he told EFE. ""I don't know exactly what happens about Martin, but it is obvious that any player who wants to succeed at Madrid is going to grab the opportunity he has.

He returned to Spain this season to work under Carlo Ancelotti, who he'd previously had success with, but things have continued to go badly for the 32-year-old and he's played just three times in the league so far. With Bale's contract set to expire next summer, he will finally leave the Bernabeu, having been linked with a departure for some time now. According to journalist Ekrem Konur, Tottenham are ready to make a move for their former player, as long as manager Antonio Conte agrees with the move. Bale's temporary move came under Jose Mourinho and the manager didn't give him as much football as might have been expected before the move. The board are reportedly happy to have their former player back in north London but need to find out if their new manager has any interest in the player. The former Southampton man can start to clubs outside of La Liga from January and could sign a pre contract agreement to join a club for free in the summer.

He played in the 5-1 win over Belarus but was again out injured for the draw with Belgium, and was ruled out for his club side for another three weeks. It kicked off an awful reaction from some Real fans, who crowded round the forward's car outside the team's training ground and shouted abuse at the player.

The 36-year-old cut a frustrated figure in the first half as Diogo Jota elected against passing to him when he was free - coupled with a shocking miss from six yards out just before half-time. Loadingâ¦ But he did what he does in the latter stages of the second, notching a brace in a late 3-0 Portugal win to take his Euros tally to 11 and move to 106 goals in 175 games for the national team. His first was an emphatic penalty after substitute Rafa Silva was fouled inside the box, while his second finished off some gorgeous combination play with Bruno Fernandes. Ronaldo has played in five consecutive European Championship and scored in all five. His first was in Euro 2004 and 17 years on, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is still running riot in the tournament. He is now the top scorer in the history of the Euros and the Champions League, having completely dominated at the highest level of club and international football. What's more, Ronaldo has now struck in nine consecutive major international tournaments - a feat only matched by Ghana's Asamoah Gyan. The next record in Ronaldo's sights is held by Ali Daei, who scored 108 goals for Iran in his career and is the highest goalscorer in international football. Ronaldo is just three away from surpassing the former Bayern Munich striker and you wouldn't bet against him doing it during Euro 2020. ",positive,liverpool,0

Ronaldo, who is the all-time international and Champions League record goalscorer, scored an impressive 29 goals in 33 league games for Juventus last season, as well as winning the Euro 2020 Golden Boot with five goals. And with the Portuguese phenomenon edging closer to the age of 37, the Serie A giants are said to be keen on offloading him in a surprise swap deal for one of PSG's younger forwards. According to French publication L'Equipe, the Old Lady are willing to part ways with Ronaldo in order to bring in long-term target Mauro Icardi, who they were heavily linked with in 2019. It should come as an enormous surprise, too, especially given the poor season the Argentine had with the French giants last term, finding the back of the net just seven times in 20 appearances. The move could also see Ronaldo link up with PSG's Kylian Mbappe - both regarded as the best strikers in the world - with the young forward publically declaring the 36-year-old as his idol in football. For Juventus, Ronaldo's eye-watering wage of nearly a million-a-week could be deemed to be holding them back financially as they look to add quality to other parts of the pitch. Ronaldo posted a cryptic message on social media on Sunday which sparked further speculation over his future. Posing next to his Rolls Royce, Ronaldo wrote ""Decision day"" in an Instagram post that quickly earned seven million likes. Make of that what you will.

Loadingâ¦ The Portugal superstar has been left frustrated after seeing Juventus miss out on the Serie A title for the first time in a decade. He's scored 101 goals for the club since arriving in 2018 but it hasn't been totally positive in Turin, with rumours suggesting he could leave. Trezeguet, who worked for the club as an ambassador until last week, told Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport Ronaldo could be suffering from a 'lack of dialogue' within the team. ""It was the best signing from the club, nobody expected that,"" former Juve forward Trezeguet begun. ""There have been some problems with his teammates, and you could see that, but he's scored 100 goals. ""I think nobody has been able to manage him as Zinedine Zidane, perhaps there has been a lack of dialogue at Juventus at some point. ""One coach can tell a player: 'Look at this game, you walked for 90 minutes and you must help me win the games. ""There are players you don't want to have against you because they make you win the matches. Ronaldo is one of them, [Paulo] Dybala as well. Some of the others, with all the respect due, not as much."" Ronaldo arrived from Real Madrid after winning three successive Champions League titles under Zidane's management. Juventus had hoped the 36-year-old's arrival would see them win their first major European honour since 1996. But the last three seasons have seen them reach the quarter-finals twice and the last-16, losing to Ajax, Lyon and Porto respectively. Reports have claimed Juventus already have a three-man shortlist prepared to replace Ronaldo - with Gabriel Jesus, Mauro Icardi and Dusan Vlahovic included. Trezeguet also named a massive mistake the club made in the transfer market - selling Kingsley Coman. The France winger joined from Paris Saint-Germain as a teenager and only made 22 appearances before joining Bayern Munich on loan in 2015. Two years later, Bayern made that deal permanent and Coman has become a key player in attack. He's scored 41 goals and provided 50 assists, with one of those goals coming in Champions League final victory against PSG last year.

It would be nice if the employees in the relevant positions had even a little idea of what Borussia Dortmund is and what it means."" Dortmund were quick to respond to the criticism when the kit was leaked last May and said: ""Fans, your criticism of the cup jersey for the new season has been received. The leaked jersey doesn't look what it will look like. So please be patient."" However, the rest of the other European clubs that were involved with these new shirts have chosen go ahead with it which has caused a storm on social media over the past week.

Loadingâ¦ Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been keen to strengthen his squad after finishing 12 points behind Manchester City in the Premier League. High on his priority list has been reinforcements in defence and per The Sun, two big names are close to arriving at Old Trafford. United have chased Varane for a number of years and are ready to pay Real Madrid a fee of around Â£50 million for his signature. The France international is entering the final year of his deal and is ready for a new challenge after a decade in Spain. Madrid have already seen Sergio Ramos depart for Paris Saint-Germain this summer and want a fee for Varane. United regularly paired captain Harry Maguire with Victor Lindelof last season but are aware they need more experience. Meanwhile, Trippier is keen on a return to England after spending the last two seasons with Atletico Madrid. He won La Liga last season and is the club's first English player in 95 years, with his cost being around Â£18 million. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is currently the starting right-back but many have doubted his attacking ability, which Trippier excels at. It'd take United's spending up to the Â£140 million mark after confirming the signing of Jadon Sancho earlier this month. Solskjaer is reportedly keen on United being more attacking next season after cagey contests with the big six last. In those games United often played Scott McTominay and Fred in central midfield together and had to sacrifice at least one of his attacking players. However it looks like the manager is going to change that for next season and instead play a 4-3-3 with two more attacking midfielders and one holding. According to ESPN, Solskjaer has already told the players who have returned to training this summer of his plan. Varane's arrival means the defence wouldn't need as much shielding and as a result, give more opportunities for Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes to play together. Pogba started a number of games on the left wing last campaign, meaning Marcus Rashford also had to shift to an unnatural role on the right.

Shortly after the signing of White was announced, plenty of Arsenal fans suggested the centre-back will end up being a better investment for them than Varane at United. Ben White will turn out to be a better investment than RaphaÃ«l Varane. 100% not even joking. White is 23 and has got 10 years or more at the top level left. Varane is nearly 30 and will probably leave United in 3 years time He already is mate, as much as I like varane but other than his pace,there's not so much in him...White is better in the build up play,pace,long and accurate passes, reads the game better and EPL proven, we're getting a better deal. White's former Brighton teammate, Lewis Dunk, believes the defender has the potential to become one of the best defenders in the Premier League. ""Heâs got the potential to for sure. I think we have seen it for a good few years now, how good he is,â Dunk told talkSPORT. ""I spoke to him a few times in the summer when he was away with England, just seeing how he was and if he was enjoying it and he was only saying good things.

Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been keen to strengthen his squad after finishing 12 points behind noisy neighbours Manchester City in the Premier League last season. Having already confirmed the signing of Jadon Sancho earlier this month, United are said to be just hours away from bringing defensive stalwart Varane to Old Trafford, too. It is no secret that United have chased Varane for a number of years, but now they are primed and ready to fork out the big bucks for the signature of the Frenchman. Following his summer break after this summer's European Championships, the 28-year-old returned to Madrid for pre-season training on Wednesday. But according to AS, the France international was not happy about starting pre-season with the Galacticos and is insistent on moving to Manchester so that he can train with his new teammates instead. Madrid have already seen club veteran Sergio Ramos depart the Los Blancos for Paris Saint-Germain for free this summer and want a fee for Varane. Taking that into account, AS further report that a final agreement is likely to be reached by Wednesday evening with a fee of around â¬55m (Â£47m) likely to be agreed upon between the two clubs. United regularly paired captain Harry Maguire with Victor Lindelof last season and are aware they need more experience at the back, with Varane fitting that exact bill. Meanwhile, it has also been reported that United are close to bringing Atletico Madrid right-back Kieran Tripper to the club after his recent La Liga triumph with the Spanish giants. It is claimed by The Sun that a deal to sign Trippier is ""in the final stages"", while Varane's five-year contract with the Manchester outfit will be announced imminently.

It looks increasingly likely that Varane will be that player, even with talk that two clubs are trying to hijack the move late on, with the Real Madrid defender having just one year left on his deal and looking for a new challenge.

Loadingâ¦ The Frenchman will become a United player should he complete a medical along with the final terms.

Varane's compatriot has been a Real target for a long time and he too is in the final year of his contract - with it looking unlikely that he will pen an extension. Speaking on 'The Transfer Window' podcast, McGarry revealed: ""The Transfer Window has learnt that during the conversations in Glasgow between representatives of Madrid and Manchester United with regards to Raphael Varane's transfer, Pogba was offered as part of the deal in order, again, to bring down the transfer fee or indeed eliminate the transfer fee, given that it's â¬50m. ""You would have to expect that Pogba's value with one year left on his contract would be around that mark, if not even maybe less. ""It would depend how much Madrid valued trying to recruit the player."" A according to the Canal Supporters, World Cup winner Pogba has rejected an offer from United and the club risk losing him for free next summer in a repeat scenario from 2012.

Loadingâ¦ Tuchel arrived at Stamford Bridge in January, with Chelsea in ninth place after a poor start to the season under Frank Lampard. By the end of the season they finished fourth and won the Champions League final, beating City in Porto, and making them everyone's favourites to challenge Pep Guardiola's side in the league next season. The Chelsea boss hasn't yet had a transfer window to put his own mark on the squad, and according to reports he could see up to 11 players leave. According to the Daily Mail, Tammy Abraham, Olivier Giroud, Ross Barkley, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Billy Gilmour, Connor Gallagher, Davide Zappacosta, Emerson, Tiemoue Bakayoko and even Christian Pulisic could all join Fikayo Tomori out the door. Tomori has been on loan at AC Milan in the second half of the season and the Serie A side have an option to sign the young centre back. It looks likely that the England international will be heading to the San Siro on a permanent basis, one reason the Blues have been linked with a centre back this summer. Barkley and Loftus-Cheek have also both been on loan this season, with Aston Villa and Fulham respectively but there isn't options on their permanent deals. Villa are unlikely to want Barkley again after a poor end to his time in the Midlands, after a good start, whilst Fulham were relegated. Abraham was left out of the FA Cup and Champions League finals and barely played at all in the back end of the season and clearly Tuchel doesn't want him, they have been linked with a big money move for Romelu Lukaku. Likewise Giroud is likely to end his spell in the Premier League as a European champion, with the striker set to join Tomori in Milan. Gilmour and Gallagher both seem more likely to go on loan than leave permanently this summer, with both youngsters looking for opportunities for first team football. Zappacosta, Emerson and Bakayoko have never really been first teamers in west London and will almost certainly leave this summer. The least likely departure is Pulisic, due to how excellent he clearly is, but some questions do remain over his future at the club. The American has often been used as a substitute for Tuchel and has come on to play at wing back as well, something that isn't ideal for the former Borussia Dortmund forward. ",positive,liverpool,0

It is believed that another London club are also in the market for the 24-year-old, who is open to a move away from Brendan Rodgers' side. According to football.london, the increasingly likely potential of Martin Odegaard fighting for his place at Real Madrid means that Mikel Arteta, who is an admirer of both Odegaard and Maddison, has switched his attention to the Englishman. Leicester appear to be demanding a fee of Â£60 million for Maddison, which Arsenal are reluctant to pay due to budget issues. They have, however, come up with an alternative offer believed to be a player plus money deal. It is currently unknown who the player is. Arsenal do have a number of players who are available for a transfer this summer, including the likes of Sead Kolasinac, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Joe Willock, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah.

806,https://www.sportbible.com/football/premier-league-could-have-nine-clubs-in-europe-next-season-20220415,The Premier League Could Have NINE Clubs In European Competition Next Season,"England could have nine clubs competing in European football next season if a remarkable set of results occur at the end of the current campaign. All three European club competitions could still be won by English sides this season. Liverpool and Manchester City are safely through to the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they will come up against Villarreal and Real Madrid respectively. West Ham have reached the last four of the Europa League, where they will face Eintracht Frankfurt, while Leicester will take on Roma in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. If English clubs win all three competitions, there could be as many as nine Premier League clubs in Europe next season. ESPN editor Dale Johnson took to Twitter on Friday to explain how the unlikely scenario could come about. Common misconception is that the maximum is 7, but that's not the case. Places for European titleholders are standalone if said titleholders don't qualify domestically. However, it's very, very rare for a European titleholder to finish outside the domestic places that season. For example, last season Sevilla won the UEL, thus qualifying for the UCL as titleholders. Sevilla also finished in the UECL place in LaLiga. Therefore, that place was left vacant, meaning LaLiga had no representative in the inaugural UECL. He began: âWith Leicester and West Ham in the semifinals of the UEL and UECL, and on the back of questions last night, a thread to explain how their performance affects the number of Premier League teams in Europe. The maximum number of Premier League teams in Europe next season is 9. âCommon misconception is that the maximum is 7, but thatâs not the case. Places for European titleholders are standalone if said titleholders donât qualify domestically. However, itâs very, very rare for a European titleholder to finish outside the domestic places that season. âIf a European titleholder DOES qualify domestically, they play in the highest-ranked competition. So, if West Ham win UEL and finish in a UEL or UECL spot in the Premier League, they play in the UCL as the UEL titleholder. That PL place in the UEL or UECL is then vacant. âFor example, last season Sevilla [here Johnson means Villarreal] won the UEL, thus qualifying for the UCL as titleholders. Sevilla [Villarreal] also finished in the UECL place in LaLiga. Therefore, that place was left vacant, meaning LaLiga had no representative in the inaugural UECL. If Crystal Palace win the FA Cup, they will be in the UEL and 6th in the Premier League will be in the UECL.If Crystal Palace don't win the FA Cup, 6th in the Premier League will be in the UEL and 7th will be in the UECL. As Leicester are almost certain to finish outside the top 7 in the Premier League, if they win the UECL then England will have 8 teams in Europe next season. 4 in the UCL3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup)1 in UECL (6th or 7th) âSo, how will European qualification work in the Premier League this season? What we know with absolute certainty is the top 4 will play in the Champions League and 5th with be in the Europa League. What will happen to 6th and 7th depends on Crystal Palace. âIf Crystal Palace win the FA Cup, they will be in the UEL and 6th in the Premier League will be in the UECL. If Crystal Palace donât win the FA Cup, 6th in the Premier League will be in the UEL and 7th will be in the UECL. âNothing else can alter domestic qualifying positions. The performance of Leicester and West Ham cannot affect which competition another Premier League team has earned, either positively or negatively. It cannot create extra places, other than for themselves as titleholders. England will only have 9 teams in Europe if West Ham also win the UEL and finish 8th (or 7th/8th with Palace winning the FA Cup).So it could be: 5 in the UCL (West Ham, top 4)3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup)1 in UECL (6th or 7th) And to be clear, it is impossible for 8th to qualify for Europe by league position - in any season. That team must win a cup or a European competition to qualify. There is no ""drop-down effect"" from other teams' performances. âAs Leicester are almost certain to finish outside the top 7 in the Premier League, if they win the UECL then England will have 8 teams in Europe next season. 4 in the UCL 3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup) 1 in UECL (6th or 7th). âEngland will only have 9 teams in Europe if West Ham also win the UEL and finish 8th (or 7th/8th with Palace winning the FA Cup).

Across London, Arsenal are needing some depth up front and they think Abraham could be the answer thanks to a tweet that reads: ""It's confusing but I play for Chelsea but support the Gunners."" Arsenal have used Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front, as well as youngster Eddie Nketiah. But more firepower is needed and many would like to see England international Abraham brought into the fold. One fan commented: ""Young, mobile, target man. Ticks all the boxes."" A second added: ""Arsenal should sign him ASAP!""

Abraham's future could be up in the air after his partner voiced her displeasure at his omission from the cup final squad. Leah Monroe posted a now-deleted Instagram story which reads: ""How on earth do you make the decision to leave your top goal scorer out of the squad for a final?"" ""The same person who even scored the goals to actually qualify for this competition? It's not making any sense whatsoever. ""Not even the bench?! This has to be a joke.""

Since arriving on a permanent deal from Real Madrid, the 22-year-old was put straight in the mix away to champions Manchester City, where the club suffered a 5-0 defeat and sunk to rock bottom of the Premier League. It's the first time ever the club have lost its opening three games. The success of Amazon's series following Manchester CIty to glory a few seasons ago was really well received and of course, its all well and good when you're winning. Arsenal fans, maybe unfairly stereotyped by the contributors of Arsenal Fan TV, will be hiding behind the couch if their team's form carries on, once the series is aired next year. âI must admit that itâs not my favourite thing to have cameras everywhere."" Odegaard said: âYou automatically think a bit more about what you are saying when there are cameras there, but the crew is discreet.â Of course, it is still early days and everyone loves a sports story of turning the ship around and defeating the odds but things look pretty bleak for Arsenal who have yet to register a goal in the league, despite turning West Brom over 6-0 in the Carabao Cup.

Isak was somewhat of a revelation in La Liga last season, finding the back of the net 17 times in total for Real Sociedad - earning him a call up to Sweden's Euro 2020 squad. So far, the 21-year-old has put in some stellar performances for the Swedes during this summer's showpiece and, as a result, is attracting interest from some of the biggest clubs around Europe. The Scandinavians are without their legendary forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the European Championship - but Isak is the new kid on the block and is captivating the Swedes every single time he plays. Isak is, essentially, Sweden's new Ibrahimovic - at least that's what many fans and pundits are saying - and he has already scored five times in 22 appearances for the nation. And that form hasn't gone unnoticed, too, with Arsenal, Real Madrid and Chelsea all said to be monitoring the progress of the young prospect. With the futures of Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette uncertain, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will be keen to make a move for Isak as part of a new-look attack. Lacazette, 30, currently has just a year left on his contract while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 32, scored just ten times in the Premier League last season. The north London club, however, faces stiff opposition from the Blancos who are also joining the race for the highly rated Swede. With 33-year-old Karim Benzema entering the twilight of his career, Madrid president Florentino Perez is looking at attacking options, according to Spanish outlet AS. The report also details that Isak is represented by Universal Sport Group agency, the same company which manages the affairs of Madrid playmaker Luka Modric - giving the 13-time European champions an advantage in negotiations. AS are also claiming that Carlo Ancelotti's side have already made contact with the striker's representatives over his availability. Unless Isak's â¬70m (Â£59.8m) release clause is triggered, Sociedad are unlikely to let the 21-year-old leave - but will Arsenal have the funds to claw him away or will Real Madrid bag him instead?

For many Arsenal fans, the departure of Mesut Ozil was a disappointing one. For years, the club have needed a playmaker to link play, create chances and score goals - and at one stage, the German provided that must-needed creative spark. In the 2015/16 campaign, Ozil picked up 19 assists in 35 Premier League matches. On his day, he was one of the best in world football but those days became few and far between towards the end of his time in North London. He struggled to maintain a place in the club's starting line-up and the rest is history. Ozil has now departed for pastures new and in his place, 20-year-old Emile Smith Rowe has come in and taken his opportunity with both hands. Gary Neville compared him to Robert Pires after last night's performance against Newcastle - a compliment of the highest order. Since making his first start for Arsenal in their Boxing Day clash against Chelsea, Smith Rowe has created ten chances for his teammates in the club's last five games against Brighton, West Brom, Newcastle [x2] and Crystal Palace. Mikel Arteta's side have won four of those last five games, with Smith Rowe contributing massively to the team's good form. In fact, only Bruno Fernandes has created more chances from open play than the 20-year-old midfielder since December 26. The 'Croydon De Bruyne', as many have nicknamed him of late, was once again influential in Arsenal's win against struggling Newcastle on Monday night, helping himself to another assist for fellow youngster Bukayo Saka during the 3-0 home victory. Smith Rowe's individual highlights against Steve Bruce's side prove he is the kind of player Arsenal have needed for a long time. Neville likened the 20-year-old to Robert Pires in his analysis and he certainly has a point. ""You watch Emile Smith Rowe play. You watch a lot of young players play particularly in the attacking area and they're frantic,"" Neville said on Monday Night Football. ""Their choices are usually a bit erratic, they don't normally get it right. ""He runs with the ball, he moves with the ball, he glides with the ball and he's always at a point whereby you feel he can release it."" Neville continued, saying: ""The real best players travel with the ball but they are always in the position where they can release it. He's connected, he's switched on, he's clever. ""They've had brilliant players, the likes of Pires, intelligent players who could run with the ball. He could play in the old Arsenal teams with the way he plays and he's only six games in...six games is unbelievable. ""It's really impressive and Arsenal fans have got a group of young players there they can hang their hats on and start to like and build something around."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Mikel Arteta is looking to strengthen his midfield this summer, after a season in which Arsenal finished down in eighth, especially with Granit Xhaka linked with a move to join Jose Mourinho's Roma. It seems that the relatively unknown Lokonga is a prime target, with reports in Belgium claiming they've already made a bid for the player. According to HLN, the Gunners bid â¬15 million for the 21-year-old, whilst the Pro League club are holding out for â¬20 million. A highlights video of the youngster shows exactly why Arteta wants to sign the player, who has made 69 appearances for Anderlecht's first team. Lokonga is reportedly open to a move this summer, although Arsenal do face competition from both Germany and France, which means the price could go up. As well as Xhaka's potential departure, the north London club have already lost Dani Ceballos and Martin Odegaard from last season, with the loan pair heading back to Real Madrid. Any signing would likely partner with Thomas Partey, who signed from Atletico Madrid last summer, with the likes of Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe playing ahead of them. Arsenal fans are pretty excited by the links to Lokonga, even if they haven't all seen him play yet! Arsenal fans got excited last week when Leicester City defender Wesley Fofana, who had an excellent first season in the Premier League, was photographed wearing an Arsenal shirt.

Loadingâ¦ The Brazilian swapped Stamford Bridge for the Emirates Stadium last summer after being sold a long-term project by Mikel Arteta. He put pen to paper on a three-year deal with the Gunners and admitted the main appeal was winning the Champions League. Per Football London he said: ""One of the reasons I wanted a three-year deal was to be part of a plan, not just a player passing through. ""When I talked with the manager he told me why he needed me for three years. ""It was that he first wanted to qualify for the Champions League and win it by the time I left. ""That was what I wanted to hear. ""I was at Chelsea for seven years and won everything except the Champions League. ""Hopefully, this move will give me the trophy I haven't got as well as another Premier League title."" Fast forward a year later and Willian's comments have aged horribly, regarding his own and Arsenal's position. The club are without European football for the first time in over 25 years after coming eighth in the Premier League. Meanwhile Willian himself endured a poor season and didn't score until the second to last gameweek, while half of his goal contributions came in opening day victory at Fulham. So what have Chelsea done in the meantime? Thomas Tuchel's men have secured a place in the top four, made it to an FA Cup final and won the Champions League. Ouch. Despite his departure, Willian was a popular player at Chelsea and then-manager Frank Lampard was keen on keeping him around. A two-year deal was offered but the 32-year-old turned it down as he believed he warranted three years extra. Now it looks like Willian is set to leave England after eight years as Arsenal look to reduce their wage budget. Willian rejected a 2 year contract extension at Chelsea and joined Arsenal in hopes of winning the Champions League within 3 years...""Hopefully this move will give me the (UCL) trophy I haven't got as well as another Premier League title.""Oh dear. :laughing: pic.twitter.com/iERwNW8Vk2 The Athletic report that as well as the winger, Bernd Leno, Granit Xhaka and Hector Bellerin all want to leave the club.

Atletico's sporting director Andrea Berta is said to be high on Bellerin, who started out at Barcelona before moving to Arsenal's youth system in 2011. On the likelihood of a swap deal between the pair, MARCA state ""the option of 'making an exchange between Spain and England can be studied"".

Speaking to BBC Sport the official explained why he didn't hand the ball over, saying: ""He arrived close to me he just clicked his fingers and said; 'The ball! ""I have four daughters and when we're together and they ask something, if we don't have the word 'please' at the end of the sentence, there is no reaction. ""So, it's the same, it's a kind of education. I think it was a kind of disrespect. There is something wrong with society if we forget the simple things such as 'please' and 'thank you'.

Loadingâ¦ Eddie Howe's side have already snapped up Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood in the transfer window and are looking to make Guimaraes a statement signing. The 24-year-old has been chased by Arsenal and Manchester United in the past and reports earlier this week claimed the Magpies had agreed a â¬40 million deal. Lyon released a statement denying that however and L'Equipe claim it was down to how Newcastle wanted the deal structuring. It's claimed Newcastle wanted to spread payment over five years which Lyon deemed unacceptable for one of their star players. A new deal is currently being rehashed, said to be in the region of â¬42 million plus â¬10 million in bonuses and a healthy increase to Guimaraes' deal. Guimaraes is with Brazil on international duty and could complete his medical in Belo Horizonte on Friday. He's regarded as one of the top midfielders in Ligue 1 and will offer quality in a position in desperate need of strengthening at St James' Park. Newcastle are currently 18th in the Premier League and have won just two games all season. Howe is keen to strengthen his squad in the transfer window and another position they're keen to improve is central defence. Negotiations for Sevilla's Diego Carlos appear to have hit a standstill, despite spending most of January chasing his signature. The La Liga outfit have said the offer received was 'insufficient' and won't be taking talks any further. Sporting director, Monchi, told a press conference: ""The offer was very important, respectful, but it was an offer that our board considered insufficient. It is also true that it was maybe not the best time. ""Itâs a difficult market in which to find a replacement for him. If the offer had come in the summer, things may have been different. Jules [Kounde] is a magnificent player and I would say the same about Diego Carlos. I think he is one of the top five central defenders in Europe."" Newcastle have attempted to sign Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United for the rest of the season. United have insisted on a Â£12 million survival clause if Lingard helps them stay up.

Newcastle are second bottom of the Premier League and at real risk of relegation after picking up just one win from their 16 league games so far this season. Loadingâ¦ The Magpies have already conceded 34 goals, the most of any side in the division, and Howe will be keen to sign defensive reinforcements next month.

The report also claims Howe is looking to sign Lingard from United, either on loan or a permanent deal. Lingard revived his career during an impressive spell at West Ham last season, in which he scored nine goals in 16 games. However, the 28-year-old has found first-team opportunities hard to come by since returning to Old Trafford and is yet to start a Premier League game this season. West Ham are also interested in bringing Lingard back to the London Stadium on a permanent deal, as they continue their fight for a Champions League place. Last month, Howe admitted Newcastle may struggle to attract signings given their league position. Responding to talkSPORT pundit Gabby Agbonlahorâs claim that âplayers donât want to live in Newcastleâ, Howe said: âIâve heard from everyone how nice the area is to live in. âWeâll have no problem attracting players to Newcastle for a whole host of reasons. I donât think thatâs going to be an issue. âWhat is an issue is our league position in attracting players in January. âItâs very difficult to make any promises in the sense that we will definitely spend money and sign players. âYou have to attract players, they have to want to come and they have to be the right players to improve the squad. âThat is why January is an incredibly difficult window to recruit players in, especially when your league position is difficult.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Footmercato reports that the Brazil international turned down an 'astronomical salary' offer from Newcastle, who were willing to pay the midfielder an astonishing â¬850,000 per month, which works out at more than â¬10m per year. But PaquetÃ¡ does not appear to be motivated by the huge financial incentive of a move to Tyneside, and is happy at Lyon. He would reportedly only consider a move to a higher-profile club than Lyon in Europe, which seems to rule out the Magpies. PaquetÃ¡ has been in fine form for 'Les Gones' this season, after scoring seven goals and registering four assists in 21 appearances across all competitions. Newcastle have been linked with numerous players since their controversial takeover by a Saudi-led PIF back in October. The club is expected to splash the cash in January in a bid to move out of the bottom three, after collecting just 10 points from 17 games so far. They sit 19th in the table and have the daunting prospect of a visit from the reigning champions, Manchester City, on Sunday. As for Lyon, they are next due to face Metz in Ligue 1 on Wednesday night, and currently sit 13th in the table with 25 points from 17 games. Their most recent match away at Paris FC in the French Cup was suspended at half-time on Friday, due to crowd trouble. ",positive,liverpool,0

His wife, his kids and his ex-teammates including Gerard Pique, as well as past legends, gave him a touching send off. On leaving Barca, he said: ""The renewal?

After leaving Barcelona following La Liga's refusal to accept a new five-year contract he had agreed with the club, Messi now looks poised to embark on a new challenge in Paris. Lionel Messi has chosen to join PSG - the club is looking to wrap up the signing over the weekend, and is set to meet with Jorge Messi in the next few hours. (@mohamedbouhafsi) And though he had accepted a significant pay reduction at Barca, L'Equipe say the six-time Ballon d'Or winner will be earning a massive salary at the Parc Des Princes. Loadingâ¦ It's said that Messi is being offered an initial two-year contract with the option for a further year. If the figures are indeed correct, the 34-year-old will be taking home a mindblowing â¬769,000-a-week and could potentially rake in â¬120 million overall - and that's not even factoring in performance-related bonuses or a signing-on fee. It had been reported by RMC that Neymar, Messi's former Barca teammate, had offered to give his close friend the No.10 shirt upon his arrival at the club. However, Messi is believed to have turned down the gesture from the Brazilian and the latest update is that he could instead take the No.19 in the French capital. 19 has been worn by the Argentine for his country in his early days, while it was also Messi's second official shirt number at Barca before he inherited the No.10 when Ronaldinho departed. The lucrative capture of Messi would complete a slew of sensational incomings for PSG, who also drafted in Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Gini Wijnaldum on free transfers as well as the Â£54 million addition of Achraf Hakimi.

Loadingâ¦ The world was shocked on Thursday night when it was announced by Barcelona that Messi would no longer be signing a new deal, due to financial restraints. The news has left fans and players of the Catalan giants on their knees, literally in some cases, and the emotional tributes have poured in. Messi's teammate Gerard Pique is one of his former teammates to have sent an emotional message, and now Barca manager Ronald Koeman has followed suit, posting on Instagram. ""Still hard to understand that you will not play for Barcelona anymore,"" the Dutchman said. ""Thanks for everything you have done for our club. ""I really enjoyed the full season we worked together. I am impressed with your work ethic and desire to win. It makes you the best player in the world. ""For now, I wish you and your family the best!"" A post shared by Ronald Koeman (@ronaldkoeman) The news of Messi leaving will hugely impact Koeman's plans for next season, as he attempts to win back La Liga from Atletico Madrid. There could be a double blow for the manager though, as Sergio Aguero reportedly now wants to follow his fellow Argentina forward out of the club. Aguero only joined the club this summer, after his Manchester City contract expired, but it's been said that he is unhappy because he was sold on the idea of playing alongside his friend. The six time Ballon d'Or winner looks set to move to PSG, with the Ligue 1 giants said to be on the verge of having potentially the greatest transfer window ever!

The football world is still getting over Thursday night's news that Messi is no longer going to be a Barcelona player, with the 34-year-old expected to be heading to PSG. Loadingâ¦ Tributes to the six time Ballon d'Or winner, who took the famous club to incredible heights, have been pouring in from his ex teammates. Gerard Pique led the tributes, with Barca boss Ronald Koeman following as well, but one player used his tribute to also hint at problems between him and the forward. Posting on Instagram, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen said, ""Leo, it's been a pleasure to play alongside you for all these years, sharing many happy times together in the form of moments and titles. ""While we didn't always agree on everything, we both wanted what was best for the team and managed to grow as individuals, regardless of the result. Thanks for that! ""You made history with the club of your life, and you'll go down in history as a true legend of football. Something that no other player will ever get close to. You changed football. ""I wish you and your family the very best for whatever lies ahead. ""A big hug from Dani and Ben, too."" A post shared by Marc ter Stegen (@mterstegen1) Reports suggested that issues between the German keeper and Messi started as early as November 2019, with Ter Stegen annoyed at the forward and striker partner Luis Suarez for their lack of tracking back, during a game with Slavia Prague. The pair clashed in training not long after and even had to be separated by fellow teammates, after a gesture from the Argentina forward. According to Diario Gol at the beginning of this year, the Catalan giants' number one then became annoyed at his teammate for his votes in the FIFA Best awards voting. Messi voted for Keylor Navas, Manuel Neuer and Jan Oblak as his Goalkeepers of the Year, ahead of his club teammate.

Barca's greatest ever player almost left the club last summer and the Catalan giants want to avoid similar drama by re-signing Messi - but at the same time, Barcelona have an eye-watering debt said to be around â¬1 billion to consider. So their solution, as reported by Deportes Cuatro, is to sign the 33-year-old to a 10-year deal that will take him beyond his playing days. The theory is that Messi receives long-term financial security to make up for the pay cut, while Barcelona ensure that the Argentine sees out his playing career at the club and can then transition into another role, either an ambassador or a club executive. There are less than nine weeks of Messi's current contract at the Camp Nou left, so the club risk losing their iconic No 10 if a deal isn't signed soon. However if the details of Messi's salary leaked by L'Equipe earlier this year are to be believed, he is currently paid a weekly wage of Â£2.1 million. That works out at an astonishing Â£108.2 million per year. So it's understandable that Barcelona want to halve that salary without giving Messi license to walk away - and one of the elements of the deal is that, while Messi would stay at the Liga club in the short term, he would be allowed a season in the MLS at the end of his career if he wished. According to the Times, the new contract is on the table following extensive talks between club president Joan Laporta and Messi's father. The report adds that Messi is desperate to win a Champions League title one more time and that the pay cut is more appealing if it helps the club land another star name that could help Barcelona achieve this. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and clubs in the US have all been linked with signing Messi. But if Laporta gets his way, Barcelona's record goalscorer will be signed to the club until 2031 at least. All imagery: PA Images ",positive,liverpool,0

That's according to club president Joan Laporta, who covered a range of different topics regarding the six-time Ballon d'Or winner during a fascinating 90-minute press conference on Friday morning. In the press conference, he spoke about how Barcelona's current financial situation is worse than expected. In fact, they are set to lose â¬400m this year alone. Laporta started things off with a comment about financial fair play and the club's heavy losses of late. ""First I would l like that the inheritance that we have received is awful, dreadful,"" he said. ""The salary mass is 110 per cent of the income of the club, we don't have any margin in terms of salary. ""The rules and regulations of the Spanish LaLiga is regulated by a financial fair play. We don't have any margin. ""We knew that when we got to the club. But I have to say when we got to the club, after the first conclusions of the audit and our analysis, those numbers are a lot worse than the numbers were first exposed to us initially. It means the losses are more elevated than we had expected."" One thing that was made abundantly clear during Laporta's press conference is that the club must come first above all else - even a player with Messi's stature. ""I can't make a decision that will affect the club for 50 years,"" he said. ""The club is over 100 years old and it's above everyone and everything, even above the best player of the world. We will always thank him for everything he's done for us. ""In order to have fair play, we need to do this or make an effort which would put the club at risk. We couldn't keep going with this and we needed to make a decision, which we have."" The Catalan club can now register new signings after allowing Messi to leave but ultimately, neither the club or player are happy about how the situation played out. ""Leo wanted to stay, so he's not happy. We all wanted him to stay. For him, he has to confront reality. It's a reality that can't be changed and he knows I wish him the best wherever he goes."" The Barcelona president, who thought La Liga would be more flexible with fair play, also confirmed the details behind their contract offer to Messi. ""Messi tried to make it easy for us in negotiations,"" Laporta said. ""The first offer was two years of salary to be paid in five years. When we thought that was allowed in the regulations of fair play, the criteria of cash came into play and it's not allowed here but it is in other countries. It's all part of the process. ""We were all thinking for two years but if he wanted more, we could negotiate. But two years at Barca is what we all wanted. We wanted the post-Messi era to start in two years. We had to bring that forward."" Messi has already been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain in recent hours. In fact, contact has already been made by the French club, according to Fabrizio Romano. Laporta confirmed the 34-year-old has other offers on the table before suggesting their actions are ""in the best in the interests"" of the club. ""Messi's camp have done everything that they can do and more than that. It's not about that. I can't create false expectation. I don't think they are real. They have other offers, he proved to us he wanted to say. He wanted to stay even if our offer was inferior to what they had. ""You would have to ask Leo Messi about that and his agents. I can't put words in Leo's mouth. He's the best player in the world and logic says he has offers from the top clubs. We went further than we could to try and attract the player and he accepted it. But we would not register him due to the salary limits. ""We have to abide by the rules. We want them to be flexible but that's not an excuse. We knew the rules and regulations, we could not abide by it because of the previous board of directors. ""Leo deserves everything. He proves he love Barca. He has his roots at Barcelona and if he would allow me a personal thought, I'm sad. But I am convinced we have done the best in the interests of Barcelona."" He continued to shower praise on the Barca legend, saying: ""Leo's legacy is excellent. Leo has made history. He is the player with the most success in the history of the club. He's been there during an era which has been splendid, the best era in Barca's history up until today. ""I hope we can overcome this situation. A new era starts now. There is a before and after Leo as there was with other greats in the history of Barca. I was there for Johan Cruyff and Messi goes along those lines."" thou ",positive,liverpool,0

Why does it look like Messi was asking for that guy's shirt? ðpic.twitter.com/pwIF3J8fuw Would cry if Messi ask for my shirt tbh, tears of fckin joyðð¿ð¹ Sacko: âBe cool, be cool, be cool.â https://t.co/HZcmOPesyA The guys is like, âhey, sure.âIâd die. https://t.co/HTGCALi8cl Looks like he askedâ¦the guy wasnât even over excited about itâ¦that makes me think the guy didnât even ask for it in the first place https://t.co/E9suCzPmix But thatâs it...thatâs what happened https://t.co/5yt5B2eKHI As well as only usually swapping with Zidane, the seven time Ballon d'Or winner has one other rule when it comes to swaps, and that's to make sure it's with a fellow countryman. ""If there is an Argentine I swap with him, but unless someone asks me, I'm not asking anyone,"" he said when talking about the time the former Real Madrid midfielder got his jersey. However because so many people ask him, and he's usually more than willing to swap, the 34-year-old actually has a very impressive shirt collection. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) There is one other player who claims to have been on the receiving end of a request from the former Barcelona star to swap shirts at the end of a game. Chelsea's Antonio Rudiger once told the story that Cesc Fabregas went up to the centre back to tell him Messi wanted the German's shirt. As well as his own number 10, the Argentina star also handed over some other pieces of memorabilia, according to the centre back. ""When I came back and opened the bag, there was [not just] Messi's shirt, but also those of Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, Dani Alves, [Gerard] Pique and [Carles] Puyol,"" the Chelsea player revealed. ""I will never forget that gesture. It's time to add Sacko to a very exclusive list. ",positive,liverpool,0

After flying into Paris for a medical and the signing of his contract on Tuesday, Messi was officially unveiled as a Paris Saint-Germain player in front of the world's media on Wednesday. He has signed a two-year contract with the option of a third and is in reported to be earning a whopping â¬35 million-a-year after tax. And though he has ended 21 glittering years of association with Barca, following La Liga's refusal to register his contract due to the club's financial difficulties, the Blaugrana still owe their all-time top scorer â¬39 million. As per El Mundo, via Colin Millars, Messi's mindblowing last contract at Barca included a â¬72 million bonus to mark his unparalleled contributions to the club. Barcelona have to pay Lionel Messi a 'loyalty bonus' of â¬39million, even though he has left the club. That is according to El Mundo - who released the full details of Messi's contract at the Camp Nou (from January -https://t.co/ytNLoj6qdR) This sounds like a totally fake story but was part of the leaked Messi contract. And Barcelona's general financial mismanagement has been so astonishingly inept, nothing should really be surprising anymore. pic.twitter.com/UgwtFz9irp Former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who Messi did not have a productive relationship with, arranged for it to be paid in two different instalments. The first sum was due in June 2020, with the second following a year later. Loadingâ¦ Yet the club's shocking predicament, which includes a debt of more than Â£1.1 billion and the inability to register their four new signings, meant Messi had only received â¬8.5m by February 2021. Clearly Barca are in no position to hand over â¬39 million to Messi, who had accepted a 50 per cent pay cut on a new contract that still didn't meet La Liga's financial regulations. Neymar also found himself in the same situation when he left for PSG in 2017. He claimed he did not receive a hefty loyalty bonus that was part of his deal at the Nou Camp and the matter ended up going to court before an agreement was reached. Given his love for Barcelona and his desire to return in another capacity, it's unlikely Messi will go down the same route. ",positive,liverpool,0

Many thought it was a bold call from manager Mauricio Pochettino but fans have spotted the exact moment a decision will have been made. Lille midfielder Xeka was down receiving treatment and Messi had a feel of his hamstring before bending over. Jonathan David had a word with the 34-year-old who appeared to gesture he was fine. Many think it was a mistake to start him and potentially risk him for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Club Brugge.

Loadingâ¦ Neymar's Â£198 million move from Barcelona to PSG certainly caused a huge shock in football, back in 2017, absolutely obliterating the previous record for a transfer fee, by over Â£100 million. It showed that the Qatar owned club really meant business when it came to wanting to win the Champions League and catapult themselves into Europe's elite tier of clubs. However, it's not really worked out quite as well as anyone would have wanted and Wednesday night saw their latest attempt to get knocked out of the competition, managing to throw away a two goal lead despite only half an hour of the second leg remaining. Whilst Mauricio Pochettino is likely to lose his job over the failure, either soon or at the end of the season, it seems that the owners also want to change the playing squad. According to journalist Romain Molina, via Get French Football News, the owners 'want rid' of Neymar, which is far more damning than just wanting to sell. It suggests a complete overhaul of their thinking, considering he was previously thought of as the man, along with Kylian Mbappe, to bring European success to the club. The timing of the news is particularly interesting with Mbappe expected to join Real Madrid at the end of the season, with his contract expiring. Reports have claimed the Ligue 1 leaders have offered the World Cup winning forward a huge amount to stay but he is yet to sign a new deal. Getting rid of Neymar at the same time would surely result in a huge overhaul of the team, especially with Pochettino expected to leave. It is highly unlikely that the Parisians could get their money back for the former Santos star, seeing as they're the only team who could afford such a fee, especially in a post Covid world. The forward signed a new deal at the Parc des Princes last year, keeping him there till 2025, which is reportedly worth Â£554,000-per-week, which would be another sticking point in moving him on. He has had numerous medium term injuries whilst playing in the French capital, and has often missed key games in Europe during that time. The 30-year-old has still scored 91 goals in 135 appearances, a better rate than he did for Barcelona, but he hasn't been able to turn PSG into European champions. PSG have also since signed Mbappe, who followed that same summer incredibly, and this year they added his friend Lionel Messi, although things haven't really gone well for the seven time Ballon d'Or winner either. The team's latest elimination from the Champions League came at the hands of Real, with club officials so annoyed at the awarding of the Spanish side's first goal that the club president stormed the referees room. Reports claimed that Gianluigi Donnarumma's mistake in the build up to the goal caused an argument between the goalkeeper and Neymar, but the Brazilian denied it was the case. ",positive,liverpool,0

The link with Beko, whose name is emblazoned on training kits, is also up at the end of the season. Loadingâ¦ But it's widely reported that Barca have agreed a â¬280 million with music streaming giants Spotify.

However, according to SPORT, the partnership promised to be even more lucrative at first. In talks with Barca, Spotify were keen to know about Barca's fanbase and particularly ""registered"" supporters who had consented to personal information being used. But of the 350 million fans around the world, just 1 per cent had agreed for the club to access their name, phone number and email. The report states this discovery had an impact on the deal. Had it been higher, Barca would have been able to negotiate even better terms with Spotify. Barca went without an official shirt sponsor for a long time before striking a partnership with the charity 'UNICEF' in 2006. They have since been sponsored by Qatar Airways and later Rakuten. As well as the shirt deal, Barca and Spotify are also reportedly still negotiating a potential rebranding of the Nou Camp stadium. Barcelona are said to be ready to sell the naming rights to their iconic home ground. Spotify's preference is to have the title rights for a ârelatively short period of timeâ - though the Catalan outfit are prepared to budge their usual commercial terms. Speaking about linking up with Spotify last month, Barca president Joan Laporta said: ""Everything is going quite well and the agreement will be announced when we sign the contract with Spotify, yes, we will have to approve the agreement in an extraordinary assembly of delegates. âWe think it is the best option, it links us to music, hopefully it will come out as soon as possible.â ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ The 24-year-old is reportedly considering his future at Old Trafford after starting this month's 4-1 defeat to Manchester City on the bench. According to the Manchester Evening News, sources close to Rashford have claimed his phone 'hasn't stopped ringing'since the rumours emerged. It's believed Rashford doesn't want to leave his boyhood club and it could be a way to secure a new long-term contract. The England international's deal runs until 2023, but United have the option to extend it by an extra year. Rashford has featured 26 times in all competitions this season but only managed five goals. Barcelona would like to add Rashford to their rejuvenated front line and make him a key player. The Catalan giants signed Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on permanent transfers in January while Adama Traore is on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Dembele is out of contract this summer and Luuk de Jong will be returning to Sevilla. There are question marks over the future of Memphis Depay too, despite the former United man only arriving last summer. Rashford also has admirers at Liverpool but it's unlikely he'd be allowed to join United's bitter rivals. No player has moved between United and Liverpool since 1964. Anthony Elanga's emergence and Jadon Sancho's summer arrival has seen Rashford drop to the bench in recent weeks. Elanga and Sancho started Tuesday's Champions League elimination at the hands of Atletico Madrid, with Rashford coming on in the second half. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick said last week he's happy for Rashford to leave if he's unhappy, but had no indication he was. ""I donât think this is an issue and he never said anything about that since we spoke yesterday [last Thursday],"" Rangnick said per the Guardian. ""But the [transfer] window is closed now. Even suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer. Now the window is closed. ""I spoke with him yesterday and the day before so I donât know anything about him being unhappy.

Loadingâ¦ When Neymar moved from Barcelona to PSG in 2017 the transfer smashed the world record for the most expensive player of all time, coming in at 220 million euros, with the previous record set at â¬105 million. It's no surprise that the Brazilian is one of the best paid players in the world and, after this summer's transfers, he is now second behind only new PSG teammate Lionel Messi, according to some reports. It's believed that the 29-year-old earns around Â£600,000-a-week, which is just his basic wages for a week's work and doesn't include bonuses, and he definitely gets those. According to El Mundo, who have been leaking the forward's contract, Neymar picks up 541,680 euros gross every month in an 'ethical bonus.' The former Barca man picks up his half a million euros for being being ""courteous, punctual, friendly and available to fans"" and not publicly critical of PSG. That means the Ligue 1 club hand over around â¬6.5 million every year just for Neymar turning up and ""greeting and thanking the fans before and after each game."" Once the match has finished, he's thanked the fans, and headed home, the player then can't take to Twitter to say that Mauricio Pochettino didn't play the right tactics and has to refrain from ""negative public comments about the club, those who work there and those who support it."" I think most people could get behind being nice and not criticising the company they work for if they got 5/6ths of their weekly wage at the end of every month. The Spanish newspaper have claimed that to date, Neymar has cost the Parisiens â¬489,228,117, which is well more than double his transfer fee. On Sunday night, the Brazil forward was part of the farcical scenes that saw the national team's game with Argentina suspended after seven minutes. In the most incredible episode, health officials and police came onto the pitch to stop the game, after Argentina's Premier League players didn't follow Covid protocols in the country.

BarÃ§a's all-time record goalscorer is keen on a reunion with his beloved club as soon as possible, and could return to Spain once his Paris Saint Germain contract ends in June 2023. ""What is almost confirmed is that we are going to live in Barcelona again and that our life will be there,"" the 34-year-old told Spanish outlet Sport in quotes published by reuters.com. ""It's what my wife wants and what I want. I don't know when my contract with PSG ends but we'll go back to Barcelona to live. ""I always said that I would love to be able to help the club. I would love to be a technical director at some point. I don't know if it will be at Barcelona or not. ""If there is a possibility, I would like to contribute again because it's the club that I love and I would love for it to continue doing well, to continue growing and to continue being one of the best in the world."" Messi left the Camp Nou in August after two decades at the club and joined PSG on a free transfer - one of the biggest shocks of the summer window. He has made a slow start to life at the Parc des Princes by his own exceptionally high standards, and is yet to score his first Ligue 1 goal for the club. The Argentine has had more success in the Champions League though after scoring twice in the 3-2 win against RB Leipzig and once in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City. Messi limped off the pitch in PSG's 2-1 win over reigning champions Lille on Friday, but boss Mauricio Pochettino hopes to have him available for their Champions League clash away in Leipzig on Wednesday.

Messi, who held an emotional farewell at Barcelona on Sunday  after 21 stunning years of service, completed a medical and signed a two-year contract with the option of a third. The 34-year-old will earn a whopping â¬35 million-a-year after tax - â¬2.91 million a month and â¬729,000-per-week - and takes the No.30 shirt at PSG.

Conversely, to the forward's many critics, it's the first sign that his once-mighty powers might be on the wane. According to former PSG and Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka, Messi's current form is an indication that he is not as ""extraordinary"" as he once was for Barcelona and Argentina. The 34-year-old is yet to score for Mauricio Pochettino's side in Ligue 1, although he has impressed in the Champions League, bagging goals against Manchester City and RB Leipzig at home. Speaking to RNC, via the Daily Mail, Anelka had some rather harsh words for Messi, who left Barcelona this summer to link up with the likes of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. ""Today we demand from Neymar, but we can do the same with Messi. Since the beginning of the season it is not extraordinary either. There is a player who has six Ballon d'Ors and finally is not so extraordinary,"" Anelka suggested. Anelka started his professional career at PSG, coming through the club's academy system before turbulent spells at Arsenal and Real Madrid. He ended up heading back to Paris in 2000, going on to bag 10 goals in 39 appearances during his second spell at Parc des Princes. The Frenchman also spoke on Neymar's underwhelming form this season, as the Brazilian superstar has scored just once in all competitions. ""He [Neymar] is going through a difficult moment. If the coach thinks he has to play to regain his level, he makes him play. Putting it aside or replacing it to break their morale is not going to fix things,"" Anelka observes. ""In addition, he has a great salary, he is a star of French and world football. He is one of the best players in the league - although right now he is failing to show it."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Footage shows the former Barcelona man ignoring his manager's outstretched hand as he trudges off the pitch. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner was close to opening his account for his new employers on several occasions throughout the match. In the first half, he was denied after a brilliant break by Neymar and also hit the woodwork from a trademark, beautiful freekick.

The Argentine was dismissed by the Premier League club in November 2019 after five years in charge. Pochettino, sacked by Spurs after a dramatic dip in form following a Champions League final defeat against Liverpool, was then appointed manager of Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain in January this year. Despite winning the TrophÃ©e des Champions in January, the French side have fallen below expectations this season, failing to win the Ligue 1 title at the final hurdle after getting knocked out at the semi-final stages of the Champions League.

They go on to report that the Argentine would 'love' a second chance at his former club, while adding that chairman Daniel Levy is 'considering' trying to persuade the former Tottenham manager to leave the French club.

His teammates' emotional reaction told you just how vital this worldie was, as the Lens keeper didn't even move. Lille went into Friday night's tricky away game at Lens just one point ahead of Paris Saint-Germain and knowing they couldn't afford to slip up. So the response to Yilmaz giving them a two-goal cushion - by picking up the ball miles out from goal, turning and firing it into the top corner - was understandable. His strike partner Jonathan David clasped both hands to his head in total disbelief as Yilmaz wheeled away in celebration after his 15th - and surely greatest - league goal of the season. By the team the veteran Turkish striker had slid along the pitch in celebration, pretty much the whole Lille team had arrived to join in a prolonged celebration with Yilmaz.

What a strike. Worthy of a title winning goal. Burak Yilmaz is the most underrated striker in Europe in the last decade Going into it, the fixture was widely seen as the hardest of Lille's three remaining Ligue 1 games this season. So to go 2-0 up inside the first half - Yilmaz already having given them the lead with a penalty - it must have felt like the title was in touching distance (especially with Lens down to 10 men after Clement Michelin's red card). Mauricio Pochetto's PSG have to hope that Lille slip up to have any chance of winning the league title in France, but Yilmaz's strike could just be the moment Ligue 1 slipped away from them. As for the 35-year-old striker himself: what a special goal in a crucial match. We'd hate to imagine how hard he can hit them with his right boot.

Neymar has been linked with a move back to Spain pretty much constantly since moving from La Liga in 2017 but it looks like he is set to stay in the French capital. Talking after Mauricio Pochettino's side secured their place in the semi finals, the 29-year-old was discussing his future, saying, ""I don't think this is even a topic any more; I obviously feel very comfortable, at home at PSG. I feel happier than before."" Whilst Neymar looks likely to sign a new contract, before his current deal expires, the same can't be said of Mbappe. The 22-year-old's deal also only has 15 months to run but he has reportedly told the club he wants to join Real Madrid, and now it could be a case of whether they're willing to see him walk away for nothing next year.

The French champions reached their first Champions League final and were finally hoping to capture silverware in Europe's top-tier club competition. Loadingâ¦ But Thomas Tuchel's men were unable to mount a successful comeback in Lisbon after Bayern broke the deadlock in the second half. Bayern took the lead in the 59th minute as Joshua Kimmich delivered an inch-perfect ball into the box. And an unmarked Kingsley Coman lined up the perfect header to bury the ball past Keylor Navas into the corner of the net. Both sides had clear opportunities to open the scoring in an end-to-end first half at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon. Kylian Mbappe slipped the ball through to Neymar, who darted into the box and saw his shot superbly denied by Manuel Neuer. Only minutes later the in-form Robert Lewandowski received the ball inside the box, spun on the spot and fired off a shot. The 32-year-old Polish striker's shot beat Navas, only to see his effort come bouncing off the post. However, Mbappe missed a brilliant opportunity to put his side ahead going into half-time. PSG capitalised on a howler from the Bayern defence as the 21-year-old French forward slipped the ball into Ander Herrera and received it back immediately. Mbappe only had Neuer to beat at close range, but the PSG superstar shockingly fired his shot straight into the Bayern 'keeper's arms. Bayern now add the Champions League trophy to their German Cup and Bundesliga triumphs this season. ",positive,liverpool,0

And because Neymar was out through injury, the No.10 was free and available for Messi to wear for a one-off. In old-school fashion, no names were on the back of the shirts for the players during the clash at the Parc des Princes. The round of 16 tie was a stalemate after extra time and went all the way to penalties, where Nice won 6-5. Messi took PSG's first spot-kick and found the net but opposite goalkeeper Marcin Bulka, who is on loan from the Ligue One leaders, saved penalties from Leandro Paredes and Xavi Simons. Former Bayern Munich defender Dante dinked his penalty down the middle in the highlight of the penalties, which led to Messi's first ever shoot-out defeat at club level. PSG's Angel Di Maria wasn't available for Mauricio Pochettino's side as he was with the Argentina national team.

Loadingâ¦ Hakimi was one of many marquee signings to join Mauricio Pochettino's side in the summer, including Sergio Ramos,Lionel Messi, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Gini Wijnaldum, Nuno Mendes and Danilo Pereira. The French outfit were instilled as one of the favourites for the Champions League but crashed out at the round of 16 following a disappointing 3-2 aggregate defeat to a Karim Benzema-inspired Real Madrid. Hakimi has played 32 times in all competitions, scoring three times and assisting four. And according to RMC, journalist Daniel Riolo, he's already fed up with life in Paris and wants out. Riolo claims the 23-year-old is ""angry"" with how things have panned out, adding that the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar do not communicate with him. ""Hakimi is going crazy, the South Americans don't talk to him anymore,"" Riolo said on the After Foot show. ""He already wants to leave Paris, he is fed up. In this team his qualities have never exploded, so maybe you have to give him up.

Before he departed City though, Aguero bought members of staff either Hublot or Tag Heuer watches, engraved with the classy message of 'Gracias - Kun Aguero!,' as per The Athletic. The prices of the Tag Heuer are between Â£1000 and Â£1650, with the Hublots costing around Â£8000, with Aguero buying around 60 of them for first-team staff. He then entered everyone into a raffle to win his recently purchased Range Rover Evoque - which was won by an incredibly grateful kitman.

Loadingâ¦ Aubameyang made a dream move to La Liga at the beginning of this month, having been released by Arsenal on transfer deadline day, although his previous dream had been for Real Madrid rather than Barcelona. The forward spent four years in the Premier League, having previously spent five season in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund. He has come up against some of the best players in the world, also playing in the Champions League with Dortmund, but most won't be expecting who he's named as his toughest opponent. Asked the question by Mundo Deportivo, in some quick fire questions, the 32-year-old said, ""Toughest opponent I've faced? Tyrone Mings."" The answer will come as a surprise to many, especially considering the Gabon striker has faced the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Vincent Kompany and Mats Hummels. Mings has been solid for both Aston Villa and Bournemouth, earning the 28-year-old 16 caps for England, including playing during the run to the final of the Euros last summer. However he has often come in for criticism for his defending and the fact that he does have a big mistake hiding in his locker occasionally. Aubameyang hit the ground running for Xavi's team at the weekend as he bagged a slightly unconventional hat-trick in the 4-1 win over Valencia. Whilst the former Arsenal man's first two goals were perfectly normal goals, his third one was rather fortunate, as Pedri's strike hit his teammate on the back and fired past the goalkeeper. It was a much needed win for the Catalan giants as it put them in a good position to finish in the top four and secure a Champions League place. They now lead Atletico Madrid on goal difference but have a game in hand over Diego Simeone's side, after their loss to Levante last week. Now he's at the Nou Camp, Aubameyang has been reunited with Ousmane Dembele, who he played with at Dortmund. The France forward is expected to leave in the summer, when his contract expires. The former St Etienne forward revealed he wants the former Rennes man to stay, ""Ousmane is one of the best on the ball and as a striker he is incredible.To tell the truth, I am very happy that he is here and when I arrived I told him, 'You have to stay, man.'| ",positive,liverpool,0

Barca, meanwhile, are targeting reinforcements up front after Lionel Messi's exit and they are hopeful of signing one of the Arsenal forwards if, of course, they can strike a bargain deal.

Neither Aubameyang or Lacazette was involved in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to newly-promoted Brentford on Friday night, with Arteta saying they were ""unwell"" in an update before the game. ""They feel unwell, thatâs all I can say,"" Arteta said of the two strikers. ""It is [a big miss] but in the world that weâre living in, I think the only permanent thing right now are changes. ""So instead of looking for excuses, you have to seek for solutions and thatâs what we try to do every day.""

Of course, the Brazilian left Paris for London, penning a one-year deal at Stamford Bridge - with an option for a second. The Blues announced the extension of Silva's contract earlier this summer. On PSG signing Ramos, Silva told ESPN Brazil: ""I have nothing against Sergio Ramos, but Sergio, at the time at which they offered him a two-year contract, was the same age as me last year. ""So that made me truly sad. I have not yet spoken about it with anyone, because it made me really sad because I felt like I had done nothing for the club. ""My departure is a page that has certainly been turned, but at the same time I think a lot, I reflect a lot on everything that has happened. ""I think that something else could have been done. ""Because it was not eight days, or eight months that I spent with PSG. It was eight years with lots of victories, lots of work to be able to change, and put PSG at the level that it is at today. ""I want PSG to win, because the club deserves all the respect. ""But, in light of the way that things played out, I have this feeling of sadness and I feel that it could have been done differently."" ",negative,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Messi's shock departure earlier in the summer opened up the number 10 shirt. Aguero, who joined the Spanish giants on a free transfer, was reportedly offered the legendary shirt number following Messi's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. But the former Manchester City star rejected the jersey due to his loyalties with Messi. ""Refusing to wear the number 10 shirt at Barcelona?"" He said. ""It wasn't that I didn't want to, but it was out of respect for Messi."" Philippe Coutinho was also briefly linked with the number 10 shirt, with attacking phenom Ansu Fati eventually receiving the famous kit.

With the club unable to register his new contract despite Messi agreeing to a 50 per cent pay cut, Barca's greatest ever player has ended a 21-year association with the Blaugrana and signed a two-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain. It's nigh on impossible for Barca to replace their all-time top scorer and so many were calling for his No.10 shirt, now vacant, to be retired. However, in a shock turn of events, former Liverpool star Coutinho could end up wearing the No.10 on his back this season. Despite Coutinho's career at the Nou Camp being underwhelming following his Â£142 million switch in January 2018, Mundo Deportivo say Ronald Koeman is still counting on him. Given its importance and the extra pressure it would be bring, the 29-year-old is said to be thinking about inheriting the No.10 from Messi, who took it on from the Ronaldinho 13 years ago. Loadingâ¦ Koeman will count on Coutinho for one last time this season. The club have offered him to take the #10.â @mundodeportivo pic.twitter.com/aR7G4xjCFZ He had been heavily linked with a move away from Barca but now looks to stay put and play a key role in the post-Messi era. Coutinho was given Johan Cruyff's No.14 upon joining Barca and reverted back to the number when Antoine Griezmann signed from Atletico Madrid and was named as the new No.7, which Coutinho wore in 2018/19. At both Liverpool and Bayern Munich, where he spent 2019/20 on loan and won the treble, Coutinho sported the No.10. His No.14 shirt was recently handed to Rey Manaj, who has been promoted to the first-team from the club's B-team. Coutinho is therefore without a shirt number and the No.10 is currently the only one available in the squad - except the No.25 reserved for goalkeepers according to La Liga rules.

Loadingâ¦ The Argentina international left Manchester City at the end of last season and signed for Barcelona as a free agent in July. But Beteve's 'La Porteria' programme believe the 33-year-old is desperate to escape the Camp Nou following Lionel Messi's shock exit. Aguero is close friends with the six-time Ballon d'Or winner and publicly spoke about playing with him at club level. La Porteria reports Aguero's 'future at Barca does not look good' after being promised Messi's new contract had been sorted. At his official unveiling Aguero said: ""Of course I hope to play with Lionel. I know him so well, we're good friends. ""What happens with Leo is a decision that he and the club will make. It is a pride to play with him. I've played with him in the national team."" Barcelona signed Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia this summer alongside Aguero but none of the trio are officially registered yet. Barcelona are unable to register any new players due to their inflated wage bill not fitting in La Liga rules. Messi became a free agent in July and agreed terms on a new contract, but has been denied signing it. The club said in a statement: ""Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles (Spanish Liga regulations). ""As a result of this situation, Messi shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona. Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled. ""FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life."" The Blaugrana have attempted to offload players this summer but it hasn't worked out. French giants Paris Saint-Germain are in pole position to sign Messi with Neymar, a former teammate of Messi's, playing a key role in convincing the forward. Barcelona finished third in La Liga last year, behind Real Madrid and title winners Atletico Madrid. ",positive,liverpool,0

Aguero signed for Barca on a free transfer following the expiration of his Manchester City contract. He had hoped to play with good friend Messi for the upcoming season, but that partnership has been nixed due to the club's dire financial situation. Messi appears to be on the verge of signing for Paris Saint-Germain, with the 34-year-old reportedly agreeing terms with the French giants. Barca have now been hit with another setback as Aguero has been ruled out of action for 10 weeks.

Loadingâ¦ Aguero has done pretty much everything there is to do in his 10 years in England, and looks set to leave the country as a five time Premier League champion at the end of this season, and continued to make history on Saturday. After first messing up a great chance to break the deadlock in City's game vs Chelsea, which ended up being an accidental assist for Raheem Sterling, the former Atletico Madrid striker took one of the worst penalties ever, The club's all time top scorer had the chance in injury time to make it 2-0 from the spot but chose to Panenka his attempt past Mendy. Aguero hit it with no pace or power and Mendy, who initially went to make a dive, just got to his feet and casually plucked the ball out of the air one handed, making Aguero's attempt one of the worst in history. Oh no, Sergio :joy:Aguero's Panenka penalty does not go to plan... :tv: Watch on Sky Sports PL:iphone: Follow #MCICHE here: https://t.co/S7lwC0ycHc:calling: Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/4zOLsnCK2A The 32-year-old hasn't played much this season, due to injury, Covid and form, but got the nod to start with Pep Guardiola potentially holding back his full hand before they face Chelsea in the Champions League final later this month. Guardiola set his team up in essentially a 3-3-4, with Aguero, Sterling, Ferland Torres and Gabriel Jesus all starting. Chelsea also made several changes from their Champions League semi final, against Real Madrid on Wednesday, with Billy Gilmour getting a rare start under Thomas Tuchel. Sterling was perhaps lucky not to be sent off in a relatively quiet opening 44 minutes of the first half, that suddenly came to life. Andreas Christensen attempted to get to the ball on the stretch but missed it under pressure from Jesus on the edge of the box. The Brazilian squared it for Aguero who seemed to have an easy chance at goal but his first choice took it away from him, Sterling ran in to grab the opening goal. Aguero didn't look too happy with his teammate but a minute later had a chance to make it 2-0 after Gilmour brought down Jesus in the box. Instead of smashing the ball home to equal Wayne Rooney's record of 183 goals scored for one Premier League club, the Argentina forward went for a Panenka, which failed in the most spectacular way possible.

Loadingâ¦ Qatar was not everyone's first choice to host the World Cup this year, apart from when it came to the people actually voting on it back in December 2010. There are many issues surrounding the hosting of the tournament in the middle east country, from the problems with human rights, homosexual relationships being illegal and even moving the tournament to the winter and still needing air conditioning. With just months left until it all begins, although it would be less if it was actually in the summer, work should be all be done on the eight stadiums. However a picture from journalist Tariq Panja has caused a stir on social media, as it shows how lifeless the surroundings outside one stadium currently is.

A report claimed that it could cost up to Â£9000-per-night for fans wanting to stay a hotel for the tournament, and flights could cost around Â£1063. Tickets to games do start as little as Â£52 for some Group Stage games, in category three tickets, category four are only available for Qatari residents, but go up to as much as Â£1224 for the final. Fans will also have to be wary about taking rainbow flags to the stadium, in support of LGBTQ+ rights, with homosexual relationships between men illegal in the country. Though fans have been welcomed, they've been told that flags could be taken off them to 'protect them' from attacks. Overall it's not feeling like a fully welcoming environment.

A new report published by human rights organisation Amnesty International, which was released just days after the World Cup draw in Doha, has claimed some security guards were subjected to conditions ""which amount to forced labour"". It comes after an investigation which documented the experiences of 34 employees from eight private security companies. The report claims that some security guards were forced to work more than the legal maximum of 60 hours each week, while some have described working for months or even years without a day off. Amnesty International says the workers were employed by private companies which provided services for sites including football stadiums as well as other infrastructure projects essential for the tournament, which begins on November 21. According to the BBC, at least three of the companies provided security for recent FIFA tournaments in Qatar, including the 2020 Club World Cup and the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup. Qatar World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), have acknowledged the failings in a statement, which read: âThree companies were found to be non-compliant across a number of areas. âThese violations were completely unacceptable and led to a range of measures being enforced, including placing contractors on a watch-list or black-list to avoid them working on future projects â including the FIFA World Cup â before reporting said contractors to the Ministry of Labor for further investigation and punitive action.â Qatarâs human rights record and its treatment of migrant workers have been criticised since the country was awarded the right to host the tournament back in 2010. According to The Guardian, more than 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since it was announced as the host nation, with 37 deaths directly linked to the construction of stadiums for the tournament. Male homosexuality is punishable by a prison sentence in Qatar, while same-sex marriages are not recognised by the government. Womenâs rights are also restricted due to male guardianship laws in the country. England manager Gareth Southgate has previously voiced his concerns over Qatarâs suitability to host the World Cup. The Three Lions held a meeting over the recent international break to discuss how the squad might express their concerns over human rights abuses in the country. But Southgate has seemingly ruled out England boycotting the tournament. ð£ ""Qatar is the safest country in the Middle East""Nasser Al Khater says fans will feel safe in Qatar as long as they respect norms and cultures - after Gareth Southgate suggested some of England's LGBTQ+ supporters would not travel for the World Cup.pic.twitter.com/sS6s14WH7Z ""I don't really know what that achieves.

City's record goalscorer is leaving the club this summer after 10 years - and next season's new Puma shirt (as leaked by Footy Headlines) contains a salute to the most celebrated of all of his goals. Placed on the inside back of the sky-blue jersey, reads the numbers: 93:20. That is the exact moment in stoppage time when Aguero scored against QPR to famously seal the Premier League for City in 2012, denying Manchester United the title in the last game of the season. On closer inspection, the '10' on the last two digits are transparent - a clear nod to Aguero's shirt number while at the club. The end of next season marks 10 years since that iconic ""Aguerooooo!"" moment, so it makes sense that this would be the perfect time to pay homage - especially with the Argentine striker due to bid farewell as a legend of the club. The new home shirt has a deep V-neck, white panels at the side and - despite the speculation that City's shirt sponsorship deal with Etihad might be coming to an end - the sponsor is present on the leaked images. The destination of the departing Aguero, who's scored 257 goals in 385 games for Man City, is still to be confirmed. The 32-year-old has been consistently linked with a move to Barcelona, as he is a close friend of international teammate Lionel Messi. Aguero has also been linked with a move within the Premier League, with Chelsea, Leeds United and a shock move to City rivals Manchester United all rumoured. However a move away from England's top flight seems to be the preferred option for the player. But no matter where Aguero ends up, it seems City will be playing with a little bit of 'Kun' magic on their shirts next season.

Messi had been the favourite going into the event and finished up with 613 points.

The Bayern Munich and Poland marksman has again banged in the goals in 2021, carrying on from a stellar 2020 where many felt he was the worthy winner after hitting 55 goals as Bayern Munich won a treble.

Luis Suarez Miramontes, who is regarded as one the all-time great Spanish players, played for Deportivo, Inter Milan and Barcelona during a trophy-laden 16-year career. He spent six years with the Catalan giants and during that spell, he became the first Spanish player to win the Ballon d'Or when he was awarded France Football's prestigious prize in 1960. It's fair to say Miramontes knows a thing or two about the game, so when discussing the 2021 Ballon d'Or event in an interview with Carrusel Deportivo earlier this month, he made a big pledge. The 86-year-old said: ""Give the Ballon d'Or to Lewandowski, damn it! Otherwise, I'll give him mine."" Lewandowski, who picked up the FIFA Men's Best Player Award before the Ballon d'Or was scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic, played a huge part in Bayern Munich's treble-winning triumph in 2020, scoring 56 goals in 50 games for club and country. In that season, he beat the likes of Timo Werner and Jadon Sancho in the scoring charts, and was named the Bundesliga's Player of the Season, with a total of 42.6 per centâ¨ of his fellow players labelling him the best in the league. Poland's record goalscorer has continued that ruthless streak in front of goal in 2021 but it still wasn't enough as Lionel Messi secured his seventh Ballon d'Or on Monday night. The Paris Saint-Germain forward paid tribute to Lewandowski during his speech. ""I'd like to mention Robert, it's been a real honour to compete with him,"" Messi said on stage. ""I think France Football should award you your 2020 Ballon d'Or, you deserved it."" After the ceremony, Lewandowski congratulated the Argentine for winning the award. Former Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Lothar MatthÃ¤us has since questioned the decision to award Messi with the Ballon d'Or.

Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas slammed the Ballon d'Or and German media branded Lewandowski's snub a 'scandal' in a scathing review. And the Poland star's colleagues are also finding it hard to understand the verdict of the 2021 Ballon d'Or results. Davies took to social media to vent his anger at Lewandowski not getting the recognition he deserves following an ultra-prolific year.

The PSG star won his seventh Ballon d'Or on Monday, extending his lead over Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo to 7-5. Messi won a first major honour for his nation in 2021, as Argentina saw off Brazil in the final of the Copa AmÃ©rica. He also left Barcelona for PSG. However, the most popular choice for the 2021 edition seemed to be Bayern Munich and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. He struck a ridiculous 41 goals in 29 Bundesliga games last year, and has 14 in 13 so far this term. As well as Lewandowski, Jorginho of Chelsea and Real Madrid's Karim Benzema were also believed to be in the reckoning. Messi ended up winning, sparking a debate about the Ballon d'Or's credibility. His father Jorge Messi is having nothing, and posted a photo of his son holding aloft the trophy on his Instagram. His caption was the most illuminating past of the post. It simply and sarcastically read: ""Bla bla bla... carry on."" He clearly didn't take too kindly to suggestions his son wasn't the rightful winner on this occasion. Another man who felt you cannot deny Messi his seventh Ballon d'Or was his former Barcelona maanger Pep Guardiola.

A fascinating Twitter thread has attempted to answer that question. De Bruyne outlined his quality with an impressive performance on Sunday as Manchester City drew 2-2 with title rivals Liverpool in the Premier League, with the Belgium international opening the scoring at the Etihad. It came just days after he scored the only goal in the first leg of Cityâs Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, with Pep Guardiolaâs side later progressing to the last four after grinding out a goalless draw in Spain on Tuesday night. Loadingâ¦ Football psychology researcher Geir Jordet studied De Bruyne throughout the first leg at the Etihad and has offered an explanation as to why the midfielder possesses such quality in midfield. Jordet, a professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, offered his findings in a Twitter thread, which has now gone viral. âKevin De Bruyne has an extraordinary awareness and ability to deliver decisive goals & assists,â wrote Jordet, who did his PhD on the role of vision, perception and anticipation in elite-level performance. According to Jordet, De Bruyne is able to gain an edge over his opponents by continually scanning play at a higher rate than the average midfielder. De Bruyne scans the pitch prior to receiving the ball with a rate of 0.45 scans/second, thus 4-5 scans every 10 seconds. This is high for a player in his role. He constantly exposes his eyes to surrounding information and becomes aware of opportunities & threats early. 2/10 pic.twitter.com/j2FxEFDwKQ âDe Bruyne scans the pitch prior to receiving the ball with a rate of 0.45 scans/second, thus 4-5 scans every 10 seconds.

This is not the case with De Bruyne who maintains his scan rate even when opponents are close. Makes him effective in those crowded areas where assists & goals are created.â Jordet added: âDe Bruyneâs scan timing is flawless. He takes his eyes off the ball when nothing new happens with it. Every time someone touches the ball, and it is important to quickly spot new ball direction or pace, he looks at the ball.â De Bruyne also varies the length of time he looks away from ball depending on the situation in play, and is even able to disguise his scanning from opposition players.

""This is such an embarrassing story that I hesitate to tell it! But since I promised you honesty, then I guess I have to. And it's pretty funny, anyway. ""It started with a tweet. I only had a few thousand followers at the time, because I was still on loan at Werder Bremen. So I tweeted something about a match or whatever, and this pretty girl favourited it. ""I was single at the time, and my friend noticed it. So he said, 'She looks like a nice girl, no? You should send her a message.' ""And I literally said to him, 'No, no, no. Come on. People don't like me. They don't get me. She won't respond.' ""So he grabbed my phone and started tapping out a message. He showed me the phone and said, 'Come on, can I hit send?' ""But thankfully, he sent the message for me, and she responded. We got to know each other over text for a few months. It's a lot easier for me once I get to know someone, so after that, I was good.

Loadingâ¦ FIFA 22 comes out on October 1st and we're being drip fed some of the new ratings for this season's edition of the game, with fans already baffled by some ratings, like a 38-year-old defender being quicker than Virgil van Dijk. Players don't always like their specific ratings either and we'll often find out about them on social media, something Walker almost certainly would have done, had he not found out he was being pranked. City showed De Bruyne and Foden a fake card of their teammate, in which his pace was only 78, and they weren't all too happy with that rating. After finding out it was a fake they knew they had to persuade the right back that it was actually real and they pulled it off perfectly. Note to self: do NOT joke about @kylewalker2's pace ðð· #ManCity | https://t.co/axa0klD5re pic.twitter.com/p26s2jmTqH De Bruyne managed to get several of the cards spread around the changing room, so his teammate wouldn't get suspicious that he was being targeted, and everyone played it so well. Jack Grealish poking Walker by saying ""It's muggy that, 78 pace?!"" before Foden rubs it in even more by saying """"I'm faster than you Walks!"" The England full back got so annoyed at his pace that he even binned the card off, literally, and was ready to march out of the changing room, after claiming ""Someone is bantering."" He then spots that he's being filmed and realises that it's all a joke, though his sarcastic laughter suggests he didn't take it all too well. Had Walker not had it revealed that it was a prank before leaving the changing room he'd have almost certainly been straight on his phone to complain, but he wouldn't have been the first player to do so. Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger is actually unhappy with his pace rating, after finding out that he's only been given 75 out of 100 on the game. The Blues centre back took to social media to make his complaint, asking how quick he needed to run in order to get it closer to 90. He won't be the last player to complain about his rating, that's for sure! ",positive,liverpool,0

The former Manchester City full back's personality is so infectious that even Keane can't help but drop his often dour persona from time to time. However there is still a very serious side to punditry in this country, especially when it comes to the Champions League, and fans were jealous of the US' coverage. On Tuesday, Abdo presented a segment with here three esteemed pundits in which they answered fairly quick fire questions about football - from who their toughest opponent was to whether Arsenal will qualify for Europe next season or not.

Lukaku managed just two touches of the ball in the first half of Saturdayâs Premier League match against Crystal Palace. To make matters worse for the Belgian, one of those touches was to kick off the match at Selhurst Park. Loadingâ¦ Lukaku continued to struggle after the break but Chelsea were able to find a late winner through Hakim Ziyech, who had a goal disallowed for offside earlier in the half. Despite the victory, Chelsea supporters were unhappy with Lukaku's contribution. âWhat is the point of playing Lukaku every single game when it is evidently clear heâs the problem with our chance creation,â wrote one Twitter user. Another wrote: âWhy do we play Lukaku if the players behind him arenât capable or competent enough to feed him.â Lukaku has had a disappointing season since rejoining Chelsea in Â£97.5m move from Inter Milan last summer. The Belgium international has managed 10 goals in 27 appearances for the Blues but has come under fire for his performances, particularly in the Premier League.

Loadingâ¦ Even the most biased of United fans would have to admit that the thought of Harry Maguire lifting the Champions League trophy seems a bit of a stretch. Oh sure, it's a cup competition so the best team doesn't always win, but even in their 2-0 victory over Brighton on Tuesday night Ralf Rangnick's side hardly looked like world beaters, and that's following draws with Burnley and Southampton and a penalty shoot-out loss to Middlesbrough. Most people think the Champions League winners are likely to be Manchester City, Liverpool, Bayern Munich or possibly PSG due to their star power, but one United legend is backing his team. Richards asked Peter Schmeichel on CBS last night whether the club's former goalkeeper thought United could win it and his positive answer was met with howls of laughter from the former City man and snorts of derision from Carragher. ""Can Manchester United win the Champions League?""Thierry Henry, @MicahRichards, and @Carra23's reaction when @Pschmeichel1 answered the question pic.twitter.com/bUpnx5AIr2 Of course Carragher will know all about winning the Champions League when his team's form in the league isn't up to much, having won it with Liverpool in 2005. The Reds finished fifth that season in the league, and lost 14 times, finishing 37 points behind champions Chelsea and only finished above Bolton Wanderers on goal difference. Rafa Benitez's team even needed to be handed special dispensation to qualify for the following season's Champions League and had to go through the qualifying stages, despite being champions. They also weren't allowed 'association protection' so ended up being in the same group as Chelsea, actually beating their rivals to top spot in the group. Despite all that, it's no surprise that Richards and Carragher find it laughable that United could become European champions this year. Every day there seems to be some sort of new crisis coming out of Old Trafford, with the recent leaks being criticised by Gary Neville, who claimed he knew exactly which players they're coming from. There has been lots of talk of players falling out with Rangnick, and Cristiano Ronaldo's relationship with the interim boss is said to be non existent. The 37-year-old did at least end his six game goal drought on Tuesday night, as United's win over Brighton put them back in fourth place in the leauge. ",positive,liverpool,2

De Bruyne, on his 50th Champions League appearance for City, scored in the second half to break the deadlock in a frustrating quarter final first leg fixture against Atletico Madrid. Loadingâ¦ It was yet another defining moment for the Belgian in City colours, widely regarded as the best midfielder in the world. Carragher waxed lyrical about De Bruyne on CBS Sports' Golazo show and stated that the 30-year-old will become City's greatest ever player. âFor me he is the best midfielder in the world.""@carra23 and @micahrichards talk about Kevin De Bruyne and if he is better than David Silva? pic.twitter.com/4IXwElFEMA But former City defender Richards, who won one Premier League title and played 245 times for the club, was not quite having it. He told Carragher that he would agree if De Bruyne was able to fire City to a first Champions League trophy. Yet when Carragher pulled him up on that, Richards mentioned David Silva - a suggestion the Liverpool legend brushed off. ""You can't just dismiss the magician that is David Silva,"" Richards said. Carragher then claimed Silva was never the best player in the world in his position, which Richards wholly disagreed with. Carragher did say that he ""loves"" Silva but was adamant that De Bruyne will ""get more goals and play more penetrating passes"" than the Spaniard. In summer, to finish a two minute argument, Richards explained that most City fans would likely say De Bruyne is on par with Silva at this current moment. The playmaking pair became teammates in 2015 when De Bruyne returned to English football in a Â£54 million move. Pep Guardiola found a way to play the pair in the same midfield upon his arrival and it led to some of the most beautiful attacking football the Premier League has ever seen. De Bruyne has scored 80 goals for City and lifted three Premier League titles - just one behind City legend Silva. The World Cup winner left for Real Sociedad in 2020 after a decade of service.

The English rivals faced off in a third different competition this season and it was Thomas Tuchel's men who came out on top. Despite City being favourites going into the game, Chelsea had a number of chances early on through Timo Werner who failed to convert. However, a brilliant ball from Mason Mount found Kai Havertz just before half time, who skipped past Ederson and tapped into an open net. Phil Foden had a chance to equalise moments later before Antonio Rudiger produced a remarkable tackle. Thiago Silva was forced off with an injury after jumping with Foden for a header late in the first half. City lined up without an orthodox striker on the pitch while also not playing a holding midfielder. Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero both started on the bench as did Fernandinho and Rodri. Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan were preferred and it didn't really click for Pep Guardiola's men. De Bruyne was captain for the evening and saw his evening end early after being clattered by Rudiger. Taken off in tears, the Belgian international looked to have a black eye as he left the pitch. Oh Kevin :tired_face:A cruel blow as the Man City playmaker is forced off...

The 5ft 6in midfield dynamo covered every blade of in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Manchester City, proving impossible to pass and even winning the most aerial duels for his side. Remarkable. But as his Chelsea teammates received their medals and walked past the Champions League trophy, each one stopped to plant a kiss on it. Everybody, that is, except Kante: who just gave it a shy, awkward pat with both hands and carried on walking. It was a typically modest moment that sums up the France international, who's now a World Cup, Premier League and Champions League winner - but who never looks to own the limelight, despite his match-winning displays. I swear Kante is the best human on earth :joy::joy: pic.twitter.com/ODEQ2VpOZv This is a player who left Stamford Bridge in a Mini Cooper after he helped get Chelsea to this final by defeating Real Madrid. Just one of numerous examples of Kante's self-effacing nature. The box-to-box midfielder was the best player on the pitch on Saturday night in Porto, but he was the most reserved when finally faced with one of the few major trophies he'd never won before. At least his family showed the full extent of their emotions when his mum came on the pitch to embrace Kante in a warm hug in the aftermath of the game. We also know his Chelsea colleagues were keen to show their appreciation of him, as Kante was carried around the pitch at full-time. Kai Havertz netted the game's only goal, rounding Ederson to score after City's defence left him in acres of space. But it was Kante's individual display that will live long in the memory, despite his lack of desire to draw attention to himself when it comes to the game's silverware and post-match glory.

Loadingâ¦ And Fabregas paid his former midfield partner a huge compliment while watching Kante's performance against Real. Fabregas wrote: ""N'golo has always been a big game player. Never doubt him. He plays for 2."" Fans were inclined to agree with his assessment: Chelsea drew 1-1 at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium, with Christian Pulisic grabbing the crucial away goal before Karim Benzema levelled the tie with an exquisite volley. Only last month was Fabregas marvelling at Kante, giving him a new nickname after seeing him do his thing against Liverpool at Anfield. Kante is known for being the very best at breaking up play in the middle of the pitch but Fabregas believes the former Leicester City man does so much more than that. Speaking back in 2017, Fabregas told the official Chelsea website: ""Now N'Golo is becoming famous for chasing around and making tackles that recover the ball and end up in goals, but he does other things very well. ""But because this is now his reputation, people just look into this and they don't look to see if he does something else. I think we are winners as a group.

Last season's Champions League saw a significant change after the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final were held in Lisbon, Portugal, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Loadingâ¦ Both the quarter-finals and semi-finals were turned into single-leg ties and held behind closed doors. The remaining European teams played at neutral venues as Bayern Munich won the Champions League trophy after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the final. The New York Times now reports that UEFA will reveal its new plans to Europe's top-tier club tournament ahead of the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea. UEFA's proposed revamp to the Champions League will be called 'champions week,' according to the newspaper. Under the changes, fans would be able to tune in for two semi-finals and the final in the same week. The final would remain in its traditional Saturday night slot, but UEFA would hold an extravaganza of events throughout the week. UEFA's plan would see matches, concerts and other events held to keep fans entertained during the so-called 'champions week.' The Champions League organisers reportedly took inspiration for the new format from the NFL's highly successful Super Bowl events. The Super Bowl is supported with various events ahead of the eagerly anticipated final on a Sunday. According to The New York Times, the huge changes to the Champions League are under 'serious consideration.' But UEFA is not prepared to roll out an official plan at the moment as clubs have not been brought into the talks over the format change. 'Champions week' wouldn't arrive until UEFA rolls out its new format for the Champions League, which will come into effect from 2024. Early concerns have been raised over a potential loss in TV revenue if the two-leg semi-final matches were scrapped. However, UEFA expects that a single semi-final clash would attract a large enough audience to help ease any financial impact from dropping the two-leg format. The new Champions League format was announced last month amid the collapse of the controversial European Super League. UEFA's revamped Champions League will see an increase of teams from 32 to 36 as they would compete in a single league stage. Teams would play five matches at home and the other five away from home as the top eight from the table would progress to the knockout stage automatically. City star Ilkay Gundogan has been critical of the new Champions League format, saying it was the ""lesser of the two evils in comparison to the Super League."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Instead of eight groups of four the teams would take part in one large group, using the 'Swiss System,' but another huge change could be the location of the final. According to the Sun, UEFA have started pitching the idea of taking the showpiece of European football to the Big Apple for the first final of the revamp. The next few finals are already planned to be in Istanbul, St Petersburg, Munich and Wembley, under the current format, but nothing has been decided after that. It is not the first time that talks about taking the final abroad have been proposed, with the USA also the location for previous talk about the possibility. Back in November 2019 it was reported that TEAM Marketing AG, who represent the commercial interests of UEFA, had spoken to potential partners and media rights holders of the plan. The claims went as far as to say that the Metlife Stadium, which is home of the New York Giants and New York Jets, and has twice hosted WrestleMania, is their preferred location. One 'US Soccer insider' told the newspaper, ""We've seen crowds of 100,000 or more for pre-season friendlies involving big European sides over here. ""Commercially it makes all the sense in the world for Uefa to explore this."" If the final took place at 3pm local time in New York then it would kick off at 8pm in the UK and 9pm in mainland Europe, which is the usual kick off time for the final. However it would of course affect fans wanting to travel for the match as it would be further away than many locations on the continent. In 2016 President Aleksander Ceferin discussed the possibility, saying, ""I think it might be an idea in the future but we have to speak about it. ""To go from Portugal to Azerbaijan, for example, is almost the same as if you go to New York. For the fans it's no problem."" In 2019 there were loads of travel issues for fans of Arsenal and Chelsea as their Europa League final was hosted in Baku, but Azerbaijan is yet to host the Champions League final. The 'Swiss System' would mean that each team is drawn to play 10 of the rest of the 36 teams within the one group, though teams would still be seeded, and the teams with the best records would progress to the knockout stages. The increased number of teams would also mean the possibility of the extra places going to teams with 'historical coefficients,' to protect the biggest sides from missing out on the competition.

The club's fanbase are absolutely seething following on from the Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid. PSG were leading 2-0 on aggregate with around 30 minutes left to play at the Santiago Bernabeu but collapsed to a Karim Benzema-inspired Los Blancos side. Loadingâ¦ The French striker scored a stunning hat-trick to pile more misery on PSG in European competition. The fans have not taken it well in the slightest and Kurzawa felt the wrath of some of the most irate supporters this week. He was driving off leaving the club's Camp des Loges training complex when he was stopped by the traffic lights. That allowed the group to chase him down and confront him. They even forced open his car door and in footage posted online, a heated discussion ensued while Kurzawa was parked up. Roughly translated, the caption on the Snapchat video read: ""I ran into Kurzawa at the camp des fiottes, we're going to hunt you all"". The behaviour from the ultras is even more questionable given that Kurzawa is hardly to blame for the team's massive disappointment. He's played just NINE minutes of action in all competitions and that came back in August when he had an extremely brief cameo against Lille in the Super Cup. The former Monaco man wasn't even in the matchday squad for the defeat to Spurs and yet he was getting some serious stick. In PSG's last game, against Bordeaux, fans booed both Lionel Messi and Neymar. Days later fans vandalised both the Parc des Princes and the club's training ground. ""Nasser, Leo out,"" was sprayed on a wall outside, as well as with a phrase that roughly translates to ""far from our land"". ""Paris will never be Qatariâand âParis is usâ were also spray-painted, while the 'NTM' section basically means ""f*ck your mother"" in when translated into English. ",positive,liverpool,0

PSG are in Manchester to try and overturn City's 2-1 lead in the Champions League semi-final second leg. And the team coach just happened to encounter Tate, who became famous for his impassioned rants about the state of his beloved Man United. However this time it was Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Di Maria and co. who were on the receiving end of Tate's vocal prowess, as he bellowed his support before they took on United's rivals. A post shared by Andrew Tate (@andy_mufc_tate) On seeing the PSG coach in front of him in traffic, the United fan began cackling with glee before yelling encouragement at the players, as they possibly sat metres away. ""This is f***ing brilliant, this,"" analysed Andy. ""PSG! Come on Paris! ""Come on Mbappe! F*** 'em up!"" he encouraged before whooping as the team bus pulled away, presumably with a newly energised Mbappe on board. The Ligue 1 side had a famous visitor to the Lowry Hotel where they were staying before Tuesday evening's kick-off. Sir Alex Ferguson was pictured arriving and - as it's only the PSG squad staying at the hotel - it seems highly likely he was invited to talk to the players. Mauricio Pochettino's side need a comeback in the style Fergie's Man United team made famous. The 2-1 deficit they have from the first leg, after goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez cancelled out Marquinhos's opener in Paris. That means PSG need at least two goals at the Etihad to stand any chance of progressing to the final and with Pep Guardiola's side playing ominously good football. But if PSG do pull it off, maybe the pep talk from Tate - erm, as well as the one from Fergie - will be all the players are talking about afterwards. ",positive,liverpool,0

PSG crashed out of the Champions League on Wednesday night after losing 3-1 at the Bernabeu. Kylian Mbappe had put the French side ahead of the night, and 2-0 up in the last 16 tie, with a superb finish in the first half. Loadingâ¦ But a magnificent second-half hat-trick from Karim Benzema, which included two goals in just 12 seconds, secured a memorable comeback for Madrid, who progress to the last eight of the competition with a 3-2 aggregate win. It is familiar story in the Champions League for PSG, who have suffered similar capitulations against Barcelona and Manchester United in recent years. Unlike Mbappe, former Barcelona forward Messi struggled to make an impact against Madrid. The closest he came to scoring in the second leg was a free-kick from distance in the closing stages of the match, which narrowly went over Thibaut Courtoisâ goal. Messi had also missed a penalty in the reverse fixture at the Parc des Princes and fans have accused the seven-time Ballon dâOr winner of âghostingâ in PSGâs most important match of the season.

That led to UEFA being forced to do the draw for the second time, after United had ended up with a tie against Paris Saint-Germain. In the redraw, Ralf Rangnick's side managed to avoid a meeting with Mauricio Pochettino's team but instead were drawn in another tough tie, this time with Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid. Whilst United would have been delighted not to come up against Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and probably Neymar, Real will be fuming. Los Blancos were drawn with Benfica in the original draw and their tie got pulled out of the hat before the controversy featuring United. They didn't want to be included in the second draw but ended up getting arguably the hardest possible opponents in the last 16. Carlo Ancelotti's side will come up against a couple of very familiar faces, with Lionel Messi having scored more El Clasico goals than everyone else and Sergio Ramos having played for Real for 16 years up until the summer. As well as screwing up with United, Real were in the draw with Villarreal on the first attempt, despite them not being able to be drawn together as they're from the same country. Liverpool were also added to the Atleti draw, despite being in the same group as Diego Simeone's team, adding to the complete farce. There was more confusion in the afternoon's second draw as Liverpool weren't allowed to be drawn with Villarreal and people couldn't work out why. There was a pretty sensible explanation though as neither Villarreal or Inter Milan could face Real and Inter also couldn't face Juventus. Chelsea managed to somehow get drawn with Lille for both draws! ",positive,liverpool,3

Spanish newspaper El Nacional claims that Liverpool made a â¬60m (Â£51.2m) bid for the Brazilian in the summer, which was immediately rejected by Madrid. The report claims Liverpool are now set to return with an â¬80m (Â£68.4m) offer for the 20-year-old. Rodrygo has scored 11 goals in 79 games for Madrid since joining the Spanish giants in a â¬45m (Â£38.5m) move from Santos in 2019. The Brazil international was expected to become a key player this season under Carlo Ancelotti but has made only five starts in La Liga, with Marco Asensio largely preferred instead. According to El Nacional, Real Madrid would be willing to let Rodrygo leave if they can make âsignificantâ profit on the youngster. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp could be looking to sign reinforcements in January, with the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations set to deprive him of a number of key players for up to a month. Mohamed Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal) and Naby Keita (Guinea) are all set to feature in the tournament, which gets underway in Cameroon on January 9. El Nacional have also linked Liverpool with a sensational move for Barcelona wonderkid Gavi. The Reds are said to be considering triggering a Â£43m buy-out clause in the 17-year-oldâs contract at the Nou Camp. Gavi is contracted to Barcelona until 2023 and the Catalan club are keen to tie the midfielder down to a new long-term deal. Meanwhile, Klopp has said he will not stand in Nat Phillipsâ way if the defender wants to leave Anfield. Phillips has struggled for first-team opportunities this season and has been linked with a January move away, with West Ham named among the potential suitors for the centre-back. ""I'm very happy that Nat is here, to be honest, but we will not block anything I think,"" said Klopp. ""Itâs not the plan at all but who knows what happens until January."" ",positive,liverpool,5

Loadingâ¦ This isn't the first time in recent years that Manchester City and Liverpool have battled it out for the title, and though the rivalry, considered the best in English football history, has really turned up to another level in the past four years, it goes back as far as 2014. Then there were just five league games left of their season when the Reds welcomed rivals City to Anfield, with Manuel Pellegrini's side four points behind Brendan Rodgers' team, and Chelsea in between the two sides, two behind the leaders. A win for the hosts would surely put them within touching distance of their first league title in 24 years, and the first since the start of the Premier League. Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel put the Reds 2-0 up inside the first half hour before City mounted a comeback in the second half. David Silva got the visitors back into the game before Glen Johnson scored an unfortunate own goal. With just 12 minutes left Philippe Coutinho struck, following Vincent Kompany's poor clearance, to give Liverpool all three points and a seven point lead over City, knowing three wins from their final four games would be enough for the title. Captain Gerrard gathered his teammates in a huddle for a speech that the the TV camera's managed to get in the middle of. Inspiring his team, the midfielder screamed over the cheers from the crowd ""We do not let this f***ing slip. We do not let this f***ing slip. We go again!"" Steven Gerrard (zero #PL titles):""We do NOT let this [#PL title] slip.""[via @footballdaily]pic.twitter.com/Rq618cSRfI Those words were meant to rally his teammates in an inspirational guttural scream for one last push at a league title that had been over two decades in the making. The captain inspiring his teammates and the Liverpool supporters in one huge show of togetherness and passion, or at least that's what he might have hoped the moment would be remembered for. Unfortunately for Gerrard he really couldn't have chosen his words much worse, in one of the most incredible pieces of foreshadowing in sports history. Loadingâ¦ Liverpool did win their next game, against Norwich City, whilst Pellegrini's side dropped points in a 2-2 draw at home to Sunderland in midweek. It all meant that Rodgers' side could all but secure the title if they beat fellow title chasers Chelsea at home, with just three games of the season left. Fans don't need telling what happened next, in one of the league's most famous mistakes, Gerrard slipped when attempting to control a pass and let Demba Ba in to score a hugely important goal, which at least the Aston Villa manager can laugh about. #OnThisDay in 2014...Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea led to Jose Mourinho's side snatching a win at Anfield...âð´ pic.twitter.com/Yv0kbA4MiH The Blues went on to win the game 2-0, with Willian rounding off the scoring in injury time at the end of the game as Chelsea broke from a Liverpool corner. More agony was to come for Gerrard and his teammates just eight days later when they faced Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, with their title hopes still alive. Liverpool took a 3-0 lead in the 53rd minute, after goals form Joe Allen, Luis Suarez and an own goal from Damien Delaney, before the moment known as Crystanbul took place. â¶ï¸ #OnThisDay in 2014, Liverpool threw away a three goal lead against Crystal Palace and their title hopes were over. Luis Suarez left the pitch crying, Steven Gerrard stood in disbelief. #CRYLIV #PL pic.twitter.com/zeShNkVoX8 Palace came back to draw 3-3 with three goals in nine minutes, Delaney grabbed the first before a brace from Dwight Gayle and Liverpool lost out on the title to City by just two points! It would take another six years for the club to finally break their title drought, with Jurgen Klopp's side lifting the trophy after beating City to the title by a mammoth 18 points. This time things are likely to go down to the wire again, and no one at Anfield will be talking about slipping before the season is done with in May. ",positive,liverpool,9

Meanwhile, the celebration saw him compared to compatriot and Brazilian legend, Ronaldinho. La Liga TV commentator Terry Gibson also waxed lyrically about the goal, and said: ""He does so well here to beat Ocampos, then he drops a shoulder and goes past Montiel with ease, but then he's got so much to do. From that angle, he then has to get the power, and then find the accuracy to drill it into the top corner. ""It's a phenomenal strike from an outstanding young player. At 21 years of age, he's got the lot - it's a brilliant goal."" But now the focus for Vinicius Jr and Los Blancos will be a home clash against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday night. This win over Sevilla means that Carlo Ancelotti's side head into the game on a run of six consecutive victories in all competitions - winning eight of their last nine matches. All eyes will be on Vinicius Jr to see if he can produce another moment of magic. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ It had been a pretty tough start for Xavi back at the Nou Camp, defeats to Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao saw them knocked out of the Supercopa and Copa del Rey, respectively, and they were struggling in the battle to finish in the top four in La Liga. However recent weeks, and the January signings, have seen the team start to turn things around and on Sunday they beat Bilbao 4-0 in the league. It was their fourth win in the past five games in La Liga, since losing to Athletic in the cup, and it was the performance of Pedri that left fans purring. The midfielder, who at the beginning of the season looked knackered after playing in the Euros and the Olympics, was back to his best, which is a scary level for a 19-year-old, and his personal highlights reel shows how he pulled the strings. pic.twitter.com/mOtNIDz1UO Forget U20s, Pedri is the best player in his position bar none, but some of you arenât ready for this conversation yet. pic.twitter.com/nunbNVrQFI I love Gavi and Nico but Pedri is on another level entirely. This guy doesnât have the potential to be world-class; he already is. He plays with the audacity of someone who doesnât believe he has limits and the serenity of someone whoâs simply enjoying himself. An amazing player. Impressive how Xavi has brought back the best from Dest and Frenkie, as well as elevating Pedriâs game to a whole new level. Thatâs what great managers do. pic.twitter.com/CEfqDT4u6L Pedri is the Iniesta regen straight up. So smooth, calm, and confident.

""He reminds me a lot of AndrÃ©s Iniesta,"" Xavi said of the youngster to reporters after the game, high praise indeed considering Iniesta was his midfield partner for so long. ""If weâre talking about pure talent, Pedri is the best in the world. ""He is a wonderful player. I havenât seen many talents like him."" As well as Pedri, it was a good night all round for Barca, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continued his excellent form since moving from Arsenal at the beginning of the month to open the scoring, ending any doubt Xavi might have previously had. Ousmane Dembele, who looked to be leaving the club in January, added the second, before the much maligned Luuk de Jong made it 3-0 in the 90th minute and Memphis Depay added the icing on the cake in injury time. The win means the Catalan giants remain in fourth in the league, but are now just one point behind Real Betis in third, after they lost the Seville derby to Sevilla on Sunday. ",positive,liverpool,0

David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane stood together as Sevilla lined up a free-kick. It was a two-man wall boasting maximum star power but minimal defensive solidity. Wallop. The ball was laid off to a fresh-faced centre-back who launched a dipping shot from more than 30 yards out. The ball flew past his future manager, Zidane, and into the corner of the net. Cue wild celebrations and Florentino Perez sat somewhere thinking: 'Who's that guy? I better sign him.' Probably. Ramos would go to Madrid in the summer for â¬27 million, a record fee for a Spanish defender. It proved a bargain as years of goals, trophies, arrogance, glory - plus many red cards - followed. But Ramos's last goal for his childhood club Sevilla seriously hurt the team he'd one day captain, while also helping out Barcelona. A Galacticos-packed Real side starring Raul, Roberto Carlos, Brazilian Ronaldo, Michael Owen and - bizarrely - Thomas Gravesen needed to win to keep their Liga title hopes alive. All looked to be going OK when Real equalised, then took the lead via a thunderous shot from their inspirational midfield genius Gravesen.  Not really, it was Zidane. Of course it was Zidane. But disaster struck when Julio 'The Beast' Baptista equalised in the 89th minute. The 2-2 draw confirmed the title was going to Barcelona, meaning two future Real players had cost the club any chance of catching their arch rivals. Safe to say Real fans probably forgave Ramos in the following 16 years, given his numerous crucial goals and status as an all-time club legend. But he has had an antagonistic relationship with supporters of his former club Sevilla. Sergio Ramos winding up opposition fans? Yes, we're absolutely as shocked as you are. However he was a Sevilla hero back in 2005, when his goal stunned his future club, future teammates and future boss, delivering a result which confirmed that the Liga title was heading to Catalonia.

After getting to his feet the Sevilla player was sent to hospital, where he was later diagnosed with a 'traumatic brain injury.' The player was released from hospital but was put under observation for 'at least 24 hours,' to see if he had any more adverse effects to the trauma. A statement by Sevilla read, ""Sevilla FC would like to convey all its affection to Joan Jordan, who fortunately, and this is undoubtedly the only important thing, is at home after being hit by an object thrown from the home stand during the derby. ""Joan left the Benito VillamarÃ­n dazed and was taken to hospital, where he was examined and underwent a series of tests required by the protocol due to the concussion. ""The final diagnosis is cranioencephalic trauma and the player will be kept under home observation until a minimum period of 24 hours has passed without any alarming symptoms. ""Sevilla FC condemns the violent act suffered today by Joan Jordan, an unacceptable act in the world of sport committed by an individual who, of course, does not represent the fans of Real Betis or the way of living football in our city. ""Likewise, the club demands the utmost respect for Joan Jordan, a true professional and an exemplary person who has suffered an appalling attack.""

Loadingâ¦ Dembele's contract at Barcelona is due to finish at the end of the season and there had been lots of talk about whether or not he would extend his stay, with some reports claiming the club only wanted him to renew the contract in order to sell him. Last week however, Barca decided to come out with a statement, saying that as they couldn't agree terms for the player they wanted to sell him in January. With the risk of losing him for free, Xavi's side decided to get rid straight away, though the France forward clearly wasn't too impressed with the statement. Dembele's agent Moussa Sissoko could be sorting a transfer away from the Nou Camp and now he's been spotted at the airport with a phone call from PSG sporting director Leonardo. Loadingâ¦ The 24-year-old hasn't been the kind of success that the club would have hoped, since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in summer 2017 following Neymar's departure to PSG. His potential availability has led to interest from Premier League clubs, even before Barca said they wanted to sell him this month, and they could agree a pre contract agreement with him already. The Spanish giants are reportedly after just Â£17 million this month, a huge loss on the near Â£130 million they spent on him less than five years ago. PSG's interest could partially stem from the fact they're expected to lose Kylian Mbappe in the summer, when his contract is also expiring. The Ligue 1 leaders have also been linked with making Zinedine Zidane their manager next season, with the French connection potentially a pull for Dembele. Despite Barca's stance on the player leaving, his agent isn't too happy with how the situation has been dealt with. ""They're putting the pressure on, but it doesn't work with people like us,"" Sissoko told RMC recently. ""Maybe it works with agents who are close to Barcelona. That's not the case with me, I'm here to defend my player's interests. ""...If Barcelona wanted to negotiate, they could have come to the table with us to talk. ""Except there are no discussions and there are threats coming from them that he won't play. ""That's not allowed. We will exercise Ousmane Dembele's rights if necessary.

Loadingâ¦ Koeman was brought in by Barca at the end of last season, taking over from Quique Setien, following the club's first trophyless season in 12 years and after the embarrassing 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich. For a while it looked like Koeman's first season would be a disaster but he turned things around and won the Copa del Rey, although the team did mess up their title chase of Atletico Madrid. Despite the improvement, the former Everton manager's future is still in doubt. He has already held talks with the club where he was kept on but that isn't the end of things. On Friday, club president Joan Laporta incredible told a press conference that the current boss isn't his choice saying, ""Yes, I told Koeman that you are not my favourite coach, give me time to find an alternative and if I don't find one - you can continue."" Following on from that incredible comment, Koeman's management team took to Twitter to reply, obviously unhappy by what was said, before it was quickly deleted. You can't really blame them, or Koeman, if they're absolutely fuming about the whole situation. Obviously there's an argument for the Dutchman losing his job, as there is for him keeping it, but surely you give him some sort of clarity. Instead Laporta is going to try and sign his prefered coach and if not then the current man can keep his job, that seems unbelievably unfair. It wasn't only the manager's future that Laporta discussed on Friday, with fans still none the wiser whether or not Lionel Messi will stay beyond this summer or leave. The six time Ballon d'Or winner wanted to leave last summer and his contract is set to expire in July and he hasn't yet signed a new deal. The president hinted the club captain would be on less money if he stayed but was somewhat positive about the chances, saying, ""Leo deserves much more, and could earn more elsewhere. I'm convinced he values the effort we're making and would like to stay. Leo is not about money, but a team which can win everything. I am moderately optimistic."" ""There is a lot of expectation surrounding his continuation. The new contract is going well but it is not done yet.

""When we had norms in the locker room things were good, when we didn't, it went bad. So, we need to have order. Being professionals. ""It's a medium to long-term project but we'll need to work really hard to find the results. The expectation and the demand will be the highest. No excuses will be made or accepted."" Spanish media outlet Directo Gol has now listed out six strict demands which Xavi will enforce in the dressing room. If you are Spanish speaker, then the video makes for some fascinating listening. Gerard Pique has now retired from international football with Spain, but it did not stop the defender from jet setting around the world whenever there was a pause in the club calendar. The 34-year-old is known for his love of tennis, previously making long-haul flights out to the States to watch the US Open Final in New York,as well as to Shanghai to catch up with Novak Djokovic. But Xavi is set to curtail Pique's jet-setting activities in one of those six demands of his squad. The Catalan legend is also going to put the squad through its paces with more hours on the training pitch, and wants to keep a tighter control of his players' social media profiles. He is also set to ban anyone from undertaking individual personal training sessions and renew the medical services that are on offer to his players, ensuring they are up to scratch. Finally, he will enforce a style that is ""not negotiable.""

The Barcelona legend has previously been linked with the Barcelona head coach role and has already been offered the position, according to reports in Spain. Read More: Xavi has been in contact with Barcelona president Joan Laporta ahead of Koemanâs sacking and the La Liga club are preparing to trigger the Spaniardâs release clause in his Al Sadd contract. The 41-year-oldâs appointment is not expected to be made until Friday amid paperwork that Barcelona need to complete, but Xavi is already preparing to make changes upon his arrival. According to Spanish reporter Gerard Romero, Xavi will adopt a 4-3-3 formation for Barcelona after playing in the system under Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. The Metro reports that the Al Sadd boss wants to strengthen his squad and identified Sterling as a potential target for Barcelona as part of his tactics. Sterling has been linked with Barcelona in recent weeks and seen his minutes reduced under Guardiola, with the City winger open to the idea of playing abroad. Read More: Joining the 26-year-old City star on Xaviâs radar is Sevilla centre-back Kounde, whose move to Chelsea in the summer was scuppered. Xavi believes that the 22-year-old French defender, whose release clause is worth around Â£68.5m, will help strengthen Barcelonaâs fragile defence. City are expected to demand a hefty transfer fee for Sterling, while Chelseaâs Â£42.5m bid for Kounde was rejected. Barcelona could struggle to meet the price tags of Sterling and Kounde amid the club handling a crippling debt standing at around Â£1bn. Ousmane Dembele, who has been linked with Newcastle and Liverpool, is expected to be handed a new contract at Barcelona.

As explained on the Coaches Voice website, he explains his commitment to the possession game and discusses the strategies he has employed against both a high press and, as is more often the case with Al Sadd; a deep-lying low block. He also talks about the necessity of numerical superiority, both in possession and out of possession, and the importance of winning the second ball. ""[The team should] enjoy having the ball and generate numerical superiorities in attack after a defensive phase with high pressure,"" he says.

Loadingâ¦ It was confirmed last week that the legendary midfielder would finally be returning to the Camp Nou as new manager. The 41-year-old is interested in bolstering his squad in January and Barcelona are looking light up front. Sergio Aguero is currently out of action until 2022 with a heart rhythm disorder while Ousmane Dembele and Martin Braithwaite are injured, as is Ansu Fati. Goal have claimed Bounedjah has been linked with a shock move after being a key player under Xavi in Qatar. The Algeria international has scored 11 goals in nine games this season and helped Al Sadd win the Stars League title last campaign. Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi believes Bounedjah has all the tools to succeed in Catalonia. ""Baghdad is doing extraordinary things. Baghdad in Barcelona, what do you want me to tell you? Xavi knows better than I... maybe he thinks Baghdad is the first or second choice,"" he told TSA Algerie. ""It can be a surprise for others and not for him since he knows him. He knows how to compare with the squad there is at the moment in Barcelona. ""God only knows, that would be an extraordinary thing. ""He made history, he scored goals everywhere...He scored the goal of the Afcon final, one of the most important goals in the history of Algerian football. We do not recognise his quality precisely because he plays in Qatar, whereas, in Qatar, there are players who cannot do it."" He continued: ""The current Barca is not the Barcelona of [Lionel] Messi, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta. In our timing, I don't know if Xavi has in mind to bring him back to Barcelona, but I know he likes him a lot. ""I know he could bring any centre forward back to Al-Sadd, they have unlimited resources, but it wasn't even a dream. ""Out of all the foreigners they have, number 1 is still Baghdad. Xavi appreciates the player, he played with him, he knows his qualities and he knows how to compare with the players with whom he has evolved.""

An investigation by The Sun has revealed that supporters of the Three Lions could be forced to pay up to Â£9,000 per night for a hotel in the country during the tournament, which gets underway on November 21. More than one-and-a-half million fans are expected to travel to Qatar, which is only around the size of Yorkshire, and there are growing doubts over whether the country will be able to cope with the influx of visitors. Most hotels are already booked up, with the remaining rooms now soaring in price following Fridayâs World Cup draw. Direct flights to Qatar could also cost as much as Â£1063, while a ticket to a match could set fans back Â£724. Should fans make it to Qatar, it is likely to cost them a small fortune to drink at the tournament. The Gulf nation, which is home to just under three million people, has some of the most expensive alcohol prices in the world. A pint of Heineken costs Â£11.50, while a glass of wine is around Â£11. Alcohol will only be available in special zones around stadiums and in specific venues in the countryâs capital Doha. Anyone caught drinking in public outside of these zones could be sentenced to six months in jail. Qatar tourism chief Berthold Trenkel says special drinking measures will be put in place during the tournament but has warned: âIt will be different inside the actual stadiums. âThere will only be zero alcohol beer actually inside.â British expat Angela Norton, 60, who emigrated to Qatar from Chester with her husband seven years ago, has warned England fans they face a huge culture shock. She said: âThere are lots of rules they wonât be aware of like the need for women to cover up in malls. âIf you wear shorts or a little dress you will get told off and the other women will spit at you. âThe cost of alcohol is so high that most expats only drink at happy hour between 5pm and 8pm where a pint of beer is still nearly Â£8. âDrinking in public is banned and if you try, the police will turn up and take you to jail. There are CCTV cameras everywhere.â Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

""I am pretty sure that England will be very difficult to beat,"" he says, almost sympathetically. ""But I am also pretty sure they will fail at the end of the day."" Loadingâ¦ With the pain of the Euro 2020 final beginning to subside, England supporters are now looking ahead with expectation and excitement about the next opportunity of silverware. A semi-final appearance at the last World Cup in Russia, coupled with the near miss against Italy last summer, has seen the Three Lions named as one of the favourites to win the tournament in Qatar, which gets underway on November 21. England's odds shortened further once the dust had settled on the World Cup draw in Doha, after Gareth Southgate's side were placed in a relatively favourable group alongside the United States, Iran and one of either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine. But former Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder Petit isn't convinced they can go all the way. ""It is always the same story with England. You always put them as contenders, but they always miss something in the end,"" added Petit, speaking on behalf of Genting Casino. ""I donât know if it is because of the management or because of the players, but sometimes I think they can't manage the pressure they receive. When they reach the last stage, you can feel the pressure on some players. Physically, the body language. Maybe it is because of that. ""There are so many young players in the national team that are doing a great job for their clubs, like [Phil] Foden, [Bukayo] Saka, [Mason] Mount. They are great players but they are still young. They probably need more experience. ""When I remember the games in the World Cup and the Euros â in the final they were playing at home and you could feel the pressure. You could feel that it was too much for some players."" Should England win their group, they could come up against Senegal or the Netherlands in the last 16, before a potential quarter-final against defending champions France. England have won just one of their last eight games against the French, with their last meeting ending in a 3-2 win for Les Blues in an entertaining friendly in Paris in 2017. When asked to pick a winner between the two teams based on current form, Petit said: ""It is not easy because we are the best enemies, England and France. But we are best friends as well. ""[There is] so much quality in both sides. It is very hard to say who could win that game, but I think we have a good record against England. Mentally, psychologicallyâ¦ the pressure, I think this is in the head of the English players. There is something they need to get over. ""To answer your question, I think France would win against England."" France are aiming to become the first team to successfully defend the World Cup since Brazil won back-to-back titles in 1958 and 1962. Petit knows first-hand the difficulties of the retaining the most coveted trophy in football. After experiencing the euphoria of their first World Cup triumph on home soil in 1998, which was then followed up by victory at Euro 2000, France came crashing back to earth with an early exit from the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, where they mustered just a single point from their three group games. The World Cup winners' curse has struck three times since then; Italy, Spain and Germany all exiting at the group stage of the tournament four years after being crowned champions. Petit, who was part of the France squad throughout the wild ride of the late nineties and early noughties, knows the size of the task facing the defending champions and is reluctant to make too many bullish predictions ahead of a tournament as exceptional as Qatar 2022. ""I know when you're a World Cup holder, it's very difficult to keep the trophy,"" added Petit, who won 63 caps for France between 1990 and 2003. ""Donât forget that this World Cup is totally different to what footballers are used to playing. They are playing it mid-season. They donât have the preparation, only one week before the start of the tournament. It is something new. Something very different for the players. ""Some teams will probably benefit from [having] more time [to prepare]. Smaller teams like Qatar, Iranâ¦ team likes this. I'm pretty sure they will prepare for weeks before the start of the World Cup. But most of the European players, they won't be able to do that with their national teams."" France's chances of success this winter are likely to depend on the Parisian phenomenon, Kylian Mbappe. Still aged just 23, Mbappe has already scored 26 goals in 54 games for his national side and Petit is expecting an impressive tournament from the in-demand striker, who picked up the Best Young Player award at the last World Cup in Russia. ""I think [France head coach] Didier Deschamps has a bright idea of how he wants the team to play and we have the best player in the world as well, with Mbappe,"" added Petit. ""Mbappe, his destiny is written in gold. Everything he touches is transformed to gold."" Not quite everything. At Euro 2020 last summer, Mbappe failed to score a single goal and missed the decisive penalty in a dramatic shootout defeat to Switzerland in the last 16 of the competition. But he gained swift redemption by scoring the winning goal in the Nations League final against Spain in October. Bad news for the rest of the world; France and Mbappe now look back to their best. ""They need to get the revenge for what happened in the Euros,"" added Petit. ""But this tournament is completely different to what players are used toâ¦ we could see a surprise.""

Tebas made this revelation to the Spanish publication El Transistor and therefore suggested that Barcelona will have to make significant changes to their finances in order to renew Lionel Messi's deal which expires at the end of the month. Tebas revealed that the Catalan giants must ""restructure their debt"" as they are responsible for half of the â¬700 million that clubs have lost across La Liga. When describing the ""special procedure"" that Barca now fall under due to their financial difficulties, Tebas said: ""We have a special procedure for when a club goes over its salary established by LaLiga, where clubs can only include players who represent 25% of the savings. ""If Barca sell a player for â¬100 million, they can only spend â¬25 million. ""If Barca receives â¬10 million on a sale, they can only spend â¬2.5 million on a new signing. ""If Barcelona want to bring in a player who costs them â¬25 million per season in salary, they must earn, either by transfer or by a salary reduction, â¬100 million."" Despite the club's financial difficulties, Barcelona have brought in Memphis Depay, Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia on free transfers. Barcelona have also attempted to sign Georginio Wijnaldum which was hijaked by Paris Saint-Germain whilst they are also set to renew Messi's contract who according to Forbes is worth a whopping $97 million a year. After Barcelona's focus on incomings, Tebas has commented that the club's focus must now revolve around reducing the size of their squad. Junior Firpo and Phillipe Coutinho are the two names which have been heavily linked with leaving the club with rumours of Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Miralem Pjanic departing too. Tebas has hinted that their could be potential serious ramifications if these adjustments to the squad are not made in the coming months: ""They have to reduce salaries in the squad consistently or produce fees from sold players.

Messi will battle it out with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and European Championship winner Jorginho for the prize, but aside from the Ballon d'Or, there will surely be the award for The Best FIFA Men's Player. This accolade is given out at 'The Best FIFA Football Awards.' The world's governing football body have yet to confirm a date for their own ceremony, but Messi is likely to be a leading contender for the most prestigious prize on the night. Since the ceremony began in 2017, Ronaldo leads the way with two awards, while Messi, Luka Modric and Robert Lewandowski have won it once each. GiveMeSport found a fascinating video on Twitter, which shows how the crowd reacted to Ronaldo, Modric and Messi being announced as the winner. It has clearly made an impact on social media after gaining well over 11,000 likes and almost 2,000 retweets. Messi is the only player to get a standing ovation for winning a FIFA 'The Best' award pic.twitter.com/DXTcgM2hHG The clip shows Ronaldo and Modric greeted with tepid applause, while the reaction to Messi was much more enthusiastic. The Argentinian maestro received a standing ovation in moving footage that sees the likes of Jose Mourinho and Jurgen Klopp on their feet to pay tribute to the Barcelona superstar. The debate surrounding who the greatest player is out of Ronaldo and Messi will rumble on for many years to come, but this footage shows there is no doubt as to who the most likeable player is out of the two. Messi has made a slow start to life at Paris Saint Germain after scoring just once in five appearances across all competitions so far this season. That came in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City in the Champions League.

PSG, who failed to win the league last season, are enjoying a brilliant summer transfer window, capping off their business with the stunning acquisition of Messi. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner will ply his trade in France following a prolific spell in Spain. While Ligue 1 has a reputation for being an 'easy' league, AS Monaco star Fabregas says it's anything but a walk in the park. ""I think sometimes he doesnât even realise how big he is,"" said the Spaniard via Metro. ""Sometimes he goes to places and he thinks itâs normal for him because heâs been raised like that by being the best and always being surrounded by friends and everything but what he moves around... when you see from the outside itâs something that Iâve never seen before from anyone else."" Fabregas added: ""Certainly when PSG donât win the league, everyone sees it as a disaster because they spend a lot of money. ""Everyone sees it as a one-team league, but in the last five years Monaco and Lille have put a break in it. ""Itâs not as easy as people think. Itâs very intense, very aggressive, very fast and strong players. They (the teams) defend very well."" On the competitiveness of the league, the ex-Arsenal captain added: ""The league is a good league, itâs a league thatâs improving. Itâs already physical, aggressive players in a good way, they defend very well. ""In attacking, they used to be not very talented but theyâre improving. New foreign, modern coaches are coming in and itâs a league thatâs going up with the generation of coaches and players."" Fabregas also says his teammates are looking forward to dueling with Messi ahead of the new season. ""All the boys are excited, knowing they are playing against Lionel Messi,"" he said.

Messi though doesn't think that his rival deserves any criticism, instead saying the United forward has adapted in an 'impressive way.' ""United is a very strong team with great players,"" the six time Ballon d'Or winner told Marca, presumably without having watched any Premier League football for the past month. ""Cristiano already knew the club, but itâs in another stage and now he has adapted in an impressive way. ""From the beginning he has scored goals as always and had no problems adapting.

He has scored important goals, especially in the Champions League, but in the league things haven't all been going perfectly. So much so that Paul Merson laid the blame for things going wrong for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the signing of the 36-year-old forward this summer. For years Ronaldo and Messi went head-to-head as their rivalry was played out in a number of El Clasico matches, which stopped when Real Madrid's all time top scorer moved to Juventus in 2018.

However, aided by the near-bottomless wealth of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, Newcastle United could be about to challenge the London club for his signature. Hazard has struggled since making his high-profile move to the Spanish capital back in 2019. Linking up with Zinedine Zidane, his Â£100 million price tag looked as if it weighed heavily, while injuries and the side's general form slump also worked against the former PFA Player of the Year. Since Zidane's exit from the club, the 30-year-old has largely been left out in the cold, with youngsters like Vinicius Jr and Marco Asensio superseding him in the pecking order. Earlier this month, it was reported that Roman Abramovich was keen to try and bring the winger back to West London, to the club where he produced his finest ever form. A move to Chelsea would appear to make a great deal of sense of the face of it, as Thomas Tuchel is also thought to be a big fan of Hazard's. And yet, interest from the Premier League's new richest club could complicate matters, as if reports are to be believed, Newcastle United will duel it out with Chelsea to try and land the superstar. According to ESPN senior journalist James Olley, the Magpies could launch a bid this January, if the man himself is made available by Madrid. ""Chelsea and Newcastle are among a number of clubs interested in signing Eden Hazard in January,"" Olley claims. While Chelsea have an obvious advantage in the race, given his loyalty to the club and the allure of Europe, Newcastle will - in theory at least - be able to gazump any of their financial offers. Hazard left Chelsea with Premier League, FA Cup, and Europa League winners medals to his name, having scored an impressive 110 goals for the club.

""I would like to thank my coaching team, the players and the support staff in particular for all their hard work. ""There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts. ""This is a club with incredible support, and I hope the new owners can take it forward to where we all want it to be. ""I wish everyone the very best of luck for the rest of this season and beyond."" Sunday's game had started with an incredible atmosphere at St James' Park and it only got better when Callum Wilson opened the scoring in the second minute. However, after an excellent opening to the match for the hosts, Spurs grew into the match and, despite Dier's goal at the end, were pretty dominant. The crowd had also turned from celebrating the new ownership to singing about wanting Bruce gone, and now they have their wish. Graeme Jones will be in charge of the team on an interim basis and will manage the game against Crystal Palace at the weekend. The Magpies have been linked with several managers, although reports claim that Antonio Conte has already turned them down. ",positive,liverpool,0

But the takeover has drawn criticism from the likes of Amnesty International, with the human rights abuses charity believing the deal should not have passed the Premier League's owners' and directors' test. ""Instead of allowing those implicated in serious human rights violations to walk into English football simply because they have deep pockets, we've urged the Premier League to change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues,"" Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International chief executive told BBC Sport. ""The phrase 'human rights' doesn't even appear in the owners' and directors' test despite English football supposedly adhering to FIFA standards.

The Belgian returned to Stamford Bridge for the first time since his â¬100 million move to Los Blancos in 2019. Despite playing just 755 minutes across all competitions this season, the injury-plagued Hazard was given a chance to shine in the semi-final second leg by manager Zinedine Zidane. But he ultimately failed to make any sort of impression on the game and was brought off in the final stages after a mediocre performance. After the final whistle, cameras followed Hazard onto the Stamford Bridge pitch and well, he didn't exactly look devastated about the result. He was spotted hugging some of his former teammates, including Kurt Zouma - and shared a touching moment with Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta as they both left the field. As you can imagine, these pictures have brought plenty of reaction on social media.   Away from Hazard's full-time antics and Chelsea will play Manchester City in an all-English Champions League final on May 29 after recording a 3-1 aggregate win over Real Madrid.

Los Blancos, meanwhile, struggled to make any sort of impression as the likes of Hazard and Vinicius Junior made very little impact on the semi-final second leg clash.  Even the return of Sergio Ramos, who started his first Real Madrid game in seven weeks, couldn't rally the troops as a goal from Timo Werner opened the scoring for The Blues. Mason Mount, who has been outstanding all season, then put the nail in Madrid's coffin with five minutes remaining when he made it 2-0 on the night with a simple tap in.

But is he really about to drop down to the Belgium second tier? The ex-Premier League great has been given an offer by Belgium second division side KVC Westerlo, who are top of the league by ten points and look set to be promoted to the top tier: the Belgian Pro League. Their sporting director is Hasan Cetinkaya, and his personal relationship with Hazard is the key link in this bizarre transfer rumour. In an interview with Het Nieuwsblad, Cetinkaya said: ""I think I can consider Eden Hazard a friend, as I first met him when he was at Lille. He promised me that one day he would play for FenerbahÃ§e. ""To get him to come to KVC Westerlo would be more difficult, but you never know. He might come and finish his career here."" It is certainly a hopeful punt from Cetinkaya. Hazard has continued to represent the Belgium national team during his poor form, but for Real Madrid he has struggled to make starting line-ups under Carlo Ancelotti. He has 11 appearances for the club in all competitions this season but is yet to find the back of the net. It is clear that Hazard will need to look for a move away from the BernabÃ©u at some point. He scored 110 goals and provided 92 assists in 352 games for Chelsea, before signing for Real Madrid for an astronomical fee of Â£103.5m. Since then, the 30-year-old has failed to find the same consistency. In 54 Real Madrid matches, he has a meagre five goals and nine assists.

The Real Madrid winger has struggled since making his Â£103 million move back in 2019, due to a combination of injuries and poor overall form. However, his former employers could be about to rescue the superstar from his La Liga nightmare. Spanish outlet El Nacional claims that Roman Abramovich himself will make it his mission to bring Hazard back to Stamford Bridge next summer. The paper even suggests that informal talks have taken place between the two clubs regarding a possible deal for the player, who has missed more games for Los Blancos that he has played over the past two seasons. The 30-year-old was initially signed by long-time admirer Zinedine Zidane, but with the Frenchman no longer at the Bernabeu, some are wondering whether it might be time for Hazard to also move on. Current head coach, Carlo Ancelotti, doesn't appear to be the Belgian's biggest fan after snubbing him for a number of big games this season. With young wingers like Rodrigo and Vinicius Jr both growing in stature and influence at the club, the writing may already be on the wall. By contrast, Chelsea owner Abramovich is apparently ""increasingly convinced"" that Hazard will light up the Premier League all over again if he does return to London. At his scintillating best, Hazard was a phenom for The Blues, winning the coveted PFA Player of the Year award in 2014-15 for his contribution to Jose Mourinho's title-winning side. He'd go on to leave the club with 85 goals to his name, as well as a pair of Premier League and Europa League winner's medals. Another factor that surely increases the likelihood of Hazard returning to Stamford Bridge next year is just how much of a fan Thomas Tuchel is. The German manager has previously waxed lyrical about Hazard, stating earlier this year: ""He is a top-quality player and a key player for many years at this club and this league, the hardest in the world.""

Madrid have needed another forward to step up and help Karim Benzema for some time, which Hazard did last night in a big way.

Madrid have seen former club captain Sergio Ramos and his central defence partner, Raphael Varane, leave the club this summer. Zinedine Zidane stepped down from his role as manager and many wondered if it'd be a season of transition for 'Los Blancos'. If Hazard can carry this form and stay fit for the rest of the campaign, they should be just fine. One fan said: ""That Eden Hazard assist was sublime. The remontada is in full flow and I'm here for it."" Another added: ""This is the kind of pure genius you can't teach a player."" While a third said: ""A fit Eden Hazard is such a much needed fresh of breath air in the team."" Benzema added a second before Nacho Fernandez and Vinicius Jr bagged a goal each to secure victory.

That's according to a report by journalist Anton Meana on Spanish sports radio station El Larguero, where the former described the attacking midfielder as 'no case Asensio'. The report also suggests that the 25-year-old had chances to leave the capital this summer but decided to stay and fight for his place. ""My intention is to continue at Real Madrid,"" he said a few months ago, as quoted by Football Espana. ""I feel that I still have a lot to give the club. ""As many already know, I'm a Madridsta and I have been since I was little. I live this club, beyond just being a player. I really feel both victories and defeats. It's from the heart."" However, should Asensio continue to stay on the fringes of Carlo Ancelotti's first team, Meana claims a showdown between the manager and player will take place which will determine where the former Mallorca man's future lies. Since joining Real Madrid in 2014 (in a transfer which Los Blancos president Florentino Perez says was helped by tennis legend Rafael Nadal), Asensio has enjoyed great success, winning two La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues, two Super Cups and a hat-trick of FIFA Club World Cups. However, it seems like irrespective of what he has achieved in the past, his manager doesn't appear to fancy him. This is extremely odd considering Ancelotti was the man who brought Asensio to the club during the former's first spell in charge between 2013 and 2015 - and because of how positive the Spain international was about the Italian's return in the summer. ""He (Ancelotti) gave me a very good feeling,"" Asensio said in July. ""He has very clever ideas. He's a coach who's been at the greatest clubs in the world and has enjoyed good spells with each. ""He has a lot of experience and I'm sure I can learn a lot from him."" With the season still in its early stages, Asensio has plenty of time to re-establish himself as a key part of Ancelotti's plans.

The 30-year-old Belgian winger was a fan-favourite at Chelsea and left Stamford Bridge in 2019 to sign for Madrid in a deal worth up to Â£150m. Loadingâ¦ However, Hazard failed to make a serious impact at Madrid and his time in Spain has been hindered due to multiple injuries. The former Chelsea star, whose current Madrid deal expires in 2024, has been reduced to only 14 appearances in La Liga this season as Los Blancos fell two points short of the league title. Hazard's future at Madrid remains uncertain amid intense speculation that Los Blancos will axe him in the summer transfer window. The Madrid flop was heavily criticised by Spanish media after he was spotted laughing and embracing Chelsea players following Los Blancos' exit from the Champions League. Now, Spanish TV show El Chiringuito reports that Hazard is eager to leave Madrid in the summer. According to reports in Spain, the Belgium international's 'preference' of transfer would be a stunning return to Stamford Bridge. Hazard captured two Premier League titles, two Europa League trophies, an FA Cup and League Cup during a successful spell in England. Madrid are expected to cut several players in the summer window as Zinedine Zidane makes sweeping changes to his current squad. Joining Hazard on the cutting block includes Gareth Bale, Luka Jovic, Mariano, Brahim Diaz and Dani Ceballos. Los Blancos are reportedly willing to sell Hazard for as much as Â£43.4m (â¬50m) as the Spanish club prepares to balance their finances amid the coronavirus pandemic. Despite rumours surrounding Hazard's future, Zidane is pushing for the Madrid winger to succeed in Spain. ""All the players have their hearts in the club, but for now, it hasn't been possible to see the Eden Hazard we want to see,"" he said. ""But I believe he is going to get there. It's a difficult moment with everything that's happened but he has a contract and what he wants is to succeed here."" ",positive,liverpool,0

He reportedly wants more surgery to end his injury hell but Dr Jose Gonzalez, who works for Atletico Madrid, has warned against it. Per The Sun he told Ondacero: ""Hazard has to train with the team for up to 10 training sessions. In my experience it is difficult for him to return to playing at his level with Real Madrid this season. ""If a player returns after a long injury without having hardly trained, the most normal thing is that he is injured again. ""He has anxiety, he wants to show that he is worth and wants to give 100% and he is not there for that."" Hazard has scored just three La Liga goals since arriving in the Spanish capital and featured in just 25 games. That time out has been due to 11 different injuries and he could be at risk of missing this summer's European Championships. Madrid want Hazard to postpone any potential surgery, but Belgium are keen to have their talisman ready for June. The 30-year-old has travelled to London for a second opinion on any possible surgery. Speaking earlier this week, 'Los Blancos' manager Zinedine Zidane admitted there is a problem with Hazard's fitness. He said: ""They're things that I can't explain. I want to be positive and hope that it's not too much of a problem. ""Something's up, because he was never injured in his entire career (before joining Real) or there were very few injuries. It's something new. ""I can't really give any more of an explanation. We want to help him and hope he's back as soon as possible. ""We're going to try and figure out why it's happening (the club's injuries), but right now we can't explain it. We've spoken about things like the lack of pre-season, amount of games and the mental aspect."" Hazard's fall from grace is sad to see considering he was a world class player during his time with Chelsea. Seven years in England saw him win two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues as well as the FA Cup. Do you think Eden Hazard will ever find his form at Real Madrid? ",positive,liverpool,0

Unfortunately, their meet-up came post-match, directly after the right-back's tackle had injured Eden Hazard during a 2020 Champions League match between Real and Paris Saint-Germain. ""After the game, I'm in the hall and I see Florentino Perez,"" explained Meunier. ""I shake his hand and say 'Nice to meet you.' ""And then he answers in French: 'Nice to meet you? Do you realize you've hurt Eden Hazard? And you say to me, 'Nice to meet you?!'"" Meunier admitted he couldn't resist cracking up at this point, despite the tension of the situation, as he sought to defend himself. ""I said: 'I hurt Eden Hazard? So it's my fault he got hurt there?' ""He [Perez] said, 'Yes, yes, it's your fault!' I said, 'It's a duel like any other'... I didn't expect him to speak French, I didn't know. And he's still the president of Madrid, you see?"" Perez actually acts like he's in the Mafia :joy::joy: https://t.co/mkRFxTuYZC It sounds like Meunier, who joined Borussia Dortmund in the summer, will not be getting the offer to come to the Bernabeu anytime soon. However it wasn't just Perez's fury that Meunier had to deal with in the aftermath. The player had to disable social media notifications across his social media platforms as he was accused of reigniting Hazard's injury misery by irate Real Madrid fans. Thomas Meunier will never be forgiven https://t.co/71Mf5OQe8d Meunuer apologised immediately post-match for the tackle that caused the injury, saying: ""I am honestly sad. I tried to contact him [Hazard] directly after the match, but I couldn't reach him... I cross my fingers that it is not too bad. ""If there is one player who I really don't want to injure, it's Eden."" To be fair to Meunuer, he can't really be entirely blamed for the series of injuries that have restricted Hazard to just 28 Liga games in his two seasons at Real Madrid, as the former Chelsea ace has struggled to find his best form in Spain. Also, there's nothing to suggest any bad blood between the international teammates ahead of the start of Euro 2020. Although let's all just assume that Perez is still absolutely fuming.

The Daily Star claims that Phillips would be reluctant to leave Leeds for Manchester United, given the fierce rivalry between the clubs and the repercussions it would have for him and his family. The midfielder is being touted as a long-term replacement for Paul Pogba, should the Frenchman leave Manchester United at the end of his current contract. But Jurgen Klopp is also keen to bolster his midfield options too after registering an interest in Phillips. Former Leeds defender Danny Mills commented on a possible transfer to United last month, and believes Phillips would have no problems breaking into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team. ""Alan Smith went and I think the fans understood it but didn't particularly like it and some will never forgive him for that,"" Mills told Football Insider in quotes published by The Metro. ""I understand that because there will always be a bitter rivalry between the two. ""Would he fit in Manchester United's team? Would he play? Without a shadow of a doubt, yes. Would he improve them? Yes. ""Whether you like it or not as a Leeds fan, Manchester United are a global entity, you can't argue with that."" Any move is likely to be a big-money one, and is expected to be in the region of Â£60million - a premium price for one of the country's most exciting midfield talents. The 25-year-old has risen to prominence this year after a series of impressive performances for England at the European Championships, and Leeds are desperate to keep hold of one of their most prized assets. He is currently under contract at Elland Road until June 2024, but the club are keen to tie him down to a new and improved deal that would make him the highest-paid player in Marcelo Bielsa's squad. Talks have already begun between Leeds and Phillips' representatives, but the England international may be tempted with a move away in search of major honours, especially if Marcelo Bielsa leaves the club. Phillips has made a total of 220 appearances for the club and scored 14 goals. He has featured nine times across all competitions for the Whites this season, finding the net in a 3-0 Carabao Cup victory over Crewe Alexandra. It will be fascinating to see Phillips' next move come the end of the season. ",positive,liverpool,1

Loadingâ¦ Phillips is impressing at Euro 2020 and has helped the Three Lions to a first major tournament final since 1966. Former United striker Dimitar Berbatov has been impressed with Phillips' performances, for both Leeds and England, and he'd be interested in seeing him at Old Trafford. He told Betfair per the Mirror: ""Kalvin Phillips stood out again too [in the 2-1 semi-final win over Denmark]. ""He's been one of the players of the tournament and, sooner or later, I expect him to leave Leeds for a bigger club. ""Offers will come in for him after the tournament. He is playing with maturity, agility, knowing when to run with the ball and when to pass. ""I would like to see him sign for Manchester United."" The 25-year-old is adored by Leeds fans as well as manager Marcelo Bielsa, adopting the nickname of 'Yorkshire Pirlo' since debuting in 2014. United are reportedly in the market for a midfielder and need a long-term replacement for Nemanja Matic. Phillips' contract doesn't expire until 2024 and Leeds are in a solid position to not sell, after a top-half finish in the Premier League. He earned his first England cap back in September and many questioned his involvement in the Euro 2020 squad. Calls for manager Gareth Southgate to use more attacking-minded players saw Phillips criticised. However, he's formed a solid partnership with Declan Rice and both men are worthy of starting spots. Ashley Cole has been a critic in the past but admitted he was wrong following the Denmark game. He told ITV: ""It was brilliant to see these fans here, the families are here, the players are celebrating singing that great song [Sweet Caroline], it's just wonderful. ""It's emotional. I'll say it live on air, I had to get Kalvin Phillips here and say to him, 'you know what... big respect'.

Loadingâ¦ Villa manager Steven Gerrard is keen to bolster his squad and missed out on Rodrigo Bentancur in January, who chose to join Tottenham Hotspur from Juventus. The Times report next on the agenda is Phillips, who has been identified as a key target. Phillips has been limited to 12 Premier League appearances this season due to injury and his last came on December 5 against Brentford. The 26-year-old is a full England international and one of Leeds' most important players. Villa are prepared to smash their transfer record and offer Phillips wages totalling Â£10 million-per-year. Their current record signing is Emiliano Buendia, who cost Â£34 million from Norwich City last summer. West Ham United and Newcastle United have registered an interest in Phillips but it's believed Villa are ahead of other suitors. Manchester United have been mooted in the past, but Phillips' love for Leeds would make a transfer to their bitter rivals nigh on impossible. Phillips was named on the bench in Friday's dramatic 3-2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He didn't end up coming on as Jesse Marsch's side took another vital step towards Premier League safety. Jonny opened the scoring in the 26th minute before Francisco Trincao opened his Wolves account in the 11th minute of stoppage time. The game changed shortly after halftime however as Raul Jimenez was sent off. Jimenez was already on a booking and collided with Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier while chasing a loose ball outside his area. With Wolves down to 10 men, Leeds launched a stunning comeback just past the hour mark as Jack Harrison bundled the ball home. They were level three minutes later after Rodrigo smashed home a Dan James effort which had come back off the post. Luke Ayling popped up in injury time to volley home from close range and move Leeds up to 16th and seven points clear of the drop. It's their second late win in a row after snatching a 2-1 victory against Norwich City last weekend. Marsch was asked about Phillips being on the bench at full-time by Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville and his response left the duo in a fit of laughter. When asked about bringing him on, Marsch replied: ""No. To be honest with you guys he was never going to play!"" He then elaborated: ""We have injuries with a lot of our U23s guys from theManchester Unitedmatch in midweek, so we didn't have many players to put in the roster. Having Kalvin with the team, I think, was great, and even on the bench, he was fantastic."" ",positive,liverpool,0

It's expected that the club will make more moves in the January window and among those linked are Lille defender Sven Botman. The 21-year-old has impressed in France and helped Lille clinch the title over Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Newcastle have the joint worst defence in the top-flight this season and hope the Dutchman can offer some quality at the back. They've also been linked with moves for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Anthony Martial, who are unhappy at Arsenal and Manchester United respectively.

Loadingâ¦ Jones is in his 11th season at United, and was once touted as potentially being the club's best ever player by Sir Alex Ferguson, but things haven't gone well in the past two years. His most recent game for the club came in January 2020, when he scored in United's 6-0 win in the FA Cup against Tranmere Rovers, before he was out for 20 months with an injury. The centre back has returned to the substitutes bench in recent weeks but is yet to play for Ralf Rangnick, and could soon be on his way out of the club. According to the Daily Mail, Rangnick is ready to accept an offer for the 29-year-old, as he looks to cut his squad down before making any improvements to it. The paper claim that Benfica could be the surprise option for the former Blackburn Rovers defender, as they're currently looking for a loan move for a centre back. The Portuguese club made it through to the knockout stages of the Champions League, thanks to Barcelona's 3-0 defeat to Bayern Munich on Matchday Six. However they are currently four points behind title rivals Porto and Sporting and want a versatile defender to boost the squad. Jones' experience at right back and central midfield does in theory make him an option. The former England international, who played in the 2018 World Cup for Gareth Southgate's team, might have already played in the Champions League this season. He reportedly impressed Rangnick enough in training that the former RB Leipzig manager was ready to select him for the dead rubber against Young Boys. However Jones was not actually registered for the competition by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the beginning of the campaign, and Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic started the match in central defence. Rangnick could already be looking at a player to 'replace' Jones, with the interim manager being linked with a move for Antonio Rudiger from Chelsea in the summer. United have also been linked with Boubacar Kamara from Marseille, and a potential move for Julian Alvarez, both for January transfers. ",positive,liverpool,0

According to The Athletic, United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has been impressed by Jones since his arrival at the club and was planning to select the defender for Wednesdayâs dead rubber at Old Trafford, which ended in a 1-1 draw. However, Jones was not registered as part of Unitedâs squad for Europe and was therefore unable to feature in midweek. The 29-year-old struggled for opportunities under former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with his last first-team appearance coming against Tranmere in January, 2020. Loadingâ¦ However, Rangnick is said to have been impressed by Jones in training and has named the defender on the bench for the last two Premier League games against Crystal Palace and Norwich. According to the report, Jones has asked to play for Unitedâs Premier League 2 side against Chelsea on Friday night in an effort to boost his match fitness and first-team chances. Jones has already featured for the reserve side three times this season in games against Arsenal, Brighton and his former club Blackburn. Former England international Jones has struggled for fitness in recent years, with a serious knee injury keeping him out of the side for around 18 months. Speaking earlier this year, former boss Solskjaer praised Jonesâ commitment and defended him from criticism over his lack of first-team football. âPhil has had a horrible 18-19 months and probably a year before that as well with injuries,â Solskjaer told the clubâs website. âPhil is a no fuss, get-on-with-it type of guy. I know more than anyone how it feels to be injured at that stage. âHe's still not 30 years of age.

United were forced to shut down their Carrington training base on Monday after a number first-team staff and players returned positive tests. Rangnickâs side were due to face Brentford in London on Tuesday night but the match was called off late on Monday evening following a request from United.

The 29-year-old centre-back, who has been plagued with injuries throughout his 10-year spell at Old Trafford, pulled no punches towards his critics in an interview last month. ""I must be an easy target,"" he told The Times. ""Every footballer has a tag and unfortunately mine is, 'Let's have a laugh at him.' But -- and I say this in the nicest possible way -- I know who'll have the last laugh. ""I'm proud of my career and when it finishes and I'm enjoying my life -- and by the way I'm super fortunate that I'll be able to do that, because footballers are fortunate -- [the keyboard warriors] will still be in their mum's spare bedroom, sipping Diet Pepsi that's flat, eating a Pot Noodle, sitting in their boxers, tweeting."" Jones, who has endured years of abuse on the likes of Twitter and Facebook, has since given fans further insight into his decision to leave social media. ""I stepped away from social media a long time ago but it's difficult because all your friends read it, your family read it and they support you, they want the best for you,"" Jones told the UTD Podcast. ""They don't want to see their mate, their husband, their dad getting slaughtered all over the papers or all over the media, so it's tough because mentally I was going through a tough time and (then) to read stuff as well. ""It's difficult but it's something I've learned to deal with, especially over the time I've been at United and the more experience you get, the older you get, the better you learn to deal with those things."" In the interview with UTD podcast, the former England international said things are different for young players who have been brought up with social media - compared to his experiences coming through the ranks. ""I suppose for young players coming into the game now, not just at Man United, but all over the world, it's a very hostile, toxic place to come into and they've got to be able to deal with that mentally as well as physically. ""I look how the game's been developed over the last 10 years, and the way social media has developed and it's difficult to stay away from it. It's difficult not to get distracted by it (and) young players coming into the game, I think it's difficult for them not to read it. ""I know as a young player, that's the first thing you do: you come off the game and you want to see what people are saying about you and when you strip it all back in reality, it doesn't really matter what they say because they're notpicking the team."" Jones was also asked about whether he wanted to hit back at those critics. ""Good question,"" he said. ""I just feel like I'm better than that now, I'm wiser to it. ""Someone's dangling a carrot waiting for a bite. Like I say, it's been difficult, but I've learned to deal with it. For some reason, maybe, I get more than others but I'm sure everybody would say the same thing. ""But people would say that's part of being a footballer so [I] take it as it comes.""

Jones, who is under contract at the club until 2023, has been plagued by injuries since he joined the club from Blackburn Rovers and has struggled to get a place in the team in recent seasons. When Ferdinand was speaking on his podcast Vibe with Five, he said: ""He's taking up a youth team player's position in that squad right now. He's had too many injuries... I was in the same team as Phil Jones, he came from Blackburn as a young kid, everyone was saying he was going to be this great player. ""Huge potential but injuries have absolutely annihilated his career and then confidence issues at certain times as well. ""He's never been able to fully establish himself in the team. Whether it's injuries, lack of form, lack of confidence. I think he should've gone ages ago. He should've gone before Chris Smalling went. Find a new club and play some football."" Jones has only had two Premier League appearances for the club since 2019 and has suffered with a long-term knee injury since last summer. Despite his injuries, according to reports earlier this month, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to keep him around the club as a fifth choice centre-back behind Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly. Ferdinand added: ""He's lacked consistency throughout his career at Man United. That's a fact, for all the reasons I stated before. I am baffled at how he's still been given a new deal at the club given his past few years at the club. It just doesn't make sense to me how you get a new deal. ""I remember back in the day you'd have to do some absolute graft to get a new deal. You'd have to be putting in performances, you'd have to be a vital member of the team. Phil Jones isn't that... ""If I was in the squad with someone like that I wouldn't talk to them.

Jones, who has been out with knee problems since 2020, last featured off the bench for United in a 3-1 win against Tranmere in the FA Cup in January 2020. After finally recovering from his surgery last year, the former England international made his first appearance for the club in a behind closed doors friendly against Burnley on Tuesday afternoon. After the signing of Raphael Varane, many fans were lead to believe that Jones was surplus to requirements as Varane, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly would be ahead of him in the pecking order. However, as Axel Tuanzebe has gone on loan to Aston Villa, Solskjaer has looked to use Jones as one of his five centre-backs. As Jones looks to rebuild his career, United fans have reacted to the news on social media. Not even mad at it because we know he'll just get injured again & we'll never see him play Very much doubt it's through choice anyway... to sell you need a buyer and who in their right mind would gamble on Jones at the moment  Reckon I'm in the minority here, but I really hope he can rebuild. No player deserves the bad luck he's had, the talent he showed at Blackburn had many clubs excited. Would be nice to see him get back to full fitness and sustain it and as one of our players I'll back him  Whilst Jones was involved in the friendly on Tuesday, United's new signing Raphael Varane was not able to play which has put doubt on whether he will feature against Southampton this weekend.

However, a move to St Jamesâ Park failed to materialise for the England international, with Dubravka unwilling to replace him as back-up to De Gea. Dubvraka started for Newcastle on Tuesday night as they beat Everton 3-1 in the Premier League. Henderson, meanwhile, made only his third appearance of the season on Friday as United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough in the fourth round.

The Frenchman's agent, Philippe Lamboley, says his client ""just wants to play"" after struggling for game time this season. Martial has scored 79 goals in 268 appearances during six largely disappointing years at Old Trafford. He made the best-possible start to life in the Premier League after scoring on his debut against Liverpool, but the highs have since been few and far between for the 26-year-old. A departure now seems imminent, and the Mirror has identified Newcastle United, Barcelona, Arsenal and Paris Saint Germain as the four clubs that could secure his signature. Newcastle have the funds to make the move a reality, as they seek to use their newly-found wealth in a bid to move away from the Premier League's bottom three. The Magpies are expected to spend big in January and could offer the forward guaranteed first-team football, but their absence from European competition may hinder their prospects of making a deal. Barcelona are in a financial crisis, but the cash-strapped Catalans still have the pulling power to attract players based on their name alone. They are also in desperate need to bolster their forward line given Sergio Aguero's health issues, but will probably need to sell players first in order to fund a deal. Meanwhile, Martial could end up moving to Arsenal with the futures of Alexander Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both in doubt. Lacazette is expected to leave the Emirates at the end of the season, while Aubameyang's issues off the pitch have contributed to alarming slump in form and has seen him stripped of the captaincy. The Gunners have been linked with a move for Martial in the past, and could rekindle their interest in him given the situations surrounding Lacazette and Aubameyang. Paris Saint Germain has also been tipped as a next destination, with the club set to lose Kylian Mbappe at the end of the season. Martial would reportedly be open to a return to France, and help fill the likely hole left by Mbappe's likely departure in the summer. It will be fascinating to see where he ends up next.

The Spanish giants, who were recently drawn against United in the last 16 of the Champions League, are said to be admirers of the France international. Eurosport claim Atletico have been given encouragement that Martial will be available in January and the Spanish club are expected to discuss the matter with United later this month. Loadingâ¦ It is believed Atletico will offer United the opportunity of a swap deal if the Premier League club are interested in any available players at the Wanda Metropolitano. Martial has found himself out of favour this season and has made only 10 appearances in all competitions, scoring just once. He still has at least three years left on his contract at Old Trafford, having signed a new deal in 2019 that includes an option to extend for a further year. However, he is expected to seek a move away from the club in January. Speaking earlier this month, Martialâs agent Philippe Lamboley said the French forward wants to leave Old Trafford after becoming frustrated by his lack of game time. ""Anthony wishes to leave the club in January,â Lamboley told Sky Sports News. ""He just needs to play. He doesn't want to stay in January and I will speak to the club soon."" Newcastle United, Arsenal, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have also been linked with a January move for the 26-year-old. This week United interim manager Ralf Rangnick was asked about Lamboleyâs claim that Martial wants to leave, and replied: âI don't communicate with agents via the media and press. âThe player hasn't spoken with me or us about it.â One player touted a potential option for a swap deal involving Martial is Atletico defender Kieran Trippier. Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo claims United were keen to sign Trippier in the summer and may make another approach for the England international in January. Trippier, 31, has made 83 appearances for Atletico since joining from Tottenham in 2019, and was part of the side that won the La Liga title last season. ",negative,liverpool,0

The 31-year-old is under contract until 2023 but a report from The Athletic suggests initial renewal talks have got off to a poor start. Sporting director Michael Edwards also doesn't see Henderson's renewal as a priority. It's a situation that is said to be 'complicated and sensitive' right now as the Reds look to renew other players first. Goalkeeper Alisson is close to agreeing a new deal, while Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are all players the club want to tie down. Liverpool are wary of letting a situation similar to former midfielder Gini Wijaldum develop. Wijnaldum left Liverpool for Paris Saint-Germain this summer after being left disappointed at his proposed wages and contract length. The Dutch international is 31, the same age as Henderson, who will be 33 when his current deal expires. Fenway Sports Group are said to be focused on younger players and don't want to table big deals for older stars. PSG and Atletico Madrid are two clubs said to be monitoring Henderson's status. Mauricio Pochettino is a fan, while former teammate Luis Suarez could play a role in Henderson moving to La Liga. Henderson spent this summer at the Euro 2020 with England and helped his country reach the final. Along the way, he managed to score his first goal in 4-0 victory against Ukraine. He said: ""It's been a long time coming. I felt one was coming. I thankfully managed to get on the scoresheet.

That is according to Jamie O'Hara, who insisted that he ""can't see Liverpool without Jordan Henderson."" Loadingâ¦ Henderson arrived at Liverpool in 2011 after the Reds splashed out a reported Â£20m to sign him from Sunderland. The England international initially struggled at Anfield, with Henderson admitting that the first year or two was a ""difficult period."" However, Henderson has since established himself as a crucial figure at Liverpool and was named club captain after the departure of Steven Gerrard in 2015. The Liverpool skipper lifted both the Champions League trophy in the 2018-19 campaign and Premier League title in the 2019-20 season. Henderson's long-term future at Anfield now remains uncertain after contract talks with Liverpool reportedly failed to progress. The Liverpool midfielder, whose contract expires in 2023, has been linked with both Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain this summer. O'Hara praised Henderson for taking on ""almost an impossible job"" of replacing Liverpool legend Gerrard as captain. However, the 34-year-old does not believe that Henderson will leave Liverpool this summer, saying it is ""his agent's job and the club's job to sort this out."" Speaking on talkSPORT, O'Hara said: ""Jordan Henderson can play for anyone, in my opinion. ""He's been absolutely brilliant over the last few seasons. He took over from Steven Gerrard to become the captain, and that's almost an impossible job, but Henderson has done that and he's been superb for Liverpool. ""I'd be really surprised if they don't get this sorted out, he is the captain, players look up to him, everyone talks about how much they love him and how big he is for the team. ""When he doesn't play for Liverpool... you could argue he's not their best player, which he isn't, but he's one of their most important players, without a doubt. When he plays, the team is better. ""When he got injured and he didn't play, they struggled. He is the driving force of that midfield. ""I can't see how Liverpool will just not get this sorted. There might be a situation where they've got to come to an agreement, whether it's money, the length of contract, but I think they'll get it sorted out.

The Gunners are among several clubs interested in signing Locatelli after he shone brightly for the Azzuri during this summer's European Championships. But Juventus are also said to be keen on a move for the 23-year-old and have reportedly bid Â£25m plus a young midfielder as they look to beat Arsenal to land the rising star. Mikel Arteta has made a new midfielder one of his top transfer priorities this summer, with Granit Xhaka on the verge of joining Roma. The north London outfit have also been heavily linked with the likes of Lyon's Houssem Aouar, but Locatelli appears to remain their first choice target. Just last week, Juventus had offered Sassuolo a player-plus-cash swap deal for Locatelli with midfielder Nicolo Fagioli used as lightweight in the deal. But Fagioli's representative Andrea D'Amico says the promising 20-year-old will not be leaving Turin any time soon. He told Sky Sport Italia: ""I think Massimiliano Allegri wants to see him [Fagioli] in training to understand if he can be useful during the season.

Despite Arsenal reportedly meeting Sassuolo valuation for Locatelli, the Gunners look set to be disappointed with Locatelli preferring to stay in Italy, according to the Guardian. According to the report, Locatelli wants to play in the Champions League next season, something Arsenal cannot offer after finishing eighth in the Premier League. Arsenal have not played in the competition for four years, with next season their first campaign out of Europe in 25 years - a key detail that will, inevitably, see them miss out on Locatelli.

I understand that at the start of the season, him having a go in pre-season to see how things plan out. âDe Gea has been excellent and thereâs no doubt about it, with the exception of the second goal you have to say against Manchester City, which I think heâll know that he should have saved. âBut I think from Dean Hendersonâs point of view, he needs to start looking after Dean Henderson. âNewcastle are a club who are on the go and on the move but they are also in a perilous position right now. âNew manager.

It was confirmed last month that Dean will hang up his whistle and retire from refereeing duties at the end of the 2021/22 campaign. No referee in the history of the Premier League has handed out more yellow or red cards thanthe Wirral-born official, who has taken charge of 554 top tier games since his debut in 2000. Since deciding it was time to call it a day, Dean has spoken in depth about his career. For example, he revealed that he was 'nervous' and 'scared'of making a decision in games with big players in the early days, and referencedRoy KeaneandPatrickVieiraâ before eventually overcoming his fears. Now, the 53-year-old has spoken about the most indimidating manager during his 22 years at the top â and surprisingly, Sir Alex Ferguson does not get much of a mention. In fact, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was the man he named as the most intimidating. ""It has to be Arsene [Wenger] when he was at Arsenal,"" Dean told BBC Sport when asked who the most intimidating person to deal with was. ""I always found it tough, not refereeing Arsenal in general but refereeing Arsenal when he was the manager. It was just his presence - he wanted the best for Arsenal all the time and if he could get any way of getting one over you he would do. ""Since he has finished football I have seen him and he has been great. Cross the white line and everyone is different, like referees. We are normal people."" ð£ ""I did fight very hard with David Dein many years ago that the referees become professional, but their level, unfortunately, doesn't go up.""Arsene Wenger speaking about Mike Dean in 2017 pic.twitter.com/SgamZ6osvH Wenger reacted to Dean's admission while on punditry duty for bEIN Sports and well, he couldn't quite believe it. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger on Mike Dean sending him off at Old Trafford:""He still doesn't know why! Nobody could ever explain to me why and they apologised to me after that.""pic.twitter.com/d1ecSb1KaO The Frenchman said: âIs somebody behind me? Are you making jokes tonight? Iâm not very proud of that!"" Richard Keys, who presents the show, then brought up the famous moment when he was sent to the stands at Old Trafford. âHe still doesnât know why. When I was standing in the middle of the stands,"" Wenger added. âI didnât know where to go, nobody told me where I could go and when I went up they told me I had to go to the stands. When I arrived at the stands, of course, there were no free seats so I had a double problem. ""First of all, I didnât know why I was sent off and nobody could ever explain to me because they apologised after that but, as well, I didnât know where to go.â Gordon Strachan's hilarious commentary on Wenger being sent to the stands at Old Traffordððð pic.twitter.com/JstpSPHdcH ",positive,liverpool,0

The 80-year-old Scot, who enjoyed a trophy-laden 26 year spell at Old Trafford, was handed a club ambassador'srole at United when he retired from the dugout â and it's a job that earns him Â£2 million for 20 days of work per year. That's according to The Sun, who claim Ferguson's investments, book deals and public appearances see his total income rival a top Premier League player. Loadingâ¦ The report suggests Ferguson netted Â£12.2 million last year, with the overall value of his personal companies rising to Â£40 million. In fact, according to the latest figures from his company ACF Sports Promotions, his assets rose from Â£17.5 million to Â£26 million in 2021. In addition to his total assets that are worth Â£39.2 million in firms registered at Companies House, the 80-year-old has enjoyed huge success from Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography â a book that has sold millions of copies worldwide since its release in 2013. My Autobiographywas the second official autobiography ofFerguson and covered the period from 2000 to 2013. He spoke about his relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo in the book, as well as his relationship with the likes of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane. He also revealed how to stop seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi after their defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final. ""You need centre-backs who are prepared to drop right on top of Messi and not worry about what is happening behind them,"" he said. ""He will drift away to the side. That's fine. He's less of a threat on the side than he is through the centre. After the inquest I told myself: 'When we play Barcelona next time in a Champions League final, I would have Jones and Smalling, or Smalling and Evans, right on top of Messi. I wasn't going to let him torture us again."" The Sun also claim that Ferguson earns Â£100,000 a year from motivational talks. ",positive,liverpool,0
1009,https://www.sportbible.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson-brought-himself-on-in-friendly-was-sent-off-20220404,"Sir Alex Ferguson Brought Himself On In Friendly, Was Sent Off Immediately","Sir Alex Ferguson was prone to losing his head, whether it be at players or officials. After all, the phrase ""hairdryer treatment"" was pretty much invented because of him. He was given 17 touchline bans in 26 years asManchester Unitedmanager but our favourite story about Fergie having a rush of blood came during his time as manager at St Mirren. Loadingâ¦ St Mirren was Ferguson's second managerial job after his short stint in charge of East Stirlingshire. In 1976, Ferguson, having only retired from football a couple of years prior, took his St Mirren team on a three-week pre-season tour of the Caribbean. As per Thore Haugstad, writing inFour Four Two,the trip came about because former chairman Harold Currie, had business links in the trading of whisky. But it wasn't just a big three-week bender for Fergie's men as they participated in some friendly games, one being against the Guyana national team ahead of a big World Cup qualifier that was on the horizon. The story goes that the Guyana team were not taking it easy at all, their centre-half being very rough and ready with the Saints' young Robert Torrance - something that angered Ferguson and prompted him to remonstrate with the referee from the touchline. When Torrance was done in again by the same player just before half-time, Fergie's head went and he wanted a piece of the defender. ""That's it, I'm coming on,"" Ferguson told his right-hand man David Provan. ""That big bastard is taking liberties."" Provan and Ferguson had both been kitted as substitutes for a laugh but now that things had got real, the former Rangers wanted in and would not let his assistant stop him from doing so. He entered the fray and when the next cross came in, Ferguson exacted ""a bit of revenge"" on the defender, leaving him ""squealing"" - according to the man himself. When they went at it again, Ferguson left it on the centre-back one more time and the referee swiftly gave him his marching orders. After the game, Fergie, still an extremely young manager at the time, told his players to keep tight-lipped about what had happened and they obliged. That wasn't the only time Fergie brought himself on in a friendly over in the Caribbean. In 1987, in the middle of his first full season as United manager, the Red Devils played Bermuda and a 45-year old Ferguson, along with his assistant Archie Knox, 40, were introduced for the final 25 minutes. According toYahoo Sports,Knox scored a 35-yard screamer for the final goal of the game, while Ferguson, comfortably the oldest player on the pitch, went close with a header in a 4-2 victory.

A split-second of pristine silence momentarily gripped the stadium before his shot hit the back of Paddy Kennyâs net, sparking delirium in the stands. Aguero had done it. City had snatched the title away from bitter rivals Manchester United in the most dramatic of circumstances. And commentator Peter Drury was tasked with doing the moment justice. âStaggering! Just staggering! Heâs won the league with 90 seconds of stoppage time to play! âDrama of the ultimate type! Tears of distress turn to tears of unbridled joy!â Somehow, amid the euphoria breaking out around him, Drury kept his head and delivered those famous lines on the greatest goal in Premier League history. âIn the moment I suppose itâs just very instinctive,â Drury tells SPORTbible ahead his stint in the commentary box for Amazon Prime Videoâs Premier League December coverage. âThose are the moments that all of the ordinary moments prepare you for, and you just hope it goes well. âI canât speak for others that have had similar moments but itâs funny â you hear it back afterwards, or not even necessarily hear it back, you leave the stadium and you can be engulfed by self-doubt. âYou think, I hope that was alright, I hope I shouted the right name. All of those things, I suppose, are parallel to what sportspeople go through. âWill I be able to deliver? Did I deliver? Was it as good as I hoped it was? âThose are the high-risk moments because if you do get one wrong, itâs there forever. Thatâs the thing about live broadcasting, there is no safety net. Once youâve said it, itâs out there. There is no sub-editor. âSo you just give thanks if you get away with it cleanly.â Agueroâs dramatic winner would usher in a period of remarkable success for both City and the Argentinian striker, who would go on to win four more Premier League titles at the Etihad before moving to Barcelona ahead of this season. In a cruel twist of fate, Aguero was forced to retire earlier this month at the age of 33 due to a heart condition, having managed only five games for the Catalan club. While he was denied the chance to become a hero at the Nou Camp, Aguero remains revered at City where scored an incredible 260 goals in 390 games. âFor the Premier League, he is emblematic,â added Drury. âHe scored the goal of goals in the history of the Premier League, there is no escaping that. âMaybe not the history of all of football, although it arguable that you would struggle to build a top 10 ahead of his goal. âBut that is just one goal, and he scored hundreds and hundreds of them. âI donât think thereâs any doubt that were periods in his career when you would select him, as the supporter of any club, when asked the question: âWho do you want in your team?â â âWeâll have Aguero please!â. âHe just scored. He scored spectacularly, he scored simply. Whatâs more, it seems to me that he did so as a thoroughly decent human being. âYouâll struggle to find anyone who has a bad word to say about Sergio Aguero. The people who knew him say he is a lovely, humble man who came to work, did his thing brilliantly and went home again. âYou ask about his place in the history of the Premier League? He is absolutely up there.â While Aguero is rightfully viewed as one of the great forwards of the modern era, Drury could claim to be the current king of commentary â if he wasnât so modest. Earlier this month he was named the Football Supporters' Association Commentator of the Year for the second time in his career. But the 54-year-old insists heâs âflabbergastedâ by his popularity. âIt feels surprising to be honest. Itâs a lovely thing, I canât deny it,â added Drury. âIâm flattered by it, pleased by it. I try to give great respect to it because itâs voted for by fans, which is great. âBut with respect to whether itâs important in my head, I donât take it too seriously because there are some very good commentators out there. âIf what Iâm doing resonates with people then that is obviously a nice thing. I donât set out to do that. Iâm just very lucky that I do a job where I can express myself and enjoy football, and who wouldnât love that? âAll I am is an enthusiast and if my enthusiasm somehow echoes with fans then that is a brilliant thing. It does mean a great deal that fans vote for it and leaves me a bit flabbergasted, Iâm really, really touched by it. âAnyone in any job knows that if somebody gives you a tick and says that youâre doing okay, that is a really reassuring moment. Peter Drury has done it again - winning the #FSAawards Commentator of the Year Award for the second time.Congratulations Peter! pic.twitter.com/oOGWq2VgGB âAs commentators we speak out into the ether. We speak to a lot of people and yet we speak to nobody, in a sense, so to get that feedback is very rare and precious.â It is easy to understand why Drury has won so many plaudits with his eloquent, poetic style of commentary. From describing Kostas Manolas as âThe Greek god in Romeâ after the defenderâs late goal for Roma against Barcelona in 2018, to his exuberant reaction to Wayne Rooneyâs famous overhead kick in the Manchester derby, Drury always seems to get the big moments right. When asked to select one memory which stands out to him from his career, Drury names Siphiwe Tshabalalaâs goal for 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa in their tournament opener against Mexico. âThat was a very, very special day [but] Iâm always worried when I recall it that Iâm going to sound sort of saccharine about it,â admits Drury. âIâm not just trying to say the right thing for the benefit of this conversation. It is genuinely true that walking up to the stadium that day, there was a sense of pride and togetherness and happiness in Johannesburg, where blacks and whites were smiling and entering the stadium together, and there was a unity about a hitherto massively divided nation. A genuine joy that the World Cup had come to Africa. âI remember saying then that if you could bottle that mood and somehow retain it, the world has cracked it. In a few short minutes that day you felt the world had cracked it. âThen this boy from Soweto scored a worldie, beyond anything else that Iâve been lucky enough to see and commentate on. That is still the moment that puts the hairs up on the back of my neck. âIt was just a beautiful moment.â It is hard to picture Tshabalalaâs goal without Druryâs commentary, rising above the noise of countless vuvuzelas. âTshabalala! Goal Bafana Bafana! âGoal for South Africa! Goal for all Africa!â However, Drury is reluctant to take any credit for the iconic moment. âI really do think that a commentator has to remember that nobody turns on the telly for the commentator, they turn it on for the football,â added Drury. âSo if you happen to be the commentator when something remarkable happens, that remarkable thing isnât you â it was him. âAguero scored the goal, Manolas scored the goal. I didnât. I was just the bloke who was fortunate enough to be sat there watching it happen. âSo Iâm really, really wary about suggesting that a great sporting moment is in any sense my sporting moment. Itâs not. I was just there telling the story.â Amazon Prime Video will be broadcasting 10 Premier League fixtures between 28th â 30th December, including Leicester vs Liverpool, Chelsea vs Brighton and Arsenal vs Wolves. Peter Drury will provide commentary at the Brentford vs Manchester City fixture on December 29th, alongside Ally McCoist as co-commentator. ",positive,liverpool,1

The former Manchester United star could -- and would -- captivate people around the world with his ability to find the back of the net, with an unbelievable ability to curve the ball and the accuracy needed to create some of the most memorable moments in football history. And that's exactly what happened 18 years ago today. Beckham's stunning strike against Greece allowed England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and the rest is history. The stage was perfectly set for the England international at Old Trafford. Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson's side were losing to Greece 2-1 and were desperate for a miracle that would avoid them from taking on Ukraine in a play-off match. So, it was only fitting for Beckham to step over the ball during injury time and, well, the rest is now history.

Before the 2002/03 season Premier League clubs could buy players at any time before March 31st. Since then teams have only been able to make signings between July and September and again in January. These windows work out differently but leaves teams having to make do with what they've got for several months. This summer United were expected to make the big signing of Jadon Sancho but, with less than two weeks left of the window, that doesn't seem likely to happen now. A failure to get Sancho, or improve several other parts of the squad, would make this one of United's worst summer windows, so we decided to rank the ones that have gone so far from worst to best. 18. 2013/14 season - In: Marouane Fellaini, Out: Paul Scholes - Sir Alex Ferguson tried to sign Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale before retiring, then David Moyes pulled the plug on a move for Thiago Alcantara, signed Fellaini for more than his release clause and missed out on Leighton Baines. It set the tone for what was to come. 17. 2009/10 season - In: Antonio Valencia, Mame Biram Diou, Gabriel Obertan, Michael Owen, Out: Cristiano Ronaldo - There were a couple more departures but replacing Ronaldo with those four players was the headline. The fact United only finished a point behind champions Chelsea shows how good Fergie was, and how stacked the squad already was. 16. 2014/15 season - In: Angel de Maria, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Falcao, Out: Danny Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa, Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Wilfried Zaha - Louis van Gaal's revolution didn't exactly go according to plan. Di Maria broke the club's transfer fee record and would be sold a year later for a loss. 15. 2018/19 season - In: Fred, Diogo Dalot, Lee Grant, Out: Daley Blind, Sam Johnstone, Michael Carrick - United finished second under Jose Mourinho and the club failed to build on their season. A versatile defender, third choice goalkeeper and deep midfielder were replaced like-for-like and Mourinho missed out on his top priority centre back. By December he was sacked. The scenario feels all too familiar this summer. 14. 2010/11 season - In: Bebe, Chris Smalling, Chicharito, Out: Zoran Tosic, Ben Foster, Gary Neville - The only time Fergie signed a player he'd never watched and Bebe proved why. The fact they went on to win the league after this window shows how good the side was, and how good the manager was. 13. 2015/16 season - In: Anthony Martial, Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay, Matteo Darmian, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sergio Romero, Out: Angel di Maria, Chicharito, Jonny Evans, Robin van Persie, Nani, Rafael - In letting Jonny Evans and Rafael go, Van Gaal sold two players who United would arguably not have better than until last summer when they signed Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Martial was the only saving grace of an awful window. 12. 2019/20 season - In: Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Dan James, Out: Romelu Lukaku, Matteo Darmian, Antonio Valencia, Ander Herrera - Maguire and Wan-Bissaka have improved Solskjaer's defence, even wit criticism of Maguire, but James has been a dud and the major improvement didn't come until Bruno Fernandes arrived in January, Ed Woodward could have signed him the previous summer. 11. 2017/18 season - In: Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic, Victor Lindelof, Out: Adnan Januzaj, Wayne Rooney - Lukaku didn't last long but his impact, especially in that first season, helped United to a second place finish, the best they've done post Fergie. 10. 2016/17 season - In: Paul Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Out: Paddy McNair, Tyler Blackett, Will Keane, Victor Valdes - Mourinho lost no one of any note and brought in four players who improved the side. Zlatan led United to the Europa League and League Cup double, and of course in Jose's eyes the Community Shield made it a treble. 9. 2008/09 season - In: Dimitar Berbatov, Out: Gerrard Pique, Chris Eagles, Mikael Silvestre, Louis Saha - It took all summer to get Berbatov from Spurs and no one else joined. United still won the league by four points and reached the Champions League final, the team was that good. Losing Pique was a blow long term. 8. 2011/12 season - In: David de Gea, Phil Jones, Ashley Young, Out: John O'Shea, Gabriel Obertan, Wes Brown, Owen Hargreaves, Paul Scholes, Edwin van der Sar - The 2008 Champions League winners were on there way out, Fergie moved to replace Van der Sar quicker than he managed with Schmeichel. United lost the league on goal difference local rivals Manchester City. 7. 2012/13 season - In: Robin van Persie, Shinji Kagawa, Nick Powell, Angelo Henriquez, Alex Buttner, Out: Dimitar Berbatov, Park Ji-Sung, Ritchie de Laet, Paul Pogba, Michael Owen - This transfer window was 90% about getting in Van Persie, beating City to his signature. The forward gave Fergie one last league title before calling it a day. Not playing Pogba and allowing him to leave for nothing would comeback to kick the club in the arse before too long. Loadingâ¦ 6. 2006/07 season - In: Michael Carrick, Tomasz Kuszczak, Out: Ruud van Nistelrooy - Not too much in this window but Carrick became such an important part of the side that this window ends up high on the list. 5. 2002/03 season - Rio Ferdinand, Ricardo, Out: Dwight Yorke - Another summer where only one signing really makes a difference and again a striker who had previously been magic left. Ferdinand would go on to create the best defensive partnership in Premier League history with Nemanja Vidic. He'd just come off the back of a huge World Cup for England when he signed. 4. 2003/04 season - In: Cristiano Ronaldo, Kleberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Out: David Beckham, Juan Sebastian Veron - Ronaldo saves this transfer window but he was so good that it's saviour enough for a top four spot. Has any summer window seen two as contrasting signings as Ronaldo and Djemba-Djemba? One a five time Ballon d'Or winner, including one at Old Trafford, one so bad they named him twice. Loadingâ¦ 3. 2005/06 season - In: Park Ji-Sung, Edwin van der Sar, Ben Foster, Out: Phil Neville Kleberson - It took six years but Fergie finally replaced Schmeichel, and for some Van der Sar was a better keeper. Park was also a hugely important and underrated signing. 2. 2004/05 season - In: Wayne Rooney, Gabriel Heinze, Alan Smith, Gerard Pique, Liam Miller, Out: Nicky Butt, Diego Forlan - Any window you bring in the club's all time top goal scorer is a pretty good one. Rooney came in after the Euros. Fergie wanted to wait another year before signing him but a bid from Newcastle forced his hand. Heinze and Smith were cult heroes at the club for a short time too. 1. 2007/08 season - In: Anderson, Nani, Owen Hargreaves, Carlos Tevez, Out: Gabriel Heinze, Giuseppe Rossi, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson, Tim Howard - Tevez and Hargreaves were the final pieces in Sir Alex Ferguson's latest incredible rebuilds. The team won the Champions League and Premier League double at the end of the season and won the league three years in-a-row. Nani hit the ground running and was a good signing for United throughout and even Anderson, much maligned later, was very good in his first season and even scored in the final shootout against Chelsea in Russia, having come on for about 30 seconds before the end of extra time. A hell of a summer. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Switzerland international has entered the final 12 months of his contract with the Bundesliga side, and club chief Max Eberl has admitted that he is seeking a move away this transfer window. Zakaria's contract situation has, understandably, alerted several top clubs to his availability, with reports suggesting that bitter north London rivals Arsenal and Spurs will go head-to-head over his sought-after signature. German outlet Bild claims that Monchengladbach are prepared to sell their midfield maestro for a fee in the region of Â£17m. Monchengladbach were originally thought to want Â£33m for the 24-year-old, but his injury woes and contract situation have seen the German outfit drastically reduce that price. Since 2017, Zakaria has scored nine goals as well as assisting seven from 128 games in a Monchengladbach shirt and even made two appearances for the Swiss during this summer's Euro 2020. The 24-year-old has been attracting attention from some of Europe's biggest sides in the past few seasons. Manchester United, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool are reported to have been monitoring the Swiss ace's form and performances. Both Arsenal and Spurs could use more depth in their midfield next season and Zakaria could be a useful option, but which north London club will entice him the most? Watch this space.

The Irish started the group in poor fashion after two opening defeats and now face a daunting trip to Cristiano Ronaldo and co. On the face of it, the Republic of Ireland could be in for an extremely tricky evening, but there will be little temptation in backing Portugal to win at a short price of 1/5. Stephen Kennyâs side have only won once in their last 14 matches and that was against a poor Andorra side, leaving the Portuguese as the overwhelming favourites to win this one. Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Portugal vs the Republic of Ireland to get your teeth stuck into. Portugal are 1/5 to win, with the Republic of Ireland priced at 16/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 5/1. Prediction: 3-0 (5/1) Half-Time/Full-Time: Draw/Portugal (5/2) Given the attacking talent in the Portugal squad, expansive football has been demanded of head coach Fernando Santo for some time now. And considering that the Republic of Ireland haven't won any of their last 13 competitive matches - only scoring five times in that run - we're backing the Portuguese to lead from the first to last whistle on Wednesday night. First Goalscorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (6/4) Barring their 1-0 defeat to Belgium in the European Championships, Portugal have been involved in some high-scoring affairs. And following Ronaldoâs sensational move to Manchester United confirmed on Deadline Day, weâre backing the 36-year-old to come into the game in his usual goal-scoring mood. Win to Nil: Portugal (8/11) Republic of Ireland last played Portugal in a 5-1 defeat back in 2014 - and weâre backing a similar outcome on Wednesday evening. While the Portuguese are winless in their last three matches, it has been against very strong opponents - a label that canât be said for Kennyâs men. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Ricardo Pereira's long road back to international football looks set to continue a little while longer following his hamstring injury at the weekend, while Ronaldo will have his sights on a record-breaking 110th international goal. Still going strong as the ripe age of 38, Pepe will hope to resume his partnership with Ruben Dias at the back, with Bernardo Silva and Diogo Jota providing support to Ronaldo. The Republic of Ireland have welcome uncapped defenders Nathan Collins and Andrew Omobamidele to the group for the first time, but will be without experienced midfielders James McCarthy and Robbie Brady. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Darren Randolph has also been left out, meaning that Kenny must choose between international novices Gavin Bazunu, Mark Travers and Caoimhin Kelleher. ",positive,liverpool,0

Having reached the halfway stage of Group A in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, Ireland are in a precarious spot - remaining winless in their four matches. After gaining their first point of the campaign at the weekend, they sit nine points behind Tuesdayâs opponents Serbia, who sit in the top spot following an impressive start. On the face of it, Stephen Kennyâs men will be more than aware that they will need to push for all three points to have any chances of reaching Qatar next year.

Republic of Ireland are 3/1 to win, with Serbia priced at 1/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 11/5. Prediction: 1-3 (18/1) Match Result and Both Teams To Score: Serbia and Yes (5/1) Irelandâs faltering campaign continues with a home tie against leaders Serbia at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin and we fear they might have a tough evening ahead of them. When these two sides met in March for qualifying, both teams scored and Serbia won the fixture, with Aleksandar Mitrovic scoring a brace in a thrilling 3-2 triumph. First Goalscorer: Aleksandar Mitrovic (14/5) Having scored in all four of Serbiaâs qualifiers to date, Mitrovicâs seven goals make him the top goalscorer in the qualifying stages thus far. The Fulham forward scored twice against Luxembourg at the weekend and weâre backing him to keep adding to his tally by drawing first blood this evening. Under/Over Goals: Over 2.5 Goals (11/8) To say the very least, Serbiaâs games during the World Cup qualifiers so far have been thrillers, with their four games producing a staggering 17 goals. Delving into that statistic alone, weâre backing tonightâs fixture to be an open affair, especially with Irelandâs must-win attitude heading into it. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Ireland will be without the services of Seamus Coleman for this match through injury, meaning that there could be a start in the defensive back three for Andrew Omobamidele. Adam Idah is expected to lead the line again for the home side, while Conor Hourihane will be pushing for a start in the middle of the park. Mitrovic made it seven goals in his last four appearances for the national team when he scored twice against Luxembourg and he is likely to lead the attacking line again tonight. Other than that, head coach Dragan Stojkovic does not have any injury concerns at this stage, and it would not be a surprise to see the same starting line-up from Saturdayâs 4-1 success.

The Welsh savoured yet another Euro adventure in the summer, but tonightâs friendly with the Finns is all about building momentum, with the Dragons bidding to reach a World Cup for the first time since 1958. Robert Pageâs side didnât quite replicate their heroics of the class of 2016, however, their campaign was still a successful one after coming through a tough group with Turkey, Switzerland and eventual tournament winners Italy. There hasnât been much between these two nations in recent years, with Wales claiming six victories, Finland four and the other four meetings ending in stalemates. Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Finland vs Wales to get your teeth stuck into. Finland are 15/8 to win, with Wales priced at 13/8 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 19/10. Prediction: 0-1 (11/2) Half-Time/Full-Time: Draw/Wales (10/3) Wales will be looking to warm up for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers with a win when they travel to Helsinki to take on Finland in tonightâs friendly encounter. The opponents met each other twice in 2020 in the Nations League and Wales won both games and weâre backing the Welsh to continue that fine form and lead from the first to last whistle in this one. First Goalscorer: Gareth Bale (7/2) Gareth Bale walked away when he was asked about his international future following the last-16 defeat by Denmark at Euro 2020. Since then, though, Bale has since been named in Wales' squad for their World Cup qualifiers this month and weâre backing the Real Madrid outcast to silence his critics and draw first blood this evening. Win to Nil: Wales (3/1) Wales have found the net just three times in six matches, however, they did run out 1-0 winners at this ground in last yearâs Nations League meeting. Based on that performance alone, weâre backing the Welsh to have what it take to claim another victory in the Finns' backyard, all while keeping a clean sheet.

Prediction: 0-2 (11/2) Win to Nil: England/England (5/4) England last played Poland in a 2-1 triumph at Wembley in March thanks to a penalty from Harry Kane and a late winner from Harry Maguire. On the face of it, Polandâs goal at Wembley is one of only three that England have conceded in their past 15 matches and weâre backing the Three Lions to keep Robert Lewandowski at bay this evening. First Goalscorer: Harry Kane (13/5) Kane has 40 goals for his country and continues to close on Wayne Rooneyâs national record of 53 goals. The England captain will be confident that he can keep adding to his tally, too, especially against a Poland side who have only kept one clean sheet in the past 12 matches. Headed Shot On Target: Harry Maguire (11/8) During this summerâs European Championships, England conceded only twice - in the semi-final and final - and Maguire had an effort on target in every knockout game, bar the final. Last time out against Hungary, the Manchester United captain headed home Luke Shawâs corner for England's third and weâre backing him to be a threat in the air once again this evening.

Steve Hodge exchanged shirts with the Argentine legend in the Azteca Stadium, Mexico after he knocked Sir Bobby Robson's side out by scoring twice [and yes, one of those was the famous 'hand of god' goal]. In the build-up to that infamous 'hand of god' goal, Hodge had flicked the ball unintentionally to Maradona. But after the full-time whistle, he decided to ask Argentina's number 10 to swap shirts â despite the controversy surrounding England's exit. Hodge, who made 24 appearances for the Three Lions, recalled the meeting with Maradona in an interview with FIFA. âI thought, I wonât be here again. Iâll try and get a shirt,"" he said. ""I shook Maradonaâs hand. He was being mobbed by his team-mates. So I thought, âThereâs no point, just leave it.ââ After speaking to the media, Hodge then had a second chance encounter with Maradona. âAfter the interview, I went down, behind the goal, to the changing rooms. And as I went down, Maradona was walking with two of his team-mates. ""I looked him in the eye, tugged on my shirt as if to say âany chance of swapping?â, and he came straight across, motioned a prayer, and we exchanged shirts. And that was it. It was just as simple as that.â Best shirt swap of all time?Steve Hodge collecting Diego #Maradonaâs shirt in the Azteca Stadium on 22nd June 1986.At auction it might go for more than most players earned in their careers in that era.Footballâs equivalent to the Shroud of Turin.Just how much is it worth? pic.twitter.com/DBxfjHt9dZ Back in December 2020, Hodge told the BBC that he had spent an ""uncomfortable"" week fending off unwanted enquiries ever since the death of the legendary footballer at age 60. A sports memorabilia expert in the USplaced its value at around $2 million but the former Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and Leeds midfielder insisted the shirt was not for sale. ""I have had it for 34 years and have never once tried to sell it,""Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham.""I like having it. It has incredible sentimental value. ""I've had people knocking on my door non-stop and the phone's constantly ringing from every TV and radio station, and even foreign stations. ""It has been uncomfortable and it hasn't been nice. I have seen articles on the internet and there has been a bit of flak flying around saying I wanted a million or two million and am hawking it around for money. ""I find it disrespectful and totally wrong. It's not for sale. I am not trying to sell it."" But 16 months later, Hodge has changed his mind. He will soon part company with the famous jersey, with the auction set to end on Wednesday May 4 at 06:01 PM (BST). âI have been the proud owner of this item for over 35 years,"" Hodge said. ""It has deep cultural meaning to the football world, and Iâm certain that the new owner will have immense pride in owning the worldâs most iconic football shirt.â Sothebyâs, who will auction the shirt, have said the following: âThe âhand of Godâ is truly a singular moment not only in the history of sports, but in the history of the 20th century. âThe moment resonated far beyond the world of football, coming soon after the Falklands conflict, and has in turn inspired books, films, and documentaries. âMaradona is now remembered as one of the greatest to ever play the game of football â and this particular game is an instrumental part of his legacy.â ðð¶ð²ð´ð¼ ðð¿ðºð®ð»ð±ð¼ ðð®ð¿ð®ð±ð¼ð»ð®'ð ð­ðµð´ð² ð³ð¼ð¼ðð¯ð®ð¹ð¹ ð·ð²ð¿ðð²ð ð´ð¼ð²ð ðð½ ð³ð¼ð¿ ð®ðð°ðð¶ð¼ð».The current owner is former England midfielder Steve Hodge, who after years has decided to put it up for sale. ð§â½ï¸ pic.twitter.com/iFgOLa8cJI Sotherby's have estimated the shirt will bring between Â£4,000,000-Â£6,000,000, a sum that could break the current record for a game-worn shirt [Â£4.2 million for a Yankee's shirt belonging to baseball player Babe Ruth.] The greatest shirt swap of all time?

The all-time great, who was affectionately nicknamed âEl Pibe de Oroâ - The Golden Boy - during his career, proudly represented his national side for 17 years. Maradona was never afraid to show his passion on the international stage, with one incident at the 1990 World Cup in Italy a prime example. Diego Maradona's reaction to the Argentinean national anthem being booed during the 1990 World Cup Final. pic.twitter.com/Up2Qhw0uqX Loadingâ¦ After previously inspiring his nation to victory at the 1986 World Cup, which featured the infamous âHand of Godâ goal against England, Maradona and Argentina looked to defend their title in Italy four years later. Maradona was nearing the end of a seven-year spell at Napoli and may have expected to have received warm support from the home crowd. However, Argentina were given a frosty reception in their opening game against Cameroon, with the Italians instead choosing to support the African side. Argentina would lose the match 1-0 but would progress to the knockout stage of the competition, later meeting hosts Italy in the semi-finals. The match in Naples would end 1-1 with Argentina eventually winning 4-3 on penalties, with Maradona scoring his spot kick at the Stadio San Paolo. Argentina progressed to face West Germany in the final in Rome and understandably received a hostile reception from the home support. In footage that has resurfaced on Twitter, Maradona can be seen reacting angrily after the Argentinian national anthem is booed. The camera begins to pan across the Argentinian players, some of whom are stunned into silence by the ferocity of the crowd. The shot then focuses on Argentina captain Maradona, who is clearly incensed by the lack of respect. He appears to utter the Spanish phrase âHijo de putaâ twice, which roughly translates to âSon of a b***hâ. Maradona would not get the last laugh, however, as West Germany would go to win the final 1-0 thanks to a late penalty from Andreas Brehme. Maradona would later represent Argentina at one more World Cup in 1994 before eventually retiring from international football with an impressive record of 34 goals in 91 games.

Loadingâ¦ The footballing legend, who sadly died last year aged 60, features in EA Sports' title as an ICON card. He has three different variations all representing different parts of his career - but that is all set to change due to a trademark issue. According Infobae per Eurogamer, Sattvica, the company of lawyer MatÃ­as Morla, has had a trademark claim recognised by a judge. :rotating_light: Diego Maradona could be removed soon from #FIFA22  EA had negotiated the rights with the player's manager but an Argentinian court recognized a claim by Sattvica, Diego's lawyer company. EA Sports had reached an agreement with Maradona's former manager Stefano Ceci. However, it could not be proven that Ceci had the authority to sign such a document and it means Maradona could be removed from the game. The Napoli legend is also still in FIFA 21 and would see himself taken out of packs, SBCs and FUT Draft on both games. FIFA 20 saw EA Sports temporarily pull Marco van Basten from the game after saying 'sieg heil' which is German for 'hail victory' on live television. In other big changes coming to the franchise, EA Sports have hinted at a potential new name. The publisher announced in a press release last month that FIFA 22 had amassed 9.1m players and a whopping 460m matches played since its launch. However, EA Sports executive vice president Cam Weber made a bombshell admission that the publisher could rebrand the long-running FIFA franchise. ""As we look ahead, we're also exploring the idea of renaming our global EA Sports football games,"" he said. ""This means we're reviewing our naming rights agreement with FIFA, which is separate from all our other official partnerships and licenses across the football world.""

After three disappointing defeats in the final of the Copa America, as well as an agonising 2014 World Cup final loss, Messi finally lifted an international trophy this past weekend when La Albiceleste beat Brazil 1-0 at the Maracana. Loadingâ¦ Angel Di Maria scored the winner and Messi was overcome with emotion at the final whistle following many moments of heartache with the national team. The 34-year-old lit up the tournament in Brazil, with four goals and five assists in a wonderful campaign. It followed up a stunning individual season with Barcelona, where he scored 38 goals in all competitions. Plenty feel as though the Copa America win puts Messi in pole position to win a seventh Ballon d'Or and further cements his place as the best player of all time. But Kempes, who wore the iconic No.10 shirt for Argentina en route to winning the 1978 World Cup, is adamant that 'El Diego', a two-time World Cup winner, will always be the greatest to ever do it. ""Messi's great misfortune is that he came onto the scene immediately after Diego Armando Maradona. And Diego, a player who was idolised by everyone, is very difficult to eclipse,"" the 66-year-old told ESPN Mexico, as per The Mirror. ""If Messi wants to be better than Maradona... He will never achieve that even if he wins four consecutive World Cups. He still has not been crown a world champions. ""It doesn't matter how much he wins, or what he wins, he will never be able to be compared to what Diego did."" Messi and Maradona have regularly been compared to one another due to their eerily similar playing style and technical wizardry with the ball. In November, days after Maradona's passing, Messi paid tribute to his former coach by removing his Barcelona shirt and revealing an old Newell's Old Boys No.10 strip. When Maradona made his debut for Newell's, a five-year-old Messi was on the pitch beforehand doing kick-ups. Messi dedicated Argentina's Copa America victory, their first since 1993, to Maradona as well as the 45 million Argentines. ""This is for all, and of course also for Diego, who surely was supporting us from wherever he is,"" the six-time Ballon d'Or winner wrote on Instagram. ""In order to continue celebrating we have to continue taking care of ourselves. ""Let's not forget that there is still a long way to go to return to normality and I hope we can take advantage of this happiness to gain a little strength to fight the virus together.""

Loadingâ¦ Only last month, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland's football associations released statements confirming they would be bidding to host the men's Euros in six year's time. The decision came along with backing out of the running to host the World Cup two years' later, which will be the 100 anniversary games. With a joint Spain and Portugal bid being Europe's preferred option for the 2030 tournament, the five countries decided to switch to the Euros. Now, according to reports, it is likely to be a bid won completely unopposed, with the two other expected bids now dropping out of the race. Turkey were hoping to host but have been 'discouraged by senior football officials' and have also failed with bids for the 2016 and 2024 competitions. The only other bidder was Russia, and they have been banned from international sport, even by FIFA, and even if their invasion of Ukraine stopped and the ban was lifted it's unlikely that the tournament would be held there. That leaves the UK and Ireland bid to get the hosting role unopposed, with UEFA said to be okay with that as it would stop any uncertainty with hosting. The joint bid is said to give the European governing body stability following the Covid 19 pandemic that caused huge financial problems to many football associations. UEFA are said not to hold fears over the trouble that marred the final of Euro 2020 last summer at Wembley, despite the face the final in 2028 would also be at England's national stadium. Much of the blame of that night's issues has been put on the Met Police, there has also been consideration to it being England's first major final in 55 years and the ending of 18 months of lockdowns in the country. Whilst the formal bidding process is supposed to go on until September 2023, UEFA could officially award the tournament before then, as long as the UK and Ireland meet the technical requirements. Matches would take place in all five countries, though Northern Ireland could have an issue with Windsor Park's 18,500 capacity not meeting the usual 30,000 minimum required for a tournament. The tournament is likely to increase in size from 24 to 32 teams for 2028 so that could mean more stadiums hosting games as well. One other issue could be the automatic qualifying spots for hosts, as UEFA may not want to give up five to the UK and Ireland. No men's tournaments have been exclusively held on the British Isles since Euro 1996, with the Women's hosted in England in 2005 and set to be hosted there this year. ",negative,liverpool,0
1029,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-scotland-czech-republic-prediction-odds-20210614,Scotland Vs Czech Republic Prediction And Odds,"After 23 years of narrowly missing out, Scotland finally return to a major tournament this afternoon when they host the Czech Republic in their Euro 2020 opener. Steve Clarke's side qualified for their first major tournament since the 1988 World Cup, having overcome a strong Serbia side in a thrilling play-off penalty shootout. And Clarke's men will be desperate to get a win on the board before their massive grudge match against England at Wembley Stadium on Friday. As you can imagine, the atmosphere at Hampden Park in Glasgow this afternoon will, almost certainly, be electric. As the nation unites in search of glory, you can probably expect the bitter Celtic and Rangers fan rivalry tossed aside, too. According to the bookmakers, the favourites for the top two spots in Group D are England and Croatia. Write Scotland off at your own peril, though, they still have a great chance to shock their opponents or, at the very least, finish strong in third place. With this summer's tournament now in full swing, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Scotland vs Czech Republic to get your teeth stuck into. Scotland are 8/5 to win, with the Czech Republic priced at 19/10 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 2/1. Prediction: 2-0 (10/1) Half-Time/Full-Time: Scotland/Scotland (7/2) A home crowd for Scotland at Hampden Park in the heart of Glasgow should spur them onto victory which will follow on from their good form in their warm-ups. And after 23 years of narrowly missing out on major international tournaments, we expect the crowd to be on Scotland's side from the first to last whistle. With that said, Scotland to lead at half-time and to triumph by the 90th minute looks like a solid bet. To score anytime: Che Adams (13/5) Much like Jamie Vardy's astronomical rise up the footballing ranks, Che Adams looks set to replicate just that. Adams has already completed a fantastic football story from the non-league pits of the Northern Premier League in England to the Premier League - and now he looks to make a stamp on European Championships. Considering Adams was involved in 14 goals in the Premier League for Southampton last season, he is, surprisingly, priced at attractive odds to score anytime. The question is, though, can he compete on a world stage? Well, we certainly think so - and Adams to score anytime during Scotland's opener looks like it could be something already written in the stars. Request A Bet: Dykes to score, 4+ corners each team and Soucek to be carded (33/1) Lyon Dykes comes off the back of a successful season with Queens Park Rangers, having linked up well with their talisman Charlie Austin. As many QPR fans will know, Dykes is not a player that's afraid to go for goal - and we think him bagging a goal this evening is an absolute given. When paired with West Ham's Soucek to be carded - who can be a hot head at times - as well as each team to have four or more corners, we reckon 33/1 is too juicy of a price to miss. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org. Scotland have a full-strength squad heading into this afternoon's match and Steve Clarke will face some tough decisions of whom to include. Clarke is predicted to go with a back three, with Kieran Tierney likely to be among them. Competition for that position is fierce, with centre-backs Declan Gallagher, Grant Hanley, Jack Hendry, Scott McKenna and Liam Cooper all in with a shout of starting, too. Clarke will also have to choose whether to go with two centre-forwards or pair either Lyndon Dykes and Che Adams - with both in fine form for their respective clubs. Scotland's chosen striker - whoever it may be on the night - will, more than likely, be supported with an attacking midfielder in either Ryan Christie or Ryan Fraser. The Czech Republic have been forced to draft in Tomas Koubek - who joins the squad on Tuesday - after fellow goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka was ruled out with a back injury. Other than that, though, the nation are at full strength, with Slavia Prague defender Ondrej Kudela omitted from the squad as he serves a ten-match UEFA ban for racially abusing Rangers' Glen Kamara in a Europa League tie.

Sky Sports' Soccer AM decided to speak with fans ahead of the derby, pulling up one United fan for a question about the club. The fan was asked to name the ex-United player, which came after he said that he was ""very confident"" to take part in the segment as he has been a supporter for 30 years. Laura Woods showed him a picture of United legend George Best and, well, that's where it all went wrong for this fan. The supporter was startled at the picture and the Sky Sports presenter even tried to help out by giving him the former United star's initials. Check it out below. Unbelievable, right? United suffered a 2-0 defeat to their city rivals at Old Trafford, with Bernardo Silva scoring the opener in the second half and Leroy SanÃ© doubling their lead to seal all three points for Pep Guardiola's men. Fans heavily criticised United's formation in the match at one point, while Alexis SÃ¡nchez also had a night to forget after he came off the bench and made only one touch in 12 minutes. The reigning Premier League champions are at the top of the table with 89 points, with title-challenging rivals Liverpool one point behind them in second place. United, on the other hand, are in sixth place and are three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Despite their defeat to City, United boss Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r was happy with how his side responded from their 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Everton on Sunday. ""We got a great reaction from the players and the supporters,"" he told BBC Sport. ""You could see from the first minute that they wanted to show the crowd, who were incredible again. ""The first half was decent. We held our own and created chances with some efforts. Going into half-time, we know there was a lot of work to be done, but they won deservedly because they had too much for us. ""They are the best team in the country. They have set the standard in the last two seasons and I don't know how many points they've taken. ""What Pep Guardiola has done with his players is remarkable and we are so close to it -- in the vicinity -- so we feel it every day.

Ireland only faced two shots on target but 19-year-old Bazunu ensured he kept a clean sheet with a stunning stop 20 minutes into the game. Olivier Thill's strike from distance deflected off Josh Cullenand looked like it was nestling into the bottom corner.

The former Shamrock Rovers youngster is making serious waves as a goalkeeper but isn't getting ahead of himself and says he's merely doing the job. Speaking to RTE Sport, Bazunu said: ""The first half we struggled a bit, I had a bit more to do, had that one save to to make. That's my job in the team to make those crucial saves. ""I saw the hit from outside the box; it took a nick, but luckily it took a nick quite early so I was able to react to it and make a save.

Last month, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told Barca officials that he wanted to leave the Catalan giants, with reports emerging that he was set on playing for Manchester City. But after handing in a transfer request, the whirlwind saga took another twist when Messi eventually made the decision to stay put for another year to avoid a legal dispute. He opened up about wanting to leave Barcelona in an in-depth interview, where he discussed his fractured relationship with president Josep Maria Bartomeu and how he came to the decision of staying put. Messi later returned to training and on Saturday afternoon, he played in the club's traditional curtain-raiser - the Joan Gamper Trophy - against fellow La Liga side Elche. The 33-year-old wasn't at his scintillating best but played a key part in Antoine Griezmann's third minute opener, providing full-back Jordi Alba with a perfectly weighted through ball moments before the finish.

Tearing teams apart left right and centre en route to a historic treble win under Luis Enrique in 2015, their accumulative numbers were utterly ridiculous. In total, prior to the three-piece disbanding when Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record Â£198 million, they played 450 games together across three seasons and won two La Liga titles, three Copa Del Reys and one Champions League. In that time, they racked up 364 goals and 173 assists between them - which just highlights their unbelievable understanding on the pitch.

Ranked at the 7th place for the 2021 #ballondor :arrow_heading_down:@MoSalah :flag_eg:@LFC pic.twitter.com/Lm1SBq2U41 He's already bagged 17 goals this term, though his form was sadly not reflected in the Ballon d'Or standings. Six players finished ahead of the 29-year-old, including Messi who was asked about his counterpart following the ceremony. Speaking after winning his seventh award, he said: ""I don't know if the record is beatable. ""I just have to accept it but I'm not sure if it can be beaten."" On Salah, he added: ""Salah will have opportunities in the years to come. ""Both players [Salah and Lewandowski] are at their best at the moment and will have more chances to win it."" If Salah continues his goal-scoring ways and impresses at the Africa Cup of Nations at the start of next year, then he could be a strong contender for the coveted individual prize in 2022. Even though Salah has been hailed as the best player in the Premier League, Chelsea's Jorginho and N'Golo Kante as well as Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo finished higher than him in the rankings. Though the left-footed wonder did earn a better spot than the likes of Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne and Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe. While he didn't win the Ballon d'Or, Salah was named the winner of the 2021 Golden Foot award. ",positive,liverpool,2

After Ronaldo knocked Pele off his perch, there were suggestions that the 80-year-old had apparently updated his Instagram to claim that he remains football's record scorer with 1,283 goals in what was deemed to be a serious ""s**thouse"" tactic. However, the three-time World Cup winner took to Twitter to state that he did not change his bio. Here is how the rankings look after Ronaldo's goal: 10. Arthur Friedenreich - 554 goals 9.

Loadingâ¦ Ronaldo netted his 108th and 109th goals for Portugal during their 2-2 draw with France. It's taken him level with Daei, who scored 109 times in 149 appearances for Iran between 1993 and 2006. The 52-year-old took to Instagram and congratulated Juventus forward Ronaldo on his achievement. He said: ""Congratulations to @cristiano who is now one goal away from breaking the men's international goal scoring record. ""I am honoured that this remarkable achievement will belong to Ronaldo - great champion of football and caring humanist who inspires and impacts lives throughout the world."" Daei has held the record since 2000 but it looks like that'll come to an end this summer. Ronaldo has scored five times at Euro 2020 so far, managing to find the net in all three group games. He scored twice in a 3-0 victory over Hungary, opened the scoring in 4-2 defeat to Germany and grabbed another brace against France on Wednesday evening. The 36-year-old started his career as a winger before becoming a striker. Following an Â£80 million transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Ronaldo was slowly shifted into a central role. He's flourished there and now leads the line for Juve and Portugal. France qualified top of Group F and that means they'll take on Switzerland on Monday. Manager Didier Deshcamps said per Daily Echo: ""In terms of points, we are first. Maybe other teams gave a better impression than the French team but now it is a new competition that starts. ""The first match against Germany was really important for us and to win this one point against Hungary allowed us even before this match to be qualified but as I said to the players we don't want to do any calculations because we don't want to take any risks. ""We have seen everything could change very quickly in this group. Of course we didn't do everything well all the time and we can improve some things.""

The story goes that Dia had somehow tricked Saints boss Graeme Souness into thinking that he was the cousin of George Weah, who had just won the Ballon d'Or and World Player of the Year awards in 1995. He had also claimed he'd turned out for Paris Saint-Germain, had played 13 times for his country and scored for them. Loadingâ¦ But despite it all being completely fabricated, Dia blagged his way into a one-month contract and even made an appearance in the Premier League. On November 23 1996, Dia, wearing the No.33 shirt, replaced Matt Le Tissier in a home game against Leeds at the Dell after the Saints legend picked up a first half injury. But he was so bad he was substituted himself for Ken Monkou in the 85th minute in a 2-0 loss. It quickly became apparent that Dia was a fraud and he then had his deal rescinded after one cameo appearance. Le Tissier gave a priceless account of the legendary tale in his autobiography. ""It was unbelievable. He ran around the pitch like Bambi on ice,"" Le Tissier writes, as per the Liverpool Echo. It was very, very embarrassing to watch. Souness actually had to take him off again because he was actually that bad. ""I have no idea if he was George Weah's cousin or not. I don't think he was. He was just chuffed to get out on the pitch and play. I think it was a great wind up from someone who came up with this idea. ""He turned up the next morning for treatment on an injury, the physio was telling me. So Sunday morning he turns up, has a bit of treatment, he leaves and then we never see him again. He never came back. He just left. Nobody knows where he went. Never to be seen again. ""It was very odd. Not quite sure how a man of Graeme's experience fell for that."" The Ali Dia story is one of the greatest in football history, but you might be surprised to learn that similar has happened in the modern game. Earlier this year, Lithuanian side FK PanevÄÅ¾ys signed a player based on his profile on Wikipedia, even though it was all fake. They announced the signing of Barkley Miguel Panzo and going off their statement on their official website, thought it was a bit of a marquee signing. Panzo is a real footballer, in fact he is verified on Instagram, but a lot of the stats and information on his Wikipedia profile are not and it led to him getting his next career move. Not only is he listed as an Angola international, his page also stated that he played for QPR in the Championship between 2010 and 2012, scoring 45 goals in 36 games. Of course, it never happened.

1044,https://www.sportbible.com/football/the-worst-january-transfers-in-premier-league-history-20220118,The Worst January Transfers In Premier League History,"The January transfer window brings the opportunity for teams to push on with title races, the battle for European spots and to stay in the league, but transfers in the first month of the year haven't always gone well in the Premier League. Loadingâ¦ Whilst Bruno Fernandes, voted the best January signing ever, and Virgil van Dijk are particularly good examples of what can be done in January, managers are often explaining how difficult transfer business is at this time of year. Unless an absolute bargain presents itself, or your team are really desperate for a player, it's often best off waiting until the summer. With a clearer head outside of the drama of an ongoing campaign, and longer to decide who to sign, perhaps some managers would have avoided some of these mistakes. Since the January transfer window was introduced in 2003 there's been some real stinkers and we've compiled a list of the worst of the lot. 17). Joey Barton - It might seem somewhat harsh to include a free transfer on the list, but Barton's move on a free to Burnley, his second spell at the club, lasted just 14 league appearances and three months, before he was banned from football for 10 months. 16). Kim Kallstrom - For a generation of fans, Kallstrom was best known as a bargain signing on Championship Manager. He arrived at Arsenal win an injured back and played just four games in all competitions, though he did score a penalty in the FA Cup semi-final shootout. 15). Steven Caulker - Caulker started the season at Southampton on loan, lost 6-1 to Liverpool and the Reds thought they'd take him off the Saints' hands. He played three league games all as late substitute and played up front in them all! 14). Ben Davies - Another defender who joined Liverpool in the winter window. Davies was back up for the Reds injury crisis but hasn't played a single minute for Jurgen Klopp's team, he's now on loan at Sheffield United. 13). Oumar Niasse - After a Â£13.5 million move Niasse didn't score a single league goal in his first few months at Goodison Park. A new season brought a new manager for Everton and Ronald Koeman didn't play him all season. 12). Marvin Sordell - Bolton signed Sordell when they were in the midst of a relegation battle, the striker only played three times, didn't score, and the club went down. The following season he still only scored four times in the Championship. 11). Denis Suarez - Another Arsenal loanee, Suarez only played six times in all competitions for the Gunners and was paid Â£55,000-a-week during his spell there. He's since revealed he was injured for most of his time at the Emirates. 10). Jean Alain Boumsong - Boumsong moved from Monaco to Rangers on a free transfer in August 2004. He impressed so much that Newcastle paid Â£8 million for him five months later. On the contrary he did not impress at St James' Park and the Stevens inquiry into corruption in football even looked into the move, though it was cleared of wrongdoing. 9). Guido Carrillo - The striker had played under Manuel Pellegrino at Estudiantes so the Southampton manager paid Â£19 million for him. Two months later the manager was sacked and Carrillo didn't score a single goal in his spell at the club. 8). Wilfried Bony - After spending Â£25 million on the Swansea striker, Manchester City would have hoped Bony would help them win the league. Instead the title went to Leicester, Bony only scored twice for City, and four times the following season. 7). Savio Nsereko - You might be asking 'who?' which is why Nsereko is on this list. West Ham paid around Â£9 million for the forward, he played 10 games without scoring. Fiorentina paid â¬2.7 million for him six months later and sent Manuel da Costa to London too. Da Costa didn't fare any better as a Hammer and it was one big terrible mess. 6). Kostas Mitroglou - Fulham were attempting to stay in the Premier League so spent a record Â£12 million for him. He took until the end of February to make his debut due to injuries and fitness levels, played three times without scoring and they went down. 5). Juan Cuadrado - The Colombian arrived at Chelsea around Â£24 million but never impressed in 14 appearances, before moving to Juventus six months later. Part of his move to the Blues saw Mohamed Salah go on loan to Fiorentina. The Egyptian impressed enough to earn his move to Roma. Jose Mourinho might have been better off just playing Salah! 4). Fernando Torres - For Â£50 million Chelsea would have expected much more than 20 Premier League goals in 110 appearances. It never worked out for the striker at Stamford Bridge, but his Champions League semi-final winner means he's not higher up our list. 3). Andy Carroll - Liverpool needed to replace Torres so they splashed out Â£35 million on a striker with six months in England's top tier. Carroll, completely opposite to Luis Suarez who joined a day before, was a disaster at Anfield, scoring just six goals in a season and a half. 2). Philippe Coutinho - Okay this one is a bit of a cheat considering the transfer was out of the Premier League but considering he cost Barcelona Â£140 million and his best achievement whilst at the club was helping knock them out of the Champions League whilst on loan at Bayern Munich he needed to be included. Great business for Liverpool mind. 1). Alexis Sanchez/Henrikh Mkhitaryan - One of the worst pieces of transfer business in the Premier League era. Sanchez did nothing for Manchester United, after they beat rivals City to his signing, just months before he was available for nothing. The club gave him huge wages and he didn't live up to them or his reputation, scoring three league goals in 32 games before leaving for Inter Milan. Mkhitaryan went to Arsenal in the deal and the Armenian didn't fare too much better, though he did score more goals, before his move to Roma. All round the transfer didn't work out for anyone!

For this, we've put together some of the best FIFA 22 young ST and CF players. These are the ones you'll want to sign up nice and quickly when you lack firepower and want to solve this issue for the long term. Like the best wonderkids list, we're not going for players like Kylian Mbappe or Erling Haaland. You already know they're the best strikers in the world and they're ludicrously expensive. Instead, we've chosen have players rated 75 or lower, with the potential to become up there with the best in the world. More articles in this series: He won't be easy to get hold of, but with Raspadori's Sassuolo contract coming towards its end you might be able to get a deal done. Get him quick though, because his massive potential will start getting fulfilled really quickly. At 21, he's going to start improving big time before long, and you'll be able to put him in your starting lineup easily. Good players will be able to carry him until his stats are high enough to hold their own at the top level, with 4 star skills and 5 star weak foot bringing him to a level of ability that few in the game will be able to match. Speedy, clinical, and skillful - Giacomo Raspadori is everything you could ever want in a striker. Dane Scarlett is a real wonderkid. With a low overall but ridiculous potential, he's the main reason a lot of people will pick Spurs as their first FIFA 22 career mode. Showing bags of potential in real life, Scarlett is no different in-game. He's not the trickiest player, but his finishing and dribbling will be up there with the best in the world by the time he's in his mid-20s. Send him out on loan, watch the goals come in the lower divisions, then give him a shot once you reckon he's ready. Sesko is similar to Scarlett in potential and attributes. He's a year older, so will take a year less to develop, and his stats are more geared towards physical than technical, but if you want a classic Number 9 to lead your team's line, look no further than Sesko. He'll develop to be brilliant in the air too, with some already decent heading stats that'll only improve with time. Musa Juwara is going to be your classic speedster. Whether he's sprinting off the shoulder of the last defender or dribbling the ball from deep, once you sign him up (he's at Crotone on loan from Bologna at the moment) he'll find it easy to slot into your side. Who needs skill moves when you have speed and dribbling. Another English youngster, and the son of Rory Delap of long throw-in fame, Liam is looking like a real prodigy. At just 18 years of age, he's a lively striker with the potential to make it all the way to the top. Once you work with him on his shooting and physical attributes, he'll be a dominant force in the top division wherever you decide to play - and his 4 star weak foot doesn't hurt either. I wouldn't put him on long throws, though. You'd be forgiven for thinking Leipzig's Brobbey is already the finished article when it comes to being a complete striker. He has 4 star weak foot, he's fast, great in the air, and a solid goalscorer to boot. That's what makes his development even more of a treat. His physical stats are enough to bully opposing centre-backs, and he'll work brilliantly as a target man for your squad. Gimenez has what it takes to slot into your team as a really talented advanced forward, carrying out all the tasks you expect of a great striker. You can make him into a strong, physical threat with excellent finishing ability and pace that's not even half bad, letting you knock it past CBs and cause absolute chaos in the back line. Wolves' Fabio Silva was a pricy addition to their squad, but if you can get your hands on him you'll be getting a great dribbler of the ball who'll work excellently both as part of a front pair or a lone striker with support from the wingers and wing-backs. He's just 19 years of age, and throughout his career you'll be able to build an all-time great for your club if you use Silva well. Hackford is a real project player. At just 17 you'll want to be patient with him and give him the playing and training time he needs, but once that's all done and dusted it'll be an easy inclusion in your squad for years to come. Remember, it's possible to surpass a player's potential overall, and with Antwoine Hackford that's a real possibility. Allowing such a young player to develop means you'll be able to really mould him into the perfect superstar - and that superb pace isn't going anywhere. Basel's Esposito is an Inter Milan loanee so he won't be available to purchase for a little while. However, once FC Basel lets him go he'll be a brilliant addition to your squad. He's great on the ball and off it, a prime candidate for free kick duties, and can even slot in at CAM if you want to give him more time on the ball as an attacking outlet for your side.

1046,https://www.sportbible.com/football/fifa-22-wonderkids-cheap-career-mode-20210929,52 FIFA 22 Wonderkids And High Potential Young Players,"When you start a FIFA 22 Career Mode, you'll be desperate to grab yourself the best young players possible. Whether you're playing as a cash rich side like Manchester City or building from the bottom up at Swindon Town, you'll want the best youngsters around in your team to grow them into future international superstars. The players we've put together are the best youngsters to sign across each position all the way up the pitch. We have put some limits in place, though. If they're young but already ridiculously good and have high overalls, they're not on the list. We have a 'best players' page for that. You already know how good Erling Haaland is, so there's no need to tell you to sign the guy if you have the money in place. Players in this list are young, with low overall ratings, and a potential that'll make them well worth the investment. Of course, every career is different, so your version of the player may even outgrow the ratings you see here. Especially if you put a good training plan in place for them. While you're here, be sure to read up on all the new features in FIFA 22 and how to make money fast on FIFA Ultimate Team. More articles in this series: Vandevoordt is going to be the go-to for early careers looking for a long-term investment. Goalkeepers take a little longer than other positions to develop, but at 19 years old and a 71 overall rating, Maarten Vandevoordt will be an absolute joy after a few years of patience. Just give him some playing time, prepare for a couple mistakes along the way, and you'll have a superstar for the long haul, making acrobatic stops like a wild kangaroo. Diogo Costa is going to be the keeper of choice for bigger clubs looking for a nice, reliable stopper. He's 21, so will be a quick developer and hop into your starting lineup. He's also close to being out of contract so you should be able to get him relatively cheaply if you act fast. He'll be able to start bailing you out of defensive mishaps pretty shortly after pulling on your team's colours. Charis Chatzigavriel is a project in every sense of the word. At just 17 years of age, he won't be stopping the world's top strikers from blasting screamers in from miles out right away. He's only 58 rated, after all. Give him time and a couple of loan spells (or just game time if you're in the lower leagues) though, and in a few years, you'll have a genuinely fantastic keeper as the first name on the team sheet for years to come. One of the more established and expensive options on the list, Morales is an up and coming Argentinian stopper with solid reactions and at 6 ft 2 will provide a big block to your goal. The real Greek Freak? At just 18 years old, Tzolakis is already 6 ft 4 and has incredible agility to be flying around his goal. With a low value and decent potential, Tzolakis is definitely one to build your future team around. More wonderkid goalkeepers Leonidas Stergiou is a CB with all the tools to dominate for years to come. He'll swiftly become a reliable option off the bench or as injury cover with his existing impressive physical stats, and with time his mental attributes will start to mature. He's captain material, to be honest. He's not the speediest CB you'll find, but that's not as essential when you're a superstar in every other area. Netz is a damn good player. As an LB, he'll develop into a fantastic defensive stalwart, with the potential to become a real attacking threat as well. His pace is solid, and he'll adapt to all kinds of tactics and formations - chuck him in as a wing back and it'll be just fine. He has a fair while left on his contract at the moment, but if you can afford to invest in the future, Luca Netz will be in your squad for a long time to come. A slightly more established force with a 73 rating at only 18 years old, Devyne Rensch already has solid pace, great ball skills, and the ability to contribute really effectively in the defensive third. His 5 star weak foot rating also means you can cut inside from the right and try some shots your opponents aren't set up for - a rare treat for a right back. No one likes to come up against quick defenders when it comes to FIFA, and Bella-Kotchap is definitely that. 79 sprint speed and 5* weak foot means the German CB will prove trouble for opposition trying to score against you, and his pace will only increase as you play him more. The full back will require more training than some of the other already more established options provided, but you'll be able to reap the rewards with Dedic. He can play either side of the defence, and with good pace and dribbling stats will definitely prove a fruitful attacking option. Genoa's Nicolo Rovella is the Italian Phil Foden. A fantastic dribbler of the ball, he'll develop into an absolute monster anchoring your central midfield. Give him a few seasons of experience and Rovella will be the perfect centrepiece to your team as you become champions. Once he reaches his potential, just be ready to reject massive bids that'll come your way. We really like a lot of these LM wonderkids in FIFA 22, but our favourite is Talles Magno though. It's partly the versatility - Magno can be played in a CF role if that tickles your fancy. Mostly though, it's the pace. He has 5 star skills, 4 star weak foot, and can run opponents absolutely ragged. Get him in and train him up as soon as possible. You won't regret it. Francisco Conceicao has decent enough stats already to get some starts in cup matches, unless you have a particularly strong squad. He's got solid pace, excellent dribbling ability, and the potential to become a real superstar of your squad. Imagine having both Magno and Conceicao? What a ridiculous wide midfield that'd turn into. The Manchester City star is a defensive stalwart in midfield and will protect your defence with his physical abilities. His work rate will see him running all over the pitch so make sure stamina is something you help him focus on in training, fitness is key to a long career. Another serious wonderkid, Clark is a centre mid with 78 acceleration and by the time he reaches his full potential, he's going to have bags of pace and the dribbling stats to match. 4 star skills and a long future ahead of him, the United States have a VERY fun player on their hands here. You could too. Dane Scarlett is a genuine wonderkid. Currently rated very modestly at 63, he's not going to be bullying Premier League defenders any time soon. Give him a bit of time and a nice squad to feed him chances though, and he'll turn into the next Harry Kane. Train up his finishing and he'll be the poacher your squad needs to dominate at the highest level, supported by a creative midfield. Cherki is a ridiculous player. If you can afford him, get him in ASAP. He has 5 star skills, 5 star weak foot, and the potential to be one of the best players in the game. Get him away from Lyon and marvel at his already brilliant dribbling stats, train his passing, and put him on free kicks. Things are going to get really tricky for the opposition trying to stop him. He can play on either wing, and be the main outlet for your attack, playing the Salah role. Kayky has all the potential in the world, and won't be playing a huge amount for City for several years. Why don't you try to grab him for your team? He's fast, a great dribbler, and works brilliantly as a classic, out-and-out winger. He doesn't have all the skill moves and weak foot ability of other wingers, at 3 stars each, but Kayky makes up for this with the potential to be one of the best dribblers and crossers in the game. A fairly expensive one to start out with, Sesko is still a teenager yet has good pace and physicality stats already with 80 for strength and 73 sprint speed. He's 6' 4"" too which means as you develop him into the star he can certainly become, he's going to be more than a handful for defenders. The son of former Premier League hero Rory Delap has already established himself as part of the Manchester City squad in real life, appearing often in the Carabao Cup and looks set to be part of the club's future. He is rapid on and off the ball and is likely to exceed his already high potential in the game. ",positive,liverpool,0

This guide is focussed on Career Mode, but many could be good signings in FUT as well. While we're at it, give our guide to how to make money fast in FIFA Ultimate Team a read if that's your thing too. More articles in this series: Ruben Dias is only 24. He's 24 years old, and is already one of the best CBs in the world, and in FIFA 22. He's only going to get better too, with a potential overall of 91. A physical powerhouse and intelligent football player, you won't have to worry about Dias getting caught out of position if you lose the ball in midfield and have to scramble for a counter attack. He's also sound on the ball, with better passing stats than most other CBs, as well as posing a genuine threat up front for set-pieces. Matthijs de Ligt of Juventus has everything you want in a CB. Strong, great in the air, and a good reader of the game when the player isn't in control, he'd slot right into any team in the world. For a central defender, he's pretty nippy too, with a sprint speed of 75. It isn't olympic sprinting, but it's enough to hassle opposing attackers and gives him more of an opportunity to use his strength stat. If you really want a fast CB though, get signing Dayot Upamecano. The French defender has the strength, tackling, and aerial ability you expect from a top CB, but the real piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is that 90 sprint speed. Sure, 70 acceleration isn't brilliant, but once he's up to pace you'll be able to chase down all but the most rapid strikers and wingers, making it extremely difficult to get in behind a team with Upamecano at the back. Theo HernÃ¡ndez is ridiculously pacy. He wouldn't be out of place as a winger, but his defensive attributes make him a fantastic left back to do all the jobs you need him to. With fullbacks growing in football's importance, it makes sense to invest heavily in the position, and HernÃ¡ndez is just what the doctor ordered. He's a quality crosser of the ball, and will find it easy to get into those positions with that pace and dribbling. So, we know we said Theo HernÃ¡ndez was a speedster. We weren't lying. However, Alphonso Davies, Bayern's Canadian fullback, has 96 acceleration and sprint speed. That is absolutely wild. He's also an amazing dribbler of the ball, and can hold his own all over the pitch with 4 star skill moves and weak foot. Being just 20 years of age, he's got a lot of development time ahead of him - not that he needs it to get right onto your starting XI. Andy Robertson is the best LB in the world. Liverpool's Scottish superstar has such a spread of attributes that it'd be ridiculous to not include him here. Most impressive is his 95 stamina, because as a fullback players are expected to constantly be sprinting up and down the field non-stop - we can remember plenty of FIFA careers with exhausted fullbacks running on empty with a congested fixture schedule. That's far from a problem with Robertson's work rates and stamina, so you'll barely ever have to sub him off. Great fullbacks are hard to find. Liverpool have somehow found two of them. What Trent lacks in stamina compared to Robertson, he makes up for with aplomb thanks to his ridiculously good playmaking abilities. Getting Alexander-Arnold on the ball is essential, because he can effortlessly whizz a pass across the pitch all the way to the left flank, or dribble all the way up his own side and bang a peach of a ball into the box. If you can get Trent on your team, you're a lucky soul indeed. Joao Cancelo of City is a wonderful addition to any squad. He's quick, a great crosser of the ball, and in the days when fullbacks have to essentially act as wingers as well as being defenders, his 4 star skill moves and weak foot set him apart from the rest. Being Manchester City's first choice he won't come cheap, but it'll all be worth it when he's running the right side of the pitch. Hakimi, PSG's right back, has 95 acceleration and 95 sprint speed. He's okay defensively, but might need to be covered by good centre back play while he's busy marauding up the pitch looking for goals and assists. A 4-star weak foot lets him cut inside and shoot for himself, and the threat of that means you'll be able to harness his ridiculous speed, zooming away from anyone who tries to catch you and whipping a ball right on the head of a (hopefully) oncoming striker. Hakimi has bags of potential, and if you get the opportunity to use it, you're in for a treat. Nuno Mendes primarily plays left wing back, but is far more than that. Chuck him in at left back or left mid and he'll perform exquisitely, particularly if you allow him to reach his full potential. His stamina leaves a little bit to be desired, but if you're playing a system with three centre backs kicking about, there won't be quite as much of a need for Mendes to track back. Plus, he's only 19, so he'll improve massively! Pedro Porro can really hold down the right hand side. With game time and training, his defensive stats will bloom, and you'll be able to hold a high press against any opponent with Porro playing a role. He really comes into his own on the attack, though, as excellent ball control means can dominate opponents focusing too much on closing down the central space. Get him wide, put the crosses in, and watch the goals flow. England have some really good full backs and wing backs, huh? Reece James is Chelsea's choice at the position, and he's a really strong lad for his position. He's fast too, so don't expect to have it easy with your slippery wingers trying to knock it past him as he'll chase them down and outmuscle them with ease. At just 21, he's a great addition to any team at any time in the next decade, so don't hesitate to spend big! ",positive,liverpool,2
1048,https://www.sportbible.com/football/best-wingers-fifa-22-career-mode-20210929,"31 Best Wingers In FIFA 22: Career Mode RW, LW, RM & LM","Strength out wide is becoming more and more important in the modern game, but this has always been the case with FIFA games. Get a speedy fella on the wing and opposing fullbacks just won't be able to cope. Get a peach of a ball into the box for your favourite forward to nod in, and it's the most satisfying thing in all of football. Here's the best wingers in FIFA 22 Career Mode. We're basing this list on current ability, potential ability and longevity in your FIFA career. No one wants a one-season wonder, so as much as Lionel Messi is indeed the best player in the world, we won't be including him in this list. We're looking more for reliable options for the future of your club, who'll continue to dominate for at least a few years to come. You may also be interested in our guides to how to make money fast in FIFA Ultimate Team and all the new features in FIFA 22. More guides to the best players in FIFA 22 can be found in the list below. More articles in this series: Juve's Chiesa caused England serious issues during the Euros, and if you can get him onto your squad he'll cause problems for your opponents too. He's seriously quick, can pull off some wild skill moves, and is extremely difficult to tackle with his dribbling and ball control ability. He's only getting better too. You can't go wrong with Raheem Sterling. He's still just 26 years old, and it feels like he's been an amazing winger to play for absolutely ages. He's even got a bit more potential to squeeze out! You all know Raheem Sterling: he's extremely quick and his acceleration will zip him past defenders before they know what's hit them, he can whip a nice ball into the box or go it alone, and his finishing isn't to be sniffed at. Playable on either side of your wing attack, Sterling is just brilliant. Ferran Torres of Manchester City can really do it all, as he's demonstrated in Pep's system. Hopefully you can make him do the same in your system too. Playable out wide or up front, Ferran Torres is a great dribbler, solid finisher, and crucially: a young superstar. He's about to get a lot better too. Torres isn't the most physical player, but that's the only weakness made up for with literally everything else he has in his locker. After a storming start to Manchester United's real-life 2021/22 season, Mason Greenwood should be on everyone's radar as a brilliant young winger to dominate for over a decade in-game. He's got 5 star weak foot, is extremely versatile with his ability to play up-front if the need arises, and offers the chance to sign a complete winger who can do it all. Dembele is a classic winger. Acceleration and sprint speed to beat his man, good crossing to get a nice ball into the box, and great dribbling to keep hold of the ball while running towards the byline. He's already at Barcelona, but at 24 years of age he's approaching the best years of his career. For an immediate impact, look no further. Goncalves isn't the speedy, old-school winger you might be looking for. Instead, you're getting a deeper player - more of a deep-lying playmaker who's effective out wide. He's a great dribbler and good passer of the ball, but the main bonus for Pedro Goncalves is his shooting. He can finish chances when you push him forwards, and has a whole lot of room to grow over the next few years he's on your team. Jeremy Doku isn't the best player in the world right now. However, he's already a 77 overall, so can make it into most squads, at least as a backup from the bench. Also, at 19 he'll be improving a ridiculous amount over the next few years. He's also amazingly fast - just watch as defenders are left stranded by simply knocking the ball past them. His crossing needs a bit of work to dominate at the highest level, but outside of that, Doku is already an absolute delight. Ajax's Antony is a young superstar. A future Brazilian international, he offers pace, ball control, and crucially: 5 star skills. He's even a decent free kick and corner taker, filling a potential gap in your squad. At just 21, he could be a star out wide for your team for over a decade. Ansu Fati will be tough to take away from FC Barcelona, but if you can, do. At just 18 he's got a long, long career ahead of him, and if you find a way to slot him into your squad and get that game experience, he'll turn into a club legend in no time. Let's see if you can get him to live up to Messi's number 10. Moussa Diaby will be an 88 overall in a few short years. Heâs up there with the very best in the game, and itâs easy to see why. His pace is absolutely ridiculous, and he's probably the best player to go for if you're looking for an utter speedster. There are a few drawbacks - his 2 star weak foot makes him a bit tough to use with a versatile playstyle, but in the right system, Diaby is a genuine treat. Here's a bit of a more rogue choice. Christos Tzolis is a 19 year old Greek winger for Norwich City. He can play on either flank, or even up front. He's fast, and a decent dribbler, but rough around the edges. With 4 star skill moves and weak foot, you can see the potential start to shine through. Sure, at just 74 overall, he might not make it into a big team's starting XI right away, but give him time and space to shine and you won't regret it. We don't really need to say too much here, but Jadon Sancho has some of the best dribbling on the game, five star skills and an eye for goal. Playing with the 21-year-old on FIFA might get you some more luck than he's had in real life so far at Manchester United. The Senegalese winger is one of the fastest players in the game, with both acceleration and sprint speed of 94 and four star skill moves, he is A LOT of fun to use on the game. Sarr will no doubt get a big move in future, why don't you try him out at a big side on Career Mode and see how he fits in? We predict pretty, pretty well. ",positive,liverpool,0
1049,https://www.sportbible.com/football/best-strikers-career-mode-fifa-22-20210929,21 Best Strikers In FIFA 22: Best Career Mode ST and CF,"Who is the best striker in FIFA 22 Career Mode? Grabbing a goalscorer is essential to your success as a team, no matter how solid you are throughout the rest of the pitch. We're here to solve that problem for you. We've built this list with a few factors in mind. Firstly, current ability. These players have to be able to slot into most sides with ease, and beat out existing rivals. Secondly, longevity. Robert Lewandowski is one of the best strikers in the world, but at 33 years old he's isn't going to lead your line for a decade. In fact, he's probably due a well-deserved retirement fairly soon. We're looking at players aged 28 or younger - players in their prime who can bring you continental glory swiftly. More articles in this series: You know all about Kylian Mbappe. PSG's superstar striker, you'll have your work cut out getting this guy signed up. A financial takeover might be necessary. Still, if you can get that sorted and somehow manage to get this guy on your team, you won't have trouble scoring goals for years to come. 5 star skills, 4 star weak foot, ludicrous pace, and exquisite dribbling and shooting ability, Mbappe really is the full package. Want a striker who can truly offer everything, from pace to power? Haaland is 6ft 4in and an absolute beast in every way. He's fast, strong, a fantastic finisher (you'll have some long-shot screamers if you use him right), and has a lot of potential improvement to make if you take the time to train him properly. It'll be easier to prise Haaland away from Dortmund than it would be to grab Mbappe from PSG, too. Outside of the 'big two' of Mbappe and Haaland, Martinez is going to be the go-to future star. At 24 he's right at the cusp of his prime years, so buying him as soon as possible will give you an out-and-out striker for years to come. He's a really good all-rounder, and will turn into a goal machine provided he gets the right service. Of course, he won't come cheap, but if your big club is in need of a striker, Martinez is the one to target. AtlÃ©tico's Joao Felix is the next great golden boy to emerge onto the world stage at the club. Unless you grab him first. Already rated 83 with fantastic ball skills and link-up play, he has an enormous amount of potential given his young age. He's versatile, too - play him in a CF role behind a more traditional striker if you want! What is there to say about Romelu Lukaku? He's tall, strong, a deadly finisher, and an all-round brilliant player. Chelsea have just signed him, so it'll take a lot to get him off their books, but Lukaku is the complete player, and everything you'll ever need to take you to immediate glory. Kane is in a similar situation to Lukaku - even Pep Guardiola struggled to get him signed up. Still though, it's hard to argue with his production, and in FIFA 22 you'll get a fair few years of great play out of him before he starts to decline. He's not even reliant on pace, so most of Harry Kane's best attributes like his 5 star weak foot and absolutely ridiculous finishing stats will stick around for years to come. Napoli's Osimhen is a bit more of a project. Slightly old to be classed as a 'wonderkid', but too young to have fully realised his amazing potential. As an 80 overall, he'll slot nicely into your squad as soon as you get him in, and with every passing season you'll see steady improvements to his game. He's already solid across the board, but just you wait until he starts approaching 87 overall. This man will dominate in any league in the world. Those of you managing Everton, you're in luck. With both Dominic Calvert-Lewin (at 81 overall with 85 potential) and Richarlison aged 24 leading the line, the forward position isn't something you'll have to worry about for a long, long time. Richarlison is a great dribbler of the ball and will work fantastically supporting a more traditional, out-and-out striker, but with the right squad around him you'll be able to make him work as the talisman of your team. Italian forward Moise Kean is an absolute treat when it comes to his stats and potential. He's just 21, but already a 79 overall, and this'll only improve with time. We wouldn't be at all surprised if he surpassed his 87 potential, too. He's got great shot power and solid finishing along with being speedy, strong, and exactly the kind of player we like to have leading the line in FIFA career modes. The only weakness is his 3 star skill moves and weak foot, but otherwise Kean is the ideal man to lead you to glory. Tammy Abraham has a surprising amount of development for a 24 year old, going from 78 overall to 86. He's not the fastest man on the pitch, but this is made up for enormously with some seriously impressive dribbling and shooting stats. Given time, he might just be the new Harry Kane. Luis Javier Suarez, like his namesake Luis SuÃ¡rez of AtlÃ©tico, has the potential to be a clinical finisher for long-term success in your FIFA 22 career mode. The former Watford striker never saw a Premier League appearance, but with 4 star weak foot and some really nice pace, you could make a superstar out of him yet. ",positive,liverpool,0
1050,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-fifa-22-online-career-mode-wishlist-20210607,FIFA 22 Online Career Mode: 8 Things We Want To See In FIFA 22,"After years of FIFA fans pleading with EA Sports to make Career Mode online-friendly, gamers may finally be getting what they have wished for. Despite being a network play staple for many years, FIFA's Career Mode has never had such a feature - with fans continuously calling on EA to expand and develop the game's online offering. But earlier this month, fans were sent into a frenzy after speculation of a potential 'online Career Mode' was hinted at in an Electronic Arts job listing. Twitter fan page FIFA 21 News spotted the listing and the eye-catching part of the job description. It reads: ""As an Online Software Engineer, you will help build our networked play development team - whether that be in our online Career Mode, Ultimate Team, or core online systems and protocols. ""We are looking for engineers who enjoy prototyping and planning, adding amazing new features to an existing and beloved game, and improving existing code."" Despite the mention of online Career Mode, it still remains unclear if EA plan to have it included in FIFA 22. EA will unveil its latest FIFA at EA Play on July 22 next month - with more information on the proposed online Career Mode likely to be announced. What would you like to see implemented in this year's fan-favourite game mode? Let us know. Here, we take a look at eight things we would love to see included. We don't yet know how online Career Mode in FIFA 22 will work, especially considering that it's still nothing but a rumour. However, if we're speculating, you and a friend - or friends - should be able to manage different teams, giving you the ability to buy and loan players from each other. How cool would that be? Although, there could be a fair few disagreements along the way. On FIFA 21, it is possible to edit some aspects of your squads' appearance in-game - though it is very limited. As it stands, you can only edit what your team are wearing, for example, players' boots, shirt fit and sock height. It's as dull as it sounds, we know. But this is where EA could do so much more with this feature - take their previous Journey game mode, for one. Players were given the opportunity to edit the overall appearance of Alex Hunter - the game modes main protagonist - by changing his hairstyle and even giving him tattoos. Considering Paul Pogba changes his hairstyle nearly every other week, Career Mode needing something similar to that is an absolute no-brainer. Back when FIFA was on PlayStation 2, gamers were given the chance to create their own teams - but EA removed it without any warning. Players have since been able to achieve this on PC, especially giving its modding abilities, however, it would be great to see this sort of functionality built into the game for consoles again. Could we see some sort of creation centre return to FIFA again in the future? Let's hope so. On FIFA 21, players are able to customise an array of sections within their stadiums to make it stand out from the rest - and we desperately need to see this in Career Mode. Because of its Ultimate Team inclusion, there is no excuse for EA not to extend this into Career Mode and give gamers the opportunity to play around with the stadiums, customising different elements.  Editing a stadium such as Old Trafford might prove tricky because of licensing issues, though. But clubs with a generic stadium such as Town Park, for example, could do with a bit of TLC - and this feature would almost certainly fix that. This is a given in FIFA 22, surely? It's always nice to see more leagues being added to the game. As always, though, there has been a lot of fans desperate to see teams from England's National League added to FIFA 22. However, there is no information on whether they will be involved, despite gamers' pleas for them to make an appearance.  Could we see them added for this year? It's not too unrealistic and it very well could happen. One of the things that makes Football Manager so realistic is seeing different managers at different clubs. Unfortunately, at the moment, we don't get to see this in Career Mode. So, instead of crazy managerial scenarios, we just see the same old managers at the same old teams - season after season. Boring, right? I mean, just imagine seeing Sean Dyche on the sidelines when taking on Barcelona in the Champions League final. We know it's not realistic, but it certainly makes it a lot more interesting. As controversial as VAR has been since its introduction, it's something that just has to feature in Career Mode later this year. We already have real-life technologies in the game such as goal-line technology, so why not VAR?  Hopefully, it won't take quite as long to make a decision as it can sometimes in real life, and it will definitely cause some absolute carnage and heartbreak when it's used to deny a last-minute winner or leveller. But especially for the licensed leagues and competitions where it's currently used right now, it would definitely make sense and be a nice touch to see it introduced in the game. Career Mode would be an absolute game-changer if players were given the option to use all of the different icons in-game. With most icons either coaching or acting as pundits, then what better feature would there be than to use them as a manager in Career Mode?  I mean, just how good would it be to have Thierry Henry on the sidelines and in press conferences for Arsenal? It is currently possible to do it on FIFA 21 with the Soccer Aid team that's been added, however, this team is usually added late to the game. Or if management doesn't suit, then picture this: David Beckham back at Old Trafford in a Manchester United kit. Beautiful, we know. ",positive,liverpool,0

1052,https://www.sportbible.com/football/fifa-22-player-potential-ratings-20211014,Can Players Exceed Their Potential On FIFA 22 Career Mode?,"EA Sports' FIFA 22 is here, and many of us have hopped right on into Career Mode to lead our favourite team to glory. Whether you're flying high in the Premier League or languishing in League 2, you should be keeping an eye on your players' potential. The training methods you use can make a significant difference, and if a player is getting close to their potential, you might wonder if it's still worth playing and training them to try to boost it further. So, here's everything you need to know about players in FIFA 22 reaching and exceeding their potential through match experience, good management, and training. The short answer is yes: players can exceed their potential. The potential of a player in FIFA 22's career mode is an average stat based on where they'll typically end up, but as a manager, it's up to you to take their career by the horns and lead them to exceed their potential ability. It's not a guarantee, but it's well worth trying to mould your young stars into the best players they can be. Take Liam Delap, for example. His current ability is 64, with a potential of 85. At just 18 years of age though, he can develop exceedingly quickly - you might have him in the mid or high 70s by the end of a season or two if you play your cards right. From here, it's easy to expect a 20-year-old rated over 75 to exceed 85 by the end of his career - just make sure you're doing everything you can to help that player along. Player development in FIFA 22 is based on a bunch of factors, so if there's a specific wonderkid you want to base your team around for years to come, you'll want to focus hard on them in all facets of your play. The first way to get players to exceed their potential is through training. In order to get the maximum development for your players, you need to keep their match sharpness high. In order to maximise your players' growth towards their potential, you need to do the training drills at least once. Once you've got a high grade (aim for an A), you can then simulate all drills from there. It can get tedious, but it'll make your players better (and hopefully polish up your skills a little bit too). After the first time around, you can just sim them to get the same result again and again. A player with high match sharpness will get attribute boosts, making their overall a lot higher than it otherwise would be. Player Development Plans are an enormously important aspect of making your stars exceed their potential. Head into this section and you can set a specific plan for which areas you want your players to develop. You need to base this on each individual player too - maybe an attacking fullback needs some more focus on the defensive aspect of his game, but equally you might want to maximise the player's aptitude in his existing strengths. It depends on your game plan and how you want to use each player. You can see the stats that get a boost (or a decline slowdown for older players) with the arrows that appear when hovering over the player's role. Get this right, and you'll be able to get your players to reach and exceed their potential a lot more easily. You can see the estimated time your player's overall rating will take to increase too - in the top middle area of the screen. Don't worry though, read on if you want to learn how to speed that up a tad. The real trick that ties all this together is game time. You won't develop a player by having him sit on the bench. As mentioned before, high match sharpness gives a player attribute boosts, as does high morale and form. How do you get morale and form? By playing some football. If your starlet starts to get a few good games in, their development plan will rocket forward, allowing them to boost their stats, learn a new position, or even change their work rates. The point about form is interesting, too, as you might want to alter the way you play to emphasise the skills exhibited by your young player. Maybe you could square the ball to a young striker when through on goal, or go in for more crunching tackles as a CDM with high potential. Winning matches and getting your highest potential players in the headlines is the best way to ensure they develop how you expect them to. Aside from older players who are still dominating at the top of the game (think Messi, Ronaldo and the like), there are a number of players with extremely high potential. You can have a look at our handy page featuring the best FIFA 22 wonderkids, but here's a selection of the highest potential players who have a chance of exceeding that massive potential. Of course, there are plenty of other brilliant players in FIFA 22 you can train up and help exceed their potential.

Both City and PSG have owners from the Middle East, with the former owned by Sheikh Mansour from the UAE, while the latter are under a Qatari-based ownership. These models are in sharp contrast to the 50+1 German method, which requires all of the clubs to own 50% plus one additional share of the football company. This is aimed at stopping external investors from claiming a majority percentage for themselves. PSG and City have reached each of the last two Champions League finals, with Bayern Munich triumphing over the French side in 2020, while Pep Guardiola's men were beaten by Chelsea in May. Those defeats delighted Hoeness and he delivered a brutal shot towards PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. ""So far they haven't won anything. Nothing at all. The two associations don't have a single Champions League title,"" he told 11 Leben podcast, in quotes published by the Manchester Evening News. ""They will continue to lose against us. Not always, but sometimes. That has to be the goal, and if we win against them, I'm really happy. ""This is what stimulates me to show them, 'your s****y money, that's not enough!' ""The difference between him [Al-Khelaifi] and me is: I worked hard for the money and he got it as a gift. We put it at his disposal and he doesn't need to work for that.

1058,https://www.sportbible.com/football/53021-best-right-wingers-in-the-world-20210727,"âThe 10 Best Right-Wingers In The World Right Now, Named And Rankedâ","Talk about right-wingers and images of Luis Figo and Jairzinho powering forward spring to mind. The current crop of right-forwards and wide midfielders may contain players that prove to be even better than the Portuguese and Brazilian legends. Here we pick our top 10 right-wingers in the world. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in recent times. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from WhoScored.com and are correct as of the publish date. All images are credit to PA Images. 2020/21 Season Stats: Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport once described Josip Ilicic as being built like a boxer but with the feet of a ballerina. The powerful 6ft 3in winger, who turned 33 in January has been Atalanta's best player since his move from Fiorentina in 2017. It was his goal at Anfield in November 2020 that handed Liverpool their first home loss inside 90 minutes for more than two years. A stalwart for his country, he has scored 13 goals for Slovenia in 73 appearances. 2020/21 Season Stats: It feels like a long time ago that James Rodriguez won the Golden Boot at the 2014 World Cup but he recaptured that form early in his first Everton season. In Carlo Ancelotti's 4-3-3, Rodriguez was given licence to roam on the right where his creativity and ability to draw tacklers to him helped the Toffees to the top of the Premier League. Injuries then slowed his roll but when fit, the 29-year-old showed he still had plenty in the tank. Rafa Benitez's appointment may mean it's one and done on Merseyside for the Colombian, who reportedly fell out with the manager when they were at Real Madrid. 2020/21 Season Stats: Blessed with blistering pace and an ability to beat opponents from wide, Leroy Sane looked to have the world at his feet after back-to-back Premier League titles with Manchester City. But a disastrous torn cruciate ligament 13 minutes into the Community Shield in 2019 put the mockers on a dream move to Bayern Munich. A year later the transfer was resurrected and there were glimpses of his old form last season as he scored six and set up nine in the Bundesliga and added three goals in six Champions League matches. 2020/21 Season Stats: One of Pep Guardiola's favourite weapons since he spent Â£60million to bring Riyad Mahrez from Leicester in 2018. While his trademark cutting inside from the right to curl a shot into the bottom corner is deadly, the Algerian can suffer from inconsistent performances. His knack for making a difference in key games and moments however ensures Guardiola turns to him for big games, which when you consider the wealth of options he has at City, is praise indeed. 2020/21 Season Stats: With his smart, diagonal runs and his excellent use of width, Torres managed to make an impact in 2020/21 despite being part of the aforementioned talent-packed Manchester City squad. Able to play right and left, the 21-year-old was in competition with the likes of Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez for playing time in his debut season. His performance has given manager Pep Guardiola food for thought for the upcoming Premier League campaign: ""He was fantastic all season, an incredible signing for us that can play in three positions up front. Maybe I have to think about playing him as a striker because every time he plays there he has a real sense of goal."" 2020/21 Season Stats: Domenico Berardi is a rarity in the modern game - a one-club man at 26. He's made 275 appearances for Sassuolo and scored 97 goals, helping them to promotion from Serie B at the age of 18. This past season was his best to date with 17 goals from 28 appearances, he was the eighth leading scorer in Serie A and was fourth in shots per game. Only Lorenzo Insigne averaged more shots from outside the box. The quick, tenacious, left-footer was reportedly being watched by Liverpool during Italy's run to the Euro 2021 title so he may become a two-club man sooner rather than later. 2020/21 Season Stats: Despite being just 5ft 8in, Bernardo Silva throws himself around the field with aggression you wouldn't expect from a man his size. Fizzing in from out wide with the ability to pick a perfect pass, the Portuguese is Manchester City's unsung hero. When Kevin de Bruyne went down this season, it was Silva that picked up the slack and ensured Pep Guardiola's side's title chase didn't falter. The 26-year-old has 59 caps for his country and seven goals. 2020/21 Season Stats: England penalty disappointment aside, 2021 is set to be the biggest year of Jadon Sancho's career. Returning to Manchester after his Â£73million move from Borussia Dortmund to United, the 21-year-old is being rewarded for the gamble he took four years ago. Switching from City to experience a new culture in Germany proved more than worthwhile as he showed himself to be one of Europe's brightest stars. His 79 combined goals and assists (36/43) before the age of 21 tops Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney, Dele Alli and England teammate Raheem Sterling. 2020/21 Season Stats: Big-time players turn up in big-time moments and that was the case again for Angel Di Maria who scored the winner in the Copa America 2021 final against Brazil, his only goal of the tournament. The goal ended 28 years of hurt for Argentina and finally gave Lionel Messi an international trophy to lift. While his season at Manchester United was forgettable, he's won league titles in Spain, France and Portugal and the Champions League with Real Madrid. Licensed to keep his width or come more central, Di Maria is better known for his vision than his pace, which is why at 33, he's still one of the best. 2020/21 Season Stats: While he's no longer strictly a right-winger as he was in his days at Roma and Fiorentina, ""little dancer"" Mo Salah has become one of the world's most effective right forwards. Come for the goals (two consecutive Premier League golden boots, 95 Premier League goals in four seasons) and stay for the work-rate. ""He works his socks off in games,"" says his Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. ""But I see him in between games as well, how dedicated he is and how hard he works at improving."" The fastest player to 100 top-flight goals for Liverpool, the 29-year-old may only now be reaching his peak - a scary thought for defenders. ",positive,liverpool,4

He's also won 18 Man of the Match awards and is producing the sort of form that could potentially bring him a seventh Ballon d'Or award.

Last week the Premier League leaders started the job with a 2-1 victory over the Ligue 1 champions, after Riyad Mahrez's free kick had gone through the PSG wall. In some ways City were a bit fortunate to lead at the end of the first 90 minutes, after Mauricio Pochettino's side dominated the first half, but they were worth the second half comeback. Loadingâ¦ Just six days later, the Parisians were without key man Kylian Mbappe going into a second leg that they needed two goals to have any chance of going through from, in an unseasonably cold and wet night, even for Manchester. PSG were awarded a penalty early in the game but VAR correctly over turned it as there was certainly no handball. City went ahead minutes later when Ederson's brilliant pass found Oleksandr Zinchenko and the Ukrainian passed to Kevin de Bruyne whose shot was deflected into the path of Mahrez who made it 1-0 on the night. Zinchenko's celebrations tonight :joy: pic.twitter.com/LD4avQ4ylF The visitors were willing opposition but with Mauro Icardi barely doing anything up front it felt like they were playing with 10 men at times. Ruben Dias in particular was a rock at the back, although Marquinhos might have equalised when he headed against the top of the bar. Keylor Navas made some good saves at the beginning of the second half but Mahrez scored his second on the night, and third of the tie, when he got on the end of Phil Foden's pass in the 63rd minute. Magnificent Mahrez! A beautifully crafted counter-attacking move, and the Algerian winger is at the back post to clean up for his second goal of the night!Man City are so close to Istanbul! :pray: pic.twitter.com/8SRlUmCfBp Things went from bad to worse just six minutes later when Angel di Maria continued his dislike of being in Manchester, getting sent off for kicking out at Fernandinho. PSG really didn't have anything to offer going forward from then, with Neymar remaining quiet throughout, and ended without a single shot on target.

Loadingâ¦ Borussia Dortmund rejected an opening bid of Â£67m for the 21-year-old English winger earlier this month. However, United have reportedly improved their offer and put together a stunning Â£77.5m deal to land Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's top target. And it initially appeared that Rashford confirmed Sancho's forthcoming arrival at Old Trafford via a tweet to a supporter. One fan simply posted, ""Announce Sancho Marcus,"" which included eyes emoji in the tweet. United fans on the social media platform were stunned when Rashford's Twitter account responded with a ""yes x"" reply on Tuesday. The tweet has since been removed from Rashford's account, but the United star has since confirmed it was a ""little hack"" and now he is back. The 23-year-old tweeted to his 4.5m followers: ""A little hack and I'm back. Morning all."" Sancho was in superb form for Dortmund last season as he scored an impressive 16 times and registered 20 assists in 38 appearances. The England international, whose current Dortmund deal expires in 2023, has already agreed personal terms with United ahead of his potential move. United boss Solskjaer is keen to bolster his attacking options ahead of the new Premier League season. Sancho is currently on international duty with England at Euro 2020, but the United target's playing time has been limited under Gareth Southgate. The Dortmund star was left out of the England squad for his side's opening Euro 2020 clash against Croatia. Sancho was on the bench for the 0-0 draw against Scotland and only made a brief cameo in England's 1-0 win over the Czech Republic. The England winger was an unused substitute in England's sensational 2-0 win over Germany in the last 16, but Erling Haaland showed his support for his Dortmund teammate on Twitter. Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthaus admitted that Sancho's lack of England playing time has ""surprised many in Germany."" ",positive,liverpool,0

The Brazilian, who spent last season on loan at Lazio last season, has returned to United for pre-season and featured in games against Derby County and QPR as well as most recent opponents Brentford. He started a second consecutive game alongside Nemanja Matic in midfield during the 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in front of around 30,000 fans - the most at the ground since the Manchester derby win in March 2020. Loadingâ¦ The 25-year-old impressed with his performance but not in his set-piece taking abilities. In the first half, Pereira fancied his chances from an appealing dead-ball situation and managed to convince Mata, a set-piece specialist, to let him take it. His effort was utterly atrocious, Pereira trying to catch Brentford out with a low effort but seeing his effort travel ever so slightly in what was a huge waste. Knowing how bad his strike was, he took to Instagram to say sorry to Mata, writing: ""The next one is yours. Your face says it all."" But Pereira undoubtedly made amends as in the second half he did his best Paul Scholes impression when he scored the most incredible 25 yard volley in front of the Stretford End The technique was quite sublime, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitting the club's Goal of the Season award might be done already. ""We might just hand it out, that hit from Andreas was out of this world,"" the Manchester United boss told MUTV. Pereira, despite never really been a regular in the United first-team, has scored a number of long-range stunners. But for him, this one is right up there as the best of his career. ""I think that's my best goal, yeah,"" Pereira stated in an interview with MUTV after the draw. ""As soon as Jesse hit it, it came off the goalkeeper and I thought 'I might have a chance here' and as soon as I hit it, it felt good straight away. ""It was a nice feeling, having the fans back in and scoring the goal."" Next up for United is a short visit to Championship side Preston, before they host Everton at home in their final friendly before their Premier League campaign gets underway against Leeds United on 14 August.

Thatâs according to Danny Murphy, who believes Rodgers benefits from his âextensive experienceâ and has the âhunger and drive to take United forward.â Loadingâ¦ Ralf Rangnick has been appointed interim managerfor United until the end of the season after the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United are on the hunt for the manager who will succeed Solskjaer in the Old Trafford hotseat, with both Pochettino and Rodgers linked with the position. Ajax manager Erik ten Hagand former Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane have been other high-profile names attached with the Premier League club. Read More: Murphy has revealed he is backing Rodgers to become the next United manager and claimed he knows how to âhandle the spotlight after managing Liverpool and Celtic.â The BBC pundit wrote forThe Daily Mail: âIt is a shame for Manchester United that Brendan Rodgers once managed Liverpool. Otherwise Iâd see him as the ideal fit to mastermind the long-term project at Old Trafford. âPast associations donât have to be a deal-breaker but they donât help, as Rafa Benitez is finding out at Everton, so Mauricio Pochettino looks the favourite to be in charge next season unless Ralf Rangnick does so well that he has to stay. âRodgers ticks so many boxes: he has extensive experience but is still young enough to have the hunger and drive to take United forward. âIn football, people tend to get judged on their last match rather than a careerâs work but thatâs unfair. Leicesterâs form hasnât been great this season but even with a lengthy injury list they are in the top half and lead their Europa League group. âItâs little more than six months since they won the FA Cup, beating Manchester United in the quarter-finals and Chelsea in the final. And twice in a row theyâve come close to qualifying for the Champions League. âRodgers knows what itâs like to handle the spotlight after managing Liverpool and Celtic. Itâs exciting to think what he could do with the squad at Old Trafford because his track record at improving players is brilliant.â Read More: Pochettino is considered thefavourite to become the next United manager, despite only becoming Paris Saint-Germain boss back in January. The Ligue 1 club are considering allowing Pochettino to leave at the end of the season, according to reports. The PSG manager failed to lift any major silverware during his time with Tottenham, but he has since won the Coupe de France with his current club. Rodgers has been with Leicester City since 2019 and earned plaudits for his work at the Foxes, falling short of Champions League qualification last season. ",positive,liverpool,3

He ended his career on 261 goals and also enjoyed spells with West Ham United, Manchester City and New York City. Coming in second place is former England teammate and longtime Premier League rival Steven Gerrard. Gerrard managed to net 206 goals in his career and he alongside Lampard are the only two to break the 200 goal barrier. Borussia Dortmund stalwart Marco Reus places fourth and is the highest placed player who is currently active. Check out the entire top 20 below per Transfermarkt. 20.

Frank Lampard (261 goals in 843 games) Lampard being above Gerrard means the intense debate regarding the duo will continue to rage on. Paul Scholes played with both and is also included in the argument regularly. But he settled the debate last year by claiming the other two are ahead of him in the rankings. ""Stevie G and Frank, of course,"" the Manchester United legend told BBC 5 Live's Savage Social. ""I'm sick to death of hearing about this, to be honest. It doesn't really matter. People can have their own opinions. ""Them two were amazing, amazing players. But very different players."" Scholes does believe the former Chelsea boss could arguably be the ""best goalscoring midfielder that there will ever be."" He continued: ""Frank played the position well. He was in a team where he was allowed to do what he wanted. ""He had the license to go with [Claude] Makelele there. Probably the best goalscoring midfielder that there will ever be. ""Steven could do absolutely everything on a football pitch. He was quick, he was strong, he was physical, he could score goals and he could make goals. ""Defence probably wasn't one of his strengths, but I don't think it was any of our strengths."" ",negative,liverpool,0
