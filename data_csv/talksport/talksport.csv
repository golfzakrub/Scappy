The Reds icon gave a brutal assessment of the current Man United squad, who were embarrassed by Jurgen Klopp’s side, losing 4-0 at Anfield. The reverse fixture saw the Reds outclass their opponents 5-0, meaning that both games have seen the quadruple-chasing Liverpool score NINE goals without reply. Following the debacle on Merseyside, questions have been asked, and damming statements given about this current crop of Man United players. Carragher also said the Liverpool sides he was involved in were never this poor when playing against Man United, despite often losing to them. “I said through the first half at 2-0, I did feel it would end up being about 4-0,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “Where Manchester United are right now, that was me in a Liverpool shirt, trying to challenge Manchester United when they were top dogs. “They had the manager, they had the squad, they had everything covered and we were just trying to hang onto their coattails.  “But what I saw there today, certainly in that first half, what I saw in that first game at Old Trafford, I don’t think we ever stooped that low. “We lost one time 4-0 at Old Trafford, but we had a man sent off after a minute, I think it was Sami Hyypia who get sent off after one minute. “We got some doings off Manchester United – they were better than us – but we still had something about us, a personality, a character. “We still won trophies in unbelievable circumstances when we weren’t one of the best teams.  “I couldn’t imagine this Manchester United team doing something out of the ordinary like an Istanbul [in 2005 where Liverpool came from 3-0 down against AC Milan in the Champions League final and won], or winning an FA Cup when they shouldn’t. “We always still felt we had the ability to do something in a game and you knew there’d be a bit of fight. “This Manchester United, yes they’re awful, but this is one of the most expensively assembled squads in the history of the game, right up there with Manchester City. “If you [Gary Neville] were playing now for that Manchester United team – I’m not even talking about [Ryan] Giggs or [Paul] Scholes – you wouldn’t allow that to happen. I wouldn’t allow that to happen.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

2,https://talksport.com/football/1090321/tottenham-oliver-skipp-new-contract-antonio-conte/,Tottenham midfielder Oliver Skipp signs new five-year contract as he closes in on a return to action after three-month lay-off,"Tottenham midfielder Oliver Skipp has signed a new contract with the club until 2027. The 21-year-old has impressed for Spurs this season, leading to Antonio Conte tipping the England youth international to become a ‘top midfielder’.  He has played 28 times for the north Londoners in all competitions this season, where he has impressed pundits and supporters alike. His first taste of regular first-team football came at Norwich last season, where he played 34 games under Daniel Farke and helped them to promotion to the Premier League. He then came straight into the first team at Spurs and impressed under former boss Nuno Espirito Santo and Conte, who have both had faith in the youngster. Skipp is currently out injured with an awkward pelvic injury that has kept him out for some time, which has led to his Italian boss questioning the club’s medical department. Conte said last month: “Oliver Skipp, it is a pity. “In England, I think that sometimes you should have a [press] conference with the medical department. More to come 👊 pic.twitter.com/M76I4JUOtu “It is too easy for the doctors to work here because they don’t speak, they don’t explain what happens, you understand? “Sometimes I think that could be good to have a press conference with the medical department to explain about the situation that they are trying to take care of their players. “Skipp is not ready. He’s having this problem with groin pain. He is fighting. He could recover before but maybe something was wrong. And now we have to wait.” The midfielder is now said to be close to a return, however, and despite missing him for the last few months, Spurs fans now have another five years to enjoy him.

3,https://talksport.com/football/1090034/man-united-scouts-have-left-neville-wont-spark-revolution/,Two Manchester United scouts have left Old Trafford but Gary Neville says it won’t spark ‘revolution’ following Liverpool drubbing,"Manchester United confirmed that scouts Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout have left the club, but Gary Neville warned it still won’t spark a ‘revolution’. The duo were two of the clubs key transfer cogs in recent years, with the Red Devils now set to overhaul their scouting network this summer. Irishman Lawlor, 57, was chief scout for 16 years after being drafted in under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005. “Jim Lawlor has decided to step down from his role as chief scout in the summer after 16 years with the club”, a club statement read. “During that time, Jim played a key role in the development of multiple trophy-winning Manchester United teams and was an important source of guidance to Sir Alex Ferguson and each of the managers who have followed him. “Jim leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future.” Bout was brought to Old Trafford following the arrival of Louis van Gaal in 2014, and after the Dutchman’s sacking, he eventually took up the role of head of global scouting two years later. “Marcel Bout has departed from his role as head of global scouting after eight years with the club.  “A respected figure within and outside of Manchester United, Marcel has played an important part as an assistant coach and in the strengthening of our scouting capabilities in recent years. “Marcel leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future”, the club statement added. Following the news, there were claims it could spark changes, given Manchester United have spent £1bn on players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Gary Neville says despite the exits of both scouts, fans should not expect swift changes. Not quite sure we’re going to see a revolution. Jim has been marginalised for years so this won’t shift the dial. https://t.co/LcVeng5eiW “Not quite sure we’re going to see a revolution. Jim has been marginalised for years so this won’t shift the dial”, Neville tweeted. The departures come a day after Manchester United’s 4-0 drubbing against Liverpool at Anfield. Ralf Rangnick claimed the Merseyside giants were six years ahead of his side, and the Red Devils need up to 10 players in the summer transfer window, if they are to compete with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City.

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the Premier League and the fight to survive is well and truly on. Most teams have six games remaining this season but due to Covid and other issues, several sides have more or less matches to play, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Newcastle looked doomed after 19 games – they were 19th and had only won once. But the combination of five new players and Eddie Howe’s work on the training field sparked a superb run that saw the Toon go unbeaten for nearly two months. During that run, they lost Kieran Trippier and Allan Saint-Maximin to injury but kept grinding out results, and after a 2-1 win over Southampton, Newcastle were on 31 points. But they lost three in a row, including a 5-1 thrashing by Tottenham Hotspur and some nerves returned on Tyneside. However, after back-to-back home wins against Wolves and Leicester, they are probably safe and are 12 points clear of the drop zone. The Toon do still have Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City to play, so it is a good job they have sealed wins against Leicester and Wolves. They face Burnley at Turf Moor on the last day of the season in what initially looked like an important match but shouldn’t mean too much to the Toon unless everything goes horribly wrong from here. Predicted finish – 14th Crystal Palace – H – 20 April Norwich – A – 23 April Liverpool – H – 30 April Manchester City – A – 7 May Arsenal – H – 15 May Burnley – A – 22 May  Aston Villa have had a very odd season and are nowhere near where they expected to be. Since Villa hired Gerrard as their manager, they have won eight Premier League games, lost ten and only drawn two. In that time, they have thrashed the likes of Leeds and Southampton, while they have performed well in games against Tottenham and Manchester City. However, they have now lost four matches in a row and could be dragged into a relegation battle unless they are careful. Villa have a squad packed with talent in almost every position, but the season has sorted of drifted along. They still have Liverpool and City to play, while they also face Burnley twice and Norwich City. They should be fine and pick up the points required to get them over the finish line, but this has been an underwhelming campaign from Villa. Predicted finish – 15th Leicester – A – 23 April Norwich City – H – 30 April Burnley – A – 07 May Liverpool – H – 10 May Crystal Palace – H – 15 May Burnley – H – 19 May Manchester City – A – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (68), even more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a relegation dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites are unbeaten in four and are eight points clear of the drop zone with six games to go. Leeds still have to play Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in good form at the moment. Ultimately, the wins for Leeds over Norwich, Wolves and Watford should be enough to keep them up. Predicted Finish – 16th Chelsea – H – 17 April Crystal Palace – A – 23 April Manchester City – H – 30 April Arsenal – A – 7 May Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a danger of that happening this season. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and has won three league games, but back-to-back defeats against West Ham and Burnley have plunged the Toffees into deep trouble. They still have to face Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal while facing relegation clashes against Watford and Brentford. Oddly, they must still play Leicester twice. So, while they have games in hand, many of their remaining fixtures look really tough. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – H – 20 April Liverpool – A – 24 April Chelsea – H – 1 May Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons but it might be a year too far for the Clarets. Burnley have only won four games and have scored just 26 goals, which explains why they are in trouble. They have conceded 45 goals, which is better than most teams in the bottom half. The Clarets beat Everton at Turf Moor before then losing to Norwich. This result saw Dyche sacked, which seems like an odd decision However, they still have to play Aston Villa twice and Southampton, so there are opportunities out there for Burnley to earn enough points to stay in the league Predicted finish – 17th Southampton – H – 21 April Wolves – H – 24 April Watford – A – 30 April Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they are still in trouble and are six points adrift of Everton. The Hornets still have six games to play and face Man City and Chelsea. But the big matches are Everton and Burnley. They lost to Leeds and Brentford, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford. Predicted finish – 19th Manchester City – A – 23 April Burnley – H – 30 April Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and with so little time remaining, it is hard to see how they could survive. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 21 of their 32 games and have conceded 66 goals. They have lost seven of their last nine and are seven point adrift of safety. It seems almost certain that they will go down and they will need five or even six victories if they are to stay up. Smith’s side still have Man United, West Ham and Tottenham to face, while they also play Newcastle and several mid-table sides. However, you can’t see them getting five wins and Norwich look doomed.

Thiago silenced his early doubters once and for all with arguably his best performance in a Liverpool shirt as he helped them to a 4-0 drubbing of Man United. The former right-back responded to the Liverpool legend on Twitter, after he posted a video celebrating the Spaniard’s performance against the Red Devils. Almost every one of his passes found a teammate, and even when a Man United player tried to close him down, the former Bayern Munich player often beat them with a bit of skill, or with a quick and incisive pass. He produced 105 passes in the game, with an accuracy of 96 per cent. The display was exceptional, and after the game, he was deservedly awarded the man-of-the-match award. Liverpool fans are waxing lyrical about Thiago, including club icon Carragher.  On social media platform Twitter, Carragher posted a video of Thiago’s chant which comes from the tune ‘Cuba’ by the Gibson Brothers. But before that, there was a small scene where Neville said: “Bayern Munich don’t let anybody go that’s half decent.” Well that comment certainly hasn’t aged well has it? Neville being Neville though, he was never going to let Carragher have the last laugh. He found the joke funny, but then added: “One good game against a pub team!”  😂😂😂One good game against a pub team ! 😂 https://t.co/O6wWeQ1GMs Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

Well sadly, that’s exactly what happened to one talkSPORT listener on the Breakfast show, which left Laura Woods, Ally McCoist and Gabriel Agbonlahor in stitches. Over the years, the world’s biggest radio station has had some unbelievably funny moments. Jamie O’Hara admitted he thought Sri Lanka was in Europe… Oh Jamie. And Agbonlahor was on Breakfast alongside Alan Brazil and Mr O’Hara in 2021 when he dropped a clanger. On talkSPORT’s Simply The Best quiz, he was asked what is the tallest mountain in Europe – the one situated in the French Alps. And the former Aston Villa man’s answer was… Mount Everest. Cue the hysterics from everyone in the studio. This call on Wednesday’s edition of Breakfast may rival that, however, albeit at the expense of Jeremy, who phoned in to lament Manchester United’s display against Liverpool. Laura began the conversation by asking: “What would you like to say Jeremy?” 🤬 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: “I think…MAKE YOUR OWN TEA! I’M ON THE PHONE TO LAURA & ALLY!”🤣 𝗟𝗮𝘂𝗿𝗮: “Who was that?!”☕️ 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: “Sorry, that was my son…”Jeremy the #MUFC was interrupted by his son wanting him to make him a tea! 😂 pic.twitter.com/Cj7RVvZrZL He replied: “I think Manchester United took a back stop to be honest with you. “I don’t think they’re any better than when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was there. “And in fact I think they were a joke.” Then came the unfortunate moment where Jeremy’s son apparently interrupted his father to ask him to make a cuppa.     “MAKE YOUR OWN TEA! I’M ON THE PHONE TO LAURA & ALLY!” Jeremy was forced to shout. Credit to Laura, Ally and Gabby, though who tried their very best to stop themselves from bursting out in laughter. As the call resumed, the ever-professional Laura tried to continue despite the hysterics from pals. But, hilariously, even she couldn’t contain herself.

The former Porto and Zenit Saint Petersburg striker and new wife Camila Angelo both took to social media to announce the arrival of daughter Zaya at a hospital in Miami where the couple own an apartment. Hulk, who has three children with ex-wife Iran Angelo, expressed his joy at the latest addition to his family alongside photos of him holding Zaya and another with Camila. “Under the blessing of God Almighty Father and Our Lady, our little Zaya was born,” Hulk said on Instagram. “Zaya means: ‘enlightened’ ‘luck’ ‘flower that blooms’ and she really comes to bring light and illuminate our lives more and more. Come blossom our home my love, we’ve long dreamed of your arrival.” Hulk, 35, was given special permission by his club Atletico Mineiro to miss their weekend fixture so that he could be present at the birth of his daughter and the Brazilian international promised to ‘love and protect her forever’ in an emotional post. Real name Givanildo Vieira de Sousa, the striker was given the nickname Hulk due to a resemblance to Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno.   Hulk and Camila married in September 2020 after he split from Iran – mother of his three children – in 2019. Shortly after the break-up, the striker capped 49-times by Brazil, confirmed that he was in a relationship with Iran’s niece but confessed that there was no relationship between them whilst he was married to Iran. “I am a man and I was not happy in my marriage. I don’t think I’m an ugly person. I’m young and Camila is young and extremely beautiful. We ended up getting involved. We were single,” he revealed.  Since leaving Chinese Super league club Shanghai SIPG in 2020, Hulk has found success back in his homeland, forging a devastating strike partnership with former Chelsea striker Diego Costa. Last season, the pair fired Atletico Mineiro to the club’s first Brazilian top flight title for 50 years. Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

A new manager and new players will arrive at Old Trafford – which  means a number of under-performing stars will be asked to leave the club.  That’s what interim boss Ralf Rangnick implied after his side’s 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday, where he claimed that up to TEN new players are needed. Gabby Agbonlahor went evern further as he delivered a damning verdict on the state of United after their Anfield humiliating, claiming that the club need a whopping 15 signings this summer if they are to challenge for the title in the near future. He told talkSPORT when asked how many changes they need: “I know it might sound a lot but 15 players, I’d say. “They need a better bench. Look at the likes of Man City, Liverpool, and Chelsea – they’ve got two teams. “Man United have got Luke Shaw, when he’s fit and on form, Bruno Fernandes when he fancies it, [Cristiano] Ronaldo will score goals and maybe David De Gea. That’s four. “The rest of them I’d put on the transfer list.”  Ally McCoist added: “They need a massive overhaul. “There’s not one Manchester United player getting anywhere near that Liverpool team. None. “So, if you look at it like that, it’s difficult to disagree what Gabby’s said.” Erik Ten Hag, who has agreed to become the next Red Devils boss, will make his own evaluation of the squad, and decide who he wants to keep and who he wants to get rid of. There aren’t many that have covered themselves in glory this season, which could lead to a mass exodus in the summer. Lee Grant – £1.5m Dean Henderson – Academy Phil Jones – £16.5m Nemanja Matic – £40m Paul Pogba – £89.3m Juan Mata – £37.1m Jesse Lingard – Academy Marcus Rashford – Academy Anthony Martial – £36m Edinson Cavani – Free Six players that are likely to be the first out of the door are Lee Grant, Juan Mata, Edinson Cavani, Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, and Jesse Lingard, with their contracts expiring at the end of June. It may be the end of the road for Marcus Rashford at United, after another disappointing performance on Wednesday, which Roy Keane described as ‘child-like’. Phil Jones and the returning Anthony Martial, who has spent the last few months on loan at Sevilla, could both be shown the door too. With the World Cup just around the corner, No.2 goalkeeper Dean Henderson may be keen to leave to get some more game time in a bid to try and get an England call-up. Captain Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are two that many United supporters would be happy to see leave after a terrible season.   But it seems unlikely that the defensive duo will be sold this summer, having spent a combined £130million on them just three years ago. As for players who could arrive at the club, Ajax winger Anthony has been linked with a move to Old Trafford and could reunite with Ten Hag. Villareal’s Pau Torres has reportedly been a long-term target for Premier League clubs and would certainly suit the new manager’s style of football. As would Darwin Nunez, who has impressed in the Champions League this season and would excite many after his incredible form for Benfica in the Portuguese top-flight. It shows that Ten Hag has a lot of work to do this summer – both on and off the pitch – and Micky Gray even warned the Dutchman to ‘stay away’ from the club.

Liverpool’s talisman proved to be too much for United’s back line as he netted twice in his side’s 4-0 victory over their bitter rivals.  Over the two league fixtures the sides have met in this season, Salah has scored five times, making him the first ever player to score five goals against Manchester United in a single Premier League season. But Salah was forced to clarify his not so clear comments he made in regards to his brilliant record against his club’s rivals. Following Liverpool’s win that sent them to the top of the Premier League, Salah was asked why he and his side had dominated the rivalry this season. And unfortunately for Salah – or perhaps, United – it wasn’t clear whether he was talking about his own teammates or the opposition. “They make our lives easier, in the midfield and in the back,” Salah told Sky Sports. “They always try to give us the ball in this situation, so they make our lives much easier.” He continued: “I think when we defend well, we had a clean sheet, a clean sheet there [at Old Trafford]. So they make our lives easier to score.  “We just go to the game and we want to score one goal. Once we get the first, we want to get the second, once we get the second we go for third. “But I think it’s a top performance from us, here and away, also. So, hopefully we just carry on like this.” Given United’s players were put through their paces yesterday, fans began to question if the Egypt international’s comments applied to them rather than the Liverpool squad. However, it didn’t take long for Salah to take to Twitter to clarify that this wasn’t the case. I meant our midfield, and our defence, make it easy for us. I was not talking about the Manchester United players whom I respect. https://t.co/WjaQfgZNw6 Salah wrote: “I meant our midfield, and our defence, make it easy for us. I was not talking about the Manchester United players whom I respect.” Hilariously, though, Manchester United fans did not seem to mind whether their rivals’ star man was talking about their squad or not. “It’s still true bro, we are not offended,” one United fan replied to Salah. “We’re literally so s*** that man had to come on twitter to make our players feel better,” another wrote. The Old Trafford faithful endured a whole roller coaster of emotions during and after their crushing 4-0 defeat, with club legend Gary Neville perhaps summing up the mood the best. “It was a sobering evening, we expected it, every Manchester United fan expected it,” he said. “I cannot explain how we’ve gone from what was a slightly promising at end of last season with finishing second… to the point where we are today which was an all-time low in my 42 years of watching Manchester United. “I’ve never seen it as bad as that.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Reds beat their fierce rivals 4-0 at Anfield on Wednesday, just months after hammering them 5-0 at Old Trafford.  That win sent Jurgen Klopp‘s side to the top of the league – potentially only until Manchester City play Brighton on Wednesday – and the Reds are still in contention for an unprecedented quadruple. As an ex-Liverpool player and fan himself, Redknapp revealed his pride at watching them play, whilst praising the players and the manager for their performances and success this season. “It was agreat performance, especially in the first half, they were just incredible,” he told talkSPORT. “The tempo they played that, they were just another on a completely different level to Manchester United. “They are a team that’s just full of quality players, good individuals, great professionals, they work hard for each other when they haven’t got the ball, they go chase it and win it back. “When you look at that front three, they could have massive egos but they don’t play like that. They’re just a wonderful team to watch.    “If you’re a Liverpool fan, and obviously I’m biased because it’s my team, you’re so proud when you watch them. You are so proud of that team and everything that they encapsulate. “I think the manager deserves so much credit for that.” As for United, they now look out of the race for the top four and could be in the Europa League or even in the Europa Conference League next season. Their fans have been booing their players – including the outgoing Paul Pogba at the weekend – and seem completely disconnected from the club.  Redknapp added: “On the flip side, listening to you this morning, a lot of Manchester United fans are completely the other way when they watch their team. “There’s no real love for that team right now. They’re just at the complete opposite end of the scale.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

11,https://talksport.com/football/1068985/premier-league-goalscoring-duos-harry-kane-heung-min-son-history-tottenham-arsenal-chelsea-man-city/,Harry Kane and Heung-min Son record: The five greatest goalscoring combos in Premier League history as Tottenham duo make history,"Harry Kane and Heung-min Son continued to display their telepathic link up on Saturday as Tottenham beat Aston Villa. Son scored a hat-trick and Kane set him up for one of those as Spurs recorded a huge 4-0 victory over Steven Gerrard’s side. The duo broke the record for combined goals in February during a 4-0 win over Leeds, and after the game, Kane hailed his relationship with Son. He said: “We’ve being playing with each now for a long long time, we just understand each others games well. “When I drop deep, Sonny knows where to run and hopefully I’m able to put him in. “We enjoy playing together.” On Saturday, the duo moved onto 40 combined goals, four clear of Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. Kane and Son also broke the record for the most combined goals in a season during the 2020/21 campaign. The pair notched 14, which beat Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s 13 goal contributions during the 1994/95 campaign. With that in mind, let us look at the Premier League’s other deadly duos that Son and Kane have surpassed. The English duo joined Spurs at the same time in 1992 and spent five years together before Sheringham moved to Manchester United. However, in 2001 he returned to White Hart Lane to link up with Anderton once more and the duo combined for a respectable 27 goals. Given that Anderton only scored just over 30 goals in his time with Spurs, he was often the man to provide the assist for Sheringham. They certainly helped Tottenham at the time and both became popular figures among Spurs supporters.  The French pair will be forever remembered as Arsenal legends after they were part of the 2003/04 ‘Invincibles’ team. Henry and Pires had an incredible understanding on the pitch and they often linked up to score some memorable goals for the Gunners. The two played with each other for six years and contributed to an enormously successful time at Arsenal. Twenty-nine combined goal contributions is very impressive – and they could have had at least one more had they not messed up a now infamous penalty against Manchester City in 2005! Despite this, Henry and Pires were a magical duo that often caused problems for even the best teams in the Premier League.  These two are a much more recent duo, with their last game together coming in the 2019/20 season. Aguero and Silva were lethal, and though it was often the latter setting up the former, the duo were equally devastating to play against. In total, Aguero and Silva played over 200 Premier League games together. The Argentine set the Spaniard up on his league debut in a 4-0 win over Swansea in 2011, and they just went from there. In their time at the Etihad, Aguero and Silva established City as a new power in world football and won the league four times.  Lampard and Drogba were the Premier League’s deadliest duo until earlier this year when Son and Kane surpassed them. Both were incredible players that brought a lot of success to Chelsea. They played together from 2004 all the way up until 2012 and helped Chelsea win the Premier League three times. Their goals were quite evenly split but Drogba did score slightly more than Lampard, with the former England man providing the ammunition. Lampard and Drogba might not hold the Premier League record anymore but they will never be forgotten at Stamford Bridge.  Kane and Son have played 187 games together in the Premier League, with their first game back in 2015. Since then, they have combined for 40 goals. This is incredible but what makes it even better is that Kane and Son didn’t contribute to a goal together until the 2016/17 season. Since Son set Kane up in a 4-0 win over Stoke in September 2016, the duo haven’t looked back and are now record breakers. Given that Kane is 28 and Son is 29, who knows how many more times they could combine. The duo are evenly split in terms of who has scored the goals, but in recent times, Kane has become more of a provider for Son, which reflects his development as a player. There are not many more exciting duos in the world at the moment than Kane and Son, so long may this partnership continue.

The hosts made a fast start at Anfield and never looked back, taking the lead in the fifth minute as Luis Diaz slotted home, before two goals from Mohamed Salah and one from Sadio Mane completed the rout.  However, things threatened to boil over in the immediate aftermath of the opener as Alexander-Arnold and De Gea squared up to each other. Replays show after Diaz netted, Alexander-Arnold kicked the ball in the Red Devils goalkeeper’s direction and it appeared to brush the Spaniard’s face. De Gea was understandably upset by this and the pair had to be separated by referee Martin Atkinson, who then had stern words with the Reds defender. And talkSPORT’s Adrian Durham suggested Alexander-Arnold was fortunate to just get a talking to. Durham said on commentary for talkSPORT: “Trent Alexander-Arnold blasts the ball and it just whistles past David de Gea’s face, who’s not happy and rightly so as well. “I actually think Trent’s a lucky boy because if that smacks De Gea in the face he’s in big trouble.” 👀 David De Gea wasn’t happy with Trent Alexander Arnold after #LFC’s opener #LIVMUN pic.twitter.com/LAfIuaOzlY Sunderland legend Micky Gray added: “Absolutely. I think he had a word with Martin Atkinson, who seemed to say he saw it and if it happens again he’s in big trouble. “You just don’t need to do it… you don’t need to rub it in any more.” Meanwhile, football hard man Graeme Souness thinks Naby Keita should have been red carded for his apparent stamp on Jesse Lingard. “Liverpool [have] got lucky. It wouldn’t have affected the score but this was a sending off,” he said. ‘He would have got a suspension. That’s a red card,” former United captain Roy Keane added.

13,https://talksport.com/football/1089810/man-united-liverpool-bruno-fernandes-premier-league/,"Manchester United ‘were in awe’ of and ‘admired’ rampant Liverpool, says Michael Gray, as Bruno Fernandes reveals the difference between the Premier League rivals","Manchester United showed no fight against Liverpool as they were steamrollered by their rivals at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp‘s side ran rampant to win 4-0 win and go top of the Premier League table.  Whilst Liverpool’s stellar performance was celebrated, United were subject to even further questioning on just what’s going so wrong for them. “I pretty much saw what I think I’ve seen all season from Manchester United, it just wasn’t a very good performance for me,” commentator Micky Gray, who was at the game for talkSPORT, said. United were once the dominant Premier League team like Liverpool and Man City are now. However, times have changed, and United have arguably been under performing since the departure of manager Alex Ferguson in 2013. And last night’s loss summed up how times have changed at Old Trafford. “I’ve seen it over the years when Manchester United were dominant. At least Liverpool had a bit of fight about them and they took the game to Manchester United,” Gray continued. “I mean that’s two games now home and away when they played against Liverpool, with a deficit of 9-0, where I’ve just not seen any fight at all with this Manchester United squad.”   High-flying Liverpool waited 30 years for a league title when they won in 2020. However, they still managed to challenge the Red Devils during their heyday. And Gray suggested the current United squad were ‘in awe’ of their rivals’ ability to dominate the north-west derby. “The movement of Liverpool, Manchester United were switching off, you know, these little given goals,” he said. “Manchester United were stood there admiring what Liverpool were doing instead of doing their own jobs… they just all switched off.” One of the key issues at Old Trafford cited by fans is not bringing in quality signings and not offloading those who don’t want to be there, something that was highlighted by Gray. “I think it’s going to take them four, five, maybe six transfer windows to actually get them back to where they need to be,” he said. One of the players whose performances have been below par this season is Bruno Fernandes, and the Portugal international opted to revealed why there is an ever-growing gap between his side and Liverpool in his post-match interview. “Liverpool are fighting for the title. We are fighting for nothing. That is the difference.” Fernandes said.  “It’s a bad result once again. Apologies to the fans but that will never be enough. We represent a big club, we are competing till the end and we have to compete. “No one can put their head down now and think that I just want to have vacations or whatever. “They have to all of us have to understand that we have something to fight at least for the badge.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

14,https://talksport.com/football/1089904/chelsea-arsenal-results-premier-league/,Chelsea haven’t lost three home games on the bounce since Arsenal beat them in 1993,"Chelsea are keen to cement third place by returning to winning ways on Wednesday night when they take on Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. Thomas Tuchel’s side, fresh off the back of their 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, are now tasked with defeating Mikel Arteta’s men. The Blues head into the clash in south west London having lost two matches in succession at Stamford Bridge. Returning after the international break, they suffered a shock 4-1 defeat at home to Brentford, before losing 3-1 against Real Madrid in the Champions League. Another defeat on Wednesday night, would represent the first time in 29 years they have lost three successive home games in all competitions. Coincidently, Arsenal were the opponents back in November 1993 in the third match, as Alan Smith and Ian Wright both netted, securing a 2-0 victory for the Gunners. Smith scored past goalkeeper Dmitri Kharin on 27 minutes, before Wright fired home from the penalty spot just before half-time to inflict misery on Chelsea. The hosts, however, are looking to record their first league double over Arsenal since the 2015/16 season.  Chelsea defeated Arsenal 2-0 at the Emirates back in August with Romelu Lukaku and Reece James on the scoresheet. Arsenal, meanwhile, who are eight points behind their opponents, suffered a 1-0 defeat to Southampton at the weekend, which inflicted a third consecutive defeat on Mikel Arteta’s side. Chelsea boss Tuchel insists his side will give it their all and are fully focussed on trying to finish as high as possible. “I am a bit afraid that I don’t share your opinion about what is sure and what is not! Sure we don’t become second, sure we don’t finish fourth – I’m not sure about it until the season is finished”, the German told reporters.  “We will fight hard. We have a crucial four matches coming in another short period of time within like two weeks – Arsenal, West Ham, Man United, Everton. “Two home, two away. Crucial matches given the task where we want to be and what we want to achieve. I agree with you that it is a big challenge in terms of physical challenge but also mentally to now dive in the next competition and in the main competition – Premier League. “Given the fact it seems like things are pretty safe but they can turn so, so quickly with the schedule. We want to play a physical game again tomorrow, want to demand again from the team. “I accept it is very demanding and challenging for everybody but at the same time it’s what you sign up for when you sign up for Chelsea. We demand special things, we want to be a special group. “We have to trust the players can overcome again and compete with teams who are maybe have more days to prepare, less games in their legs and still on us to push the standards and level.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

15,https://talksport.com/football/1089858/man-united-news-simon-jordan-liverpool-premier-league/,Manchester United given scathing indictment by Simon Jordan after their display against Liverpool who claims they ‘cheated the fans and the club’,"Simon Jordan did not hold back on his assessment of Manchester United’s players in their defeat to Liverpool. The Red Devils were well beaten at Anfield and were woeful from the first minute to last, registering two shots and having just 28 percent possession of the ball in the 4-0 loss.  Inquest’s have also taken place, with Bruno Fernandes leading an investigation into the display in the dressing room at full-time. It was a miserable evening for the Old Trafford club who also had their wounds rubbed in salt by Liverpool supporters. And speaking on White and Jordan, the co-host weighed in on his opinion of the game, and felt the players ‘cheated the fans and the club’. “It’s very difficult to look at that Man United side from the coach down to the players on the pitch,” the former Crystal Palace chairman said.“From picking Phil Jones in a formation that he’s not overly comfortable with and hasn’t played in for some time, and isn’t up to speed in, is probably not the ideal coaching methodology. “Through to the players’ performance on the pitch, their inability to close space, or want to seem to compete with Liverpool, unexplainable.  “These players are cheating the fans that are going to watch them,” he added. “They are cheating the club. “I think they are, because the one thing you can always do is apply yourself. “If you’re not good enough as a unit, not good enough as a team and the opposition against you is better then you will lay something on them.  “The only kid that laid something on them was Hannibal [Mejri] when he came on, never was there a more fitting name, he came on and put it about. “And ultimately, Gary Neville was right to talk about the fact that he was running around and trying to put his foot into people, and perhaps we don’t want to see some of that. “But at least there was some competitive spirit and pride playing for a football club. “And you look at them, from [Marcus] Rashford all the way back, there was not enough about them.  “They didn’t compete, and I do not know what other word you can use. “If you are being paid to do something, and you’re not doing it week-in-week-out, week-in-week-out, and you’ve got people schlepping across the country to see you play, then you are cheating somebody.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

Pep Guardiola’s side lost to Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at the weekend and then slipped behind them in the league, after they demolished Manchester United 4-0 at Anfield on Tuesday night. If the Citizens had been playing Brighton a few weeks ago, you would have said this should be an easy home win. But City have gone three games in all competitions without a win and Brighton are flying, having seen off both Arsenal and Tottenham away from home in their last two games. Graham Potter has the Seagulls back on track after rough run of a form and a top-ten finish is within their sights. Recent history is massively stacked in City’s favour, though, as they have won ten of the last 11 meetings between the two, while the last time they failed to beat Brighton at home was in 1982. Since then, Brighton have visited City eight times and lost every game.  This Premier League clash will take place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, April 20. The match will be exclusively live on talkSPORT and coverage will start at 7pm with Adrian Durham. Commentary will come from Sam Matterface and former Republic of Ireland midfielder Matt Holland. To tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2, click HERE for the live stream. You can also listen in the following ways:  City are still without England full-back Kyle Walker due to an ankle injury. Playmaker Kevin De Bruyne (foot) has been passed fit and centre-back Ruben Dias could return for the first time since March 1 after two games as an unused substitute. Ilkay Gundogan (knee) has overcome a knock and Ederson is likely to return in goal after Zach Steffen played in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final loss to Liverpool. Brighton are without Yves Bissouma, who starts a two-match suspension for reaching 10 yellow cards. Fellow midfielder Steven Alzate missed the win at Tottenham through illness but is back in training and could be involved. Centre-half Shane Duffy is still out with a thigh injury. Manchester City provisional squad: Ederson, Steffen, Carson, Cancelo, Stones, Ake, Laporte, Dias, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Fernandinho, Rodri, Sterling, De Bruyne, Silva, Mahrez, Grealish, Foden, Jesus, Delap, Lavia, McAtee. Brighton provisional squad: Sanchez, Steele, Lamptey, Cucurella, Dunk, Veltman, Offiah, Webster, Mac Allister, Alzate, Mwepu, Lallana, Caicedo, Gross, March, Sarmiento, Trossard, Welbeck, Maupay.  City saw their hopes of a treble ended as they were beaten by Liverpool in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Manager Guardiola had made seven changes for the game as his players felt the effects of the previous Wednesday’s bruising Champions League game at Atletico Madrid and the Spaniard remains comfortable with his decision. Asked if he had any regrets after coming in for some criticism, he said: “No. I understand the opinions of my fans. They have all my respect to give their opinions but my selection was for many reasons. “Kevin (De Bruyne) wasn’t ready, Kyle (Walker) wasn’t ready, (Ilkay) Gundogan wasn’t ready. They (the players who played) were ready.” Guardiola was also quizzed on reports City have agreed a £500,000-a-week contract with Erling Haaland ahead of the clash with Brighton. Speaking at a press conference, the City boss said: “No answer to your question.” Pushed further, he added: “No answer about these questions. I have another concern and business in my head right now (than) to think what will happen in this club next season.” Brighton manager Graham Potter, meanwhile, said ahead of the game. “City are an amazing side. The way they played the second half at Wembley showed a lot about their quality and character. “Pep has been there a while, but the message from him has never suffered, from a coaching perspective it’s incredible.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

17,https://talksport.com/football/1089710/sadio-mane-liverpool-assist-manchester-united-luka-modric-pass/,Sadio Mane’s assist against Manchester United was good but not as good as Luka Modric’s ‘pass of the decade’,"Sadio Mane’s superb assist in Liverpool’s 4-0 destruction of Manchester United has been the subject of social media hysteria but Ally McCoist believes Luka Modric’s sublime pass for Real Madrid against Chelsea last week tops it. Mane produced a stunning pass on the turn to tee up Mohamed Salah for Liverpool’s second goal in the Premier League clash, which came just six days after the football world purred over Modric’s outside-of-the-foot assist for the 13-time European champions.  Ex-Rangers striker McCoist called it the ‘pass of the decade’ as he set up Rodrygo as Chelsea were dumped out of the competition and he thinks it is still the best. “Brilliant pass, but not as good as pass of the decade. But it was a brilliant pass; I’m accepting that,” he said when a listener asked him how he thought they compared. It was the Senegal international’s second assist of the season and arguably his most important, setting the tone for Jurgen Klopp’s men to put a lacklustre United to the sword at Anfield. Mane put the game beyond any doubt in the 68th minute when he fired low past David de Gea despite United enjoying their best spell of possession in the lead up to the goal. The goal took Mane’s goals total up to 14 for the season – a solid return despite missing a month of the season after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal.  McCoist was also full of praise for Mohamed Salah’s composed touch and finish from Mane’s pass. “It’s spinning really awkwardly as it arrives at him, so his touch has got to be perfect. Honestly, what a touch it is from Salah and the finish is superb,” McCoist added. Salah added his second goal of the night five-minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 22, five goals ahead of Tottenham’s Son Heung-Min in the race for the Golden Boot. The Egyptian forward was back amongst the goals after a goal drought that saw him go six games without finding the net, and the league’s top scorer looks to have found his groove once more ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby against Everton at Anfield.

The Tottenham fan, 42, is known for being the face of multi-million pound campaigns for brands like Dolce & Gabbana, while he now has Wellwear, his own clothing line so he knows what he’s talking about.   But the Essex-born Gandy let his own love of Spurs cloud his judgement when he put Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta at the bottom – much to presenter and Gooner Laura Woods’ disappointment. “It terms of the worst, it is Mikel Arteta”, Gandy said laughing on the Breakfast show. “I am a Spurs fan, who else is going to be bottom of the list?” He also appeared at pains to suggest Aston Villa manager is not up to scratch. “I mean I Iove Steven Gerrard, but the dress sense, it is a bit geography kind of stand-in teacher. He is second from bottom. “I love [Watford boss] Roy Hodgson as well, it is lovely as he is always in a shirt and tie, the old school which I love.”  The fashion icon later ranked his top three well dressed, with Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers coming third in his list. “I have met him in person a couple of times, and he is well dressed. He actually gets it right, he mixes it well. “He mixes the tie, the suit, and then it is the bomber jacket which he goes with a few times. He is not the kind of typical team tracksuit wearer.” Second in line for the model was Newcastle boss Eddie Howe. “He is just a good looking guy”, Gandy explained.    “He is one of those, has the good looks and pulls off anything I think.” It come of no surprise that Antonio Conte was his no.1 dressed manager. “Number one, you probably have to go for a European manager, and having looked through, Antonio Conte is number one”, he said smiling. It is a surprise that both Scott Parker or Thomas Tuchel, who was a model in his younger days, made the grade. Parker may not be in the Premier League yet, but the young manager, 41, is on the brink of guiding Bournemouth back to the big time this season, with his side currently second in the Championship. But unless he takes over from Conte in the White Hart Lane dugout, he’ll have his work cut out for him to get on this list.

Already 2-0 down at half-time, the visiting players were seemingly mocked by the home supporters – before the game even restarted.  Both teams were passing the ball about after a delay to the second half as referee Martin Atkinson had issues with his communication headset. And to compound the Man United players’ misery, fans on the Kop started to shout ‘ole’ when Bruno Fernandes and co. knocked it about to each other. It was one of many humiliating moments and some on Twitter joked it was United’s most productive period of play. A clip of the exchange was posted by Paul Machin of Redmen TV, who wrote: “That was United’s best spell of the whole game.” Goals from Sadio Mane, Luis Diaz and a brace from Mohamed Salah gave Liverpool a resounding victory. For the time being, the win put them top of the Premier League, but Jurgen Klopp’s side will drop back down to second if Man City win at Brighton. It’s also the first time since the 2013/14 season the 19-time league champions secured the double over bitter rivals United. This is it in case it didnt get shown on the telly. 😂 pic.twitter.com/U9owv1lx8P But without a doubt, the manner of the victories on this occasion were far more embarrassing, as Liverpool scored nine goals in the two meetings without reply. The Red Devils were particularly poor in the first half, where they did not register a shot. It didn’t get any better at full-time either as the visitors had just two efforts on goal, on one target and had only had 28 per cent possession. “It’s embarrassing, it’s disappointing, maybe even humiliating,” United boss Ralf Rangnick said afterwards. “We have to accept Liverpool are six years ahead of us now.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Toffees are three points clear of the drop zone with a game in hand on Burnley and a win would go a long way to securing their top-flight future. Weirdly, this is the first meeting between the two this season because of Covid postponements and it is an important game for both sides. Leicester will be looking to bounce back from their defeat at St James’ Park to Newcastle United. The Foxes were unbeaten in three and will now look to get back on track against an Everton side fighting for their lives. The Toffees have been awful away from home for a long time, but they have won their last two league fixtures at Goodison Park, so those points have been crucial in their battle to stay up. The Toffees have also beaten the Foxes in three of the last four league meetings at Goodison, so recent history is on their side.  This Premier League game will take place on Wednesday, April 20 The match at Goodison Park is scheduled to kick off at 7:45pm. Rodgers has only beaten Lampard as a manager once in four meetings. Unfortunately, you can’t watch this game if you live in the UK as it hasn’t been selected for broadcast by Sky Sports or BT Sport. However, highlights will be available on the Sky Sports website and app shortly after the end of the match and then later on Match of the Day. Updates will also be live on talkSPORT throughout the afternoon whiletalkSPORT.com will be running a live blogto follow all the action. To tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2, click HERE for the live stream. The home side have quite a few injury concerns to key players and that could make their task harder. Yerry Mina hasn’t played since February with a hamstring injury, while Donny van de Beek hasn’t played since withdrawing from the West Ham match just before kick-off. The Toffees are also set to be without Tom Davies, Nathan Patterson and Andros Townsend until the end of the campaign. Meanwhile, the away side will definitely be without Wilfried Ndidi and possibly Jamie Vardy. The former England international hasn’t played since March due to a knee injury and is a big doubt for this game. However, we could see Jonny Evans and Wesley Fofana return to the centre of defence after both were rested at the weekend. Timothy Castagne and Ricardo Pereira will also be pushing to start as will James Maddison after his winning goal against PSV in the Europa Conference League last Thursday. So, Rodgers could make quite a few changes from the side that lost on Sunday.  Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

21,https://talksport.com/football/1089688/mohamed-salah-thiago-stats-liverpool-manchester-united/,"Mohamed Salah jokes Thiago is the only one Liverpool fans were singing for in 4-0 win over Manchester United, while Gary Neville points out his reaction during standing ovation","Mohamed Salah couldn’t help but crack a joke about the reception Thiago received at Anfield on Tuesday night. Liverpool thrashed rivals Manchester United 4-0, and the Reds were in fine spirits as they overtook Manchester City to top the Premier League table as a result.  Salah has scored five times against the Red Devils this season, and his double against them on Tuesday night confirmed he’d rediscovered his shooting boots following his brief goal drought. However, despite the Egyptian making headlines for getting back to his old self, Liverpool‘s talisman was keen to point out just how well his teammate, Thiago, played in the clash. “He was the only one they [the fans] were singing for today,” Salah joked in his post-match interview. Thiago well and truly ran the show as Liverpool looked to edge ahead of their title rivals, winning possession for the Reds and completing a range of perfect passes on countless occasions before being substituted late on where he received a standing ovation from the home crowd. “Thiago was laughing when he came off, he was laughing at Man United all game” Gary Neville observed. “I don’t normally swear on the podcast but he took the p*** out of Man United tonight.” Thiago has turned out to be something of a bargain, signing for £25million from Bayern Munich in 2020. The Italy-born player broke the record for the most passes by a player in 45 minutes in the Premier League on his debut against Chelsea, with 75 successful passes. Since then, he’s been a key asset to Jurgen Klopp, playing 60 games – a tally that would likely be much higher had he not sustained multiple injuries and caught coronavirus twice. And against United, him and Virgil van Dijk completed 111 passes in the first half. United combined only completed 92. “He’s a good player. We have to keep him fit,” Klopp reacted to Thiago’s latest masterclass. “He has rhythm now, which helps with these kind of situations to really be in the right spaces, the right little turns, finding the right passes. “You don’t have five million players like this on the planet – only a few who see things earlier than anyone else and have the technical ability to not only see it but get the ball there as well. “It was a top game from him.”   Klopp added: “He is a world-class player. He can be pretty dangerous with and without the ball so, from our point of view, there is really nothing to moan about. “Football is outstanding, but his counter-pressing was mad. That makes the full package. I couldn’t respect it more.” But while Thiago stood out as one of Liverpool’s star players on Tuesday, he still pointed out he was not alone in being at his best in the clash. “I think it’s one of the strongest performances a team has had here at Anfield,” he said. “The first half was unbelievable, also the second one. We were at a high level for the 90 minutes.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

The Borussia Dortmund striker is set to join the Premier League champions this summer, with City willing to pay his release clause of £63million. The 21-year-old has become one of the most coveted talents in world football having developed into a deadly striker at Dortmund. Haaland, who joined the German side from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, has a remarkable 82 goals in 85 games for Dortmund. He also helped Dortmund win the DFB-Pokal (German FA Cup) last season. According to Transfermarkt, his value stands at £135m, so for Man City to be signing him for less than half of that price, could prove to be one of the best signings in their history. A number of clubs want to sign him, with his dad Alfe-Inge Haaland and his agent Mino Raiola reportedly speaking to a number of Europe’s big hitters, including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. The latest reports suggest City have agreed terms with Haaland’s representatives which would make him the highest paid player in the Premier League. One of those terms include his salary, which reports suggest will stand at half a million quid every week. Speaking on White and Jordan, the former Crystal Palace chairman was far from happy when hearing about the figures involved, labelling the amounts of money as ‘ridiculous’ and ‘obscene.’   “We are already in the territory of ridiculous level of a return for footballers,” Jordan said. “I don’t begrudge anybody making money, people deserve to be successful. And in their field if they’re good at what they do, they should get rewarded. “But we are getting into the level of what footballers are getting paid, it’s ridiculous. “Now I don’t know whether this is £500,000-a-week after tax or £500,000-a-week before tax, either which way, we are moving into a territory of obscene amounts of money.  “No one should really want this, we throw these figures around in a country that’s got foodbanks up the ying-yang as if 500-grand-a-week on a footballer is something we should all accept. “They’re not worth it, he’s not worth £500,000-a-week, and these players that are getting paid this kind of money aren’t worth it. “Back in the day when people were making lots and lots of money, do you know what the key component was? You had to be really, really, really good. “And it seems to me now in football, you can be quite average and become a multi-multi-millionaire.  “It’s not bitterness, it’s not resentment, I’ve had my time and I made a lot of money, and I was really good at what I did, and I wasn’t so good at other things, that’s why I cost myself a lot of money. “In this world of football, it seems to be sometimes, and not in the case of Erling Haaland, because he isn’t mediocre. “But what the 500-grand salary does, it makes a 200-grand salary look like it’s an average pay. So someone that is average in the Premier League gets paid £10million a year. “And you’ve got to sit back and pause for a second and go, half of these players can only kick with one foot.  “And you look at it and go, how do you get £10million-a-year to be an average footballer, that’s what a £500,000 salary does.” Whilst Pep Guardiola is set to bring in one of the best players in the world, Jordan doesn’t believe Haaland will send the club into the ‘stratosphere’. “We’ve got a big six in this league which [some of them] consist of Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, arguably,” he added. “And those clubs are not going to sit on their hands and allow those clubs to disappear into the ether.  “Liverpool are margins away from Manchester City, margins. So I look at it and say yes it’s a component part [signing Haaland] that Man City haven’t got, and it will add to them. “But I don’t think it will send them into the stratosphere. “I think Liverpool have bought a boy in [Luis] Diaz, that will change the direction of travel for Liverpool. “So I think there will still be the competitivity [in the league].” 😫 “No one should really want this… It’s ridiculous! It’s obscene amounts.”🤦‍♂️ “We throw these figures around in a country that has foodbanks as if it’s something we should accept!”Simon Jordan passionately reacts to #MCFC offering Haaland £500k-a-week. pic.twitter.com/IWvyQgnrsr Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Red Devils were beaten 4-0 at Anfield, thanks to a brace from Mohamed Salah and goals from Sadio Mane as well as Luis Diaz. After losing 5-0 in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford, the club have now conceded NINE times in two matches against the Reds this season. It’s been a abysmal season for 20-time league champions United, who going into the game last night, could have increased the pressure on Tottenham in the race for top four. But not only did they lose, the manner of the defeat meant they have dropped a place to sixth, behind Arsenal, on goal difference. At full-time, manager Ralf Rangnick confirmed the players were dissatisfied with their performance, which then led to Fernandes asking the questions. “We had a conversation in the locker room right now where Bruno also said something towards the team and I said something,” he explained, choosing to keep things private. Fernandes also spoke to Sky Sports speaking about the defeat, and issued an apology to the club’s fans.  “It’s a bad result once again,” he said. “Not much that I can say. Obviously, [we] apologise to the fans. “It will never be enough but obviously it is what we can do now. “They [the fans] don’t deserve that we play in this way, they deserve much more from us. “The way they support us until the end, the way they stay even after the whistle to applaud us, they deserve much more from us.” On the squad’s feeling on the result, the Portugal international added: “We have to say the things, but that has to be kept in the dressing room. “We know there is not much we can do now the game is over. We have to think already to the next one that will be a tough one again. “We have to look in ourselves, we have to look inside, from the top until the bottom and understand what is going wrong.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

After the 5-0 hammering at Old Trafford earlier this season, the Reds showed pure superiority over their rivals once again thanks to goals from Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and two from Mohamed Salah.  Another humiliating night for Ralf Rangnick’s men leaves them three points adrift of Champions League qualification, having played one game more than fourth-place Tottenham. Meanwhile, the quadruple-chasing Reds go two points above Manchester City – who have a game in hand – not just thanks to their electric front three,  but the brilliance of Thiago Alcantara in midfield. For all United’s raggedness, the Reds were outstanding, particularly the Spain midfielder. Speaking on commentary for Sky Sports, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher said: “That’s his best performance at Anfield.” Jurgen Klopp’s side picked up where they left off at Old Trafford when Diaz slammed home from Salah’s cross inside five minutes. Liverpool showed their class off the pitch with a minute’s applause for Cristiano Ronaldo – who did not play following the death of his new-born son on Monday.  Salah all-but ended the game by doubling the lead on 22 minutes, capping off a free-flowing move which talkSPORT host Adrian Durham labelled a ‘goal of the season contender’. Mane played a brilliant pass for the second and then got in on the act in the second-half, before Salah rounded off the thrashing. It’s the first time United have conceded nine goals to one team across two games in a Premier League season – and it’s another new low for Ralf Rangnick’s sorry men.

A minute’s applause was conducted in the seventh minute of the Premier League match between the long-time rivals in a show of support for United star Ronaldo, following the death of his newborn son. Liverpool also sang their anthem ‘You’ll Walk Alone’, which led manager Jurgen Klopp to describe it as his ‘moment of the game’.  The poignant gestures for Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez came after the couple announced the tragic death of their baby boy on Monday. Supporters from both teams united for a minute’s applause in the seventh minute of the Premier League fixture, in reference to the Portuguese icon’s shirt number. Speaking after the match, which ended 4-0 to Liverpool, Reds manager Klopp said: “Pure class in the moment where everyone knows since yesterday so many things are much more important in life. That was my moment of the game.” Ronaldo, 37, was absent from the clash as he grieves the loss with Man United saying: “Family is more important than everything.” 7-minutes in, Liverpool and Man United fans show their support for Cristiano Ronaldo and his family. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/5TCxj5oxKO United had earlier confirmed the tribute with a statement reading: “While United and Liverpool share English football’s greatest rivalry, there is a deep-rooted respect held between the two clubs and that will be highlighted by the minute’s applause, which was initially suggested by fans of the Merseyside team. “Ralf Rangnick’s United squad led a request to wear black armbands at Anfield and that has been reciprocated by Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool side.” Ronaldo and his partner were expecting twins, and said the birth of their daughter ‘gives us the strength to live this moment’. “It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away,” the couple’s emotional statement read. “It is the greatest pain that any parent can feel. “Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. “We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support.

Under interim boss Ralf Rangnick, United were all at sea against their rivals as they succumbed to a 4-0 hammering at Anfield.  Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and a Mohamed Salah brace gave title-chasing Liverpool the comfortable victory and Man United can be thankful they didn’t lose by more. Former Red Devils defender Neville was left tearing his hair out by what he was seeing, adding that there is an ‘excuse mentality’ at Old Trafford. Neville said: “The demise today and all season has been alarming. “These are the easiest fixtures in the league at this moment in time. “‘I’ve been watching Manchester United for 42 years, this is as bad as it gets in my time watching the club. “This United team are a waste of space. They’re hopeless in front of David De Gea.”  He added: ”This is just a nothing. Hide behind the new manager, blame the old. (There’s an) excuse mentality running through the club. “Manchester United are fit, but they’re walking – at best an amble, a jaunt. “Look at the space between the front and the back, it’s unbelievable.’ Then they get in shape and walk.” Neville could only find one positive for United – in the form of 19-year-old starlet Hannibal Mejbri.  The midfielder entered the fray on 84 minutes and impressed Neville for his endeavours to win the ball off the Liverpool players. Neville said: “It takes a young kid to come on to show them how to sprint and put a challenge in. I’m actually proud of him.” He added: “The kid showed something that he didn’t like the idea of Liverpool taking the mickey out of his team-mates. At least he showed something. “It wasn’t great him kicking players but that’s something Man United fans can take at least. There were some lads out there who are good lads, professional, but they’re broken. “[Bruno] Fernandes is a good player, there’s some decent players out there. They’ve played at good levels.

The Red Devils were well beaten by the Premier League title-chasing Reds, with a Mohamed Salah double and goals from Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane sealing the comfortable win. It could have been a bigger of margin of victory, with Jurgen Klopp’s vibrant men running rings around the hapless Man United throughout. Neville tore into the players while the match was going on, labelling the team a ‘waste of space.’ And his mood showed no signs of improving after the match, as Neville went on to criticise the way the club is run, labelling it ‘fundamentally broken.’ He told Sky Sports: “It was a sobering evening, we expected it, every Manchester United fan expected it. I don’t think one Manchester United fan came here tonight with any hope whatsoever. But you still try and build yourself up in that half an hour before kick-off, could something happen? But nothing, that team’s got nothing. “I cannot explain how we’ve gone from what was slightly promising at the end of last season with finishing second and I know we lost the Europa League final, which was a bad one, to the point where we are today which was an all-time low in my 42 years of watching Manchester United. “I’ve never seen it as bad as that.”  Neville added: “What the club have done over the last ten years… Jurgen Klopp apparently had an interview or a conversation with Manchester United, he called it ‘Disneyland’ when he spoke to Ed Woodward. “What Manchester United have done is they’ve brought players in with piano introductions like Alexis Sanchez or #Pogback and all the big per lava around him, Cristiano Ronaldo, they’ve elevated the player above the manager at the football club as well. “You go to Liverpool, Chelsea or Manchester City and the manager is the primary figure at the football club. “Manchester United have undermined managers over the last ten years by elevating the players into a God-like status and the players haven’t performed.  “There are a lot of things the players could’ve done better, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could’ve done at the start of the season, Ralf Rangnick maybe could’ve done better but fundamentally the club is broken on and off the pitch. “The stadium’s falling apart, the training ground’s now falling back to second rate compared to the other training grounds. The owners are taking £25million out of the club when it actually needs investment and sets the culture badly from the top.” It looks like Erik ten Hag will be tasked with cleaning up the Man United mess from next season, but the Dutchman was urged by talkSPORT’s Micky Gray to get out while he still can. Gray said on analysis for talkSPORT: “Once upon a time this used to be the biggest battle in the Premier League. Now there is a gulf and a gap between the two teams like I’ve never seen before.  “Things you can say about Manchester United at the end of this game – no fight, heartless, where’s the desire? Full of quitters. “Stay away, Erik Ten Hag.

28,https://talksport.com/football/1089631/man-united-transfer-news-ralf-rangnick-liverpool-premier-league/,Embarrassed Man United boss Ralf Rangnick says up to ten new players are needed in rebuild to compete with Premier League rivals Liverpool and Man City,"Ralf Rangnick is well aware of the task at hand at Manchester United where he made it clear a huge rebuild is required. The Premier League side’s interim boss was speaking after watching United hammered by Liverpool 4-0 at Anfield and said up to 10 players are needed.  Rangnick admitted he was embarrassed to address supporters afterwards. “It’s embarrassing, it’s disappointing, maybe even humiliating,” he said as the scale of the task sunk in. “We have to accept Liverpool are six years ahead of us now. “When Jurgen Klopp came [to Liverpool] they changed at the club and lifted not just the team but the club and city to a new level. That is what needs to happen with us in the next transfer windows.” Rangnick will take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford in the summer, with Ajax’s Erik ten Hag expected to take over as permanent manager. But before that United, still hoping to qualify for the Champions League, have Arsenal and Chelsea to play. They have played a game more than fourth place Tottenham, who they are three points behind. “There will be a rebuild for sure but that does not help us when we still have five games to play,” Rangnick added. “If you analyse the situation it is not difficult to analyse. For me, it is clear there will be six, seven, eight, maybe ten new players. Before you sign those players you need to be aware how you want to play.”  While Liverpool are chasing a quadruple, Rangnick rejected the idea of his players had already given up fighting. “I don’t think we have checked out, [Liverpool] are just better than us,” he said. “They have 25 Formula One racing cars in their squad. “I don’t think it makes sense to speculate about our chances of making the top four after a performance like today.” Over the two Premier League games, Liverpool have won by an aggregate score of 9-0 and in their history, United have only suffered a combined heavier defeat against Sunderland – 0-11 – in 1893. At Anfield, Klopp’s men took a 2-0 lead into half-time, through Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah, who added another along with one from Sadio Mane. While Rangnick was humiliated, Klopp says he took no satisfaction in the beating.  “I am not here to humiliate opponents. We did what we had to do,” he said. “They played without their centre midfielders and when you are in a difficult situation like United before the game, Paul [Pogba] has to go off and it is not easy to play against us. “Nine-nil? I am not interested in that. It is something for the supporters if they want to celebrate. I know it will not last forever, they will strike back.” The positive note for United on the night was that Liverpool fans put aside their rivalry in the seventh minute to applaud Cristiano Ronaldo, who was absent on compassionate leave after the death of his newborn son.

The Dutchman, who’s currently in charge of Ajax, has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford post with interim boss Ralf Rangnick set to move into a consultancy role at the end of the season. Recent reports suggested that it was between Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino for the job but the former was always considered the favourite. And it appears Man United have got their man with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano reporting that Ten Hag is set to sign the contract. Romano adds Man United and Ajax are in talks discussing his €2million (around £1.6m) release clause. It’s also understood Ten Hag is keen on bringing in Mitchell van der Gaag, who’s serving as his assistant at Ajax. This will be a huge move for the 52-year-old Ten Hag, however, there’s no doubting he’ll have an awful lot of work to do. Jordan said in a rant on talkSPORT earlier in April: “I don’t care, Erik ten Hag will walk into this club and unless he’s given a better framework to work in, he’s going to suffer as well.  “He’s going to have the same problems as well. The whole framework of Manchester United isn’t root and branched. “With due respect to these guys – [Darren] Fletcher, [John] Murtough, Richard Arnold – they are not the best in class to get them to even have a whiff of City and Liverpool. I don’t care who you bring in there. “You can bring in Houdini to escape from the problems and you can bring in Harry Potter to have the magical hands, you’re not going to get proper people in there unless you get proper people to do jobs.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Red Devils conceded nine goals to their arch rivals over two Premier League clashes this season, something former defender Gary Neville described as the lowest point in his 42 years as a supporter.  United’s inferiority to the quadruple-chasing Reds was clear from the moment Luis Diaz opened the scoring on five minutes to Mohamed Salah completing the rout with the same amount of time remaining. The Egyptian bagged another one in between and Sadio Mane got in on the act as the new league leaders ran rings around Ralf Rangnick’s men – who are 22 points adrift of them – for the second time this term. A totally uninspiring United side are now on their lowest points tally ever after 33 Premier League games and increasingly unlikely to qualify for next season’s Champions League. Known for his impassioned rants about the Red Devils, legendary captain Keane had nothing but despair left for his former side. Although he did single out forwards Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard – both of whom were particularly unimpressive at Anfield. Keane said on Sky Sports: “It’s not anger, now I think it’s just sadness. You look at the United team, there’s no heart, no soul, no leaders.   “They are so far off. You look at the United fans tonight, there’s no surprise at the scoreline. They kept going until the end, but you just felt Liverpool could score every time they went forward. “There’s just disarray at the club from the top, the board, the fans have no time for the owners. They need a new manager. They need players in, they need players out. “It’s so sad to see and it’s not the club I played for. It’s chalk and cheese. I don’t see a Manchester United team out there fighting and playing with pride. “There’s no surprise at the result. Over the two games this season it’s 9-0 to Liverpool. United are so far off it – the opposite of what you want in a top team. There is no leadership, no characters, no fight, no determination. It’s a long way back for this club. Whatever we had when I played – that bit of pride – has gone. “I’ve never known so many players wanting to leave Manchester United… the greatest club in the world. You could see after the Everton defeat they have already left the building. They’re gone. “Lingard coming on to try and save Man Uniter. Lingard should have left two years ago – he’s not good enough. Rashford up front, he played like a child. “Defensively? We were trying to help out Maguire before the match, give him a bit of PR. But the last goal? Maguire’s passing and defending, not acceptable and not good enough for Man United.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

31,https://talksport.com/football/1088455/paul-pogba-man-utd-boo-simon-jordan-old-trafford/,"Paul Pogba ‘earned what he’s got’ from booing Man United fans as Frenchman’s Old Trafford career is labelled ‘appalling’, says Simon Jordan","Simon Jordan has defended the Manchester United fans who booed Paul Pogba at the Red Devils’ win over Norwich at the weekend. Pogba had a tricky afternoon against the Premier League’s bottom side and was taken off by manager Ralf Rangnick with 16 minutes to play with the scores locked at 2-2.  Cristiano Ronaldo eventually captured the three points by completing a hat-trick late on, but there were some awkward scenes involving his French teammate. Pogba had a fine first-half as United climbed to a 2-0 lead, but with no support in midfield, he quickly gained the crowd’s ire as Norwich levelled the score. His withdrawal was met with boos, to which he replied with a sarcastic smile, and then stepped things up at full time. Heading for the tunnel as fans applauded the Red Devils, who ran out 3-2 winners, Pogba cupped his ear to the crowd and was showered with abuse. Rangnick expressed his discontent post-match saying: “I don’t think it makes sense to target individual players. In response to Rangnick’s words, Jordan said: “People say ‘you shouldn’t boo him when he comes off’ he reaps what he sews, he’s earned what he’s got.  “He’s got that relationship and reaction from the fans because of his performances over four or five years. “[Jose] Mourinho wouldn’t put up with it either, he wouldn’t put up with Pogba, and he got done in the court of public opinion, he got done for taking this player to task and having a problem with him. “There’s certain people you just can’t turn round and maybe Man United’s whole buying policy is the problem.”  Pogba re-signed for United in 2016 as the world’s most expensive footballer, departing Juventus for a fee of £89.3million. A smattering of trophies has followed and  the 29-year-old hasn’t quite lived up to the world class reputation he crafted at Juve, or with France. And Jordan believes both Juventus and France possessed a system that makes up for Pogba’s flaws, while United don’t. Jordan said: “Maybe they never should have bought Pogba if they weren’t at the stage where they could afford the luxury of letting Pogba do what he wants when wants, and manage him a certain way because the rest of the team is good enough.  “He plays in a certain way for a very good French side, he was part of a very good and cohesive unit that made up for some of the things he didn’t do and Juventus was the same. “But the fact of the matter is he’s been appalling for Manchester United the five seasons he’s been there.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The French midfielder limped out of the embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on ten minutes after Luis Diaz opened the scoring for the hosts. Question marks remain over the 29-year-old’s future with the Red Devils, given his contract expires this summer. Fans recently turned on Pogba during the 3-2 victory over Norwich, booing him off the pitch, and the £90million man responded by cupping his ears at full-time. Pogba has failed to fully endear himself to supporters since his Old Trafford return in 2016 – and many expect him to leave on a free transfer when his current deal expires. Neville said on Sky Sports commentary: “That could be Paul Pogba’s last minutes in a Manchester United shirt, if that injury lasts for a few weeks.”  But the ex-defender’s fury was directed at the entire club during a dreadful performance which saw United concede nine goals to their arch rivals over two Premier League games. “Right, let’s be clear, this Man United team is an absolute waste of space,” he said. “These players want the season over so they can hide behind the new manager and blame the old. An excuses culture permeating the whole club.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

The 36-year-old set-up substitute Rodrygo who netted late in the quarter-final to send the tie with Chelsea to extra-time at the Santiago Bernabeu.  Real Madrid eventually booked their place in the semi-finals securing a 5-4 aggregate victory, despite losing 3-2 on the night in the Spanish capital. Karim Benzema’s header on 96 minutes was enough to send Los Blancos through to face either Atletico Madrid or Manchester City. With Madrid 4-3 down on aggregate, Modric curled the ball with the outside of his right boot picking out Brazilian winger Rodrygo. The 21-year-old, with his first touch of the game, calmly slotted past Chelsea shot-stopper Edouard Mendy, and suddenly the aggregate score was 4-4, with the match going to extra-time. Modric showed the footballing world just why he has a Ballon d’Or in his trophy cabinet. Fans and pundits alike were left speechless by Modric’s sublime piece of skill. This still stands…. 😱 https://t.co/0wQxBQskmg “We may have just seen the pass of the decade,” talkSPORT Breakfast host Ally McCoist. “Modric is magical. What a pass.” Former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor agreed. “Most people who try that, the ball would just go in a straight line. I would probably break my ankle if I tried that!” And it looks like Leicester City midfielder James Maddison was keen to point out he has been calling Modric’s brilliance for years. In 2016, he posted on Twitter: “Modric is the king of passing with the outside of the foot.” Quote tweeting that, he simply wrote on Tuesday night: “This still stands.” Modric may be 36, but is showing no signs of slowing down.  Croatia teammate and Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic believes the Real star could play until he is 40. “In the last five, six, or seven years he has been at the same level, which is amazing”, he said before the second leg. “The reason he is so good is because he loves football so much, he lives it every day. “He is a professional and if he keeps going like this, I can see him still playing for three or four more years at such a high level. “He is an amazing player. I admired him when I was a child — he played for my favourite club Dinamo Zagreb. “Now we have become good friends, I admire him even more. “A great person, great player — I am looking forward to playing against him again.” That ball from Modric! 😱Unbelievable!Chelsea held their lead for a matter of minutes… It's now 4-4 on aggregate! #UCL pic.twitter.com/vOi8K6Vf9z Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Norwegian striker has long been linked to the Premier League club and head to the team his father, Alf-Inge, played for in the early 2000s. The 21-year-old has become one of the most coveted talents in world football as he developed into a deadly striker at Borussia Dortmund. He has a remarkable record of 82 goals in 85 games since joining from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, opting for Germany over Manchester United. A £63million release clause in his contract means he is available for a cut price fee and all the top clubs in Europe have been sounded out. His dad, and the player’s agent Mino Raiola, have held talks with a number of teams as they weigh-up their next move. The list of candidates have been whittled down to City, Barcelona and Real Madrid. The Mail report that City have agreed terms with Haaland’s representatives to make him the highest paid player in the Premier League.  The five-year £500,000-a-week they are prepared to pay him would eclipse the money being paid to Cristiano Ronaldo. The report adds that the £63million release clause is set to be triggered imminently. Dortmund have denied that a deal is in place, but it seems inevitable that Haaland will be playing away from the Bundesliga club. City have been playing without a recognised centre forward for the majority of the season and former Rangers striker Ally McCoist thinks this is terrifying for the rest of the league.  He told talkSPORT Breakfast: “From City’s point of view, could that be the final piece of the jigsaw? To be fair, they’ve been doing better than alright without a recognised centre forward. “I think it is terrifying for the rest of the league. The scary thing is they are not even getting the finished article. “They’re getting a 21-year-old machine. He is going to develop. He’s got all of the qualities to develop into one of the best ever. “He’s powerful, quick and clever. Scores all sorts of goals. It’s an awesome signing for the league.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

The Premier League star was expecting twins with his partner, Georgina Rodriguez. Their baby girl survived and, in an emotional statement, the couple said her birth “gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness”. “It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away,” the statement began. “It is the greatest pain that any parent can feel. “Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. “We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. “Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you.”  In October, the Manchester United forward revealed he and Ms Rodriguez were expecting twins. And in December, she revealed the twins would be a boy and a girl. Ronaldo shares daughter Alana, four, with Rodriguez and also has a son Cristiano Jnr, 11, as well as twins Eva and Mateo, four, via surrogate mothers. Responding to Ronaldo’s announcement, Manchester United said: “Your pain is our pain, @Cristiano [heartbreak emoji]. “Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time.”  United have since confirmed the 37-year-old will not play a part in the club’s Premier League clash against Liverpool on Tuesday night. Teammates David de Gea and Marcus Rashford were among the many to send the couple their condolences, as have neighbours Manchester City. “Thoughts are with you and Georgina, brother,” Rashford wrote on Twitter. “I’m so sorry.” Ronaldo’s former club Real Madrid said in a statement: “Real Madrid, its president and board of directors are deeply saddened by the passing of one of the children that our dear Cristiano Ronaldo and his partner, Georgina Rodriguez, were expecting. “Real Madrid shares in the family’s pain and wishes to send them all of our warmth.” Liverpool, Leeds and the Premier League were among many others sending the couple messages of condolence on Twitter.

Ronaldo, 37, announced on Monday that his baby son had tragically died. Manchester United confirmed Ronaldo’s absence, saying onmanutd.com: “Family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time. “As such, we can confirm that he will not feature in the match against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday evening and we underline the family’s request for privacy. “Cristiano, we are all thinking of you and sending strength to the family.” The Premier League star was expecting twins with his partner, Georgina Rodriguez. Their baby girl survived and, in an emotional statement, the couple said her birth ‘gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness’. “It is with our deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our baby boy. It’s the greatest pain any parent can feel. Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness”, Ronaldo and Rodriguez wrote on social media.  “We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you. Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez.” Messages of support and condolence continue to flood in for the pair since the news broke, and Liverpool fans are also expected to offer their own gesture at the match. Reds fans inside Anfield will mark the seventh minute, which corresponds to Ronaldo’s shirt number, by applauding. “If you are lucky enough to be attending the game tomorrow evening, then please show a mark of respect to Cristiano Ronaldo and his family by taking part in the round of applause which will be held on the seventh minute”, a post read on a Liverpool fanFacebookpage.  “Rivalries should be set aside in heartbreaking circumstances such as these. You’ll Never Walk Alone, CR7 Jr.” One Liverpool supporter on Twitter, added: “If you are attending like myself, please applaud on the seventh minute to show respect to Cristiano Ronaldo and his family through this heartbreaking time.” While it has been confirmed Ronaldo won’t feature, interim manager Ralf Rangnick revealed he won’t be able to select several stars for the clash. Raphael Varane, Scott McTominay and Fred are unavailable for the trip to Merseyside, while Luke Shaw and Edinson Cavani are likely to miss the remainder of the season through injury.  Liverpool go into the match on the back of their emphatic 3-2 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday.

38,https://talksport.com/football/1087426/cristiano-ronaldo-stats-hat-trick-man-united-norwich-premier-league/,Cristiano Ronaldo nets 50th career hat-trick as Manchester United capitalise on Tottenham’s loss by beating Norwich to boost hope of qualifying for Champions League,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a second successive hat-trick at Old Trafford, and the 50th in his club career as Manchester United beat Norwich 3-2. The Portuguese forward got his third via a stunning free-kick late on in the game as the Premier League club capitalised on Tottenham’s loss against Brighton. Although its been a difficult season for the Old Trafford side, there is still some light at the end of tunnel for them. Following Spurs’ 1-0 defeat to Brighton, the Red Devils knew a victory would put them to within three points, with six games remaining. And despite the protests that happened in the game, and outside of the ground, where Man United fans were portraying their anger at the Glazer family, the players remained professional on the pitch, and got the job done. It was the perfect start for Ralf Rangnick’s side, albeit with a bit of luck. Playing out of the back, Norwich defender Ben Gibson was dispossessed by Anthony Elanga who had the simple task of passing the ball across the box for Ronaldo to virtually tap in. Even though the Red Devils were good value for their lead, they were not comfortable in the match, and on the counter-attack, the Canaries should have done more to test the hosts’ goal. But they were unable to do so, and midway through the second half, Ronaldo doubled his goal tally.   From an in swinging corner by Alex Telles, Ronaldo got away from Gibson and in typical fashion buried the header into the bottom left past Tim Krul. Whilst the hosts merited the two goal lead, they were never comfortable as Norwich showed great character to get themselves back in the contest. Finding his way into the left hand side of the penalty box, Pukki had time and space to weigh up his options, and delivered a perfect cross to the far post where Kieran Dowell had the simple task of heading past David De Gea. Prior to the game, the Everton academy product spoke to talkSPORT and said there could be an ‘upset’ on the cards when his side face Manchester United in their next game.   And whilst his side couldn’t live up to his words, he certainly did by getting his side back into the game, and then providing an excellent assist for the Finnish forward. The 24-year-old hadn’t scored or assisted in the league this season until today, but picked one of the best grounds to find his goal scoring touch. Things could have gone even better for the bottom side in the Premier League as De Gea was forced to make a few good saves. But they were unable to take the chances, and with Ronaldo on the pitch, the hosts always had a chance of winning the game.  Winning a free-kick after Elanga had been fouled, the 37-year-old stepped up and smashed his effort in. It cannoned off the left-post, and even though Krul got a hand on to it, he was unable to keep the ball out. It was a massive goal for the Red Devils, and one that could prove to be crucial if Rangnick’s side are to qualify for the Champions League next season.

39,https://talksport.com/football/1085038/chelsea-champions-league-comeback-karim-benzema-real-madrid/,Karim Benzema breaks Chelsea hearts as Thomas Tuchel’s side nearly pull off heroic comeback against Real Madrid in Champions League classic,"Chelsea beat Real Madrid in the Champions League 3-2 but their comeback fell agonisingly short as Karim Benzema haunted the Blues again. Thomas Tuchel’s side got the three goals needed to win the game at the Santiago Bernabeu, but Rodrygo and the Frenchman spared the hosts’ blushes as they won the tie 5-4 on aggregate. Even though it was a tall order, goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner gave the Blues the three goals needed, but sadly, their efforts were in vain. The first leg saw Los Blancos flex their muscle as a stunning hat-trick from Karim Benzema gave them a two-goal advantage. But Thomas Tuchel’s side never stopped believing and made the perfect start at the Bernabeu. Chelsea won the ball high after some good pressing from  Werner. He won the ball and fed Mount, who from 15 yards out, centre of the goal, curled it beautifully into the right corner past Thibaut Courtois. Speaking on talkSPORT, former Blues player Scott Minto spoke about the quality of the strike and Mount’s impact in the team. “Really good play from Chelsea there. That is an absolutely wonderful finish. That’s why, even when he’s not playing well, Mason Mount needs to be in this team.”  The goal from the academy product also meant he is just the third Englishman to score at the Bernabeu, following in the footsteps of Leeds star Alan Smith in 2001, and then Danny Welbeck for Manchester United in 2013. In the second-half, the Blues knew their task, one goal would sent the tie to extra-time, another would win the whole contest. And just six minutes into the second period, Rudiger, who was partly at fault for the third goal in the first leg, made amends. Rising from a Mount corner, the German towered above all the Real players and produced a superb header into the bottom right.  Commenting on the goal, Minto was in awe of the quality of the strike, but also issued a warning about not becoming complacent. “Well I tell you what, they need to be very careful from here on in, don’t get carried away, if there is going to be another goal, you expect it to come from Chelsea, but they have to keep their shape, so important not to give a goal away now”. “That is one of the best headers you are ever going to see because he is leaning forward and heading it back from where it came from, that is truly wonderful”. Minto’s words about another goal coming in the way of Chelsea would also come to fruition. CHELSEA ARE LEVEL! 🙌Another great header in a tie full of great headers! 💥Antonio Rüdiger powers the ball home from a corner to make it 3-3 on aggregate…#UCL pic.twitter.com/ACRwp5xAIt On his return to the Bernabeu, Marcos Alonso scored the goal that he and the rest of the team would seal their place in the semi-final of the competition. Mount, involved again, did well to win the ball back from Ferland Mendy in the middle of the park, N’golo Kane received the ball, drove up the pitch before releasing Alonso. The Spaniard’s first time-cross was blocked by Dani Carvajal, but the ball fell back to him and he unleashed a fierce right footed effort into the top right corner. However, there would be further drama, as VAR ruled out the goal after the ball inadvertently struck his hand.   That goal though would not diminish Chelsea’s character, and they got the third goal required to win the tie outright. Werner, often maligned since signing from RB Leipzig in 2020 for £48million, produced the strike to put Tuchel’s side in front. After being played through by Mateo Kovacic, he showed incredible composure to get around Nacho Fernandez, and feinted once more before curling an effort that took a slight touch by Courtois as it nestled into the bottom right. Three goals up, the job was done, and all Chelsea had to do was keep a clean sheet.  But they were unable to do so, and ten minutes from time, Luka Modric showcased why he is one of Europe’s best midfielders by delivering a sensational outside-of-the-boot cross to Rodrygo, who scored with his first touch after being substituted on. That goal sent the tie to extra-time, and six minutes into the opening period, Benzema haunted Rudiger and the Blues again. It was almost a replica of the first goal at Stamford Bridge last week, as Vinicius Jr sent the ball in and the Frenchman headed past Edouard Mendy. But in the process, the German centre-back lost his footing and was therefore unable to get closer to Benzema by the time he recovered.  The now former champions tried to get back into the game, and even had chances late on in the second period of extra-time, but could not find the net again to force a penalty shoot-out. It’s a bitter pill for Chelsea to swallow, but they have to brush this loss off quickly as they are in action against Crystal Palace on Saturday in the semi-final of the FA Cup.

40,https://talksport.com/football/1025110/man-utd-erling-haaland-transfer-real-madrid/,Manchester United ‘end interest in Erling Haaland’ with Real Madrid now firm favourites to sign in-demand Borussia Dortmund striker in stunning double transfer,"Manchester United’s long pursuit of Erling Haaland has come to an end, with the club deciding to pursuit other attacking targets instead, according to reports. The Red Devils were for a long time considered one of the clubs that had the best chance of signing the Borussia Dortmund striker when fellow Norwegian – and his former Molde manager – Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge. However, it’s now claimed Old Trafford chiefs have other priorities in the transfer market and have moved on from competing for the in-demand goalmachine’s signature. The 21-year-old superstar is widely expected to depart the German club in the upcoming summer transfer window, when a €75million release clause in his contract becomes active. According to ESPN, the Borussia Dortmund star favours a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid, and that had led to Manchester United pulling out of the running. However, the Red Devils will continue to chase other attacking targets in the transfer market to find a proven goalscorer.  Edinson Cavani’s contract expires this summer and he could leave the club as a free agent, while Cristiano Ronaldo turns 37 next month and has been linked with an exit just one year into his two-year contract. The report claims United’s sacking of Solskjaer didn’t dampen their prospects of signing Haaland, despite his connection with the former manager – who handed the Norwegian star his senior debut at old club Molde. Haaland’s representatives have admired United interim coach Ralf Rangnick’s work at previous clubs but, with the club enduring another transition phrase, it is suggested joining United is not considered the best fit for one of the world’s most coveted young players.  Real Madrid have now emerged as favourites to secure his signature, along with Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe, in what could be a stunning double summer transfer. Manchester City are thought to still be in the running, though. United’s noisy neighbours have been strongly linked with the Norwegian star, who could follow in the footsteps of his father, Alfe-Inge Haaland,who played for the Citizens from 2000 to 2003 and now is helping to guide his son in his career.

Pep Guardiola’s side are the favourites to land the prolific Norway international ahead of the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Recent reports suggested the Sky Blues had won the race for his signature, but these claims have since been rebuffed by the Dortmund chief. Haaland is understood to be keen on a move to the Premier League and to learn from Guardiola. In response to the reports, Kehl pointed to Haaland’s €80million (around £67m) release clause, tellingSky Deutschland: “There is a release clause, you know, and there is a deadline. “We want to make a decision as soon as possible. Erling always wants to play and you always try to make a good decision together with him.” Kehl was also recently asked whether any club had already expressed an interest in paying the players release clause. The Dortmund chief bluntly replied: “No.” In March it was revealed the striker had discussed personal terms with City with the Premier League champions were prepared pay him an eye watering £500,000 a week.  Haaland’s agent, Mino Raiola, could also earn a huge bonus along with the player’s father, former City midfielder Alf-Inge. Should Haaland move to the Etihad, the deal could come close to the £100m mark, but would provide City with a centre-forward option, having previously missed out on Harry Kane. So far this season, Haaland has netted 25 goals and contributed nine assists from 26 appearances in a Dortmund shirt. He also has 15 goals in 17 appearances for his country. Haaland was most recently on target twice in Dortmund’s 6-1 Bundesliga victory over Wolfsburg last weekend. Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The 11-year-old has taken to English academy football like a duck to water since he joined United‘s academy in February, and found the net once again for the Red Devils’ Under-12s in a youth tournament in Spain on Wednesday. United’s youth sides are currently out in the Costa Brava playing in The Mediterranean Internet Cup – a tournament centred around showcasing Europe’s best young talent every year. And CR7’s eldest son has certainly got that in abundance. Having already been spotted scoring on Tuesday, he was again amongst the goals a day later. Taking the ball just inside the penalty area, Ronaldo’s son larruped the ball home with his right foot. With the ball in the back of the net, he joyfully ran to the corner flag and copied his dad’s trademark celebration. Speaking about his son’s potential back in 2020, Ronaldo Sr said: “We’ll see if my son will become a great footballer. He has potential. He is fast and dribbles well, but that is not enough.     “I always tell him that it takes work and dedication to have success. I won’t pressure him to become a footballer, but if you ask me if I want him to, yes I would like it.” Ronaldo Jr has been playing alongside his father’s former United teammate Wayne Rooney‘s son, Kai Rooney. The pair have both been seen scoring goals for the Red Devils, with Kai Rooney netting four times against Liverpool earlier this season, triggering a real sense of nostalgia within the Old Trafford faithful.

Last week, the Seagulls were also deserved winners, and at the time, produced their first win in seven games to beat Arsenal 2-1. Antonio Conte’s side never got going and were poor throughout, and have now given their fierce rivals the chance to close the gap in the race for Champions League football. Having scored 12 goals in their last three games, winning every one, the hosts were going into this game in hot form. But they were slow and lethargic throughout, and could have no complaints about the result. Leandro Trossard, as he did at the Emirates, found the net again. Receiving the ball on the left channel, he beat Eric Dier with some excellent footwork before showing excellent composure to slot the ball into the bottom right with the outside of his foot, past Hugo Lloris. Speaking on talkSPORT, former Premier League striker Dean Ashton was in awe of the goal, and said it was the least the Seagulls deserved.  Leandro Trossard bags for Brighton in the 90th minute! 😱A lovely cut inside and finish!That's a big blow to Tottenham's hopes of #UCL football… 😬 pic.twitter.com/xkggEnBUjF “How big could that goal be in the top four race?” He said. “Leandro Trossard absolutely sits Eric Dier on his back side, brilliant, outside of the boot, and its only what they deserved because they’ve been absolutely brilliant.” Brighton thoroughly deserved the victory and will go to Manchester City on Wednesday looking for another big scalp. Spurs though will be feeling a bit more alarmed than they were before the start of play, as the Gunners can go level on points with them if they beat Southampton.  Crucially as well, Mikel Arteta’s side will have a game in hand. It’s also nothing Conte hasn’t seen before from his Spurs side who have produced frustrating performances and results on the back of impressive wins. But it could have been a different story had Heung-Min Son and Steven  Bergwijn done better. The former had a clear shot on goal when the game was goalless but had his effort blocked by Trossard.  Whilst the Dutchman could have rescued his side a point right at the death but sent his effort wide of the post. Whilst it’s a disappointing result for Spurs, Champions League football is still very much possible, and they will hope to rectify this result with victory against Brentford next Saturday.

Many had gathered in the morning to march towards on Old Trafford where they planned to protests against the club’s owners, the Glazer family.    The idea was to leave seats empty for 17 minutes, representing the 17 years of the Glazer’s ownership. Banners and leaflets were handed out with the message ‘Red white and black till we get our club back,’ with chants ringing out against the club’s ownership. The 1958, the group that have organised the protest, tweeted that they were proud of the turnout so far ahead of the game. Earlier in the week, they released a statement calling the club ‘a mess’ as they urged fans to join what they hoped would be a peaceful and family friendly day. “Nothing will change until the head of the snake is removed,” the statement read. “It’s rotten and starts from the top down like any business. The club’s a mess so we need to act and raise awareness again. A new manager won't suppress us. Red White & Black till we get our club back.

They continued: “This is the start of constant, relentless, peaceful and legal protests and actions against our owners. “We know the challenges ahead of us and we will not waiver or detract from these goals. Bring your colours, flags, banners and flares. “We need you, we need each other, we need everyone to put aside their differences. Some things are worth fighting for.” And many sang anti-Glazer songs as they remained outside once the game kicked off.   Those inside were heard singing ‘Stand up if you hate the Glazers’ which most did. When the protest officially ended on the 17th minute and some headed inside others stayed to sing: “Love United, stay outside”. Those who did, though, missed the team race to a 2-0 lead with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring twice. Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Canaries can see a crack of light in their pursuit of Premier League survival following a 2-0 win over Burnley that leaves them seven points from salvation.  Still bottom of the table, goals from Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki cut the deficit for Dean Smith’s side, giving Norwich something to play for in their final seven games of the season. And Dowell was confident that there’s plenty more to come from his side, particularly when looking at the fixtures of other relegation battlers. When asked by talkSPORT if Norwich can stay in the league, the Everton academy graduate said: “Definitely yeah, I think that was a statement from us today, to show that we’re not going anywhere either. “Seven points away from Everton and now they’ve got some tough fixtures coming up and we’ve got some we think we can win so you never know.” Norwich’s next opportunity to put points on the table will come on April 10 when they take on footballing giants Manchester United at Old Trafford. Few will give the Canaries a chance of taking something from the match, except for Dowell.  Asked if Norwich can take something from the United game, Dowel said: “Yeah, I reckon we’ve got an upset there.” Goalscorer Pukki was similarly positive about Norwich’s chances of staying up telling talkSPORT his side have it in them. “If we believe we have what it takes,” Pukki said. “We know against some other teams we need to play even better than we did today if we want to get points. “We all want to stay in this league so we need to do what it takes to do it, but we know it’s going to be hard, we are behind others so it’s a tough job but we need to go every game and try to win.” ",positive,liverpool,0,65,69

The France striker’s current deal expires at the end of the campaign and he looks set to depart the north London club after confirming talks with other clubs, with a return to Lyon on the cards. Lacazette recently revealed said he was ‘in discussions with a lot of clubs’ and said he ‘misses playing in the Champions League’, in a recent interview with French outlet Canal Plus . When asked if he was surprised by his captain’s comments, Arteta said: “Well he doesn’t need to tell me what he does in his own life but he has, we have discussed that and he is entitled to do that – then he has a duty to do his best here. “His contract situation allows him to make the decision about his future. We have expressed clearly what our intention is – to speak in the summer once we know where we are, about what we are going to do in the future together. “And for the rest, I just want him fully focused on his duty, which is now defend Arsenal in the best possible way, like he has done all the time he has been with us. That’s why he has been wearing the armband of this football club, that’s a big reason. “The contracts start and end with the expiry date that you have agreed on that day that you put the pen down. “Then you have to deal with the consequences with that and that’s the reality of the contract that he has, and the commitment and the duty that he has with the football club.”  Arsenal face a tough test against Chelsea on Wednesday, with their top four hopes hanging in the balance. Lacazette will not feature in the match after testing positive for COVID-19. The Gunners boss, however, remains optimistic his star striker will remain at the club beyond the summer and snub other clubs’ advances. “It is the agreement that we made with him, that was our position and our position remains the same, that is what we are going to do,” Arteta said. “The risk of that happening, it was always there since the moment we made that decision, then it is up to him. It is not up to us or him it is up to both parties.” Arteta also said Arsenal’s summer transfer business will depend on whether they qualify for next seasons Champions League.  “Champions League brings, first of all, the club much closer to where we want and to play in a competition that has a huge history in relation to our club,” he added. “Secondly, obviously it improves every situation with the sponsor, financially, expectations, the capacity to grow our players and expose them into a different dimension of a competition and this is where we want to be. “It is a game-changer.

Unai Emery’s side were the talk of the football world this week after stunning Bayern Munich in the last-eight to set up a major showdown with Jurgen Klopp’s side in the final four. Victory, of course, would see them playing in the biggest match in European football. The Spanish side are undoubtedly underdogs for the two-legged semi-final with six-time winners Liverpool, but will be hoping that their home supporters can make a difference during the decisive second leg at El Madrigal on May 3. Villarreal will be looking to their loyal fanbase to create a cauldron of noise at home, and in order to do that they’ve generously put a large number of tickets up for sale for a bargain price. Ticket rates for the huge European clash start at just €25, which equates to around £20.70. While the average cost of watching football in Spain is generally cheaper than what it is in England, those thinking that fans on these shores will have their pockets emptied for the tie couldn’t be more wrong. Liverpool have also put their tickets on sale for the first leg of the tie at Anfield, with a significant discount on a batch of tickets.   The Reds have made 500 tickets available for just £9 to local supporters who are wanting to attend the huge Champions League tie. Those tickets will be based on the top tier of the main stand, so supporters can also look forward to a stellar view of the action as Klopp’s side look to earn a spot at this year’s showpiece event at the Stade de France in Paris. The Champions League final was originally planned to take place at the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg but UEFA moved the match following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The winner of the two-legged affair between Liverpool and Villarreal will face either Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain in the final showdown.

Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal are reportedly amongst the clubs keeping tabs on Nunez ahead of a potential summer bidding war for his signature. Liverpool advanced to the Champions League semi-finals with a 6-4 aggregate win over the Portuguese outfit on Wednesday, with Nunez again impressing despite his side crashing out. His stunning performances this term have attracted a host of suitors ahead of the summer transfer window, with Tottenham and Newcastle United also reportedly interested in bringing him to the Premier League. Should Nunez get his big move abroad this summer then Benfica will certainly command a whopping transfer fee for their prized asset who is contracted to the Lisbon giants until June 2025. Benfica manager Nelson Verissimo claimed Nunez should be valued at a similar fee to Joao Felix who departed for Atletico Madrid for £113m in 2019, but there is a feeling that the figure will be more around the £65m Benfica valued him at when he was linked with a move away in January. With Liverpool said to be one of the clubs tracking the 22-year-old, Jurgen Klopp was full of praise for the Uruguayan who has been attracting the attention of Europe’s top clubs. “Extremely good-looking boy and a decent player as well,“ said Klopp of the 22-year-old striker, who plundered two goals across the tie.  “Really good, really good, I have to say. I knew him before, of course but he played pretty much in front of me with these tough battles with Ibou Konate. “Physically strong, quick, was calm with his finish when he finished the goal off. Good, really good. If he stays healthy, it’s a big career ahead of him.” Scorer of Benfica’s third goal in Wednesday’s 3-3 draw at Anfield, Nunez remained tight-lipped after the match in response to Klopp’s comments and reiterated his desire to focus on finishing the season strong for the Lisbon-based club. Darwin Núñez scores another goal in the Champions League! 🔥The young star continues to shine against Europe's elite clubs…What a star 💫 #UCL pic.twitter.com/hzEZAwjoI8 “What the Liverpool coach said, I take it as a compliment, but my mind is on Benfica,” Nunez told Portuguese broadcaster TVI. “I won’t say anything, and I’ll leave everything for this shirt. My job is to continue like this, to take advantage of this luck that is happening to me. “Last year I didn’t play at all, but this year I’m having an incredible season. I have to continue like this, and there is also a lot of merit from my colleagues.” Nunez has found the net 24 times in 20 starts in the Portuguese top flight and six goals in six Champions League appearances including two against both Liverpool and Barcelona and one against Bayern Munich.  But it was one that didn’t go in that left Nunez stunned when Liverpool ‘keeper Alisson superbly saved the Uruguayan’s volley just as it was about to hit the back of the net. “That Alisson save? That was incredible. I swear to you, I saw the ball going in, and then it wasn’t,” Nunez admitted. Alisson had spoken highly of Nunez in Tuesday’s pre-match press conference referring to Nunez as a ‘strong striker’. Sky Bet: Bet £10 Get £30 in Football Free Bets – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The Blues had the perfect start against Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Karim Benzema hit a hat-trick in the first leg at Stamford Bridge to take a 3-1 lead to Spain. England star Mount reduced the deficit with a goal in the 14th minute. The ball fortuitously found him through on goal, but there was nothing lucky about the finish. His shot was too good for Thiabut Courtois and put Chelsea 1-0 up. talkSPORT’s co-commentator Scott Minto said: “Really good play from Chelsea there. That is an absolutely wonderful finish.

The Blues centre-back was guilty of a poor ‘half-challenge’ on French star Benzema, which allowed him to score his hat-trick goal in the 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge. In the quarter-final of the Champions League, trophy holders Chelsea locked horns with the Spanish giants looking to make the most of having the first-leg at home. But the game did not go to plan, as Benzema once again showcased his importance to the 13-time winners despite his age. The 34-year-old, who Real boss Carlo Ancelotti is ‘ageing like a fine wine’, netted a hat-trick which included two outstanding headers in the space of three first-half minutes. There was an element of fortunate for his goal that secured the match ball, as Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and Rudiger had a calamitous moment. After the ball fell to him following a clearance from a Real player, 30-year-old goalkeeper Mendy had time and options to clear the ball. But his pass to the German defender was far too light, and it gave Benzema the chance to steal the ball.  Whilst it was a poor pass from the AFCON winning shot-stopper, Rudiger  had the chance of bailing his goalkeeper out. But his tackle was not strong enough to dispossess Benzema, who then had the simple task of placing the ball into an empty net. Speaking on Thursday’s talkSPORT Breakfast, Gabby Agbonlahor gave his thoughts and believed Rudiger was thinking about a potential transfer this summer and pulled out of a tough tackle to avoid any kind of injury. “I know it was a bad pass on Mendy, but Rudiger’s tackle was someone who didn’t want to get injured,” said the former Aston Villa captain. “It was like he’s got a move ready and he didn’t want to hurt himself.”  Former Chelsea defender Mario Melchiot didn’t completely agree with that statement, but did agree that Rudiger could have done more to stop the rampant Frenchman. “I can’t really say that, because he’s normally so tough, he does not care about that,” Melchiot told talkSPORT. “But the way he went in it, I agree with you, he could have gone tougher. “And he went with his left foot instead of his right and normally if you make the tackle with your right, and you go all the way [you would win the ball].  “Everything was half, half ball, half challenge, and that’s why Benzema [scored].” Rudiger is out of contract at Chelsea this summer and has been widely linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge at the end of the season. The Germany international is reportedly wanted by a host of suitors, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain the main contenders, although it has been claimed Manchester United could look to keep him in the Premier League by offering Rudiger a move to Old Trafford.

The Portugal sensation responded angrily to being substituted at Brentford on Wednesday night, with the Red Devils 2-0 up on 72 minutes. Ralf Rangnick’s men went on to win 3-1 and the United boss downplayed the incident after the match, but reports suggest all is not well with Ronaldo at Old Trafford. The 36-year-old returned to his old club on a two-year deal last summer and, despite a promising start, United are now clinging onto hopes of a top-four finish. According to The Sun, Ronaldo’s camp have held conversations with incoming chief executive Richard Arnold about cutting the forward’s second United spell short. It is understood Ronaldo wants to play until he is 40, but considers Champions League football an absolute minimum.  The five-time Ballon d’Or winner expected United to challenge for football’s top honours upon his return and a recent interview suggested he is disappointed with the current mentality at Old Trafford. “Manchester Unitedshould win the league or finish in second or third. I don’t see any other positions for Manchester United,” Ronaldo toldSky Sports. “In my head I don’t accept that our mentality be that we finish below the top three in the Premier League. “We are capable of changing things now… I know the way but I’m not going to mention here because I don’t think it’s etiquette on my part to say but what I can say is that we can do it better, all of us.  “We have to change that.

We have a long way to improve but I believe if we change our mind we can achieve big things.” Rangnick’s men are currently seventh in the top-flight and need to make up ground on Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham if they want to finish fourth.
