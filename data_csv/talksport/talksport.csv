Despite a bright start, the Belgium international has endured an underwhelming return to Stamford Bridge since he returned in a £98million deal last summer. Expectations had been high after Lukaku scored 30 goals in all competitions for Inter Milan in 2020/21. With 24 of them coming in Serie A he was the Nerazzurri’s top scorer in their title-winning season. After bagging three league goals in three games at the beginning of his Chelsea return, the 28-year-old has netted just twice more in the Premier League since with Kai Havertz slotting in at centre-forward instead. The former Everton man has been linked to Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain amid speculation that Kylian Mbappe could be on the move in the upcoming transfer window. However, talkSPORT have been told Lukaku would be the ‘perfect replacement’ for Harry Kane at Tottenham. Spurs are currently thriving under new boss Antonio Conte as they battle it out for the final Champions League spot, and rumours of Kane departing have all but settled.  However, should Kane be tempted to leave at the end of the season, Lukaku has been cited as the man that could fill the England captain’s boots. While Lukaku’s future was being spoken about, talkSPORT host Natalie Sawyer queried whether he should join his former boss Conte at Spurs. And former Tottenham striker Darren Bent agreed that should Kane head for the exit, Lukaku should be the man signed to replace him. “As long as Antonio Conte’s there, I don’t think Harry Kane would go anywhere,” Bent began. “But if worse came to worse and Harry Kane did leave, and go elsewhere, if they can get Lukaku, you’ve seen what Conte can get out of Romelu Lukaku. “Even down to his nutrition, because that was the best I’ve ever seen him look, last season and at the start of this season. “If there was an opportunity and Kane leaves and Conte can get Lukaku, I’d go out all day to get it, all day.  “I think as someone who has plenty of Premier League experience, there’d be no one better to replace Harry Kane. “I know they’re completely different in terms of players, Harry Kane dropping in and [is] technically a better footballer, but Lukaku would be an adequate replacement, certainly with what he did with Conte already. “So, I would.” Bet365: Bet £10 Get £50 in Free Bets – CLAIM HERE Open account offer.
