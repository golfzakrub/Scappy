One of Britain’s richest men launched a last-minute move for the club on Friday, throwing fresh uncertainty over a process that is finally nearing completion. US merchant bank Raine Group were in the process of confirming to the three shortlisted contenders who would be submitted to the Treasury as the successful candidate when Ratcliffe’s £4.25billion offer was revealed. While Boehly is now in a five-day period of exclusive negotiations, Ratcliffe’s bid remains on the table and is still seen by sources close to the process as a viable option. As a result Raine are still to publicly confirm Boehly as their choice to buy out Roman Abramovich. It is believed that an increased offer from Ratcliffe - owner of INEOS - could be enough to blow the process wide open. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made a last-ditch attempt to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich (Martin Rickett/PA) It is thought he bypassed Raine in making his offer, thus avoiding the complex bidding process set up by the bank. Steve Pagliuca and Sir Martin Broughton were informed on Friday afternoon that their bids had been unsuccessful. Boehly had been the outstanding favourite from the moment the Ricketts family pulled out on the eve of final offers being made. His plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge were among the strongest points of his bid, while he also had the advantage of already carrying out due diligence when previously trying to buy the club. Ratcliffe was also a former suitor and his dramatic insertion into the process could yet have an impact. He has not been told his bid is too late. While Boehly has the chance push through his buyout, the threat of Ratcliffe will leave him aware that there can be no hitches for fear of seeing his rival steal in. In a statement, INEOS said: “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. “That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.” ",positive

The Chelsea striker also has no interest in Newcastle, one of the few teams seen as being able to afford his salary and transfer fee. The Belgium international’s position at Stamford Bridge is under intense scrutiny after being consigned to the fringes by Thomas Tuchel in recent months. He has made only one Premier League start since late February and was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday. Lukaku has endured a miserable return to Chelsea after his club-record £97.5million move from Inter Milan last summer. He has struggled to adapt to Tuchel’s system, while injuries have also disrupted his campaign. Meanwhile, his relationship with his manager was strained by his decision to conduct an interview with Italian TV, in which he was critical of Tuchel’s system. While Chelsea’s head coach insisted the situation was resolved, Lukaku has largely been reduced to the role of substitute during the second half of the season. The player is growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of opportunities, with Tuchel’s decision not to use him at Goodison Park - despite being in desperate search of a goal - surprising sources close to Lukaku. It has been noted that he remains Chelsea’s joint second-highest goalscorer this season, despite his lack of starts and injury problems. Tuchel has publicly stated that it is down to Lukaku to prove he can lead his attack and live up to the expectations that accompanied his return to the club. But the German continues to select Kai Havertz ahead of him as a makeshift striker. That raises serious questions about Lukaku’s future, with major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him. Milan have emerged as a potential escape route but Lukaku would be reluctant to further upset Inter fans, who he made such an effort to appease with his ill-judged Sky Italia interview. Chelsea know there are few clubs who would be willing to offer them anything like the money they paid for Lukaku, which could block any chance of him moving on this summer. His wages, believed to be around £300,000-a-week, would rule out the vast majority of possible suitors. Romelu Lukaku has only made one Premier League start since February as his Chelsea struggles continue Newly-rich Newcastle were widely seen as one of the few clubs that would not be put off by the financial package required, even though it is unclear if they have any interest. But it is understood Lukaku would not entertain a move to St James’ Park. It remains to be seen what approach Chelsea’s new owners take with the former Manchester United player. While Roman Abramovich has largely been prepared to write off big-money signings, his successor may not. Todd Boehly, who is in exclusive talks to buy the club, has made it clear that he sees sports teams as investment opportunities. It is unlikely he would be comfortable with the most expensive player in the club’s history sitting on the bench. But the American is also believed to want Tuchel at the heart of his Chelsea revolution, which could mean more misery for Lukaku, whose preference is to stay and turn his fortunes around at the club he supported as a boy.

Eriksen, who joined Brentford on a six-month deal in January, has been a revelation back in the Premier League and has helped propel the Bees away from the relegation zone. After proving he can still perform at his previous levels after recovering from a cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark last June, the 30-year-old midfielder is a target for rivals clubs. Tottenham are considering a move to re-sign Eriksen in the summer, while Manchester United and Newcastle have also been linked with a move for him. But Brentford are keen to extend his deal and believe they are in a strong position to keep him. Speaking after Brentford lost 3-0 against United at Old Trafford last night, Frank said: “I am always positive. I always believe we have a very good chance. I know he is happy here, he is enjoying his football. It is a decision that will be taken at the end of the season.” Asked how Brentford are trying to convince Eriksen to stay, Frank said: “Very simple, I speak to him. We are presenting our plans and discussing it back and forth.” Last night’s defeat leaves Brentford 14th in the Premier League table, eight points clear of the relegation zone. ",positive

The Portugese superstar’s two-year contract at Old Trafford is not set to expire until June 2023, yet there has been fierce debate over recent months as to whether he should leave for a second time at the end of the season. While Ronaldo has proved United’s saviour on plenty of occasions with 24 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, many have questioned his place in what is expected to be a drastic rebuild of the ailing Red Devils under new permanent manager Erik ten Hag. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner appeared to strongly hint that he would be staying put after again enjoying a starring role against Brentford in the Premier League on Monday night. Ronaldo is now only four strikes behind Liverpool leader Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race after dispatching a second-half penalty in the morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Brentford. He had earlier seen an initial effort ruled out for offside before the interval. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a starring role again for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brentford After emphatically scoring his spot-kick, Ronaldo pointed to himself and then down to the Old Trafford turf, seemingly indicating that he may be staying after all. Then, while soaking up the adulation of the fans during a post-match lap of honour to mark the last home match of a difficult United campaign, he appeared to mouth to the Sky Sports cameras: “I’m not finished.” Interim boss Ralf Rangnick insisted once again after the win over Brentford that any decision on Ronaldo’s future should be deferred to Ten Hag, yet he backed the 37-year-old to remain part of the squad despite his repeated claims that United will need to sign at least two top-class strikers this summer. “The way we played again tonight, not only because he scored he also won the penalty and helped defensively, why should he not be part of the squad and help the team?” said Rangnick. “But this is a question you have to ask Erik and also Cristiano. “Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position but if you look at international football there are not many teams who play with two strikers. “For me, it is a question of what players Manchester United have in the future. It is obvious United need two more quality strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be strikers. Liverpool or Manchester City have five or six top-class strikers. If you ask me if Gabriel Jesus or Jack Grealish is a winger or a striker, they can all play there. “Mason Greenwood would have been one, then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. Anthony Martial was on loan and Edinson Cavani injured.” ",positive

Star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic bagged his 43rd goal of the season, breaking Guy Whittingham’s long-standing record after scoring a brace. Tom Cairney opened the scoring before Kenny Tete, Fabio Carvalho, Bobby De Cordorva-Reid and Jean Michael Seri joined Mitrovic on the scoresheet. The full-time whistle was followed by a pitch invasion at Craven Cottage as selfie-hunting fans mobbed the players before they were ushered off for the trophy presentation. The London club also became the first team in two decades to score more than a 100 goals in a single season in the second tier as six different players found the back of the net against Luton. SPONSORED Fulham were led by a brace from Serbian striker and top scorer Mitrovic, who has now scored 43 goals in 43 games this season -- a record for the division since the Premier League was founded in 1992. Fulham will finish their season with a trip to fifth-placed Sheffield United on Saturday. The result leaves Luton in sixth and final playoff spot, level with United on 72 points and two points above Middlesbrough. Addditional reporting from PA ",positive

A relatively routine 2-0 victory at Anfield has Jurgen Klopp’s side strong favourites to progress, even despite Unai Emery’s excellence in European competition. The quadruple is very much still on for Liverpool and, barring the kind of turnaround not often seen before in Champions League history, they will soon be in their third cup final of the campaign. That’s not to say it will be easy, however. Villarreal did not exactly impress last time out but beating Juventus and Bayern Munich deserves a huge amount of respect.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive

He has seen too much, both he and Liverpool involved in too many comebacks - usually as perpetrator - from more perilous positions than the one Villarreal find themselves in, to entertain that kind of talk. Still, Klopp’s team selection for Saturday’s trip to Newcastle suggested that beneath the obligatory lip service, cliched chatter of it being “only half-time”, he genuinely feels the job is not done, with Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara all rotated for what was a must-win game. It feels like an age since the quadruple-pursuers last played a match that wasn’t one of those, and while a draw or a one-goal defeat would of course be enough to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons, there is little danger of Klopp’s side hunkering down and looking to ride out a yellow storm at El Madrigal tonight. “We have to be ready to suffer and sit back in moments, but not as a general approach,” the 54-year-old said, highlighting the aggression that has seen them win five out of five away from home in the competition this season, racking up 15 goals across trips to Benfica, Porto, Atletico Madrid and both Milan giants. Liverpool won’t rest on their laurels in tonight’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Villarreal “We didn't win the games by sitting deep and counter-attacking,” he added. ""We tried to play as ourselves and we have to do that again.” Alexander-Arnold, too, warned against the old demon that is complacency but neither Klopp nor circumstances have allowed it to fester in this group. The German’s intensity does not permit half-heartedness even if his team now play with more control than in the thunderous early years of his reign, while the Reds’ new-found depth and blessed fortune with injuries mean individual shirts are on the line every week. One early goal could, of course, swing the tie, but the trouble for Unai Emery and Villarreal is that should Liverpool score it, even without the away goals rule, it would surely signal game over. The Spaniards must be foot-perfect, riding their luck as they did at times in the second leg of their quarter-final against Bayern Munich, staying in the game and showing the ruthless streak that saw off Juventus in a late flurry in the round before that. “We will try to find some weak spots,” Emery said yesterday, before acknowledging that is “something that no one has done this season."" If there is hope for Villarreal, it may lie in the second-leg sloppiness that has left the aggregate scoreline shy of reflecting Liverpool’s dominance of each of their knockout ties to date, though in neither the 6-4 against Benfica nor 2-1 against Inter did the Reds ever look in real danger of an exit. Emery will be boosted by the return of Spain striker Gerard Moreno, but it may be a case of one-in, one-out, with concern over the fitness of top scorer Arnaut Danjuma after the former Bournemouth man missed training yesterday. Liverpool will still be without Roberto Firmino, though the Brazilian has travelled with the squad to Spain. ",positive

The Hammers are heading to Germany on Thursday for the second leg of their semi-final tie after losing the first match in London 2-1 last week. West Ham are no strangers to being in this position during the Europa League as they lost the first leg of their last-16 tie to Sevilla, while Lyon held them to a draw at home in the quarter-finals. David Moyes’ side turned both ties around, though, by winning the second legs in convincing fashion without conceding a goal and Soucek thinks that will fill the team with belief ahead of the trip to Frankfurt. “This is a good way [to think] as we won both the other games in the second leg,” he told Standard Sport. “We need to do it again now. It gives confidence to us and we know that we can be a better team on Thursday, because we already played against them and we are quite confident. Tomas Soucek is confident West Ham can turn around their Europa League semi-final deficit against Eintracht Frankfurt “But we have to do 100 per cent of us, or maybe more, during the game. We have been showing spirit all season, maybe for two years since Covid started. We have developed a great atmosphere and on Thursday we will need it even more, because it is so difficult but so close to the final. “Our spirit has to be incredible from the first second, because we know what happened in the first leg, we conceded in 40 seconds. From the first second we have to be ready.” West Ham have enjoyed a remarkable run in Europe this season and although defeat to Arsenal on Sunday means they can no longer qualify for the Champions League via the Premier League, they can still do so by winning the Europa League. Soucek has admitted it would be a dream to play in the Champions League and only adds to the potential prize on offer. “It’s one thing to get to the final, to be so close to get to the trophy of the Europa League and get a medal,” he said. “The second thing is to get into the Champions League. They are two big things that we want, but it is still a really difficult step to go in the second leg.” ",positive

Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative

The Dons were relegated to League Two at the weekend after losing 4-3 at home to Accrington Stanley. Bowen was appointed as manager until the end of the season in March and is now set to hold talks with the club about his future. The 58-year-old is hungry to continue on a permanent basis and already views the Dons as clear promotion contenders in League Two next season. “The players have got to be ready for a long hard season. The mentality has to be better,” said Bowen. “And I’ll say it now – I see AFC Wimbledon as one of the favourites to bounce back. We’ve got to embrace that and really grow in confidence.” Wimbledon want to resolve their managerial situation quickly so that they can get on with planning for life back in the EFL’s basement division. “We would all like to make this appointment as quickly as possible in order to make plans for the next campaign,” said interim chair Mick Buckley. “As you are all aware, the summer break is much shorter than normal due to the World Cup in December. “That means we need to sort out player contracts and recruitment plans as soon as this campaign is over - and having a manager in place is a preferable part of that process. “All I can say, at the moment, is that recruitment discussions are already under way and we will be making an announcement as soon as we have an appointment.” The Dons are also braced for bids for star midfielder Jack Rudoni, who has been scouted by Fulham and Nottingham Forest this season.

David Moyes’ side host the Premier League leaders at the London Stadium on Sunday, May 15, when most of the penultimate round of fixtures take place in order to avoid any clash with the FA Cup final at Wembley the previous day.

Academy graduate Lingard’s 22-year association with the Red Devils is set to come to an end when his current Old Trafford contract expires this summer. The 29-year-old is not expected to agree a late extension and will seek a new club at the end of the season having made just four starts for United across all competitions so far this term. Lingard will be one of a number of players departing as the Erik ten Hag era begins, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata also set to exit. The England international was an unused substitute on Monday night as United picked up a morale-boosting 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford in interim manager Ralf Rangnick’s final home match in charge. Jesse Lingard will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the season That victory saw United tighten their grip on sixth place ahead of West Ham and the players embark on a post-match lap of honour following a difficult campaign, though Lingard’s brother was evidently furious by the lack of a proper send-off for Lingard. Louie Scott reportedly posted on his private Instagram story: “20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year.” He added: “Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs [sic] being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise.

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive

Unlike so many games this season in which Ronaldo’s goals have papered over the cracks, the 37-year-old proved instrumental in the win even aside from both winning and penalty. At times, Ronaldo was even tracking back in order to win the ball before combining with Bruno Fernandes, Juan Mata and Anthony Elanga in a manner United fans have not seen before this season. Granted, the fact Brentford are not playing for much has to be taken into account but United resembled something of a cohesive attacking unit at times, all while dealing with Christian Eriksen’s delicious deliveries well from a defensive point of view. Fernandes opened the scoring following an Elanga cross after the youngster broke behind the Brentford defence in the opening ten minutes before Mata teed up Ronaldo for another goal on the break. That, however, was chalked off by VAR after an offside call and United went into the interval with only a one goal lead. From there, United really stepped up a gear. Led by Ronaldo, both Mata and Nemanja Matic also impressed on what is definitely their final appearances as a United player on home soil. Raphael Varane would sweep home a third as supporters bid farewell a number of players, not many of whom have lived up to their billing. In many ways, it was a strange, somewhat of testimonial-like atmosphere. A game that really did not matter, the handbrake was off and at least some of the negativity was lifted as Mata, Matic and Edisnon Cavani were applauded off the United stage. The Erik Ten Hag era is coming and Ronaldo’s future is uncertain. For the other players labelled as deadwood for much of the past few years, it was at least an amicable goodbye. ",positive

Last week’s tussle between the respective champions of England and Spain at the Etihad was an instant classic, with early goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus seeing the hosts race into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. City could and should have scored a hatful more before the evergreen Ballon d’Or front-runner Karim Benzema reduced the deficit in trademark fashion, with second-half goals from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva then sandwiched between a sensational Vinicius Junior effort and followed by an outrageous Benzema Panenka penalty that left a thrilling tie brilliantly poised at 4-3. Despite being ahead, there is a sense of real potential missed opportunity as Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders head to the Bernabeu, where Real are typically so dominant, though very nearly came unstuck in humiliating fashion against Chelsea in the quarter-finals.

James Robson will be providing expert analysis from Madrid. City look set to remain without experienced right-back Kyle Walker, who may not play again this season due to an ankle injury suffered in the quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid. Defensive colleague John Stones will be assessed after remaining sidelined for the win over Leeds, having limped off last week against Madrid - starting at right-back - in the first half. Guardiola made five changes to his first XI at Elland Road, with Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez replaced by Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. For Madrid, David Alaba is once again facing a race against time to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury to start in the first leg, only to suffer a setback and go off at half-time. Casemiro is now fully fit, but Eden Hazard remains out as he recovers from an ankle operation and Gareth Bale missed the weekend’s title celebrations with back spasms. Based on the first leg, which was more akin to a basketball match, predicting an exact scoreline between these two attacking powerhouses is a fool’s errand. Last week’s contest was absorbing, chaotic and gloriously eventful, with seven goals scored when in reality it could and should have been well into double figures. City will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t get the job done last week despite their hatfuls of chances, with Real always managing to somehow hang on and prevail in the end. This truly could go either way, but we’re backing Guardiola’s men to narrowly progess in another high-octane affair and book a second consecutive final berth. Man City to win, 3-2.

It’s obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players.

Alexander-Arnold, however, has insisted the squad are not focusing too much on the future. “Hopefully those extra two years [of Klopp] are as successful,” he said during his pre-match conference. “It’s an increase in success every year with him. This has been special so far. We can make it something special. Hopefully we’ve got 4 more years of that to come. “It wasn’t like it was a big party when he heard. It’s hard for news to sink in when games come thick and fast. “We’ll know when we sit down that it is good news but as a set of lads, we’re focused. He hasn’t spoken about it. Business as usual.” ",positive

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive

The influential Bardsley, who turns 38 in October, will call time on an impressive career spanning two decades at the end of the current Women’s Super League (WSL) campaign. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make but, after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” she said on Monday. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” SPONSORED The American-born Bardsley has 81 senior England caps to her name, featuring in three World Cups and two European Championships. She also played at London 2012 for Great Britain and was part of Hege Riise’s initial squad for last summer’s delayed Tokyo Olympics, though was forced to withdraw through injury. Bardsley, who played college soccer for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, began her club career in the United States, playing for Ajax America Women, Pali Blues and Sky Blue FC before moving to Europe with Swedish outfit Linköpings. She first arrived in English football with Lincoln in 2013, joining Manchester City a year later ahead of their debut season in the WSL. Bardsley won the WSL title with City in 2016, plus four League Cups and three FA Cups. With the Lionesses, the 37-year-old was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, also lifting the Cyprus Cup twice and the SheBelieves Cup in the USA in 2019. Manchester United’s Mary Earps has now established herself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper under Sarina Wiegman ahead of this summer’s delayed home Euros, with competition from Bardsley’s City team-mate Ellie Roebuck and Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton. City plan to honour Bardsley ahead of Wednesday’s clash with Birmingham, with a trip to Reading then in store before the FA Cup Final clash with Chelsea at Wembley on May 15. They currently sit fourth in the WSL, one point adrift of United in third and with a game in hand on their rivals. “Karen has left an undeniable mark on women’s football, and I believe that her playing career is just the start of the overall impact she will make,” said City head coach Gareth Taylor. “Although injury has limited her appearances on the pitch during my time in charge, she has remained an integral member of our team and has made a real difference behind the scenes. “She deserves all the plaudits that she receives, and I would like to wish her the very best for the future and the next step of her journey.” ",positive

The Red Devils are set for another comprehensive reset at the end of a dismal campaign, with Erik ten Hag leaving Ajax to take over the managerial reins after being preferred to Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino. Interim boss Rangnick is also set to remain as planned in a consultancy role, which he is set to combine with duties as the new head coach of the Austrian national team. United will require major surgery in the transfer market once Ten Hag is on board, with a drastic squad overhaul required to address problems all over the pitch and the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata all expected to depart. Ronaldo has been the saviour for United on several occasions since his sensational return to the club last summer, though there remains a debate over the 37-year-old’s future in such a rebuild. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has another year remaining on his contract, though Rangnick said it is up to Ten Hag to make a decision on Ronaldo as he stressed the need for United to significantly strengthen their forward department for next season regardless. “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,” Rangnick told Sky Sports of Ronaldo ahead of Monday night’s Premier League visit of Brentford. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” Rangnick has still yet to speak to Ten Hag since the Dutchman was last month confirmed as United’s fifth permanent manager since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. It remains to be seen if Cristiano Ronaldo will be part of the Erik ten Hag era at Manchester United However, he is expecting to sit down with his successor once the respective English and Dutch seasons have concluded, with United now embroiled in a fierce fight just to make the top six and Ajax on track for another Eredivisie title but denied a potential double following defeat by rivals PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Cup Final. Rangnick said: ""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" ",positive

The sluggish and weary Blues suffered their third loss in six Premier League games at Goodison Park, with Richarlison’s effort after a key Cesar Azpilicueta error handing Frank Lampard’s side a vital victory in their battle against relegation. It was a disappointing result punctuated by more sloppy individual mistakes and profligacy, both of which are becoming all-too-familiar themes for a Chelsea team that have certainly not been firing on all cylinders since their agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid last month. Lukaku’s struggles are a major running theme of an inconsistent campaign that has still included two domestic cup finals and Club World Cup glory, with the £97.5million club-record signing having started just one of the last nine matches across all competitions. Prolific in Inter Milan’s Serie A title-winning season last year, the Belgian international has failed to net a Premier League goal since December. Romelu Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea slumped to a shock defeat at Everton Regardless of those ongoing issues, many fans may still have expected Tuchel to turn to Lukaku as his side tried in vain to snatch a late equaliser on Merseyside on Sunday, with third-place Chelsea now just three points ahead of Arsenal with four matches left to play this term. Instead, the German opted to replace Jorginho with midfield colleague Mateo Kovacic at the interval, with wide forwards Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic later introduced at the expense of captain Azpilicueta and ineffective frontman Timo Werner. When quizzed as to why Lukaku did not feature at all against former club Everton, Tuchel insisted he was merely restricted by the number of available substitutions, which will be increased to five per game from next season. He said: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.” ",negative

After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive

The striker started for the fourth successive match on Sunday, playing a pivotal role as Mikel Arteta’s resurgent side swiftly regained fourth place in the Premier League from rivals Tottenham with a hard-fought 2-1 win at the London Stadium. Along with the likes of Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding, Nketiah is one of a number of unlikely protagonists now contributing hugely to Arsenal’s push for Champions League qualification despite a previous lack of regular playing opportunities. The 22-year-old’s Arsenal future remains subject to significant doubt, however, with his contract due to expire in June and no agreement yet reached over an extension despite offers having been tabled over recent months. The loss of Nketiah would likely leave Mikel Arteta needing to sign at least two new forwards this summer, with Alexandre Lacazette also seeing his deal expire and admitting he is open to returning to Lyon after holding talks with plenty of clubs. Eddie Nketiah has become an influential part of Arsenal’s push for a Champions League berth And Souness says he is “amazed” by the Arsenal academy graduate’s contract situation, believing he won’t be short of suitors on a potential free transfer after another impressive outing at West Ham. “I thought Nketiah was the best player on the pitch against West Ham,” Souness said on Sky Sports. “He was always threatening. “His contract is about to run out? I’m amazed by that. He will not be short of teams wanting him. He looked a threat throughout and he’s up for the fight. “I really like him and against West Ham, I thought he was fabulous. He’s put himself in the shop window. If that is his general standard, he will not be short of teams wanting to take him.” ",positive

Mikel Arteta’s side were not at their best at the London Stadium, but they won 2-1 to claim the three points that lifts them above Tottenham in the race for Champions League football. Rob Holding opened the scoring in the first-half by heading home from a corner, but West Ham equalised before the break through Jarrod Bowen. The Gunners, however, scored the winner in the second-half as Gabriel headed home at the back post from Gabriel Martinelli’s cross. Simon Collings was at the London Stadium to see Arsenal in action... Aaron Ramsdale 6 Made an excellent save in the first-half when Declan Rice’s header looked destined to go in.

Strong in the air and dealt well with Said Benrahma Rob Holding 8 | Star man Into the side for the injured Ben White and had a good game. Opened the scoring with an excellent header and made some vital blocks at the other end. Gabriel 7 Didn’t have a great first-half and looked shaky at times. Improved after the break and got on the scoresheet with a good header. Nuno 5 Just looks so raw and a player clearly still developing. Had some bright moments going forward, but defensively he looks vulnerable. Martin Odegaard 6 Was the best player on the pitch for this game last season, but he was very quiet today. Struggled to get into the game as Rice kept him quiet. Mohamed Elneny 7 Another good performance from the Egyptian, who is relishing his run in the team. Made one or two crucial blocks and tackles. Granit Xhaka 7 The Swiss has been in fine form recently, but he was not quite at his best today. He was still solid enough, especially defensively, but a few loose passes at times. Bukayo Saka 7 Looked like Arsenal’s best weapon in attack and caused Ryan Fredericks plenty of problems down the right. Setup the opening goal from a corner. Eddie Nketiah 7 Bright and lively, as you’d expected, and pressed West Ham’s centre-backs well. Had one or two sights on goal, but couldn’t make them count.

Harry Kane’s goal and a Heung-min Son double ensured Spurs moved above their north London neighbours, at least temporarily, with the Gunners due to play West Ham later in the day. A much-changed Leicester, who are prioritising Thursday’s Conference League semi-final decider against Roma, struck the post early on through Patson Daka but were undone when Kane header home Son’s corner in the first half. After the break, South Korean finished inside the box from substitute Dejan Kulusevski’s pass before curling home a stunning effort from 20 yards to seal an important victory. Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a late consolation for Leicester when his long-range effort range crept inside the near post. Dan Kilpatrick was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 7 Made a fine fingertip save to turn Daka’s early effort on to the post and quick off his line when needed. Couldn’t keep out Iheanacho’s late strike, which was right in the corner. Cristian Romero 9 A presence at both ends of the pitch in another imposing display. Made the second goal with a magnificent double tackle, the second absolutely cleaning out Caglar Soyuncu. Eric Dier 8 Won some important headers in a calm performance. Coped well with sub Jamie Vardy for the final 25 minutes. Ben Davies 7 Gifted Leicester an early chance in a sloppy moment but solid thereafter. Stepped out of defence well on a couple of occasions. Emerson Royal 5 Tidy and worked hard but failed to make any impact in the final third. He was involved in the build up to Son’s second goal, however. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Passing was hit and miss, but got struck in and helped Spurs to establish midfield dominance after the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7 Used the ball well and was one of Spurs’ better players in the first half, despite a mix-up with Romero leading to Daka’s chance. Might have been clear on goal from Kulusevski’s pass but touch was poor. Ryan Sessegnon 6 Got in some good positions but struggled to make inroads against his opposite man in another difficult outing. Still looked short of confidence. Lucas Moura 4 Back in the XI for the first time since the defeat to Wolves in mid-February, he did nothing to suggest he has deserved more playing time. Never got going and was more liability than threat. Heung-min Son 9 Made the game safe with two second half goals, including a stunning curling finish. Assisted Kane with a near-post corner in a match-winning display. Harry Kane 7 Continued his remarkable record against Leicester with an 18th goal in 17 appearances, a firm header from Son’s corner. Subs Dejan Kulusevski (Lucas 55’) 8 Responded to being rested with an immediate impact from the bench, slipping in Son to double the scoring and setting up his second goal with a simple pass. Harry Winks (Bentancur 81’) 4 Beaten too easily by Iheanacho in the build up to Leicester’s goal. Steven Bergwijn (Son 81’) 6 No repeat of his late heroics at the King Power in a brief cameo.

Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well.

Here? I honestly don’t think so,” he said. “The attack works well, but I don’t get to play much. “A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming.

Minutes before Gabriel headed in what proved to be a winner, the Arsenal goalkeeper rushed out to sweep up a long-ball played in-behind his defence, to which Bowen got to first. The West Ham star hit the ground after a collision but was booked for diving, although Ramsdale would give him credit during his post-match interview for not protesting further. “He is a good lad,” said the Arsenal stopper. “I didn’t actually touch him at all. He was honest. He jumped straight back up and said, ‘No, no, no. It wasn’t a foul’. Fair play to him.” Moyes, however, suggested there may well have been a chance for Bowen to cause Ramsdale a problem without diving necessarily. “I don’t ever want my players to dive because I just don’t really believe in it,” he said. “I think Jarrod could have easily left his leg there and trailing it into the goalkeeper, maybe he should have.

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves. He was man of the match today. He is always there when we need him.” ",positive

Arsenal ensured they ended gameweek 35 in the Premier League’s top four with a 2-1 win away at West Ham at the London stadium on Sunday. The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City. But Arsenal responded to the pressure with a third consecutive victory to give them the edge in what has become a two-horse race for fourth place. After a cagey opening to the contest in which Arsenal enjoyed most of the possession, Rob Holding gave the visitors the lead with a glancing header from a 38th-minute corner. West Ham levelled on the stroke of halftime, however, with Jarrod Bowen’s shot taking a deflection to beat Aaron Ramsdale who moments earlier had saved well from Declan Rice. Gabriel ensured Arsenal remained in the driving seat for a long-awaited return to the Champions League although, with a north London derby still to come, the race is far from over. Arsenal have 63 points from 34 games with Tottenham on 61 points, also with four games left to play.

They still gave Arsenal a good game, though, and they went in level at the break as Jarrod Bowen cancelled out Rob Holding’s opener. Gabriel, however, scored a winner for Arsenal in the second-half and West Ham are now sixth in the Premier League, with the Gunners 11 points ahead of them with three games to go. Simon Collings was at the London Stadium to see West Ham in action... Lukasz Fabianski 7 Made one or two good saves to deny Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka. Couldn’t do much about either goal, as poor marking let him down. Vladimir Coufal 7 As always, he was a real threat going forward and caused Nuno problems at left-back. Setup Bowen’s goal with a good cross. Kurt Zouma 6 Not at his best and still looks to be finding his feet after returning from injury. Was caught out once or twice by Nketiah’s pace. Aaron Cresswell 6 Asked to fill in at centre-back and did a solid job, especially given he was playing in a two and not a back-three. Ryan Fredericks 5 Had a tough afternoon up against Saka, who skipped past him a few times. Not easy for Fredericks given he had been asked to fill in at left-back.. Mark Noble 6 Unsurprisingly outshone by Rice next to him, who was imperious. Looked a bit leggy at times and occasionally struggled with pace of play. Declan Rice 7 | Star man Another excellent performance in the middle of the park from the England international. Looks a class above every week he plays. Pablo Fornals 6 Like most of the trio behind Bowen, the Spaniard couldn’t really get into the game too much. Had a few sights of goal in second-half. Manuel Lanzini 5 A difficult afternoon for the No10, who never really got going and was hooked with 20 minutes to go. Looked like his poor marking was partly to blame for Arsenal’s opener. Said Benrahma 5 Like Fornals on the other side, he just wasn’t really involved much. Kept quiet for most of the game by Takehiro Tomiyasu.

After a dull opening half an hour, Rob Holding – who once again impressed - scored the first Premier League goal of his career with a glancing header following Bukayo Saka’s corner. From there, the game burst into life. Seconds after Holding’s opener, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a brilliant reactionary save as Declan Rice’s near-post flick-on flew towards him at break-neck speed. As is becoming customary for this West Ham side, David Moyes’ team were able to feed off a loud home crowd and create their own momentum, with Vladimir Coufal teeing up Jarrod Bowen for an improvised finish to level the scores just before the interval. After the break, the home side started brightly once more. Bowen proved the livewire in the absence of a central striker, although was booked for diving when Ramsdale raced out of his box to sweep up a long ball in-behind the Arsenal defence. With the game finely-poised, a set-piece was likely to be the difference and so it proved when Gabriel Martinelli crossed for compatriot Gabriel Magalhaes to power in what proved to be the winner ten minutes into the second-half. With a corner cleared, Martinelli reacted first and hung up an inviting cross for his teammate to convert with a crushing header at the back post. Eddie Nketiah twice went close to adding a third but this was a game in which Arteta’s side overcame a major hurdle. With Spurs beating Leicester earlier in the day, Arsenal proved they could deal with the pressure. ",positive

Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive

A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive

For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive

The first half consisted primarily of Chelsea possession and fouls. Five of a total eight yellow cards were handed out in the first 45 minutes, two of which came Cesar Azpilicueta and Seamus Coleman’s way after the captains tussled over a foul committed by Mason Mount, which also earned a booking. It was Azpilicueta who, moments after the restart, surrendered possession by his own penalty area for the opening goal. Demarai Gray slipped in Richarlison to bury the opener and send Goodison Park into raptures, matching the big-game atmosphere present all weekend on Merseyside as fireworks set off outside the Chelsea hotel overnight were followed by flares welcoming the home team bus into the stadium. Vitalii Mykolenko squandered a great chance for 2-0 immediately afterwards, firing over from close range, before Jordan Pickford came to Everton’s rescue. Mason Mount hit the post with a half-volley from outside the box, which rolled agonisingly along the goalline. Azpilicueta arrived on the scene to have a rebound stunningly denied by the keeper, who got up to save Antonio Rudiger’s point-blank effort from the subsequent corner with his face. With seven minutes of added time, Pickford again produced heroics to deny Mateo Kovacic after the midfielder wriggled free deep in the Everton box.

It was a scrappy performance from the Blues, who fell to defeat away from home for the first time since January. James Robson was at Goodison Park to give his verdict on the visiting players... Edouard Mendy - 6 Had very little to do – but could not keep out Richarlison’s strike. Let down by Azpilicueta on that occasion. Cesar Azpilicueta - 5 Took his eye off the ball and Chelsea paid as Richarlison struck. Typical of a performance when he seemed more interested in getting into arguments than concentrating on his job. Thiago Silva - 6 Felt like the only Chelsea defender not to lose his head on as when they allowed themselves to be frustrated by Everton. Antonio Rudiger - 6 Booked early on and had to walk a tightrope afterwards. Still as physical as you would expect, but there were some heart in mouth moments. Reece James - 6 After his brilliant performance at Old Trafford, there was a sense of him wanting to do too much on occasion here. At times he could have kept it simple as was caught as a result. Still one of Chelsea’s most threatening players. Jorginho - 4 Chelsea needed him to be more dynamic. His one-paced display typified the lack of urgency in his side’s first-half offering. Ruben Loftus-Cheek - 6 Chelsea’s best moments of a dour first half came from his bursts through midfield. One of the few players in yellow to try to open Everton up. Marcos Alonso - 6 He had more reason than most to pile the misery on Lampard after the break down of their relationship at Chelsea. Pushed high to give Chelsea an outlet on the left. Mason Mount - 6 So close to scoring. Not short of endeavour, but in that No10 role he needs to produce a bit more craft to got along with the graft. Timo Werner - 5 Largely ineffective. Got himself into some decent areas, but never did anything with those opportunities. Kai Havertz - 6 Worked hard and it was clear how he was trying to get between the lines of Everton’s defence. Did not look like scoring. Substitutes Mateo Kovacic (Jorginho, 46) - 6 Brought a bit more drive to Chelsea’s midfield to try to break Everton out of their comfortable shape. Christian Pulisic (Azpilicueta, 68) - 4 Struggled much like the rest of Chelsea’s forwards. Hakim Ziyech (Werner, 68) - 5 Produced the odd threatening cross. Not a lot else. Subs unused: Kepa, Chalobah, Sarr, Saul, Kenedy, Lukaku. ",positive

It lifts Tottenham back into fourth place in the Premier League, though that will change if Arsenal come away from the London Stadium with three points later on Sunday. Spurs started the better of the two sides but it was a much-changed Leicester side who very nearly took the lead early on as Patson Daka was denied by the woodwork. Cristian Romero then had to make a brilliant interception to stop the Foxes striker having a tap-in at the back post. Despite that strong spell, it was Tottenham who found the opening goal of the match. The Foxes once again were found wanting defending a set-piece, as Son swung in the corner and Kane was there to head home. Spurs’ main man went close to getting his second of the afternoon as he pounced on a loose pass and poked an effort at goal, Kasper Schmeichel doing just about enough to keep it out. After a scrappy start to the second-half, Tottenham took real control of proceedings on the hour mark. Two huge challenges from Cristian Romero set them away, and Dejan Kulusevski then slid the ball through to Son. He turned smartly in the box and fired home with his left foot to double the advantage. Leicester never looked like mounting a comeback but any hopes of one were ended when Son got his second. He picked up the ball, cut inside onto his left and bent a stunning effort into the top corner to put the result beyond any doubt. Iheanacho added a late consolation in stoppage-time, but it did little to dampen the mood on a positive afternoon for Spurs in north London. ",positive

Celtic took a giant step towards clinching the Scottish Premiership title with an absorbing 1-1 draw against Old Firm rivals Rangers at Parkhead. The visitors, beaten 1-0 by RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final in Germany on Thursday night, started positively and could have taken the lead through Ryan Kent when he missed a good chance. But in the 20th minute Portuguese attacker Jota volleyed past Gers goalkeeper Allan McGregor from close range. Striker Fashion Sakala levelled in the 68th minute with a powerful drive, and struck the post late on when clean through as he failed to take a massive opportunity.

Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner.

Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too.

It was a typically competitive Old Firm derby, with the visitors knowing defeat would have effectively seen Celtic wrap up the league title. That hosts were on track for that when Jota put them in front in the first-half, but Fashion Sakala got his side level after the break. Scott Arfield and Sakala both missed huge chances late on to win it for Rangers. It leaves Celtic six points clear at the top of the table with three games remaining, though Rangers will still be hoping for an historic end to the season with a Europa League semi-final second-leg clash against RB Leipzig to come in midweek. The first big chance of the match fell to Ryan Kent, when he got on the end of James Tavernier’s brilliant cross only to divert it wide from close range. Kent then fired a shot from distance straight at Joe Hart soon after. With just over 20 minutes played, it was Celtic who took the lead. Daizen Maeda found space to drill a low cross towards the far post, where Jota beat Borna Barisic to it and provided the finish. The hosts increasingly took control of the match and Jota could well have had a second, though he sent a difficult headed chance flying over the bar. An even better opportunity came for Maeda just before half-time. The ball was looped to him superbly by Jota and he was completely free, but Allan McGregor charging off his line clearly put him off and the Celtic man flicked the header wide. Maeda started the second-half as he ended the first, wasting a big chance to double the lead. This time it dropped perfectly for him in the box and once again he fluffed his lines, blasting the shot over the bar. Rangers enjoyed a better spell as they tried to find a way back into the match, with Fashion Sakala heading over the bar and Steven Davis then unable to keep his effort from range down. The visitors got their equaliser though midway through the second-half. Ryan Kent slid the ball through to Sakala and he drilled a low effort past Hart, who would have been furious to get beaten at his near post. Hart had to be alert minutes later when Sakala was through and the goalkeeper tipped the effort away, before the Rangers forward continued his eventful period by heading over from the resulting corner. Once again Hart made up for his early disappointment when he made a brilliant save late on to deny Scott Arfield, with the Rangers midfielder thinking he had found a crucial later winner for his side. There was still time for the biggest moment of the match and potentially the decisive one in the title race. Sakala was played clean through on goal, he beat Hart with the finish but saw the ball cannon back off the inside of the post. Celtic have now perhaps overcome the last big obstacle between them and another league title. ",positive

The 37-year-old has hit 23 goals this season as United’s leading scorer but the team is off the pace in the race for fourth place - leaving questions over his future at Old Trafford. Former teammate Berbatov wants to see Ronaldo continue into next season thanks to his consitent output in front of goal. “Ronaldo is doing incredibly well for his age with the way he plays and the goals he scores,” the Bulgarian told Betfair. “To have so many Premier League goals in a season at his age is an incredible achievement. He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. “His game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important. SPONSORED “He has one more year at United, which is a good thing in my opinion, and now it is down to him whether he stays or leaves. I'd be glad to see him stay and of course things depend on the new manager and on what Ronaldo wants. He is an icon in football and when you are like that your opinion matters.” However, Berbatov accepts that Ronaldo may want to move on to have one last shot at lifting the Champions League trophy. “If he decides to go, obviously you can not blame him,” he added. “When you are used to playing Champions League football every year of your career and then you don't have it, it's tough to accept. “His performances this season show how well he is taking care of himself. He will want to play as long as he can and show that the impossible is possible. “He has proven that he can still do it at 37 in the Premier League, he likes to prove people wrong and I'm pretty sure that he will want to continue doing that and play a few more years.” ",positive

A 4-0 win over Espanyol over Saturday sealed La Liga glory for Real to ensure that Ancelotti has won the league in his first season back at the Bernabeu. A draw would have been good enough, but Rodrygo netted twice and Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema also got on the scoresheet to get the job done in style. The Italian left Real back in 2015 after three years in charge in which he was unable to lead them to the title. It’s the latest in a long line of trophies that he has lifted. Ancelotti won Serie A in 2004 when he was managing AC Milan and then sealed Premier League glory in 2010 as Chelsea boss. His time at PSG saw him win Ligue 1 in 2013, before leading Bayern Munich to the league title in 2017. Ancelotti will be hoping there is even more success to come for him this season, with Champions League glory still a possibility. “I’m very proud of this,” Ancelotti said. “I’ve had a very long season, but I’m still enjoying it.” “Now I’m with Real Madrid, and to win with Real Madrid is very special. “This is the first time for me to win a title at the (Santiago) Bernabeu, and the atmosphere here is special.” It’s a 35th La Liga triumph for Real Madrid, with the players marking it after the match by throwing Ancelotti up in the air. He did not want the fun to stop. “I told Marcelo that I wanted to keep going,” Ancelotti joked. “I was enjoying being up there in the air.” Along with Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane, Ancelotti has won the European Cup or Champions League on three occasions as a manager, with two of those coming when it charge at AC Milan and the third in 2014 when Real lifted the trophy for a tenth time. Champions League success this season would see him break that managerial record, though there is a tough task ahead. Real have a one-goal deficit to overcome on Wednesday night, after losing 4-3 to Manchester City in the first leg, though the Spanish side have already knocked out PSG and Chelsea this season despite not being at their best.

Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, has been linked with a takeover of Chelsea in the past but only last month a spokesperson dismissed reports he could succeed Roman Abramovich. The race to buy the club following the sanctioning of Russian billionaire Abramovich had been whittled down to three contenders, with consortiums headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Michael Broughton, LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Steve Pagliuca, who co-owns the Boston Celtics, left in the running after a fourth prospective owner - the Ricketts family - pulled out. The process had been nearing its conclusion, with a preferred buyer due to be announced but 69-year-old Ratcliffe revealed to The Times that he had submitted a late offer to US merchant bank Raine Group - who are overseeing the sale - on Friday morning worth more than £4billion, having held talks with Blues chairman Bruce Buck yesterday. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” Ratcliffe already has significant experience in sport, currently the owner of Ligue 1 side OGC Nice and Tour de France-winning cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. Ineos are also principal sponsors of Formula One world champions Mercedes and sailing’s Ineos Team UK. Their statement continued: “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive

Rivalling Boehly is an offer fronted by former British Airways chief Sir Martin Broughton, with backing from the likes of Formula One legend Sir Lewis Hamilton and tennis superstar Serena Williams.

The Reds didn’t ever look in any trouble in the first leg, the only danger to them that frustration grew as the Spanish side kept them at bay in the first-half. But Jordan Henderson’s cross found the back of the net with the help of a deflection off Pervis Estunpinan and less than two minutes later, Sadio Mane had doubled the lead with a smart finish. Villarreal will have home advantage in next week’s return fixture, but that looks unlikely to stop Liverpool sealing a third Champions League final appearance under Jurgen Klopp. Unai Emery’s side made their intentions very clear inside two minutes, when goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli took 30 seconds over a goal-kick much to the outrage of the Kop behind him. Liverpool’s first chance of the match fell to Sadio Mane when he got on the end of a cross from Mohamed Salah, but he was unable to direct his header with the ball slightly behind him. Jordan Henderson’s cross nearly found a way in at the near post, before Luis Diaz had a couple of shots from range saved. Giovani Lo Celso, on loan from Tottenham, made a brilliant block to deny Salah and the Egyptian then shinned an effort over the bar from close range as Liverpool piled on the pressure. They came closest to the opening goal a few minutes before the break when Thiago tried his luck from 30 yards, only to see his brilliant strike smack off the outside of the post. Liverpool had the ball in the back of the net shortly into the second-half as Fabinho finished from close range, but the linesman’s flag quickly went up with Virgil van Dijk offside in the build-up. A brilliant two-minute spell was all it took for the Reds to take complete control of the tie. The ball was worked out wide to Henderson as Liverpool found some rare space, his cross flicked off Estupinan and floated beyond the goalkeeper into the far corner. Emery didn’t have time to consider a change of approach before the lead was swiftly doubled. There was nothing fortunate about this one, with Salah playing a great pass through to Mane and he poked the finish past Rulli at the near post. It was very nearly three midway through the second-half, as Andy Robertson volleyed home from a brilliant Trent Alexander-Arnold cross, but once again the offside flag was swiftly up as he went to wheel away in celebration. Villarreal didn’t threaten to find a way back into the match, managing just a single shot across the 90 minutes, and they’ll need to produce an almost miraculous comeback on home soil next Tuesday if they are to turn the tie around and reach the Champions League final.

The La Liga fell to a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, and are perhaps fortunate to only be taking a two-goal deficit into the second leg after they were utterly dominated by Jurgen Klopp’s side. Jordan Henderson’s cross took a flick off Pervis Estupinan and found the far corner for the opening goal, before Sadio Mane doubled the lead less than two minutes later to give Liverpool a lead they more than deserved. Emery and Villarreal have done superbly to reach the last four for just the second time in the club’s history, but they know they will need to significantly improve if they are to score the two goals they will at a minimum require next week. “We can’t dispute the result because they deserve it,” Emery said. “The first half was defensively good but we didn’t achieve in attack. They had two or three chances to score. “The second half was the same and they pushed and deserved to score. 2-0 is a good difference for them, for us not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. “The match next week will be very different than tonight.

With Manchester City not in action until later on Saturday when they face Leeds, Jurgen Klopp’s side took full advantage to end the Magpies’ run of fix straight home victories. Jurgen Klopp was able to rest Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from his startling line-up ahead of Tuesday’s decisive Champions League semi-final trip to Villarreal. Liverpool could - and probably should - have won more comfortably in front of a boisterous crowd of 52,281 as they held the upper hand for much of a contest which saw the Magpies’ hopes of a fifth successive league win and a seventh on the trot at home wilt in the face of almost constant pressure. Eddie Howe’s men were never able to build up the kind of head of steam which has eased them clear of the relegation battle, perhaps a reminder of how far they have to go before they can once again compete with English football’s best on a sustained basis. SPONSORED The game kicked off amid a raucous atmosphere which might have increased had Jonjo Shelvey managed to make a better connection with a second-minute shot. Diogo Jota was similarly unable to make the most of a half-chance as the ball dropped to him inside the Newcastle penalty area, but Keita had keeper Martin Dubravka scrambling across his line as his first-time strike flew inches wide of the far post with eight minutes gone. Jordan Henderson volleyed high over from Andy Robertson’s corner with the Reds menacing in possession, which they increasingly started to dominate as Henderson and James Milner were allowed to dictate from the middle of the field. They took the lead with 19 minutes gone when, with the home side appealing in vain for a free-kick following Milner’s challenge on Fabian Schar, Henderson and Jota combined to feed Keita, who stepped inside before dispatching the ball past the helpless Dubravka. Newcastle’s response was tepid with Allan Saint-Maximin dragging a 28th-minute effort harmlessly wide as the visitors denied Bruno Guimaraes time and space to effectively limit his creativity, and Dubravka had to get down well to keep out Sadio Mane’s shot after Luis Diaz had raced away down the right 11 minutes before the break. Miguel Almiron thought he had levelled with six minutes of the half remaining after rounding Alisson, only for an offside flag to dash his hopes, and it took a fine fingertip save by Dubravka to prevent Jota from increasing the visitors’ lead as the whistle approached. Newcastle returned with greater intensity, but with key men Guimaraes and Saint-Maximin still largely curtailed, were unable to cause enough problems to trouble Alisson and his defence unduly, and Dubravka had to be alert to deny Jota and Robertson in quick succession as the hour mark approached. Mane might have killed the game off with 27 minutes remaining but steered his shot wide, and Dubravka had to save from substitute Salah and Jota as Liverpool eased to victory, although Alisson had to be vigilant to keep out Guimaraes’ late strike.

In beating Villarreal 2-0 at Anfield last night, the Reds went a long way to ensuring their quadruple bid will, at the very least, go to the wire and did so without coming out of third gear, the home crowd departing having suffered nothing like the emotional exhaustion that knockout European ties at this ground are renowned for delivering. Their side had enjoyed three-quarters of the possession, barely once been exposed on the break and allowed just one shot, off target. Alisson in the home goal did not make a save until falling on a tame strike three minutes from time as the linesman raised his offside flag anyway. “We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes sense that you control the game, and that is what we did,” Klopp said. Not only against the basketball match at the Etihad 24 hours earlier was the contrast stark, but also compared with the Reds’ two previous semi-finals under the German, the frantic 7-6 aggregate win over Roma in 2018 and the famous 4-3 comeback against Barcelona 12 months later. Klopp was asked whether lessons could be learned from the former of those ties, the Reds having been 5-2 up after the first leg at home before almost blowing it as the Italians rallied in Rome, but looked genuinely perplexed as to the relevance. This is a different team, in terms of both personnel and style, typified by the conducting presence of Thiago Alcantara and Fabinho in midfield, who play each game as if they’ve seen it before, like two men watching their favourite sitcom for the thousandth time, aware of what’s about to happen long before it does. In any other season, given this club’s relationship with the European Cup, a Champions League run that now looks almost certain to end in next month’s final would be front and centre. But such serene progress through the rounds has made this one feel as if it has been going on almost in the background, cruising along untroubled while all eyes have been on a domestic tussle with Manchester City. The Premier League still looks the most problematic element of this four-trophy pursuit, but when big games come every three or four days it certainly helps to deal in smooth rides rather than rollercoasters, and the swiftness with which Liverpool have seized command of each of their knockout ties to date has surely played some part in sustaining a quadruple push for so long. Liverpool have one foot in the Champions League Final after a 2-0 win over Villarreal at Anfield Klopp’s side have benefited from a kind draw, yes (though it did not look like that when the one for the group stage was made), but there have been virtually no moments of jeopardy, except perhaps in the 120 seconds between Lautaro Martinez’s goal and Alexis Sanchez’s red card in the last-16 second leg against Inter Milan. There has been no need for moments of Divock Origi-esque, legend-making heroism, either. In fact, the last time Liverpool’s future participation in this competition looked in serious doubt was as Trent Alexander-Arnold was preparing to land a corner on Alisson's head at The Hawthorns last May, before they had qualified for it in the first place. The caveat in all of this is that Villarreal were poor, a team who have clearly earned their spot at this stage of the competition but did not produce a performance worthy of it. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe Unai Emery has won praise for assembling a team far greater than the sum of its parts but last night the gulf between the sides was of the size you’d expect if glancing at the teamsheets without the knowledge that the Spaniards had already taken care of Bayern Munich and Juventus. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe. Had it not been for the presence of the world’s best player in opposition at the Etihad on Tuesday, and the nagging air of inevitability that lingers around the Champions League Death Star that is the Bernabeu, we might already be making preparations for an all-English final in Paris. With little fuss, Liverpool are almost there. ",positive

Daichi Kamada’s goal gave the Bundesliga outfit - conquerors of Barcelona in the previous round - a slender advantage ahead of next week’s return, after Michail Antonio had cancelled out Ansgar Knauff’s first-minute opener. David Moyes sprung a huge surprise in naming Kurt Zouma in his starting XI, the Frenchman returning well ahead of schedule from the ankle injury that at one point the club feared would end his season. If that was a boost for the home side ahead of-kick off, however, it was the visitors who were celebrating almost as soon as the game began as Knauff snuck in behind Pablo Fornals to head past Alphonse Areola and silence the London Stadium. The Hammers could be forgiven for looking a little shellshocked but gradually began to assert themselves and went within inches of a leveller when Jarrod Bowen was slipped in by Tomas Soucek but saw his finish come back off the post after the faintest of touches from Kevin Trapp. They did not have to wait long, however, as their set-piece threat told once more, Zouma heading down for Antonio to hook home despite the best efforts of Trapp. The German outfit retook the lead early in the second half at the end of a flowing move, which saw Areola brilliantly deny Djibril Sow, only for Kamada to tap in the rebound. Substitute Said Benrahma went close with a stunning effort soon after coming on but thing could have gotten worse for West Ham had Craig Dawson’s deflection not carried Kamada’s strike onto the far post. Deep into added time Bowen went within inches of an outrageous equaliser, thundering a magnificent bicycle kick against the crossbar from Declan Rice’s cross. ",positive

In an astonishing European match, City took a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes as Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne got them off to a flying start. Karim Benzema notched his 40th goal of the season though, completely against the run of play, to halve the deficit. Phil Foden extended the lead shortly after the break, only for Vinicius Junior to respond almost immediately with a brilliant solo effort. Bernardo Silva lashed home from the edge of the box to make it 4-2, but there was still time for Benzema to step up to the spot and dispatch an impudent panenka. The game could have finished any score - as it is, Real will be incredibly relieved they are still right in the tie going into next week’s second leg in Madrid. City started with John Stones at right-back as they looked to deal with a shortage at the back, while Real suffered a blow as Casemiro was fit enough only for the bench. Guardiola has often been accused of over-thinking these big European nights, but even he would have had very little time to gather his thoughts before his side took the lead inside two minutes. Riyad Mahrez drifted past the challenges and curled a ball into the box, where De Bruyne stooped to head home an early opener. Jesus, fresh off his four goals against Watford, made a great start a dream one. De Bruyne was involved again, putting a low cross in which David Alaba failed to deal with it and it fell perfectly for Jesus to convert from close range. City were imperious as Real fell apart, De Bruyne and Foden in particular running the show. Mahrez blasted an effort into the side-netting from a tight angle when he had two players waiting for a tap-in, leaving Guardiola absolutely furious on the touchline. Foden then dragged a shot just wide as the home side could very feasibly have been 4-0 up. Instead, it was 2-1. Benzema has at times single-handedly dragged Real through the Champions League this season and his latest intervention got them back in the tie. Ferland Mendy’s cross was a decent one, but it was made to look even better when Benzema sent a left-footed volley into the bottom corner to halve the deficit. Shortly afterwards, Stones was forced off and Fernandinho replaced him, as Real went into half-time with hope they shouldn’t have had. It was very nearly a start after the break reminiscent of the first-half. Mahrez beat Eder Militao to the ball and was clean through on goal, though his curling effort bounced off the far post. The rebound fell to Foden, who was denied by Dani Carvajal on the line. City restored their two-goal advantage eight minutes into the half. Fernandinho did a wonderful impression of Kyle Walker to burst out of defence and intercept the ball, carrying on his run as he drove forward with the ball and clipped a superb cross into the box. Foden was unmarked and had a simple headed finish. Fernandinho’s next contribution was markedly less positive for his side. Vinicius turned the 36-year-old on the halfway line and he was away, with the chasing City defenders getting nowhere near him. The Brazilian drove into the box and curled a finish into the far corner, less than two minutes after Foden was wheeling away in celebration. The chances continued to flow at both ends of the pitch, with Aymeric Laporte popping up as a striker to send a shot straight at Thibaut Courtois before Rodrygo wasted a good opportunity for Real. With 15 minutes to go, Silva made it 4-2 with a wonderful finish from the edge of the box. Oleksandr Zinchenko was brought down, but the referee played advantage as the Real defence stopped and Silva took full advantage to smash an effort past the motionless Courtois. It seemed impossible to imagine the match having even more drama, but Benzema had other ideas. Laporte handled in the box, leaving Benzema to defy the situation and show outrageous nerve to dink the ball down the middle for his 14th Champions League goal of the season. That was to be the last time the scoreboard was troubled in an incredible 90 minutes, with the only regret that there is a week to wait until the second leg. ",positive

Pep Guardiola’s side had to respond after Liverpool beat Newcastle and they did just that, with Rodri heading them in front early on. Leeds made it uncomfortable though and threatened to make City stumble in the race. But Nathan Ake doubled the lead after the break and Gabriel Jesus put the result beyond doubt, before Fernandinho capped the win with the final kick of the match to maintain City’s one-point advantage with four league matches remaining. Their focus now turns to the Champions League, as they travel to the Bernabeu to face Real Madrid on Wednesday. As Liverpool did earlier in the day, Guardiola shuffled his pack with Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne among those named on the bench. Leeds had a big chance to take a shock early lead, when a City corner was cleared out to the halfway line. Joao Cancelo was the last man and he slipped, allowing Rodrigo to charge clear for the home side. He should really have squared it to Raphinha, but took too long to make his decision and the space disappeared. With 13 minutes on the clock, City scored the opening goal themselves. It was incredibly simple too - Phil Foden swung in a brilliant free-kick delivery and Rodri had space in the box to head into the far corner. A nasty clash of heads between Robin Koch and Aymeric Laporte stopped the match and when it resumed, Leeds had their best spell. They rushed City and created some promising moments, but could not turn those into clear-cut chances. Gabriel Jesus fired straight at the goalkeeper after working space in the box, before Stuart Dallas was forced off with what looked to be a serious injury. The Leeds man clattered into Jack Grealish and in doing so was stretchered off himself. City took complete control of the match after the break and it came through another set-piece. The corner was swung in deep, Ruben Dias won the initial header and it fell to Ake who swept home the finish from close-range. Jesse Marsch moved Jack Harrison and Raphinha to wing-back as he threw everything he could at City in the final 25 minutes at Elland Road, but that left them exposed at times. Raheem Sterling had plenty of joy down the right, while Ilkay Gundogan sent a shot from distance wide before he had another from inside the box blocked. Raphinha went close to halving the deficit and setting up a grandstand finish, with Laporte sliding in brilliantly to deflect the Brazilian’s shot over the bar. Any hopes of a Leeds comeback were ended for good by Jesus with just over ten minutes remaining, finishing emphatically after Foden played him in with a wonderful pass. Cancelo could, and probably should, have added a fourth late on when clean through, before Fernandinho did just that deep into stoppage-time when he rifled it low into the far corner from the edge of the box.

The sorry Red Devils have won just two of their last 11 games across all competitions, a dismal run which continued with a fortunate draw at home to Chelsea on Thursday night. Cristiano Ronaldo saved United a point to keep their faint hopes of a top-four finish alive, although fighting West Ham for a spot in the Europa League appears to be of bigger concern. Those Champions League hopes have surely now been extinguished after Arsenal and Tottenham both won on Sunday, leaving Ralf Rangnick’s side eight points adrift of fourth place, having played a game more than their rivals. They are three points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham, meanwhile.

Firmino has missed the last four games - including last week’s initial clash - with a foot strain. The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet. But we hope sooner rather than later.” Divock Origi could return to the Liverpool squad in eastern Spain after sitting out Saturday’s 1-0 Premier League victory against Newcastle due to non-Covid illness. Jurgen Klopp made five changes to his starting lineup for a lunchtime kick-off at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all rested. You would expect that quintet to return to the first XI at Villarreal, with Joe Gomez, Joel Matip, James Milner, match-winner Naby Keita and Diogo Jota quickly swapping back out. However, Klopp has a difficult balancing act on his hands in Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple, with quick-fire matches against Tottenham and Aston Villa to come as well as the FA Cup Final against Chelsea at Wembley on May 14, which is followed by final top-flight meetings with Southampton and Wolves. Klopp is not expecting any lingering effects from a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. He added: “We had the issues with a stomach bug – they are all back. I think that’s it.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

83,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive

Head of recruitment Carey, who worked remotely and whose role was understood to be less grandiose than his title suggested, had been with Spurs for six years and follows technical performance director Steve Hitchen, who resigned in February, out of the club. “We can confirm that Head of Recruitment Brian Carey has decided to leave his role following six years at the Club. We would like to thank Brian for his work and wish him well for the future,” Tottenham said in a brief statement on Wednesday. Managing director Fabio Paratici is undertaking a thorough revamp of Tottenham’s scouting and recruitment teams and is close to appointing a new No2 to support him in running the football side of the club following Hitchen's exit. Paratici, who had only worked in Italy before joining Spurs, including alongside Antonio Conte at Juventus, wants more specialist knowledge of the English market, although his proposed new deputy is understood to be from overseas. Paratici and Conte have made two new additions at Tottenham so far, recruiting Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Turin in January.

Spurs will consider offers for Bergwijn this month but want to recoup closer to the £27m they paid PSV Eindhoven for the winger two years ago. Bergwijn, 24, was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho's tenure in January 2020 but could be the first departure under Antonio Conte, if Ajax return with a sufficiently improved offer. Bergwijn, who was born in Amsterdam, came through the ranks at Ajax before joining their rivals PSV in 2011, and is thought to be open to a return to the Eredivisie champions after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Spurs, however, would be reluctant to allow Bergwijn to leave until they have signed a replacement, particularly with Heung-min Son currently sidelined with a hamstring injury until at least the end of the month. Bergwijn made an impressive start at Spurs, scoring in his first three home league games including stunners against both Manchester clubs, but he has since struggled for confidence and fitness. He scored just once last season and opened his account for this term in December's 2-1 win over West Ham in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, also assisting Lucas Moura's winner. Tottenham will allow Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn to leave the club this month His display earned praise from Conte, who has raised the possibility of Bergwijn deputising for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. Bergwijn has not played since Boxing Day due to a calf injury but Conte said before Sunday's 3-1 win over Morecambe he expected to welcome back the Dutch international ""very soon"". Quizzed on Bergwijn’s future at a press conference held before the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea, Conte said: “Honestly, Bergwijn he knows very well what I think about him. I consider him a player that can play in all three roles. As a No9 and as a No10. “For sure, in my period at Tottenham, he was injured for a long time but I showed him that when he’s in a good physical condition, I gave him a chance to show he’s a good player. For sure, Bergwijn is a Tottenham player and he’s very close to coming back. “After the game against Chelsea, he can start having training sessions with us. I count on him. He’s a player with different characteristics to Sonny, Lucas and Harry. He’s very good 1v1, he’s a creative player that we don’t have in our squad.” ",positive

Ajax had a £15million bid for the Netherlands international winger rejected earlier this month but had not given up hope of persuading Spurs to sell. Tottenham were ready to consider offers for Bergwijn at the start of January and allow him to leave if Ajax returned with a sufficiently improved offer. But Antonio Conte has consistently said he wants to keep Bergwijn, even before his memorable heroics in the last-gasp win at Leicester. Bergwijn scored two injury-time goals as Tottenham fought back from 2-1 down to snatch an incredible 3-2 victory at the King Power Stadium, and Spurs hope that dramatic night will help revitalise his career in north London after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Conte has said he believes the 24-year-old can deputise for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. And a move for Bergwijn, who was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho’s tenure in January 2020, back to the Eredivisie before the transfer deadline has been ruled out. ",positive

It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch.

Richarlison goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","verton vs Chelsea FC LIVE! Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors. The Toffees do lead four shots to three however, and they also boast the only one shot on target from either side. Chelsea lead three to two on bookings. ",positive

Not what was required. 58 mins: Bentancur the latest player into the book - that’s been coming. Mendy turned him really nicely and the Spurs man just swept his legs away. Easy decision. 55 mins: First Tottenham change of the match. Kulusevski on to replace Moura. If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu. Was he tripped? The Spurs fans think so. The referee doesn’t. On we go. 50 mins: Romero plays the ball into the edge of the box, where Hojbjerg is briefly playing as the central striker.

Fortunately, straight to Schmeichel. Foxes would be wise to try and avoid conceding corners, judging by their efforts defending them so far.

100,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive

This time the Rangers man doesn’t really make any contact at all. 55 mins: MASSIVE CHANCE! Maeda has yet another huge moment and he’s fluffed his lines again.

Celtic swiftly back on the attack though, lifted over the top and Jota heads over the bar. Real chance. 28 mins: Barisic gets away from his man, only to then be clattered by Carter-Vickers. Had to get that right. McGregor lunges in inside the box too... brief appeals for a penalty but there’s no real contact. 26 mins: Rangers still happy to sit off then Celtic have the ball. Haven’t started pressing more since going behind. Bad news for Rangers fans - Celtic haven’t lost any of the last 96 league matches in which they’ve scored first. 23 mins: No surprise that the atmosphere has gone up another level after that goal. Home fans know just how big that goal could be. Barisic sends the ball straight out of play as he looks to flick it to Kent. Rangers got to get themselves back together. CELTIC TAKE THE LEAD! They’ve taken a huge step towards the title! Taylor plays the pass into Maeda and he can turn in the box. Works the space to beat Goldson, fires the cross low into the back post and Jota gets there ahead of Barisic to turn into an empty net. 18 mins: Ball worked out to Maeda, but he’s offside.

Angelino hit the winner after 85 minutes in Germany to start a huge week for the Scottish side with a narrow defeat. Rangers did come from behind to defeat Braga in the last round but are once again up against it as the tie heads to Ibrox in a week’s time. With strikers Alfredo Morelos and Kemar Roofe still out injured, Giovanni van Bronckhorst had again to adapt and in what looked like a 5-3-2 formation with midfielder John Lundstram moved back, he gave a start to Stephen Wright up front with Ryan Kent. There were Rangers fans in most parts of the stadium, helping to create a terrific atmosphere but they watched their side chase shadows at the start. SPONSORED A penalty claim when Christopher Nkunku could not get away from Gers defender Connor Goldson was ignored by French referee Benoit Bastien. There was little respite for the Light Blues and in the 16th minute Calvin Bassey blocked a goal-bound shot from Nkunku before Goldson, with equal desperation, prevented Dominik Szoboszlai's shot troubling Alan McGregor. With their first corner just before the half hour mark, Goldson headed Borna Barisic's delivery over the bar but Rangers were soon defending again with skipper James Tavernier getting in the way of a terrific strike from Angelino. With Aribo further up after the break, Rangers had their first real chance at the start of the second half when Kent worked some space in the RB Leipzig box and fizzed the ball across the front of skipper Peter Gulacsi's goal but found no takers. Tavernier then had a shot deflected for a corner but again Goldson headed over. At the other end, McGregor beat away a drive from Nkunku - a reminder for the Govan men of the home side's threat. RB Leipzig took a grip and Rangers were again on the back foot but still the Ibrox side's defence defended resolutely. Fashion Sakala replaced Wright after 68 minutes and moved into the centre-forward position but moments later the visitors should have found themselves behind. Nkunku burst into the Rangers box and rounded McGregor but with the goal gaping he hammered the ball over the bar - it was a huge let-off for the Light Blues. In the 75th minute Gulacsi gathered a long-distance effort from Kent before Nkunku beat Bassey to a header but again missed the target and then McGregor tipped a shot from Tyler Adams over the bar. From the corner Sakala headed clear but only to Angelino who volleyed past the Gers keeper from 20 yards to give the home side the advantage for the game in Glasgow. Additional reporting by PA Media.

The 37-year-old scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season on Thursday to rescue a point against Chelsea and his overall tally stands at 23 in 37 club appearances. United’s problems are surely more systemic than merely Ronaldo, who remains an elite goalscorer, but his signing has been criticised in some quarters as an example of the club being focused on superstar names rather than coherent strategy. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag this summer further muddies the waters. With the Dutchman needing to rebuild, it’s unclear as to whether or not Ronaldo will feature, or even if the Portugal international would wish to given United will likely miss out on Champions League qualification. Under contract until the summer of 2023, Ronaldo has previously hinted he does not want to be challenging for merely a place in the top four. Speaking after United’s draw with Chelsea, Rangnick said: “His attitude, he’s 37 - it’s not normal. If he plays like he did yesterday he can still be a big help to this team. “It’s ten Hag and also Cristiano’s decision for what he can do next, but his performance was great.” ",positive

The all-time kings of Europe reduced to the role of fools. Real Madrid endured a chastening night at the hands of Manchester City, when their very place in history was rocked to the core. Yet they head to the Bernabeu next week with everything to play for. This Champions League semi-final should have been over after half an hour, with Real humbled and humiliated by City’s sheer superiority. But Pep Guardiola’s side head to Spain with the slenderest 4-3 advantage after a night when it was impossible to shake the sense that an opportunity had been missed. It was notable that the Catalan needed to remind his players after this thrilling, breathless and reckless clash that they had won on the night. It felt like he was trying to convince himself. “Football is football, the result is the result, but how we performed is exceptional,” said Guardiola. “Nobody can say the performance was not good. I want to convince my players that we won the game and lift their heads up.” City were irresistible at times. They scored four and could have comfortably doubled that figure. Even after Karim Benzema’s Panenka penalty late completed the scoring, the home side had at least two more glorious chances to further extend their lead. It was that kind of night, with Real helpless to stop City when they were in full flow. But Carlo Ancelotti’s side do not know when they are beaten. That weight of history means there is never a lost cause – and with players like Benzema, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior, they always have a chance. “If Real have three chances, they will score five goals,” said one Spanish journalist before kick-off. And while that was not the case, it was remarkable how they made the most of the moments when they came their way. Benzema’s ageless brilliance was on show again after disposing of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds. At the Etihad, he had three shots and two goals, with the other effort blocked. City had done well early on to force him to do much of his work in deep areas to keep him away from the danger zone. In reality, his composure on the ball only helped to settle Real at the point when the City storm was at its most ferocious. Manchester City should have been out of sight against Real Madrid after just half an hour of the semi-final first-leg clash His first goal served notice to City of the danger of playing with too much abandon, halving the deficit after Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus had fired the home side into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. It instilled an uncertainty in Guardiola’s rearguard that remained throughout and is sure live on into next week’s second leg. Who would be brave enough to predict the outcome of that match, which cannot come soon enough? The expectation would be that both teams would try to tighten up defensively, but the question is whether either can? Real looked as vulnerable as they did in their quarter-final second leg against Chelsea, when they were blown away in front of their own fans by Thomas Tuchel’s side. Only the cushion of their 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge – and the brilliance of Modric and Benzema – saw them stumble over the line. Against City their tactic appeared to be no more than riding the storm and seizing their own moments. Guardiola – who was without a recognised right-back last night – will see his team significantly improved by the return of Joao Cancelo from suspension. But how Ruben Dias or Aymeric Laporte recover from such a wounding experience remains to be seen. But inspired by the ageless brilliance of Karim Benzema, the LaLiga champions-elect never know when they are beaten “If we play like we did in the second half, we won’t be able to win,” said Guardiola. “If we play like we did at other periods, we will. When I became a footballer and a manager, when you go to the Bernabeu there is no option but to win. You have to come through these situations to win the Champions League.” Ancelotti, meanwhile, warned City they might have missed a golden chance to secure their place in a second successive final. “It is a defeat that leaves us alive in the second leg,” he said. “We have to be better in our defensive aspect, but I believe we are able to create problems for them also. “In the second game I think if we defend better, we will win - but if we defend like today, we will be out of the competition.” Another classic lies in wait.

The Spanish giants looked in danger of humiliation after trailing 2-0 inside the first 11 minutes of Tuesday’s semi-final first leg but a stunning comeback means the tie is finely poised going into the return at the Bernabeu next week. Real boss Ancelotti criticised his team for their slack start at the Etihad but hailed their spirit in refusing to crumble in the face of City pressure. Meanwhile, Guardiola rued City’s failure to kill the tie off. Ancelotti said: “It is a defeat that leaves us alive in the second leg. We have to be better in our defensive aspect, but I believe we are able to create problems for them also. “In the second game I think if we defend better, we will win - but if we defend like today we will be out of the competition. “My feeling is that we started really poorly in the game, we were too soft, we let in two goals and from there the team showed what they have showed in the last periods.” Guardiola knows City could have effectively booked their place in a second successive final if they had taken a host of chances. He said: “If we play like we did in the second half, we won’t be able to win. If we play like we did at other periods, we will. “When I became a footballer and a manager, when you go to the Bernabeu there is no option to win. You have to come through these situations to win the Champions League.” Kevin de Bruyne opened the scoring after two minutes and Gabriel Jesus doubled their lead in a thrilling start. Karim Benzema pulled one back, but Phil Foden made it 3-1 early in the second half. Vinicius Junior cut City’s lead again before Bernardo Silva made it 4-2. A late Benzema penalty then ensured Real remain very much in the tie going into the second leg. “We were there all the time,” added Guardiola. “We were there. No complaints about the result, the performance, anything. I am so proud of the way we performed in front of the world.” ",positive

The American flew in for face-to-face talks with the club on Thursday, with prospective buyers making their final pitches this week, but has been told he will not be presented to the Treasury as a preferred bidder by US merchant bank, Raine Group, who are overseeing the sale process. The news comes on the day Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, confirmed he had launched a late £4.25bn bid to buy out Roman Abramovich. The owner of INEOS is hoping to hijack a sale that was nearing conclusion, with Todd Boehly and Sir Martin Broughton now battling it out for ownership. In a statement, INEOS said: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years.

Todd Boehly’s consortium have already held talks at Stamford Bridge and Sir Martin Broughton is also due to run through his proposals one last time. There is hope among the candidates that the process will come to an end this week, although they are still to be given any guidance by Raine over time frames. There is an acceptance that the speed with which the takeover has had to be conducted – due to the UK Government sanctioning Abramovich over his links to Vladimir Putin – has meant for the shifting of parameters. Shortlisted bidders are making their final pitches in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich Raine has asked a series of “comfort questions” and demanded a commitment from each bidder not to sell the club for 10 years. They have also asked for £1billion-worth of investment on top of the sale to ensure the ongoing success of the club. The final pitches have been described by sources close to the process as a normal part of the procedure, even after representatives from each consortium met with members of Chelsea’s executive before submitting official offers earlier this month. Pagliuca is due to fly into London today and head to Stamford Bridge. The co-owner of the NBA’s Boston Celtics has been the lowest key of the remaining candidates, with his interest in the club not known until late in the bidding process.

The three remaining candidates have been asked a host of follow-up queries, even after submitting final offers earlier this month.

Last week, it emerged both the F1 and tennis stars would pledge futher funds to a bid spearheaded by Sir Martin Broughton.

Lo Celso has added guile and grit to Emery's midfield and was outstanding as Villarreal eliminated first Juventus then Bayern Munich in the knockouts. Lo Celso was man of the match in the 1-0 win over Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, and pivotal again in the subsequent 1-1 draw in Germany, playing both games with a fizzing intensity which the Bundesliga giants found difficult to contain. He got the pre-assist for both the Yellow Submarine's goals across the tie. The performances could scarcely have been more contrasting to Lo Celso's limp efforts in his final months at Spurs, when the simplest of tasks looked beyond him and supporters grew increasingly exasperated with his inability to impact matches. The Argentine's turnaround since returning to Spain on January deadline day has not come entirely out of the blue, however, but rather feels like the result of a talented player being back in an environment which suits him. Giovani Lo Celso has revitalised his career since leaving Tottenham for Villarreal on a loan deal in January This is certainly the view of Spurs boss Antonio Conte, who regards the midfielder as gifted but ill-suited to the intensity and physicality of English football and judged that he needed to be playing regularly back on the continent. Conte has a point. Lo Celso enjoys dribbling and likes to release the ball late, when he has drawn in an opponent and space has opened up ahead, making him susceptible to challenges. His pass in the build-up to Samuel Chukwueze's decisive goal at Bayern was a good example. In LaLiga and the Champions League, Lo Celso is afforded more time and is said to feel more protected, and therefore more comfortable, than in English football. Before joining Spurs he had practically never been injured but two-and-a-half years of hard knocks in England led to a succession of niggles and more serious complaints, which sapped his confidence and disrupted his rhythm. His commitment to playing for his country, even while Argentina was on the UK's ""red list"" of travel destinations, further contributed to his stop-start season at Spurs and frustrated the club, particularly given the view that Lo Celso was the ringleader in September, when he, Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez reported for international duty against the club's wishes and subsequently spent 10 days training in Croatia to avoid a spell in quarantine. That said, Conte's predecessors Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino admired Lo Celso, and he looked more than capable of playing in England during Project Restart, when he was the heartbeat of Mourinho's improving Tottenham side. While many at Spurs found Lo Celso stand-offish, Mourinho liked his quiet determination and said in July 2020 he would not swap him for ""any player"". Last season, injuries and a loss of form largely reduced Lo Celso to the role of alternate for Tanguy Ndombele, who could rarely maintain his intensity for longer than an hour, and Mourinho's seeming lack of trust in him continued under Conte. Lo Celso spent last season at Spurs as an alternate for the disappointing Tanguy Ndombele By contrast, Emery, who managed Lo Celso at Paris Saint-Germain, has placed enormous faith in the 26-year-old, and regards him as a tactically intelligent player who can carry out specific jobs. Lo Celso has quickly become the leader of Villarreal's defensive press, and he is expected to play off the right in tonight's semi-final first leg to deal with the threat of left-back Andy Robertson, just as he did so successfully against Bayern. While Lo Celso's lack of a defined position was a problem at Spurs, Emery enjoys his versatility and will move him around during matches to suit the situation. There is also a view that Lo Celso may prefer being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, having struggled at PSG and Spurs but shone for Real Betis and Villarreal, who are seventh in LaLiga and will need to win the Champions League to return to the competition next season. Villarreal are desperate to keep Lo Celso but his loan deal does not include an obligation to buy at the end of the season, and Spurs want to recoup as much of the £55million fee they paid Betis as possible. Villarreal have never spent more than £21m on a player and are likely to push for another loan deal. Given Lo Celso’s impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer One intriguing hypothetical would be the return of Pochettino from PSG to north London in a job swap with Conte, which has been mooted this week. Lo Celso was signed on Pochettino's watch and he may be more open to keeping his compatriot than Conte. Given Lo Celso's impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer, however, particularly if he impresses again at Anfield tonight. ",positive

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday evening after Emery overcame European powerhouses in Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. A master of European competition after winning the Europa League on four different occasions across two clubs, Emery has tasted success against Klopp before. One of his Europa League victories came at Liverpool’s expense, beating Klopp’s side 3-1 while manager of Sevilla after a second-half comeback in the 2016 final. After overcoming two of the biggest names in the game - with those wins following up on the win over Manchester United in last season’s Europa League final - Emery is once again proving to be a master tactician in the game. Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Klopp paid tribute to the former Arsenal boss. “Unai is a detail-obsessed manager who prepares for all different situations in the game and that’s what his team is executing,” he said. “It’s really, really good, different ways to build-up, different ways to press, different ways to react on results. “He is a world class coach is doing an incredible job there. “Our job is to make life difficult as possible for them and that is what we will try and do over the two legs.” ",positive

A good job then, that the German knows his way around a yellow wall. Having stifled Bayern Munich in the previous round, limiting Robert Lewandowski & Co. to just one goal across 180 minutes, Emery and his Villarreal side arrived at Anfield intent on making this semi-final first-leg a non-event and turning the tie into a one-off shootout at El Madrigal in a week’s time. Instead, they were undone by a quickfire double at the start of the second-half that has Klopp’s quadruple chasers on the brink of the Champions League final, knowing only a collapse in that return six days from now will deny them a third trip to the European showpiece in five seasons. By the time they travel to the continent, Liverpool’s pursuit of four trophies will have already gone deeper into a season, in date terms, than any English team in history and, thanks to Jordan Henderson’s deflected cross and Sadio Mane’s finish three minutes later, they are well on their way to becoming the first to play in all three major cup finals in the same season, too. This was not a vintage Reds display and certainly not a match to rival that served up by Manchester City and Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, either. But where City threatened to blow their opponents away, Liverpool prioritised control, never troubled defensively and always likely to win this game by however many they managed to score. The result is that, unlike Pep Guardiola’s men, they will take a two-goal cushion to Spain. Villarreal, for their part, offered up the kind of defensive resistance that Real seemed to have no interest in. Unfortunately, they did not have Karim Benzema at the other end, nor even their own next-best-thing, with Spain striker Gerard Moreno not fit enough even for the bench after a hamstring problem. Their stall was set out from the start. Francis Coquelin played in a four-man midfield containing two holders and was not one of them. Juan Foyth did as good a job as anyone has since his January arrival on these shores of shackling Luis Diaz, aided by the diligence of Giovani Lo Celso. Dani Parejo and Etienne Capoue stationed themselves almost on the toes of their centre-halves, cramping the edge of the box and allowing the likes of Thiago Alcantara all sorts of freedom at anything more than arm’s length, which almost backfired spectacularly when the Spaniard came within inches of a first-half wondergoal, striking some combination of bar and post. All the old tricks were in play, too. Geronimo Rulli took an age over his first goal-kick after just two minutes and continued to do so with admirable consistency. Each time he feigned to play short before ushering his defenders forward, as if only remembering in the nick of time that, against the best pressing team on the planet, that might be unwise. When just a minute was added at the end of the first-half, there were groans from The Kop aplenty. The romanticism of this town of 50,000 weighing in behind a merry band of Premier League cast-offs has afforded them licence to play in this way and Emery, for all his conservatism here, does not inspire the kind of snide fury that courses through, say Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid. Still, it was not pretty. Even so, Liverpool’s quality was already threatening to tell. Mane timed his run perfectly but flicked wide from Mo Salah’s superb cross, the pair combining in near-identical fashion to Riyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne for City’s opener 24 hours earlier. A raking fifty-yard pass from Andy Robertson was met with a brilliant first-time cross on the volley from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who picked out Salah, the Egyptian just failing to do likewise with the top corner. It was not individual quality, in the end, that did the trick, but an appreciable lifting of the tempo immediately after half-time and a bit of good fortune, as Henderson’s cross took a nick off Pervis Estupiñán, the change of direction enough to do for Geronimo, who could only flap into his own net. In Emery’s blueprinting of every possible scenario, the folder marked ‘going a goal behind’ must surely have been fairly near the top of the pile. He will have no doubt stressed the importance of dodging the old one-two. But when Liverpool tails are up and Anfield is in full voice, that is easier said than done and Salah soon slid Mane home to poke in a second. There has at times felt like a sense of destiny about Villarreal’s European run. Against a club who know all about that, however, they have surely reached the end of the road. ",positive

Overwhelming favourites against the Spanish side even before a ball was kicked in the tie, the Reds have one foot in the final in Paris after a 2-0 victory at Anfield on Wednesday night. Jordan Henderson’s cross deflected in off Pervis Estupiñán soon after half-time before Sadio Mane gave the Reds breathing space ahead of next week’s return. Villarreal have seen off Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach only the second semi-final in their history, but face a huge task to overturn the deficit against Klopp’s quadruple chasers. “It was a brilliant game,” Klopp said. “The first half I liked a lot - we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had. But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lots of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding.

We are at that stage when the Catalan can over-think, at best, or go into complete meltdown, at worst. Either way, City’s failure to replicate their domestic dominance in Europe has generally been self-inflicted. That they go into tonight’s semi-final first leg as overwhelming favourites underlines the quality of Guardiola’s squad, considering they face a team on the verge of winning the Spanish title and are playing at this stage of the competition for the 31st time. Guardiola has, arguably, had the deepest pool of talent in Europe for the past five years, yet last season was his first final as City manager and defeat to Chelsea continued a pattern that has seen him lose to underdogs in each of his Champions League campaigns with the club. From Monaco to Tottenham to Lyon, City have contrived to find a way to blow it, just as the draw looked like opening up for them — and Guardiola’s fingerprints have been all over each of those disappointments. None more so than last May’s final, when he named a starting XI without a holding midfielder. When Thomas Tuchel got wind of the news while on the team bus, driving to the stadium in Porto, he quickly altered his own plans. Chelsea’s winning goal from Kai Havertz came as a result of Mason Mount exposing that glaring hole in the City team to play the German through. So, it has reached the point where City fans are left looking through their fingers as the Champions League reaches the crunch stages for fear of what Guardiola will do next. If they can be sure of anything, it is that Madrid will be ready to pounce on any chance given. They are in the last four because of Chelsea’s own meltdown in the first leg of their quarter-final at Stamford Bridge. Calamitous defending gifted them a 3-1 lead to defend at the Bernabeu. Even then, Carlo Ancelotti’s side were 15 minutes from being eliminated until a sublime moment from Luka Modric set up Rodrygo to send the tie into extra time. Pep Guardiola has been known to over-think his selection and tactical decisions in Manchester City’s quest for Champions League glory That game in Spain should be instructive to Guardiola: Madrid could not handle Chelsea’s speed and aggression. Only the cushion from the first leg allowed them to recover by picking their moments through the individual brilliance of Modric and Karim Benzema. They are capable of producing those moments against City, but are unlikely to be gifted the freedom they were in the first 50 minutes at Stamford Bridge. That is, unless Guardiola strikes again. City’s own performance in the Spanish capital against Atletico in the last round should serve as encouragement that they have matured on this stage. For all the recriminations directed at Diego Simeone and his streetwise team, City used all the gamesmanship they could muster to frustrate and run the clock down. It was a defensive masterclass, right out of the Simeone playbook. In previous years, Guardiola might have been tempted to play his way out of trouble. On this occasion, City snapped and snarled and stubbornly got over the finishing line. It felt like a significant moment for the club and their manager in terms of their European evolution.

That is an indication of how fierce the competition is at City and why, with a year left on his contract, he has refused to commit his future to the club. Pep Guardiola also wants to sign a new centre-forward in the summer. Erling Haaland is his No1 target, and Jesus could leave after five-and-a-half years at the Etihad. Arsenal are among the clubs interested in the Brazilian. Strengthening their forward line is a major priority for Mikel Arteta and he looks an ideal signing for the Gunners. Jesus would tick a lot of the boxes for Arteta. Crucially, at 25, he still has his best years ahead of him. He is hungry and has a point to prove after struggling for regular starts at City. Arsenal specifically targeted young players with room for growth last summer, and the enthusiasm of those signings has spread throughout the squad. Arsenal want to reunite Gabriel Jesus with former Manchester City assistant boss Mikel Arteta Arteta knows Jesus from his time as an assistant at City and is a fan of many of his qualities. He would suit the way Arteta wants to play, as he is technically and tactically astute, versatile, quick and a tireless worker off the ball when pressing the opposition. Those traits would make Jesus an ideal fit for the young forward line at Arsenal, who are missing a proven goalscorer to help take them to the next level. Jesus had scored only three Premier League goals this season, and one since September, before his four goals against Watford at the weekend. But having arrived at City as a central striker, he now operates mostly on the right wing. That would be a different story at Arsenal, who can give him a central role, and that would surely be attractive to him. City are unlikely to stand in Jesus’s way if he want to leave, so if he pushes for a move, then his wish should be granted, especially with only 12 months left on his contract. He would be a good addition for Arsenal, but if their recent sticky run showed us anything, it is that Arteta needs a variety of different options, particularly in attack. Teams have found a way to stifle the Gunners, with Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira openly admitting that pressing Alexandre Lacazette made their attack break down. Jesus would, no doubt, improve Arsenal, but the signing of an additional forward feels necessary to give Arteta tactical flexibility. Players in the mould of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tammy Abraham, two strikers scouted by Arsenal over the past year, would fit that brief. Arsenal were particularly keen on Abraham last summer, however, they were unable to shift Eddie Nketiah or Lacazette to make room for him in the squad. The player himself was keen on the move, but could not wait for Arsenal and, ultimately, joined up with Jose Mourinho at Roma. The Gunners could go back for Abraham this summer, but given his fine debut season in Italy, such a deal would likely be too expensive. It is why Calvert-Lewin could emerge as a leading target, not least because Everton may well be relegated. That, combined with a tough season for the striker, would drop his valuation. A reunion with Mikel Arteta could be the solution that suits both Gabriel Jesus and Arsenal A player like that would give Arsenal a different way of attacking; the chance to be direct when short and sharp passing is not working. There could also be space in the team for Jesus, who can play left, right or even off a central striker like Calvert-Lewin. For now, Jesus says he is focused on firing City to Champions League and Premier League glory. Time will tell what happens after that, but a reunion with Arteta could be the solution that suits both the player and Arsenal. ",positive

The champions romped to a big win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday to briefly move four points clear of Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus scored four times in a 5-1 win. With title rivals Liverpool not in action until Sunday against Everton, City were overwhelming favourites to put Watford to the sword at the Etihad Stadium, with a double from Jesus’ edging them 2-0 in front inside 24 minutes. Watford then briefly threatened to make a game of it as French defender Hassane Kamara’s first goal in English football five minutes later brought the visitors to within one of City. However, a stunning strike from Spain international Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot. Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout. City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind. The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety. The visitors would have been fearing the worst on their trip north. Guardiola had won all 10 of his previous meetings with Watford in all competitions, and by an aggregate score of 42-4, before Saturday’s clash. It did not take long for City to get on the scoresheet once again in the Etihad sunshine, as Jesus, who was heavily linked with a move to Arsenal in the British media this week, reminded Guardiola of what he could do with a poacher’s finish just four minutes in. City had more than 83% possession in the first 15 minutes as they controlled proceedings, adding a second through Jesus again, on the end of a sumptuous cross from Kevin De Bruyne. Kamara’s drilled finish offered Watford only a brief reprieve, from what was their own meaningful attempt on goal all match, with Rodri drawing gasps from all around as he rifled his fourth league goal of the season past helpless Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. There was no slacking off from City, as just 15 seconds into the second half Jesus was fouled by Foster in the area before, after a lengthy VAR check, getting up to slot home from the penalty spot to complete his treble. A familiar source created the fifth and final goal for City as De Bruyne laid the ball across for Jesus to cap a memorable afternoon for the Brazilian. Additional reporting from Reuters ",positive

Two of the super agent’s most famous clients will be involved in arguably the most significant deals of the upcoming window. Erling Haaland is set to complete a move to Manchester City, while Paul Pogba will become a free agent and is set to walk away from Manchester United. By Raiola’s standards they will represent loose change in terms of the fees they generate – but will go down as two of the biggest deals in history. Haaland is available for £63million due to the buyout clause inserted by his representative when he moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2020. That paves the way to personal terms that have been reputed to be as high a £500,000-a-week. Pogba, meanwhile, will be in line for an enormous signing on fee when he walks away from Old Trafford, along with a weekly wage that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the world. No wonder Raiola’s clients are so fiercely loyal to him. The Italian always claimed his priority was to get the best deal for his clients like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and they loved him for it. Managers and chief executives did not always feel the same. He felt the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson after engineering Pogba’s exit from United as a free agent when one of the hottest prospects in the game in 2012. Ferguson wrote in his autobiography: “There are one or two football agents I simply do not like, and Mino Raiola is one of them. I distrusted him from the moment I met him. “He and I were like oil and water. From then on, our goose was cooked because Raiola had been able to ingratiate himself with Paul and his family and the player signed with Juventus.” His relationship with Pep Guardiola was even more fraught, with Raiola outspoken in his criticism of the Catalan over his treatment of Ibrahimovic when managing him at Barcelona. “If Guardiola doesn’t play Ibra after paying €75million for him, it’s best if you send him to a psychiatric hospital.” He later claimed to have confronted Guardiola after the Champions League Final in 2011. “I went for him that night in the corridors at Wembley,” he said. “Only Adriano Galliani stopped me. Lucky for Guardiola.” Raiola later said: “Pep Guardiola, the coach, is fantastic. As a person he’s an absolute zero. He’s a coward, a dog.” Given such personal enmity, it emphasises Raiola’s power that he was still prepared to work with him to bring in Haaland this summer. Likewise, United were prepared to do repeated business with him even after Ferguson’s experience. Pogba was brought back to Old Trafford for a then-world record £89million. Raiola was believed to have earned a staggering £41million from that deal. Ibrahimovic, Romelu Lukaku and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were other big money moves to United. And he hardly improved relations with the club or fans with his frequent public comments casting doubt over Pogba’s future. Guardiola famously claimed Raiola even tried to engineer a move for the France midfielder to City. Raiola was simply too big to ignore – too powerful for any club to refuse to do business with. And City’s impending deal for Haaland is the greatest evidence for that. It is also a further example of the brash Italian’s careful management of his clients. Haaland could have joined United back in 2020, when the player’s mentor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, made such a strong bid to bring him to Old Trafford. Instead, he rejected the possibility of the bigger move to further develop his game at Dortmund. Two and a half years on, Haaland is wanted by all the major clubs and can take his pick. He may just be Raiola’s legacy. ",positive

In front of a sparse United crowd amid a fan protest against the Glazer ownership, Chelsea quickly settled into a good rhythm. Kai Havertz was guilty of squandering the visitors’ most significant openings in the first half, whipping a shot against the side netting after a breakaway before slapping a one-on-one shot against David De Gea’s shoulder. The goalkeeper was then able to deny a free header, straight at him, as Chelsea produced everything but a finish. Reece James and Mason Mount were enjoying the freedom of Manchester down the right and the midfielder attempted to prise open the deadlock with a whipped cross that beat De Gea, and Timo Werner, shortly after the break. Beforehand, Havertz had again wasted a good counter with a sloppy pass. SPONSORED It was no surprise when Marcos Alonso popped up, unmarked, to fire Chelsea ahead on the hour mark after another move down the right. But even the most optimistic of home fans would not have expected Cristiano Ronaldo to appear moments later and slam home a leveller, after good work from Nemanja Matic. That goal did little to lift United in the grand run of the game and James hit the post with a left-footed strike from outside the box after a nice tee-up by Mount. But the Red Devils held on for a point. ",positive

The Dutchman will take over in the summer after a poor period for the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick, leading to Keane’s optimism that he will get a good view of the team ahead of his first day in the role. The ex-midfielder told Sky Sports ahead of the game with Chelsea on Thursday: “I think he’s a good appointment, there’s been a lot of speculation and the club will be glad to get the deal done - so he can start looking at the club and the background. “He’s got a solid CV, a very good reputation. But I suppose the proof will be in the pudding and we’ll know better when he’s in the job and he gets the backing, the support and hopefully a little bit of power to get United back competing at the top.” United legend Keane warned Ten Hag that he has a big job on in the transfer market, echoing Gary Neville’s sentiment of a potentially “brutal transition”. “He’s got to get a group of players that will give everything for the cause, that will be hard to beat,” he added. “Hopefully he’ll have a style of play that entertains the fans, but it’s a rebuilding job. He’s fortunate coming in in the summer with five or six players on big contracts already leaving - that will help. “I think every United manager will get backing, he will get some money to spend but it’s about getting the right players and right characters into the club - what we’ve seen from this group of players that last few months has not been good enough.” ",positive

Having watched top four rivals Arsenal beat Manchester United earlier on Saturday, Spurs knew the pressure was on. They looked devoid of all attacking creativity and for the second successive game they failed to have a shot on target. It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out.

While the likes of Gabriel Jesus and Tammy Abraham are reportedly targets, former Arsenal star Parlour has reasoned why 14-goal Toney could prove a better option. He told talkSPORT: “The strikers they’ll be looking at, they’ll also be looking at the other clubs interested in those strikers. ",positive

The Manchester United forward has scored 17 goals in 28 Premier League games this season, trailing only Mohamed Salah at the top of charts despite widespread criticism of his suitability to the modern game. Ronaldo scored his first League goal against Chelsea on Thursday to rescue a point at Old Trafford and recently hit the 100 mark during a loss to Arsenal at the Emirates. Under contract until the summer of 2023, it is unclear whether the change of manager and the fact United are all but certain to be playing outside of the Champions League next season will have an impact on his future. ""This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself,"" Rangnick told reporters when asked about Ronaldo’s future. ""Cristiano has another year of contract. It is also important to find out what he wants if he wants to stay."" Rangnick told Sky Sports in a separate interview that the final decision was out of his hands. ""In the end, it’s both Erik’s and also Cris’s decision what they want to do,"" he said. ""It is not for me to speak about that but, today, the performance of Cris was really great."" With Ronaldo scoring eight of United’s last nine league goals, Rangnick conceded that team are too reliant on him but said the club would focus on signing new strikers in the summer. ""Right now, we very much rely on Cristiano, he also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession,"" Rangnick added. ""But there has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers for sure."" Dutchman Ten Hag will replace Rangnick on the bench at the end of the season. United are sixth in the league on 55 points, five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand.” Additional reporting from Reuters ",positive

It had been suggested that the Italian was interested in taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at the French champions this summer, raising the possibility of a job swap that would have seen the Argentine return to north London. Conte’s contract runs until the end of next season but he has repeatedly said he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the campaign, with Spurs currently locked in a battle with rivals Arsenal for fourth place. When asked about the PSG links on Friday, Conte said: “Obviously I think that it's good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don't like when people try to invest news, only to speak, only to create probnlems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we're really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.” Asked if he had spoken to his players about the reports, Conte added: “In this situation, who works in football - players or managers - know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out. “We're working very hard and my players know very well we're very focused. We're speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. “We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Conte’s Spurs have slipped two points behind Arsenal with five games to play after losing to Brighton and last weekend’s frustrating draw with Brentford. Ahead of Leicester’s visit on Sunday, he issued a rallying cry to his players and supporters to keep pushing in the final five games. “I want to underline that we’re fighting for a target that, at the start of the season, no one could imagine,” Conte said. “Especially in November because when I arrived the situation wasn’t good - otherwise you wouldn’t change the coach. So to arrive with five games to go with the possibility to get this result is a great achievement for us. “So for this reason, we have to face the situation with great enthusiasm because we have nothing to lose and only to earn. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and it’s the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “If we reach this target, all the people in Tottenham have to be happy to reach this target and everybody has to be involved to meet this target.” ",positive
145,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive

Speaking last week, prior to undergoing surgery, Skipp opened up on his frustrations at seeing what had been a breakthrough campaign derailed by injury. “Come the international break, I had an injection which other players have had in the past and the hope was that the original pain would go but that’s not been the case,” he said. “There’s been various times where I felt like I was I getting there but with the nature of this injury it hasn’t materialised that I’ve come back yet. “It’s been a really frustrating one for me, the most difficult part of it is being in the unknown.” ",negative

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take.

Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

The 25-foot-high artwork pays tribute to the Tottenham legend, a one-club man who made more than 250 appearances for the club and captained Spurs to their last trophy in 2008. The mural on Tottenham High Road features King and his inspirational quote: “This is my club, my one and only club”. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust [THST], who commissioned and part-funded the artwork with the help of the club, said it “opens a new chapter in Spurs history”. “It is, we hope, the first of a number of initiatives that make the history of Tottenham Hotspur more visible in the area around the stadium and more widely around Haringey,” said THST in a statement. On seeing the completed mural for the first time, King said: “It is a true honour for me to have a tribute like this in the heart of a community that means so much to me. “I have always shared an incredible relationship with the club and its fans, who have supported me through thick and thin. “To know that I am thought of in this way by our fans makes me incredibly proud and shows why this club – my one and only club - is so special.” THST board member Rob White said: “Murals are a great way of being able to raise awareness of great players, and great moments. “It’s taken about 18 months. We started with identifying potential sites, finding out who owned them, then looking to get permission for the project. For a variety of reasons, this is not as simple as it sounds. Especially when introducing a relatively new concept to an area. The hope is that once this first mural is in place, other people will come forward with suitable sites. “We had a meeting with Ledley and Tony Stevens from the club at the end of November 2021, where we put the idea to Ledley and showed him the concepts. It’s fair to say that he was delighted and humbled by the idea. “I also think that it’s quite an abstract concept when you are first approached for something like this, but then it all becomes a bit more focused when you see the scale of the project. It’s also really nice for Ledley to think that this fans tribute will be in place for a long time. “The club has been extremely supportive of the project, and they have really got behind the Ledley mural. I know that this project has inspired them, and that they’re looking to use this experience to build on some more heritage and Spurs history ideas in the local area. “This is a response to the calls to pay tribute to club legends. It’s also a really good way of engaging with the local community. “The long-term vision is to have about 10 to 12 pieces of Spurs history artwork throughout Haringey, which help to tell the story of the club. “The pieces do not all need to be the size of the Ledley mural but could form part of a history/heritage trail and some could also tell the stories of the lesser-known characters. This could be funded by various fan groups, overseas or in the UK, who would then decide on who or what they wanted to see.” ",positive

Spurs survived a major scare as they rallied and scored three goals in the final 16 minutes to come from behind and see off the League One strugglers 3-1 on Sunday. Tottenham laboured, particularly in the first half, until Antonio Conte called for the cavalry and introduced Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Oliver Skipp in the 69th minute. Winks equalised with a free-kick five minutes later before Lucas put Spurs ahead and Kane then sealed victory. Winks said it was disappointing that Tottenham’s second-string needed to be bailed out by their star forwards again after a display that he said “wasn’t good enough”. ""There is disappointment, it wasn’t good enough,” said Winks. “It was sloppy. We weren't sharp or aggressive enough. We didn't play with enough pressure or intensity. We could have upped our game a lot. “At half-time, there was a lot of harsh and honest words said. It wasn’t good enough and we know that. We hold ourselves accountable. We did better in the second half than the first, but it's not good enough. “These are the kinds of games where in the first 10 or 15 minutes, you need to settle everybody, settle the crowd and then enjoy the game. We made an enjoyable afternoon into a tough one. We shouldn't have done that. “We got the result, we got the win, it's nothing to be too happy about because we made it difficult for ourselves and we shouldn't really celebrate. We should be looking back and seeing what we can do better.” ",positive

Spurs begin a gruelling run of ten games in 30 days with Thursday night’s home derby against Brentford and Conte has confirmed that Kane, the club’s only senior striker, is unlikely to start them all. Bergwijn has struggled for consistency since joining Spurs from PSV Eindhoven in January 2020 and the winger has been linked with a return to the Eredivisie next month. Under Conte's predecessors, Heung-min Son typically deputised for Kane through the middle, but the Italian wants to keep Son at No10 and revealed he is prepping Bergwijn to play up front. Asked by Standard Sport if Kane would need to be rested this month, Conte said: “I think so and I also think Steven could be a good option [to deputise]. ""In the past I have seen that Son played No9. Honestly, I prefer Son to play as a No10 – in the position that he is now playing. I like to have a point of reference as No9. Steven is working and we are utilising him also in this position [and] in the three positions off the striker. Steven could be a good option on the day that I want to give a rest to Harry.” Bergwijn scored on his first three home appearances in England, including crackers against both Manchester clubs, but his confidence appeared to drain after he missed a glorious chance in the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in December – which triggered Spurs' slide down the table. He has scored just once for Spurs since the start of last season but Conte says the Netherlands international – who helped his country qualify for the World Cup with a brilliant goal last month – is not alone in lacking confidence. “I honestly think many players have to recover their confidence at Tottenham,” the head coach said. “When you finish the season in seventh, for sure the confidence is not up. This is another aspect we’re working on – to improve [players’] confidence."" Conte added: “[In Steven] we're talking about a player that has important skills. It was a pity for me – but not the [Dutch] national team, because he scored in qualifying – because I would have liked to have him during the two weeks of the international break to work with him and know him much better. “But for sure he has great quality. He's good one-v-one, he's fast, he can beat a man and also score. He's understanding what I want from him. Tonight, he’s ready and available – and I’m counting on him.” Kane has started all four matches under Conte, including the embarrassing defeat to NS Mura last week, and he was named in the XI for Sunday’s postponed visit to Burnley. Getting the best out of the England captain remains one of Conte’s most pressing challenges, with Kane still having scored just once in 11 League appearances. Conte, though, has no doubts about Kane’s enduring quality and says he has only been able to truly appreciate his “level” since working with him at close quarters. “We have a world-class striker as a No9 in Harry and I am very delighted to have the opportunity to work with him because many times you make an evaluation [of a player from] outside [the club],” Conte said. “But only when the coach has the possibility to train players, do you understand their level. With Harry, I was enthusiastic to see him in the way that he works every day and the commitment, heart and passion that he puts into Tottenham. It was not a surprise but when you arrive you do not know what you find. And I found this.” Conte will be without Argentine pair Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso against the Bees, and could name the same XI which was due to start at Burnley before snow forced an 11th-hour delay.

157,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive

Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning.

Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings.

Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month.

But Arsenal responded to the pressure with a third consecutive victory to give them the edge in what has become a two-horse race for fourth place. After a cagey opening to the contest in which Arsenal enjoyed most of the possession, Rob Holding gave the visitors the lead with a glancing header from a 38th-minute corner. SPONSORED West Ham levelled on the stroke of halftime, however, with Jarrod Bowen’s shot taking a deflection to beat Aaron Ramsdale who moments earlier had saved well from Declan Rice. Gabriel ensured Arsenal remained in the driving seat for a long-awaited return to the Champions League although, with a north London derby still to come, the race is far from over.

A dull game has burst into life. 44:00 - Coufal finds himself in all sorts of space, squaring to Bowen, whose improvised finish hits Gabriel and goes past Ramsdale. David Moyes won’t be happy to concede a goal like that from a set-piece. Not great marking from West Ham, with Holding shrugging off Lanzini. 40:00 - A HUGE save from Ramsdale as Rice’s near-post header from the corner crashes in at him from close-range. 38:00 - From the resulting corner, Holding hits a towering header from Saka’s corner! His first ever Premier League goal. 37:00 - Nketihah with a driving run with West Ham slightly exposed, draws a smart save from Fabianski down to his right. 33:00 - Rice has a shot after a driving run but Ramsdale saves easily. 32:00 - Not much in the way of quality from Arsenal at the moment but Saka has done well to beat Fredericks in a number of 1v1s.

Richarlison goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","verton vs Chelsea FC LIVE! Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors. The Toffees do lead four shots to three however, and they also boast the only one shot on target from either side. Chelsea lead three to two on bookings. ",positive

Easy decision. 55 mins: First Tottenham change of the match. Kulusevski on to replace Moura. If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu.

A move down the left led to the Welshman sweeping past Joe Hart yet Celtic hit back almost instantly. Tom Rogic made hay after Allan McGregor weakly parried Reo Hatate’s drive from outside the box, to slot home and bring the teams level after only six minutes. The first-half continued to edge towards the visitors’ favour and they deservedly led when Cameron Carter-Vickers fired a set-piece move home on the verge of the break.

Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner. Not a huge amount of space on offer for either side though. As it stands, it’s a point that Celtic will be more than happy with. 78 mins: Yellow card starting to put a serious shift in. Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too.

Might be time for a rethink. 38 mins: Free-kick Rangers, as Kent wins a cheap foul for his side. Barisic swings it in, Goldson can’t quite up enough and Celtic flick it away. Comes back into the box, Rangers have their first corner of the match. Tavernier over to take it. It goes absolutely miles into the air, Goldson wins the initial header but comes to nothing. Back out to Tavenier, he’ll have another go! 36 mins: Ralston and Barisic slide in together... Celtic want a corner, Rangers want a goal-kick. Rangers get their wish, much to the frustration of those around Celtic Park. 34 mins: Taylor bombs forward on the overlap and it gets played into him. Whips the cross in, over everyone and out for a throw-in on the other side of the pitch. Maeda would have needed to be ten times as tall to get on the end of that. 31 mins: More good work from Jota to skip away from Tavernier and he can drive into the box. Tries to cut inside onto his right foot, Tavernier gets back and leans into the Celtic man. Jota wants a penalty, never getting it. Celtic swiftly back on the attack though, lifted over the top and Jota heads over the bar. Real chance. 28 mins: Barisic gets away from his man, only to then be clattered by Carter-Vickers. Had to get that right. McGregor lunges in inside the box too... brief appeals for a penalty but there’s no real contact. 26 mins: Rangers still happy to sit off then Celtic have the ball. Haven’t started pressing more since going behind. Bad news for Rangers fans - Celtic haven’t lost any of the last 96 league matches in which they’ve scored first. 23 mins: No surprise that the atmosphere has gone up another level after that goal. Home fans know just how big that goal could be. Barisic sends the ball straight out of play as he looks to flick it to Kent. Rangers got to get themselves back together. CELTIC TAKE THE LEAD! They’ve taken a huge step towards the title! Taylor plays the pass into Maeda and he can turn in the box. Works the space to beat Goldson, fires the cross low into the back post and Jota gets there ahead of Barisic to turn into an empty net. 18 mins: Ball worked out to Maeda, but he’s offside. Met with groans around the ground. Visitors probably just about on top so far. Lundstram has made a great start, he’s set his side away on the counter a couple of times. ",positive

The fact Giovanni van Bronckhorst has continued the kind of European coups Steven Gerrard managed to pull off during his time at the club has probably saved him from further league scrutiny. Still, there remains a slight hope of overtaking Celtic in the Scottish Premiership before Sunday’s Old Firm and a positive result in Germany this evening would move to take the pressure off that game. Leipzig, however, look a level above anything Rangers have faced before in this campaign.

Pep Guardiola’s side scored four – and it is no exaggeration to say they could and should have doubled that figure. Real, meanwhile, largely made the most of their chances to stay in touching distance when humiliation, at times, felt inevitable, but may yet regret David Alaba heading wide from close range in the first half. A 4-3 scoreline means this semi-final is deliciously poised for the second leg and next week cannot come soon enough. If both sides approach it in the same manner, then another goal-fest is on the cards at the Bernabeu, but it is hard to imagine either manager being content to play with such abandon in Madrid. For Real’s part, it felt like they were helpless to stop City in full flow, particularly in the opening periods of each half. Guardiola, however, will know his side were guilty of creating many of their own problems – failing to kill off their opponents when in total control – and repeatedly handing them lifelines. Aymeric Laporte’s handball in the box late on means City head to Spain with the slenderest of leads, with the irrepressible Karim Benzema taking an 82nd-minute Panenka penalty to complete the scoring on the night. The veteran Frenchman continues to find new levels and as long as he is in this Real side, along with Luka Modric, no amount of adversity is enough to see them crumble. The Spanish giants looked to have met their match when City started at break-neck speed, raced to a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes and threatened to kill the tie before the half-hour mark. Kevin de Bruyne stooped to head his side in front after just two minutes, with Real yet to get out of their own half. Then he turned provider, playing in Gabriel Jesus in the box, who spun Alaba with ease and swept home from close range. Real looked shell-shocked – and it could have been so much worse when Riyad Mahrez fired into the side netting when he should have crossed, before Phil Foden fired narrowly wide with Thibaut Courtois to beat. Given the pattern of the match, few could have predicted City would come to count the cost of those wasted chances. But there were small signs of Real’s threat each time Benzema and Modric got on the ball to ease that sense of panic and break City’s dominance. Vinicius Junior also showed glimpses of what was to come in those moments, targeting John Stones, who was playing out of position at right back, with doubts about his fitness. Alaba’s missed header was a sign of Real’s growing threat and it was Benzema who fired his side back into the match with a typically deadly strike from just inside the box, taking Ferland Mendy’s cross in his stride. Mahrez had another chance to extend City’s lead straight after the break when racing through one-on-one with Courtois, but hit the post. From the rebound, Foden’s effort was cleared off the line by Dani Carvajal. But the England international restored the two-goal advantage when Fernandinho, who had come on for Stones, burst down the right and crossed for him to head home from inside the six-yard box. Two minutes later and Fernandinho turned villain when left standing by Vinicius on the halfway line. The Brazilian winger ran all the way into the City box before sliding a shot past Ederson on the angle. The home side could not get close to him and increasingly Real looked in his direction to do damage, but instead went two behind again when Bernardo Silva blasted into the top corner in the 74th minute. Real’s defenders had stopped when expecting referee Istvan Kovacs to give a foul on the edge of the box as Toni Kroos took out Oleks Zinchenko. City played on and Bernardo took full advantage of the advantage. Just when it looked like Guardiola would head to Madrid with a two-goal cushion, there was time for one more twist, with Laporte handling and Benzema capitalising. There were still chances for City to restore their advantage, but the finely-poised nature of this tie only adds to the anticipation ahead of their next meeting - when nothing can be ruled out.

Manchester City claimed a slender advantage in their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid after a dramatic 4-3 victory at the Etihad Stadium. The Premier League leaders raced into a 2-0 lead in a pulsating first-leg encounter with goals from the irrepressible Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus in the first 11 minutes. Real responded through the prolific Karim Benzema before Phil Foden and Vinicius Junior traded goals early in the second half. Bernardo Silva gave City a two-goal advantage but Benzema scored a cheeky penalty - his 41st goal of the season in as many appearances - to cut the deficit once again. Both sides spurned numerous other chances in a compelling and breathless clash that set the stage for a fascinating second leg next week. City may regret not making the most of a number of early opportunities as they stormed out of the blocks. They could almost have put the tie out of sight in the opening half-hour but Real, after fine comebacks against Paris St Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds, fought back again. Manchester City have a narrow lead at the halfway stage of their Champions League semi-final tie against Real Madrid after a thrilling 4-3 win at the Etihad. In an astonishing European match, City took a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes as Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne got them off to a flying start. Karim Benzema notched his 40th goal of the season though, completely against the run of play, to halve the deficit. Phil Foden extended the lead shortly after the break, only for Vinicius Junior to respond almost immediately with a brilliant solo effort. Bernardo Silva lashed home from the edge of the box to make it 4-2, but there was still time for Benzema to step up to the spot and dispatch an impudent panenka.

Click here for James Robson’s full match analysis Somewhat deflated tone from Guardiola, despite his side taking a narrow lead to Madrid. He knows it could have been so much better. Simple message from Guardiola: “We’re going to Madrid to win the game.” Wouldn’t back against them pulling it off. For all Real took advantage of their chances, City could have scored four or five in that first-half. City will be very confident of getting on the scoresheet at the Bernabeu. Kevin de Bruyne 9 Some absolutely vintage football from him as City threatened to run away with it early on. Opened the scoring and then set up Jesus for the second. Foden should have taken advantage of another opening he created, all before half time. Bernardo Silva 8 Picked up spaces that dragged Real around the pitch and further opened them up with his darting movement. No better demonstrated than by his wonderful goal. Phil Foden 9 Scored one and might have had two more. Some absolutely sumptuous touches had Real players chasing shadows. Pure class. James Robson was at the Etihad to rate the City players Bernardo Silva is focusing on the positive despite the obvious frustrations, with City still in a good position going into next week’s second leg in Madrid. “I honestly think for the first 20 minutes we were so, so good,” Silva said. “The way we pressed, the way we controlled the game and created chances. Over the 90 minutes it felt like we could have won by a better score. “Unfortunately we were not able to take advantage of our two-goal differences that we had three times. It is the Champions League, we play one of the best teams in the world. It is still a good result. On to the next game. “It was a good game. Our fans should be proud of us and the work we did.

On three occasions City had a two-goal advantage at the Etihad, but a Karim Benzema-inspired Real kept themselves in it despite Pep Guardiola’s side earning a thrilling 4-3 win. Foden was on target in the second-half to make it 3-1 to the home side, only for Vinicius Junior to halve the deficit less than two minutes later, and it’s a result that Real will be relieved with going into next week’s match in Madrid. “For the fans watching it was obviously a great game of football,” Foden told BT Sport. “We are playing a side that have won the Champions League many times and if we give the ball away they are going to punish us. It is something we need to work on in the second leg. The tie is still on. “It was a great game. End to end. We started really well and could have killed them off. In these games, we need to take more chances.” Bernardo Silva lashed home from the edge of the box with 15 minutes remaining as City moved 4-2 ahead, but once again they were pegged back as Benzema stepped up to the penalty spot and dinked a perfect panenka down the middle. It all came after a sensational start from City, that saw them take a 2-0 lead with barely more than ten minutes on the clock thanks to Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus. Silva wanted to focus on the positives, of which there were plenty for City. “I honestly think for the first 20 minutes we were so, so good,” Silva said. “The way we pressed, the way we controlled the game and created chances.

Here’s how <em>Carlo Ancelotti</em>’s side rated at the Etihad... Thibaut Courtois 5 Hardly to blame for any of the first three goals but did not exactly infuse a ragged backline with calmness either. Seemed to switch off expecting a City free-kick when beaten at near post for fourth. Dani Carvajal 5 A real mixed bag. Made important interception on stroke of half-time and in clearing Foden effort off line, but caught napping at back post for at least two of City’s goals. Eder Militao 4 Given the runaround by countryman Jesus and sucked across to him when caught under Fernandinho’s cross for Foden goal. The centrepiece of a backline that looked vulnerable throughout. David Alaba 3 Defied fitness doubt to start but poor decision allowed Jesus to spin him for the second in uncharacteristically frantic display. Did not make it back out after half-time. Ferland Mendy 5 Got an assist for a fairly average cross thanks to Benzema’s brilliance but won’t be happy to have been skinned by 36-year-old Fernandinho for Foden goal. Toni Kroos 5 Might’ve intercepted De Bruyne cross that led to second goal. Lack of mobility exposed at base of midfield without Casemiro holding the fort. Luka Modric 7 Outshone creatively by De Bruyne but won crucial 50/50 in build-up to Benzema goal and still managed to show class. Influence, as against Chelsea, seemed to be growing in second half but replaced soon after fourth City goal. Fede Valverde 5 Dropped into midfield with Casemiro out but within two minutes the Brazilian’s absence was felt as he failed to go with De Bruyne’s run. Supposed to provide legs alongside the two veterans but faced an impossible task against City’s collection of energetic wizards. Rodrygo 5 Anonymous until testing Ederson from tight angle in flurry after Benzema goal. Improved after the break before being subbed with 20 minutes to play as Carlo Ancelotti sought so shore things up. Vinicius Jr. 7 Failed to punish City sloppiness in possession at the back on more than one occasion but came alive when realising Fernandinho mismatch and scored brilliant solo goal after trickery on halfway. Karim Benzema 8 First goal gave Madrid a foothold when they were threatening to be blown away and summed him up: half-a-chance wonderfully put away with a finish few could have executed. Panenka for the second was outrageously cool in circumstances. Substitutes Nacho (Alaba 46’) 6 Replaced an out-of-sorts Alaba and did fine. Eduardo Camavinga (Rodrygo 70’) 5 Sent on to reinforce midfield as Ancelotti seemed to accept a one-goal deficit as a good result but was another whose failure to play to whistle contributed to Bernardo strike. Dani Ceballos (Modric 79’) Marco Asensio (Vincius 88’) Unused: Lunin, Fuidias, Vallejo, Marcelo, Casemiro, Isco, Vasquez, Bale ",positive
