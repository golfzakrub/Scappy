The England international scored his ninth goal of the season in Villa's 2-0 win over Norwich City at the weekend. The result relegated the Canaries and the striker's former head coach Dean Smith, but the 51-year-old will be proud of Watkins as he continues to make an impact at the highest level. Smith recruited Watkins for Brentford and later Villa, as he broke the club's transfer record to bring the versatile forward to Villa Park for £30million two summers ago. And since Watkins made his Premier League debut, only three strikers have scored more Premier League goals than him. READ MORE: The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort READ MORE: Dean Smith pinpoints Aston Villa weakness Steven Gerrard must take note of Only Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Diogo Jota can eclipse Watkins' 23-goal haul since the start of the last Premier League campaign. The 24-year-old scored 14 goals in the Premier League last season and earned himself a call-up to the England national team in March 2021. After scoring against San Marino on his Three Lions debut, he was handed four more caps, but wasn't picked for England November internationals. Speaking in December, Steven Gerrard claimed that the Villa forward could force his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans before the 2022 World Cup. ""It’s been a pleasure to work with him and I’m looking forward to the future. I’m delighted to have him here,"" Gerrard said. ""Ollie has just got to be the best he can be for Aston Villa and I’m sure that will be enough for him to get back in the England squad and I’m sure Gareth Southgate will be watching him closely. But the best thing you can do to get into England squads is to be consistent and do your stuff for your club, and Ollie is certainly doing that."" Villa head coach Gerrard was also certain that Watkins would thrive in his system. He said: ""I don’t think there is a limit for Ollie. ""He’s got the lot – pace, power, aggression. He will grow, he will enjoy the style we play so there isn’t a ceiling for him."" And Gerrard was proven right as Southgate turned to Watkins in the March internationals when Tammy Abraham was ruled out of the squad due to injury. Watkins played one minute of the game against Switzerland, before he was handed a start against Ivory Coast in the second fixture of the break. He scored his second goal for the Three Lions against Ivory Coast and has since played with a spring in his step for Villa. Despite Gerrard's side being on a tough run of form, Watkins has impressed in the past month or so, netting two goals in four games. He is now aiming to get at least his 10th goal of the season with a double header Burnley, two games against title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City and a game against Crystal Palace all to come this month.

Trevor Francis liked a double arm lift, Christophe Dugarry was a kiss blower and few smiles will ever be as broad as Kevin Phillips’. But for all their grandeur they weren’t legendary celebrators, indeed Mikael Forssell was decidedly understated. When players get it right the celebration can be more memorable than the goal itself, though in truth the it’s a heady cocktail of circumstance and quality which stick in the mind. So we at BirminghamLive have had a go at picking the best goal celebrations in Birmingham City history. They’ve not all derby related honestly but this one takes the Audience Participation award. No sooner had Zigic spooned home the winner and lolloped off to the Tilton, than he was wrestled down in a headlock by Craig Gardner. Seb Larsson arrived on the scene booted the advertising hoardings and then the substitutes started a pile on, finished by an exuberant supporter as the cherry on top. READ: 'In tears' - The day The Saviour rescued Birmingham City READ: Berahino, Mousset, Ladapo - Free agent strikers Birmingham City could sign for nothing this summer Not a goal celebration but one of the most memorable reactions to a final whistle. Redknapp had steered Blues to safety on the final day with a victory at Bristol City. Fans cavorted in the away end for several minutes when Harry was drawn like a moth to the flame, out came the scarf, the fist pumped and he was suddenly 50 years younger. Those scenes tempted him out of semi-retirement. The midfielder cracked home an equaliser in front of the Tilton and flew up the sideline bellowing defiance. As he got closer to the Villa supporters off came the shirt and the enviable torso rippled. It just about trumped the wagging finger at Wolves a couple of seasons later. Barry Fry took his Blues team to the Terriers on the final day of the 1994/95 season knowing a win would put them back in the second tier. With his back to goal ten yards out Claridge spun and somehow rammed the ball past the entire home defence and set off behind the goal in whirl of arms and legs, similar to the way an octopus would attack the Can-Can. Thankfully he was engulfed by supporters before further embarrassment ensued. The youngster lasered in a daisy-cutter from 20 yards, a goal which was enough to put Chris Hughton’s Blues in the Championship play-offs. He then glided towards the visiting supporters and gave it the old snake-hips routine before being engulfed by team-mates. The boy could move. Clinton hooked it goalwards, Sorensen made a mess and off the Londoner went, fingers planted on lips with the other hand pointing at anyone who’d catch his eye, ending in a good old chest-beat Blues were still fuming about the career threatening injury Kevan Broadhurst had suffered at Villa Park earlier that season. They exacted retribution a few months later with a 2-1 victory sealed by Howard Gayle who raced away from the visitors’ defence and stroked home the decisive goal. He then leaped over the hoardings, climbed the fences and stood there, Messianic-like holding on with one hand, pumping the other as Bluenoses celebrated beneath him. What an image. As soon as Ricky Otto’s cross brushed off Tait’s floppy hair and into the Carlisle net Wembley erupted. It was the most golden of goals. And the celebration was even more memorable. The midfielder turned left and went off to the stands in search of the friends old and new. The shirt was ripped off to reveal the legend suggesting toilet-related activities in relation to Blues’ local rivals. Eight years ago today. Obviously the goal meant everything, it saved Blues from relegation. But it’s the scenes it sparked which stand out. In went the ball, out came the pasty Scottish complexion and round and round and round went the shirt as Caddis headed up the touchline and off towards Darren Randolph. Seconds later Lee Clark was haring in the other direction and throwing himself into the crowd. Stern John at Millwall in the play-off semi-finals gets an honourable mention in the shirt swinging category. Who put the ball in Arsenal’s net? Who gave Blues fans the proudest day in club history? Oba-Obafem, Obafemi Martens. He swept the ball into the empty goal, shrugged off Nikola Zigic, zigzagged away from his team-mates then flew into a triple flik-flak as Bluenoses kicked down the gates of heaven. A stunning celebration to go with a simple goal. ",positive

The 23-year-old is far from unfamiliar with such a position after featuring in the role during the run-in of Albion 's promotion campaign under Slaven Bilic and also previously been used by Bruce there earlier in the season. O'Shea 's first two starts since returning from a fractured ankle were in the role too, in back-to-back late February defeats to Middlesbrough and Swansea City. During the latter of those two, the Republic of Ireland international was substituted for Darnell Furlong and didn't feature in the first team in six of the next seven as West Brom reverted to a back three, leaving O'Shea on the substitutes bench. The 1-0 win at Reading was the first foray as a full-back in over two months. READ: West Brom strikers sent clear Steve Bruce message after Andy Carroll decision READ: Steve Bruce admits West Brom 'mistake' as Reading switch offers food for thought That absence is not deemed as a reflection of the defender's ability to fulfil the responsibilities required in such a role, though, with Bruce happy to have O'Shea as an option in an area lacking in depth. “I believe he can play there comfortably,” the Albion boss said. “I think he struggled (against Middlesbrough and Swansea) because they were the first games he had played in six months. I take the responsibility of playing him there when I probably needed to play him at centre-back to ease him back in, but I’ve got no problem with him playing right-back. “But therein lies the problem with the squad. We’ve got one recognised right-back in (Darnell) Furlong and one recognised left-back in (Conor) Townsend. That’s the imbalance of the squad and what we’ve got to put right.” ",positive

An instant return to the Premier League was on the agenda in pre-season, but instead they have fallen well short of even making the play-offs. It is not what the Baggies faithful had in mind when they returned to the second tier. This is the first full campaign since fans have been allowed to attend games since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. While this term has not been what supporters expected, it has at least given them the opportunity to cheer on, or vent their frustration with, their team. CHANGE: West Brom chief set to leave for Championship rivals next month TRANSFERS: West Brom boss confirms major Carroll decision ahead of summer transfer window Attendances have unquestionably been down, not just at Albion but throughout the Championship, due to the cost of living crisis and concerns over Covid-19, while West Brom 's inconsistent form also hasn't been an attraction to the average punter. That said, the club still have the fourth-highest crowds in the entire division. According to Transfermarkt, the Hawthorns had an average gate of 22,222 across the 22 Championship games it has so far hosted, which represents a 7.6 percent drop on the 2019/20 campaign. There are caveats to that figure because the Baggies publish tickets sold, as opposed to bums on the seats in attendance, but that is also the case across the league. As you can see below, with the exception of Middlesbrough, and Coventry - having been in League One and playing at St Andrew's - all of the second tier's 10 most attended stadiums suffered declines in attendance; although Sheffield United were a Premier League side in 2019/20. It should also be added that half the league still have one remaining home fixture to play this Saturday which could slightly alter figures. Focus will now turn to the summer transfer window and next season, where improved performance on the field could lead to more bums on seats. Average attendance | +/- on 2019/20 season 1.

The 20-year-old is the latest youngster to break into Villa's first-team ranks and cement his place in the starting XI. Ramsey has enjoyed an exceptional Premier League campaign following on from his breakthrough season last term. He has made 31 league appearances for Villa this season and has started all but one of Steven Gerrard's first 22 games in charge of the club.

As a product of the Villa academy, the midfielder has been with the club since the age of six and progressed through the ranks. And when asked how much of a lift it gives him when supporters are chanting his name, Ramsey replied: ""Obviously being a local lad, I’ve been going to Villa Park since I was the age of eight now. ""I know what it’s like to sing those songs, when I was singing about Jack (Grealish), so now for the fans to sing it about me, it gives me a real buzz to go out and play. I think especially in front of my friends and family to hear the fans singing my name, it’s a good feeling."" Speaking of Ramsey, Villa boss Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""I've been very aware of the Ramseys because of how well this club did in the Youth Cup. They obviously played Liverpool in the final and I was aware of the commentators speaking of the Ramsey brothers, also the Carneys (Chukwuemeka) and Tims (Iroegbunam), those around the game. ""It probably wasn't until Arsenal away where he curled one into the top corner. I really liked the technique of that goal. I think that was the moment where I thought, 'Ooh!' ""To score a goal like that, in an environment like that at Arsenal at that age, that is normally a moment, being a lover of the game, where it makes you think, 'Hang on a minute, this kid might be a player!' ""Then, obviously Dean (Smith) played him some more before I arrived but it's not until you get up close and personal with someone on the training pitch and you see his level and potential, you see the human being... That's when you get really excited about the talent. ""I've said it quite a bit. I don't want to keep talking JJ up. I want him to play his football and to protect him and manage him in the best possible way but, without a doubt, he's someone I want to build around this club moving forward."" ",positive

This year’s Community Shield won’t feature Villa after Steven Gerrard's side were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round, and they are of course not in the hunt for the Premier League title. But the club still could be involved in the final with Villa Park potentially being the host venue. The match is scheduled for July 31, but that means Wembley Stadium will be unavailable due to hosting the women’s European final being played on the same day. According to the  Daily Mail , Elland Road, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and Villa Park, which was selected as the venue in 2012, are all 'interested' in hosting.

The final will take place between the FA Cup winners, Liverpool or Chelsea, and the Premier League champions, Liverpool or Man City. If Liverpool win both competitions, then Jurgen Klopp’s team will play second placed Man City. The news comes as the club are due to press ahead with their plans to increase Villa Park's capacity from 42,785 to above 55,000.

After Norwich City lost 2-0 to Aston Villa and Burnley beat fellow strugglers Watford, the Premier League's bottom side were relegated with four games left of the season. Ollie Watkins scored the opener in the first half, before Danny Ings netted his sixth goal for the campaign in second half additional time. The result means former Villa boss Smith will now turn his attentions to getting the Canaries back up and out of the Championship next season. But he was frustrated with his side's mistakes against Villa at the weekend after claiming there was a sense of inevitability about the club's relegation in the end.

""I thought we done it really well in the first half, Pierre [Lees-Melou] had a really good chance when he really should have done better. I thought we controlled the football for long periods of the game as well. As I say, a slip has cost us.""

7,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-aston-villa-squad-issues-23838431,The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort,"Aston Villa are set for another busy transfer window this summer with plenty of outgoings and several incomings expected. Steven Gerrard will be backed in the market with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens hoping the club can challenge for European football next season. Following a positive January window where the club signed Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne and Calum Chambers, the Villa boss wants to add more quality to improve his starting XI. A holding midfielder and more defensive reinforcements are at the top of Gerrard's wish list, while Villa will also target more attacking talent, according to reports. Here are five issues that the Villa head coach must sort this summer. READ MORE: Fresh Carney Chukwuemeka transfer claims emerge amid Aston Villa uncertainty READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer WHO WEARS THE ARMBAND? One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things."" READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer priority READ MORE: Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season CONTRACT DILEMMAS Carney Chukwuemeka is no closer to signing a new contract with Villa, while Douglas Luiz is also yet to pen fresh terms and could leave the club this summer. Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will."" ",positive

Suarez, 35, will be assessing his options ahead of the upcoming window as his contract at Atletico Madrid looks set to expire. Villa as well as Palmeiras, Corinthians and Atlético Mineiro have been linked with a move for the Uruguayan but journalist Gerard Romero, who is based in Barcelona, claims the striker has rejected the offers from these clubs in favour of focusing on the proposal from Villa. Here is what fans have had to say on the potential deal: READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer wish revealed READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer Mark Ashton : I’m Liverpool through and through but I would love to see Suarez at Villa, awesome player and honestly I think he would be great for them, to be honest would love him back at Liverpool for a season or two. Stuart Perry: Still a great player. Look forward to seeing him at Villa. I first watched him with Ajax in the Netherlands. Peter Whitehouse: His best days are behind him but he’s still a fantastic player now. He’s played for top clubs all around the world and internationally at top tournaments. He does have a nasty side yes but it is needed to be a success in the sport at the top level. The fact that he has played with Gerrard before at Liverpool could be the swaying factor in this proposed deal like it was with Coutinho. Richard Arth Harding: This would be a very good signing. William Stoker-Little : No thanks lol. Harry Spruce: Gerrard’s is properly getting the band back together haha. Mark Cross : Yes please. Ken Lewis: Dreadful signing. Caine Pickering : No thank you.

The 24-year-old has been in terrific form since joining the Scottish outfit on loan at the beginning of the season. He has netted eight goals in all competitions in 30 appearances while also pitching in with assists at key moments. At the club's end-of-year awards ceremony, Ronan picked up the player of the year and social media player of the year gongs for his consistently splendid performances from midfield. He also grabbed the goal of the year award for his sensational long range strike against Hearts in the Scottish Cup in March. TALKING POINTS: Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat REACTION: Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat Saints manager Stephen Robinson has said that he would like to keep Ronan at the club, but he faces competition for the Wolves player's signature. Two other Scottish clubs are said to be interested. Aberdeen have been linked with a move after boss Jim Goodwin signed Ronan while he was still at the club. He has said that ""it is obvious"" that a reunion would be mooted given their familiarity with each other. Hearts also have the player in their sights after seeing what he can do in the Scottish Premiership. The Jambos could entice the player with the promise of European football next season. A surprising name has also been thrown into the mix in the past month, with St. Pauli believed to be interested in signing him. The German outfit are in the hunt for promotion from the second tier and the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga could be too good for Ronan to turn down. ",positive
11,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-shortlist-fulfil-steven-23843979,Aston Villa shortlist to fulfil Steven Gerrard's biggest summer transfer priority,"Ahead of his first summer in charge of Aston Villa, Steven Gerrard has revealed his biggest priority as we approach the transfer window, which could be fulfilled by any of these four targets. Villa were linked with midfielders such as Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in the January window but a move failed to materialise. Moving into the summer, Gerrard has outlined the priority for his recruitment team as he looks to bolster the midfield options within his squad, as he aims to sign a player capable of playing as a 'number six' this summer. Speaking on the impact a signing such as this could have on current Villa midfielder John McGinn, Gerrard stated: ""John likes to be a bit more of a free spirit. But it was a priority in the last window to make a six happen but we couldn’t possibly do that, it wasn’t right, the timing wasn’t right. READ MORE:   Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer ""So we have to be patient for the right thing in the long run. But with different personnel around John we’re hoping to give him some more freedom."" A player ahead of the defence to offer both an added layer of security but also help progress the team is clearly at the top of the list for Gerrard, so here is four players he could sign to fill this void in the squad: Boubacar Kamara Christian Purslow (chief executive), Johan Lange (sporting director) and Gerrard himself were all present for Olympique de Marseille's fixture against Nantes recently to watch the Boubacar Kamara, who will be out of contract come the end of the season. The 22-year-old offers the composure, defensive instinct and reading of the game to perfectly orchestrate and solidify the midfielder for Gerrard's side. However, the club will likely face a line of competitors queuing up to secure his long-term future this summer given his talents. Christian Norgaard No player across Europe's top five leagues has made more tackles than Brentford's Christian Norgaard (121), with the player also ranking sixth in midfield pressures (349). He clearly offers a reinforcement defensively but can also be relied upon to progress the team forward with just under five progressive passes per game averaged. Villa have dealt with Brentford before whilst bringing Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa to the club and could look to delve into their pool of talent once again here to sign the 28-year-old Danish international. Kalvin Phillips The 26-year-old England international is valued at around £60 million by Leeds United and it comes as no surprise given the services he offers within the midfield. Both Villa and Manchester United have been credited with an interest in the player but could see the price tag drastically reduced if Leeds do drop into the Championship this summer, given the likelihood that Phillips would actively pursue a move away from the club if they did drop into the second tier of English football. Phillips ranks in the top one percent of midfielder across Europe's top five leagues for pressures (30) and the top three percent for blocks (2.5) and tackles (3.8), outlining the clear benefit signing him would have on Gerrard's current midfield. Wilfred Ndidi In terms of players who would anchor the midfield and allow the talent to thrive around him, it would be hard to find someone better suited to the role than Leicester City's Wilfred Ndidi. The 25-year-old Nigerian midfielder ranks in the top ten percent for aerials won (2.6) per game, clearances (3.4), interceptions (2.7) and tackles (4.2) across Europe and Villa would have to pay a price in the region of £50 million if they were to acquire a player of this calibre. Commenting on the rumours linking him with a move in the summer, Ndidi stated: “At the moment I am enjoying myself in Leicester,"" he replied. My family is here. My business degree is on hold. There was lockdown and then my daughter was born. I am looking forward to it maybe next year.” ",positive

Bailey has been unable to put a run of more than seven consecutive appearances together in the Premier League since his £30 million arrival from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer. The Jamaica international came off five minutes before half-time of the 2-0 defeat of Norwich City at Villa Park on Saturday with an ankle injury. Bailey was making his seventh straight appearance for Villa and was doing well until he had to be replaced by Danny Ings shortly before the interval. Bailey has struggled to make his mark at Villa with the 24 year-old arriving at Villa without a full pre-season and once he scored his first goal for the club against Everton in September, he picked up a quad injury.

Bailey has, on occasion, shown glimpses of his obvious talent and a proper pre-season will allow him to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League. Villa boss Steven Gerrard rates him highly and was disappointed to see him come off injured. ""It's an ankle issue,"" Gerrard said after the Norwich game. ""In terms of the extent and the damage I’m sure he’ll be MRI scanned in the next 24 to 48 hours. ""I'm really disappointed and frustrated for him because he's worked really hard to get back, he's been training ever so well. ""We wanted to give him another opportunity off the back of Leicester City to really try and keep him in the rhythm. ""You see how he started the game he nearly scores with a fantastic effort and a top save from Tim Krul and not too far after that he's got to come off the pitch. ""He's frustrated, we're frustrated and I'm sure the supporters are as well and he said there was a bit of a twist after the contact so we'll get him looked at. ""He's obviously going to be a major doubt for the next game against Burnley because it's very rare that you come off the pitch and you’re available for the next game, so we are concerned about it."" Bailey himself took to Instagram on Sunday to share a picture of himself in action during the game with a blue love heart emoji as the caption. His fans and Villa supporters piled into the comments section with messages of support for the winger, with his photo alone garnering nearly 19,000 likes. ",positive

And whether it is a shining example of everything a football ground should be or a right dump doesn’t matter. After all, it is our dump and that’s what counts. Of course, Blues fans have something of a love-hate relationship with St Andrew’s for a while now, or at least with those people tasked with keeping the famous old ground in reasonably decent nick. Blues have been operating at a reduced capacity for the whole of the 2021/2022 campaign, with the ground requiring expensive remedial works. But whatever the rights and wrongs behind the problems at St Andrew’s, it remains the their spiritual home and means just as much to most supporters as the swankiest of big-money stadiums at the likes of Spurs and Arsenal. READ MORE: 'We're happy' - Manager addresses striker future amid Birmingham City links READ MORE: Birmingham City fans left baffled by 'update on update we are waiting for' on St Andrew's safety work But then there are those other grounds we have a hankering for - those of footballing foes which spark warm feelings because of a brilliant victory there or a favourite incident, the culmination of a promotion success or huge cup upset. These days, as more and more modern stadia spring up across the country, another category of favourite springs to mind - those old-fashioned grounds that help carry us back to another era, complete with towering stands, hostile crowds thrust right to the edge of the pitch and the brilliant atmospheres that football should be all about. So, our question to you is what are you favourite football grounds and which are the ones you loathe? For Blues fans, St Andrew’s is always going to be the beating heart, even if two of those heart chambers aren’t even functioning at present. The reopening of the lower tiers in the Kop and Tilton stands cannot come quickly enough because something needs to be done about the atmosphere. But where else do Blues fans feel ‘at home’? Blues writer Brian Dick says: “The recent trip to Blackpool, a sunny Easter weekend by the seaside, was a real opportunity for 3,500 supporters to let their hair down. Unfortunately the team let them down too. “The biennial trips to yo-yo club Fulham are always fun, Blues take a huge following and pack out the away end. Crossing the city to the other place is always something to look forward to. Derby away is always, always eventful.” So they are the good grounds, but what of the ones Blues fans dislike? Brian adds: “In terms of stadiums Blues fans loathe, it depends to be more a personal thing. Reading away is pretty soulless, matches tend to be midweek 8pm kick-offs in a half empty gr0und. “Blackburn’s Ewood Park is always cold and Hull is a long journey, there’s nothing remarkable about the ground and results are always terrible. Elsewhere, West Ham’s London Stadium isn’t really fit for purpose as a football venue.” Now it's time for you say. If the survey below doesn't load, click here.

King has spent five years at The Hawthorns since arriving at the club from Hull City in February 2017 but is believed to be serving a notice period ahead of joining the Championship rival next month. Stoke have been rearranging the structure of their hierarchy in recent months following the departure of long-time chief executive Tony Scholes to the Premier League.

The England international scored his ninth goal of the season in Villa's 2-0 win over Norwich City at the weekend. The result relegated the Canaries and the striker's former head coach Dean Smith, but the 51-year-old will be proud of Watkins as he continues to make an impact at the highest level. Smith recruited Watkins for Brentford and later Villa, as he broke the club's transfer record to bring the versatile forward to Villa Park for £30million two summers ago. And since Watkins made his Premier League debut, only three strikers have scored more Premier League goals than him. READ MORE: The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort READ MORE: Dean Smith pinpoints Aston Villa weakness Steven Gerrard must take note of Only Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Diogo Jota can eclipse Watkins' 23-goal haul since the start of the last Premier League campaign.

After scoring against San Marino on his Three Lions debut, he was handed four more caps, but wasn't picked for England November internationals. Speaking in December, Steven Gerrard claimed that the Villa forward could force his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans before the 2022 World Cup. ""It’s been a pleasure to work with him and I’m looking forward to the future. I’m delighted to have him here,"" Gerrard said. ""Ollie has just got to be the best he can be for Aston Villa and I’m sure that will be enough for him to get back in the England squad and I’m sure Gareth Southgate will be watching him closely. But the best thing you can do to get into England squads is to be consistent and do your stuff for your club, and Ollie is certainly doing that."" Villa head coach Gerrard was also certain that Watkins would thrive in his system. He said: ""I don’t think there is a limit for Ollie. ""He’s got the lot – pace, power, aggression. He will grow, he will enjoy the style we play so there isn’t a ceiling for him."" And Gerrard was proven right as Southgate turned to Watkins in the March internationals when Tammy Abraham was ruled out of the squad due to injury. Watkins played one minute of the game against Switzerland, before he was handed a start against Ivory Coast in the second fixture of the break. He scored his second goal for the Three Lions against Ivory Coast and has since played with a spring in his step for Villa. Despite Gerrard's side being on a tough run of form, Watkins has impressed in the past month or so, netting two goals in four games. He is now aiming to get at least his 10th goal of the season with a double header Burnley, two games against title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City and a game against Crystal Palace all to come this month.

On this day in 2014 the popular defender etched his name in club folklore when he headed a stoppage time equaliser to give Blues a 2-2 draw at Bolton - and the point they needed to dodge relegation. It was an iconic goal that sparked wild celebrations, made all the more memorable for Caddis’ topless shirt-whirling euphoria and at the end Lee Clark’s passionate sprint towards the visiting supporters. But speaking in 2018 Caddis has recalled how an idea conceived days before, during an orderly build-up to the match, helped inspire Blues. “The gaffer had asked secretary Rita Greenaway to contact the players’ families to see if they would record messages for us - and he played them to us in the hotel the night before. “They told us how proud they were of us and that we had their support - and that kind of reminded you of what you were playing for. “I helped us relax a bit more but also made you realise that we were doing it for the people behind the scenes who might lose their jobs or struggle to pay their mortgage or whatever. “For Lee Clark to have done that was a really good touch.” But even on that afternoon the road was still long for Blues as they went a goal down - and then ironically Lukas Jutkiewicz made it 2-0 with only 14 minutes to go. “As soon as we kicked off it was just a case of - get one back and go from there. Thankfully Ziggy [Nikola Zigic] did that.” But the real drama was to come. The game was deep into added time when a Zigic header was kept out and the ball looped invitingly back to Caddis. “For three or four seconds the weight just lifted off your shoulders. I remember thinking 'I needed to waste as much time as possible'. “I’d taken my shirt off and I knew I was going to get booked so I thought I’d run back into our half so the referee would have to come a long way. “I was also conscious of the fact Darren Randolph had been in tears after he let big Juke’s shot through his legs - he thought he’d cost us, so I went for him too.” Blues managed to see out the remainder of the game and a story-line for the ages had been written. The Scot, who now plays for Swindon, wil forever be remembered - and the game will go down as the most dramatic in Clark's tenure. “It’s a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life.” And he’s not the only one.

Trevor Francis liked a double arm lift, Christophe Dugarry was a kiss blower and few smiles will ever be as broad as Kevin Phillips’. But for all their grandeur they weren’t legendary celebrators, indeed Mikael Forssell was decidedly understated. When players get it right the celebration can be more memorable than the goal itself, though in truth the it’s a heady cocktail of circumstance and quality which stick in the mind. So we at BirminghamLive have had a go at picking the best goal celebrations in Birmingham City history. They’ve not all derby related honestly but this one takes the Audience Participation award. No sooner had Zigic spooned home the winner and lolloped off to the Tilton, than he was wrestled down in a headlock by Craig Gardner. Seb Larsson arrived on the scene booted the advertising hoardings and then the substitutes started a pile on, finished by an exuberant supporter as the cherry on top. READ: 'In tears' - The day The Saviour rescued Birmingham City READ: Berahino, Mousset, Ladapo - Free agent strikers Birmingham City could sign for nothing this summer Not a goal celebration but one of the most memorable reactions to a final whistle. Redknapp had steered Blues to safety on the final day with a victory at Bristol City. Fans cavorted in the away end for several minutes when Harry was drawn like a moth to the flame, out came the scarf, the fist pumped and he was suddenly 50 years younger. Those scenes tempted him out of semi-retirement. The midfielder cracked home an equaliser in front of the Tilton and flew up the sideline bellowing defiance. As he got closer to the Villa supporters off came the shirt and the enviable torso rippled. It just about trumped the wagging finger at Wolves a couple of seasons later. Barry Fry took his Blues team to the Terriers on the final day of the 1994/95 season knowing a win would put them back in the second tier. With his back to goal ten yards out Claridge spun and somehow rammed the ball past the entire home defence and set off behind the goal in whirl of arms and legs, similar to the way an octopus would attack the Can-Can. Thankfully he was engulfed by supporters before further embarrassment ensued. The youngster lasered in a daisy-cutter from 20 yards, a goal which was enough to put Chris Hughton’s Blues in the Championship play-offs. He then glided towards the visiting supporters and gave it the old snake-hips routine before being engulfed by team-mates. The boy could move. Clinton hooked it goalwards, Sorensen made a mess and off the Londoner went, fingers planted on lips with the other hand pointing at anyone who’d catch his eye, ending in a good old chest-beat Blues were still fuming about the career threatening injury Kevan Broadhurst had suffered at Villa Park earlier that season. They exacted retribution a few months later with a 2-1 victory sealed by Howard Gayle who raced away from the visitors’ defence and stroked home the decisive goal. He then leaped over the hoardings, climbed the fences and stood there, Messianic-like holding on with one hand, pumping the other as Bluenoses celebrated beneath him. What an image. As soon as Ricky Otto’s cross brushed off Tait’s floppy hair and into the Carlisle net Wembley erupted. It was the most golden of goals. And the celebration was even more memorable. The midfielder turned left and went off to the stands in search of the friends old and new. The shirt was ripped off to reveal the legend suggesting toilet-related activities in relation to Blues’ local rivals. Eight years ago today. Obviously the goal meant everything, it saved Blues from relegation. But it’s the scenes it sparked which stand out. In went the ball, out came the pasty Scottish complexion and round and round and round went the shirt as Caddis headed up the touchline and off towards Darren Randolph. Seconds later Lee Clark was haring in the other direction and throwing himself into the crowd. Stern John at Millwall in the play-off semi-finals gets an honourable mention in the shirt swinging category. Who put the ball in Arsenal’s net? Who gave Blues fans the proudest day in club history? Oba-Obafem, Obafemi Martens. He swept the ball into the empty goal, shrugged off Nikola Zigic, zigzagged away from his team-mates then flew into a triple flik-flak as Bluenoses kicked down the gates of heaven. A stunning celebration to go with a simple goal. ",positive

Neither have played a minute of football since Bruce arrived at The Hawthorns in February due to injury. Dike sustained what has proved to be a season-ending injury issue against Peterborough United just two matches into his Albion career and another two before the change of manager. Zohore, however, hasn't featured since August due to a combination of injury issues and being frozen out of the first team by Valerien Ismael. After spending last season on loan at Championship rivals Millwall, the 28-year-old has made just 23 appearances almost three years after arriving from Cardiff City. READ: West Brom boss confirms major Carroll decision ahead of summer transfer window READ: Steve Bruce wants 'more' from West Brom striker despite Reading winner The former Denmark youth international has though been mentioned in the same breath as January addition Dike ahead of next season, suggesting an opportunity to impress Bruce will be afforded during pre-season. “We’ve got two centre forwards,"" Bruce said when explaining the decision not to offer Andy Carroll a contract extension. ""One (Zohore) we’ve paid £8million for and the other (Dike) £7million in January. They’re both number nines. “We’ve got to try to see if we can get a tune out of (Zohore) and, of course, Dike, who we paid a lot of money for in January and who, at this moment in time, is fit again. “It’s a big summer for him."" Karlan Grant has instead been the almost ever-present centre-forward up front for Albion this season and, despite a disappointing overall performance as a team, the 24-year-old scored a 16th goal of the season against Reading at the weekend. Bruce, though, believes that there is even more to come from the striker next season. ",positive

The 23-year-old is far from unfamiliar with such a position after featuring in the role during the run-in of Albion 's promotion campaign under Slaven Bilic and also previously been used by Bruce there earlier in the season. O'Shea 's first two starts since returning from a fractured ankle were in the role too, in back-to-back late February defeats to Middlesbrough and Swansea City. During the latter of those two, the Republic of Ireland international was substituted for Darnell Furlong and didn't feature in the first team in six of the next seven as West Brom reverted to a back three, leaving O'Shea on the substitutes bench. The 1-0 win at Reading was the first foray as a full-back in over two months. READ: West Brom strikers sent clear Steve Bruce message after Andy Carroll decision READ: Steve Bruce admits West Brom 'mistake' as Reading switch offers food for thought That absence is not deemed as a reflection of the defender's ability to fulfil the responsibilities required in such a role, though, with Bruce happy to have O'Shea as an option in an area lacking in depth. “I believe he can play there comfortably,” the Albion boss said. “I think he struggled (against Middlesbrough and Swansea) because they were the first games he had played in six months. I take the responsibility of playing him there when I probably needed to play him at centre-back to ease him back in, but I’ve got no problem with him playing right-back. “But therein lies the problem with the squad. We’ve got one recognised right-back in (Darnell) Furlong and one recognised left-back in (Conor) Townsend. That’s the imbalance of the squad and what we’ve got to put right.” ",positive

Steve Bruce showed his hand for next season from the off against Reading as Albion took to the field back reverting back to the four-man backline that the manager started his stint after replacing Valerien Ismael with. While on paper it could have easily been a three with Semi Ajayi and Dara O'Shea kept from the 0-0 draw with Coventry City while Kyle Bartley came in for Matt Clarke, it was clear from the outset that wasn't the case. O'Shea was the was shifted out to right-back, as was the case earlier in the year when it was deployed, as Ajayi and Bartley remained centrally with Conor Townsend reigned in from wing-back to complete the quartet. As the unlucky one shifted out of position, the Republic of Ireland international took time to adapt initially but grew into the role, particularly going forwards. Ajayi was the pick of the bunch and looks like a key component of deploying the system in future. The Nigeria international was no less influential driving forward with the ball with just Bartley to the left as when overlapping on the right of a back three as against Sky Blues last weekend. The 28-year-old was equally imperious at the back, keeping Lucas Joao out of the game from open play by sticking tightly to the Reading centre-forward and being physical to keep Reading at bay. Ajayi was also adept at covering in behind Bartley when the hosts raced in behind. As far as early returns go, this was a particular positive of the day at the back. David Button was a relative spectator throughout as Reading failed to muster a single shot on target and just six in total as Albion's new look set-up kept them at bay. Just over a fortnight ago, Callum Robinson was withdrawn against Blackpool to be protected from Baggies boo-boys at The Hawthorns for a perceived lack of effort on Good Friday. Today, the 27-year-old's introduction was the spark Albion needed off of the bench to stop the match from meandering towards another 0-0 stalemate. After being summoned from the substitutes bench in added-time against Coventry last weekend, but still managing to win a penalty that gave Albion an opportunity to steal all three points at the death except for Grant's spot-kick woes, Bruce gave Robinson an actual opportunity to make an impact in Berkshire. Replacing Adam Reach in an attacking change for the best part of the final 20 minutes, the Republic of Ireland international offered an instant injection of energy which was exactly what was required. That was no more evident than six minutes after entering the fray. After Jake Livermore pushed up on the halfway line to force a mistake from Reading, Robinson was on hand to collect from the Baggies skipper with room in front to exploit. Whereas others may have dawdled and looked to retain possession, the substitute drove forward with a purpose to keep Reading on the back foot. Grant pulled to the left and, after waiting until all but reaching the penalty area, Robinson fed the striker who himself seemed energized by the introduction to execute a far from simple phase of play to come inside and apply a finish full of composure past Nyland. Robinson could well have played his way into the side from the final day against Barnsley and an opportunity to complete an Albion rehabilitation at The Hawthorns. Returning to form and building momentum into the summer individually can only be a positive for the Birmingham-native. Bruce has spoken in recent weeks about giving youngsters a chance to shine. Therefore, it was somewhat of a surprise that no one under the age of 22-years-old were involved from the off in the penultimate match of the season. There were, though, options off of the bench to be utilised and do that Bruce did. While perhaps forced in its implementation, showing faith in teenage Zac Ashworth for a place on the bench despite Conor Townsend being available to line up from the off was still a decision that had to be made. And, lo and behold, the 19-year-old was called upon perhaps earlier than anyone could have expected. After expectant father to be Townsend twisted an ankle just before the half-time interval which will now require a scan to ascertain its severity, Ashworth's time had come. Emerging after the break to little fanfare due to the nature of the substitution, any Albion fans that weren't there to witness that particular moment were left with a fine performance to recall on the trains back up north. The left-back was assured in possession and ultimately didn't look out of place at all in the first team environment. ",positive

The former Liverpool striker joined the Baggies on a free transfer in January after his short-term deal with Reading expired. He has since gone on to score three goals in 15 Championship appearances. Although Carroll has not been hugely prolific in front of goal, he has impressed with his general play in leading the line and has been arguably the team's top performer since arriving as injury cover for Daryl Dike. Albion fans have been vocal about their desire to see the forward remain at the club. TALKING POINTS: Steve Bruce finds the West Brom way forward as team turns to next season at Reading DEMANDING: Steve Bruce wants 'more' from West Brom striker despite Reading winner But the 33-year-old's time at the Hawthorns will come to an end when his six-month deal runs out in the summer, West Brom boss Steve Bruce has revealed. The manager says that the decision will create space on the wage bill as they look to strengthen other areas of the team. “We’ve got two centre forwards, one (Kenneth Zohore) we’ve paid £8million for and the other (Daryl Dike) £7million in January,"" said Bruce. “They’re both number nines. ""Andy Carroll has done great for us and he’s in better nick now than he’s been for the last few years. He’s done tremendously well but he’s unfortunate that we’ve got two centre forwards who we hope this summer will be fit. “I think I need to strengthen in other areas rather than at number nine. We need more threat in wide areas, we need midfield players because we’re limited in there for numbers. “So we have to make tough decisions and believe me that was a really really tough decision because I know how popular Andy was with the fans and how popular he was in the dressing room. “But I’ve got to think of the overall balance of the squad. His wages will be freed up for somebody else. That’s the stark reality of it."" ",positive

An instant return to the Premier League was on the agenda in pre-season, but instead they have fallen well short of even making the play-offs. It is not what the Baggies faithful had in mind when they returned to the second tier. This is the first full campaign since fans have been allowed to attend games since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. While this term has not been what supporters expected, it has at least given them the opportunity to cheer on, or vent their frustration with, their team. CHANGE: West Brom chief set to leave for Championship rivals next month TRANSFERS: West Brom boss confirms major Carroll decision ahead of summer transfer window Attendances have unquestionably been down, not just at Albion but throughout the Championship, due to the cost of living crisis and concerns over Covid-19, while West Brom 's inconsistent form also hasn't been an attraction to the average punter. That said, the club still have the fourth-highest crowds in the entire division. According to Transfermarkt, the Hawthorns had an average gate of 22,222 across the 22 Championship games it has so far hosted, which represents a 7.6 percent drop on the 2019/20 campaign. There are caveats to that figure because the Baggies publish tickets sold, as opposed to bums on the seats in attendance, but that is also the case across the league. As you can see below, with the exception of Middlesbrough, and Coventry - having been in League One and playing at St Andrew's - all of the second tier's 10 most attended stadiums suffered declines in attendance; although Sheffield United were a Premier League side in 2019/20. It should also be added that half the league still have one remaining home fixture to play this Saturday which could slightly alter figures. Focus will now turn to the summer transfer window and next season, where improved performance on the field could lead to more bums on seats. Average attendance | +/- on 2019/20 season 1.

Gerrard was particularly pleased with McGinn's leadership in the victory as he helped youngster Iroegbunam through his third appearance of the season.

We’re pretty open minded about how John wants to play in our system but we’re delighted to have him, he’s an asset for us. ""John likes to be a bit more of a free spirit. But it was a priority in the last window to make a six happen but we couldn’t possibly do that, it wasn’t right, the timing wasn’t right. So we have to be patient for the right thing in the long run.

Leon Bailey and Emi Buendia also arrived, but they have all struggled to settle for one reason or another.

No matter who the manager picks we all have a responsibility to create and help each other out, provide goals and assists. For me it is about working hard each game, whether I am starting or coming on."" When asked about Villa's inconsistent season, Ings replied: ""It has been a strange season. It is always difficult. We have changed managers and a lot of things have happened. But ultimately we are trying to improve individually and as a team. Hopefully we can finish the season strong."" Much has been said about Villa's struggles to fit both Ings and Ollie Watkins in the same team, but Steven Gerrard believes it can work and he has proven the duo can hit up a relationship on the pitch. They combined to score their first goal together in the 4-0 win over Southampton back in March, and managed to do it again in the win over the Canaries last time out. ""When strikers come together, things do take time,"" Ings added. ""We have had some really nice moments linking up. We have plenty to work on and keep building on but ultimately, the direction we want to go as a team, it is not just down to us to score the goals. You want goals for your 10s, you want your centre-halves scoring. I think overall everyone has to chip in with goals.

All of us are working hard to try and achieve something. ""It is important to put as many points on the board as we can to try and finish in as strong a position as we can.

Cameron Archer, Keinan Davis, Louie Barry, Kaine Kesler Hayden are just a few of the names that have thrived when given the chance of regular game time throughout the lower divisions in English football. This route could pave the way for either a return to the squad under Steven Gerrard's watchful eye like Archer, or an opportunity at securing a permanent move away from the club, like Davis at Nottingham Forest. Whether it leads to Villa receiving an increased transfer fee or a more confident young player, the loan market is a vital asset for this club given the talent it is currently producing within the academy. Ahead of the 2022/23 BirminghamLive have looked at five more academy prospects that could look to secure a loan move away next season to continue their development. READ MORE:   Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer Ben Chrisene The 18-year-old left-back recently has made the bench on five occasions for Steven Gerrard but is yet to make his Premier League debut with both Lucas Digne and Ashley Young preferred to him at this current stage of the season given his inexperience. The Villa boss has been keen to outline the hopes he has for the player after stating this regarding his development moving forward: ""Really good prospect and we’re really excited to try to help him become a Premier League player."" Chrisene has played senior football in both the FA Cup for Villa and two appearances for Exeter before making the switch to Birmingham in 2020. A loan move to offer the player regular football in a senior side could be key in ensuring the development plans the club have for him are fulfilled. Aaron Ramsey The younger brother of one of the hottest prospect in English football, Jacob Ramsey, is none other than the equally as promising Aaron Ramsey. Currently on loan at League One side Cheltenham Town where he has started nine games since January, recording one assist and his first goal in the Football League just over a week ago against Bolton Wanderers. Ramsey has shown his quality against senior opponents both on loan and in the U21s side in the EFL Trophy, where he recorded one goal and one assist in the 4-2 win against Milton Keynes Dons in October. The 19-year-old could benefit from another loan move possibly in the Championship next season. Caleb Chukwuemeka Prior to departing for Scottish Premiership side Livingstone in January, Chukwuemeka was in red hot form for the U23s side at Villa with seven goals and six assists in eight starts across the PL2 division. However, the loan move currently hasn't gone to plan in Scotland with just 102 minutes recorded across six appearances as a substitute in the league. Speaking on the loan move for Chukwuemeka, Livingstone boss commented on the players first start for the side which led to him being substituted after just 45 minutes of action against Ross County. David Martindale stated: ""The boy has talent, there is no doubt about that, I've seen it in training. I can coach him into how I want him to play. He needs to work on the intensity and the fitness because you could see maybe in the transition the application wasn't quite there. ""That's up to me as a coach to work on that. I think he'll be a very good player for us but as with most foreign players and also English players coming up, I think they get a massive shock. Through both an injury to his hamstring and a struggle to adapt to the coaching ethos from his new boss, the loan move hasn't been a success for Chukwuemeka and could benefit from a new situation next season in order for the talent he possesses to shine through in a senior side. Kerr Smith The 17-year-old defender was recently promoted to first team training after signing from Dundee United in the same transfer window which saw Philippe Coutinho arrive through the door. Smith has played senior football before after making ten appearances for Dundee and could benefit from getting regular game time in the lower divisions within English football. Louie Barry Barry has had a mixed experience whilst out on loan this season after failing to settle at League One side Ipswich Town after arriving at the beginning of the season. The 18-year-old attacker made just one league start for the Tractor Boy's before returning to Villa in January. Barry then dropped down into League Two after signing for Swindon Town and has gone on to thrive throughout the second loan spell. With six goals and one assist in 11 starts, Barry is beginning to display the talents that many thought he would during his time in League One. He now has the confidence and development to build on next season which could see him benefit from another loan move within League One to test himself against greater opponents on a regular basis.

One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things."" READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer priority READ MORE: Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season CONTRACT DILEMMAS Carney Chukwuemeka is no closer to signing a new contract with Villa, while Douglas Luiz is also yet to pen fresh terms and could leave the club this summer. Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will."" ",positive

The 20-year-old put pen to paper on a deal until 2027 on Tuesday and will continue his meteoric rise with the football club he joined at the age of six. Ramsey enjoyed a breakthrough Premier League campaign last year, but after making 30 league appearances this term, he has gone from strength to strength. He has so far scored six goals this season and is a favourite to win the club's player of the season award.

Obviously I am delighted with JJ [Ramsey] committing long-term to this project and this journey. ""I must say, himself, the kid, he was very humble and his representation were very keen, the same as the club, to get this done. We’ve signed a big talent for many years, he’s one of our own as a younger boy who we’ve given a pathway to and he’s taken it with both hands. ""He has shown that he deserves to be a starter in this team, he needs to remain consistent and he has got tot keep learning and growing, we think he can still get better, we think there are more levels that he can get to. ""He’s been an absolute joy to coach and a joy to be around and there’s nothing better than seeing someone who wants to commit to what you are doing here so I think it is big news to the club and I’m sure the supporters are delighted just as much as I am.""

Brighton trounced Wolves 3-0 at Molineux on Saturday. A first-half penalty from Alexis McAllister was followed up by goals from Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma after the interval. An impressive first half of the season put Wolves in a great position to finish in the top seven and challenge for European qualification. They even looked capable of potentially posing a serious threat to the top four. HEADLINES: Despair for Bruno Lage after Wolves' damaging defeat to Brighton dents European ambitions REACTION: Bruno Lage slams players for 'watching' Brighton in worst Wolves game A string of bad results has quietened those hopes, however. Bruno Lage's men have won just three times in their last ten Premier League games. There is still a decent chance that the club may qualify for one of Uefa's competitions next season, though. They are just three points behind seventh-placed West Ham with a game in hand, and both the Hammers and Manchester United have been in poor form of late. While Neto admits that their chances have been hampered, he says the team will continue fighting ""to achieve our goals"". In order to do that, the Portuguese believes that the team have to do better in terms of chance creation and finishing in front of goal. “When you have your goals, you want to achieve them. We want European football, we are working to that, but the last three games we were not happy,” he told the club’s official website. “We have to create more, we have to score more goals. We are looking to work on that, finishing the best way. “It was not a happy day for us. The last three games were not what we had in our mind. We have a lot to fight for. It’s becoming difficult but we have to continue to work to achieve our goals. “I understand the frustration of the fans. We are here to fight, to work each day. Things are not happening, but we will continue to work to get the victory in the next game.” ",negative

If that’s the case and we have to be patient then we’ll do it. “The support I’ve had during the first window and since I walked in the door has been brilliant and I really appreciate that.

Problems with the stadium emerged in December 2020 when a structural survey meant the Kop and Tilton Road stands were immediately closed – and have remained so to this day. While there is no exact date for reopening of the whole ground – the club’s project manager Michael Moran expressed hope that some sections – if not the entire stadium, could be available for supporters at the start of next season. The club is also giving consideration to installing safe standing in some areas. However, what became clear in a special presentation from Moran was the difficulties the club have experienced as soon as the remedial works started and the conditions under the stands became apparent. Moran, who was appointed in August 2021 outlined how industry pressures around the availability of labour and materials – as well as the sheer scope of the works have caused delays. “It has grown and grown and grown over time as the issues have presented themselves,” Moran said. “A lot of what we have dealt with are legacy issues. Our brief was to reinstate the stadium to its original design and a lot of the problems we have stem from a lack of access. “The stands were built over the old terraces which were broken up and at a time when regulations for maintenance were not as good. “The upper tier areas required trained operatives who effectively abseil into position – these are highly skilled people, some of whom operate on oil rigs – and it’s a niche market which suffers from high demand. We wanted to flood it with operatives but there are only so many you can get your hands on.” When workers first went into under the Tilton they found standing water, the source of which had to be identified and addressed. There was also corrosion on rakers, particularly on the lower tiers and there was also rubble, including heavy lumps of concrete, which had to be removed to allow access to areas some of which required workers to crawl through tunnels just 2ft wide. Materials were another issue, hundreds of bolts needed replacing or solidifying with structural grout – at a time when there was an industry shortage. Moran also claimed that a member of the club’s board even visited depots to source the material. There have been occasions when asbestos monitoring teams were called to the site, causing work to cease while the suspected materials were sent away for testing. Moran added; “Teams of workers were doing 11 hour shifts, seven days a week, with as many as 15 operatives, heavily incentivised and on double pay.” Indeed Blues ’ Chief Financial Officer Mark Smith said the club had already spent five times the original quote. Moran maintained that finance has not been an issue during the project. Moran said he is in the process of negotiating a time frame with the contractor, who will provide the club with options of either repairing and galvanising the affected beams, or replacing them. During this process consideration will also be given to areas of safe standing. It is thought that if beam encasement is deemed to be an acceptable way forward there is a chance sections could be open by the end of July. A decision on that is expected to be made in the couple of weeks. ",positive

Albion supporters rarely heard from predecessor Xu Ke, save for the odd written statement, and ex-chairman Li Piyue even less so. Upon arriving at the decision to sack Valerien Ismael last week, owner Guochuan Lai ripped up the structure of the club at senior level; it points to a fresh start, under Gourlay, with improved communications across the board. It’s an issue that Gourlay, during his days as part time club consultant, has sensed needs resolving - and began with a progressive discussion at Monday night's Albion Assembly meeting, which was also attended by Mark Miles and Simon King. “There are some things that have been rumbling on a lot longer than this season which we have to put right as a club,” Gourlay admitted. “We have to be more transparent with you guys [the press], we have got to be more in touch with our fan base. “We have let that drift. It is one thing we have got to address. I think that just helps the whole thing. It does. I have been at The Hawthorns many, many, times and the atmosphere has always been incredible. “We need that on our side, we hope we can drive results and get Albion fans back on our side so we can take this football club forward. We (Gourlay and Bruce) are very confident together. I have been here for five months. I have seen a lot of the good things in the club and together we can unlock that very quickly. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe me, Steve, the board, the fans – with the support of the owner – can take this club forward. We really do believe we can take it forward.” On the field Albion need improvements too, hence the installation of Bruce as their new boss. He took charge of training on Friday before being unveiled and continues preparations again ahead of the trip to former club Sheffield United on Wednesday night. Bruce himself spoke of his belief that he is inheriting one of the best groups of players in the Championship, and that’s an assessment shared by Gourlay. That quality married with Bruce’s experience needs to see an upturn in results - and the early signs are promising. “I believe there is so much quality in the side,” Gourlay added, “and the reason Steve is perfect for us is because we don’t have time, we need to hit the ground running. “We have got 17 games left and we have got to start winning games very, very, soon. I know Steve has been in positions like this before and he has proven himself many times. He is so highly respected by the players. “No disrespect to Valerien, but we have seen a nice lift since his arrival. I think we have to push on from his now. We have been underperforming there is no doubt about it.” ",positive

Suarez, 35, is a close friend of Villa boss Steven Gerrard and could look to follow in Philippe Coutinho's footsteps and reunite with his former teammate at Villa Park this summer, with his contract at Atletico Madrid set to expire. According to journalist Gerard Romero, who is based in Barcelona, Suarez rejected several offers in order to focus on the offer from Gerrard. Romero stated: ""Luis Suarez has ruled out offers from Palmeiras, Corinthians and Atlético Mineiro - as well as one from Arabia - to focus on the proposal from Aston Villa from his former teammate Gerrard."" Speaking to GGRecon another one of Gerrard's former teammates in the form of Glen Johnson waded in on the potential deal this summer. Johnson commented on a return to the Premier League for Suarez, where he stated: “To play in the Premier League after you’ve been in La Liga at 35 would be a big ask. But look, Luis is super fit and super determined and it wouldn’t surprise me if he goes back and tears it up again, really.” Read more: Leeds United tipped to complete £15m Aston Villa transfer amid Newcastle doubts emerge Read more: What Smith did to Villa players as Gerrard makes 'disappointed' comment However, BirminghamLive's Ashley Preece has cast doubts over the prospect of Suarez arriving this summer as issued the following statement on the rumours: ""Suarez remains an option.

Sawyers is currently on loan at Stoke City, who beat West Brom 3-1 in Saturday's Championship encounter at the Hawthorns. The midfielder, who arrived from Brentford in 2019, is in the final months of his current contract, though Albion are understood to hold an option to extend the deal by a further 12 months. The 30-year-old was not allowed to feature against his parent club on Saturday under the terms of his loan deal. Bruce has, however, left the door open for the player once his stay at the bet365 Stadium comes to an end.

""We’re verging on a major overhaul,"" Bruce said. ""That’s required because the club is never going to accept being halfway in the Championship and rightly so."" Bruce also revealed he is an admirer of Sawyers before the match against the Potters. ""I’ve always liked him as a player,"" he added. ""He is in my thoughts. I’ll sit down with him in the summer. ""He scored for Stoke in the week when he came on against Reading, he made a huge difference. The kid is a good footballer."" ",positive
47,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-cardiff-bowyer-hernandez-23835338,Lee Bowyer reveals the Cardiff City decision which left him 'baffled',"Three minutes into the second half of Birmingham City’s 1-1 draw with Cardiff City, Onel Hernandez picked up possession, turned and ran straight at the heart of the Bluebirds’ defence. The flying forward made about 20 yards before Cardiff’s Mark McGuinness recognised the danger and snuffed it out. With no hope of catching Hernandez the centre back slid in from behind and took the 29-year-old’s legs out from underneath him. Referee John Busby gave McGuinness and needlessly long talking to and then brandished the yellow card. It was a fair cop. But it also brought to mind an almost identical situation that had happened in another Blues game – in a 0-0 draw with Coventry in November 2021. That time Ryan Woods was the protagonist, Ian Maatsen the victim, the circumstances, as identical as you can get in two different football matches. READ MORE: Birmingham City player ratings vs Cardiff City: Bela strikes, Bacuna shines but Blues are held READ MORE: Simon Jordan gives brutal Lee Bowyer verdict after claims of Birmingham City’s ref justice Yet the referee that day, Leigh Doughty, saw red and sent Woods off. It was a decision that landed Woods a three game ban at a time when central midfielders were as abundant as hen’s teeth and saw Blues waste time and money with an unsuccessful appeal. According to Lee Bowyer the incidents were ‘the exact same’. A point he made to Andy Woolmer on the touchline at the Cardiff City Stadium. “I said that to the fourth official, ‘I am not asking for this player to be sent off – please don’t take it this way, I never want to see a player sent off. But I had a player do exactly that and get sent off’. He said ‘Sorry’, he wasn’t reffing that game. “The rules just seem to change – and again – you brought it up, I am not saying it because I want to see red cards, but it has to be the same across the board. What are the rules? Why was Ryan’s a red card and this one wasn’t. It baffles me. But I am not wasting my time on the officials.” ",negative
