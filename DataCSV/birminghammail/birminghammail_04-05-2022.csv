The 19-year-old is a player with a budding reputation across Europe, following his performances for Serie A side Bologna. The Scotland international has scored five goals from left-back this term, as speculation continues to grow around the teenager ahead of the summer transfer window. Villa  were one of several clubs linked with a move for the former Hearts defender in January and it is understood that the club will  maintain their interest this summer . However, it has been suggested that Steven Gerrard will face a battle for Hickey’s signature. READ MORE:  The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort READ MORE:  'I don't care' - Steven Gerrard fires warning to Aston Villa squad with Tim Iroegbunam message It has been  reported by an Italian radio station  that Mikel Arteta’s side have ""started negotiations"" with Bologna over a potential deal. That would see Hickey compete with Scotland teammate Kieran Tierney for a left-back berth at Arsenal. The report further suggests that the Italian club values Hickey in the region of £17m, after an impressive two seasons at the club. That would represent a significant profit for Bologna, who signed Hickey for just £1.5m in 2020 despite competition from Bayern Munich, while it is believed Hearts would also receive part of the sum as a sell-on fee. Villa are claimed to be joined in the hunt for the defender by AC Milan, Liverpool, Brentford and Napoli. Newcastle are also listed as possible suitors, despite having signed  Matt Targett on loan  earlier this season. The Villa loanee has won over Newcastle fans with his displays under Eddie Howe, after going in search of first-team football following the arrival of Lucas Digne. It has been reported that the Magpies have an option to sign the 26-year-old on a permanent basis for £15m this summer, but have also recently been linked with a move for Atletico Madrid full-back Renan Lodi.

The 36-year-old, who most recently played for non-league outfit Maidstone United, has called time on a career which spanned almost two decades. Elokobi represented 11 different clubs during his playing career, but his longest spell came at Molineux. Mick McCarthy brought the Cameroonian to Wolves in January 2008 for £500,000 and he went on to become a cult hero. He helped Wolves into the Premier League before playing his part in keeping the club in the promised land for three years. READ: Man Utd pit Ruben Neves against transfer alternative with Wolves scouting mission READ: Fosun have simple Bruno Lage decision after rotten Wolves run continues Elokobi’s finest moment in old gold came during the 2010/11 season when he scored against Manchester United to help bottom-of-the-table Wolves secure a 2-1 to end Sir Alex Ferguson’s hopes of an unbeaten campaign. Elokobi levelled the scores at Molineux before Kevin Doyle struck the winner. ""After 19 years in this beautiful sport. The time has come for me to hang up my playing boots,” Elokobi said in a statement on his Twitter account. “I want to thank all the managers I have played under, I have learned so much from each and every one of you.” Elokobi went on to thank numerous people whom he has worked alongside before delivering a special message to those who have supported him from the stands down the years. “The biggest thank you to my supporters in the UK and worldwide,” he added. “You have always been an amazing part of the journey, because without you there is no game.

The midfielder has been a star performer for the Exiles this term, recently winning the League Two Young Player of the Year award. Azaz has gained significant experience this season, having been a virtual ever-present for Newport, missing just four league games. Against Port Vale, the  Villa  youngster was named Man of the Match after providing an assist for Ryan Haynes’ opener before firing the decisive goal of the game in a 2-1 win at Vale Park.

He’s capable of so much. “I think he made four starts before I came in – and that’s not about me, that’s about the team and the staff and the collective of the football club and what we can do to develop players and we demonstrated that with Finn. We would have liked to be in the mix (for promotion) but, for me, the performances in certain halves of games have been pleasing. “Today the lads’ attitude and focus pleased me. There was that cliche of us having nothing to play for and we demonstrated what we’re about today.” With Villa having showcased the strength of their academy last season through winning the FA Youth Cup, a section of supporters  have kept an eye on Azaz’s development  at Rodney Parade. Steven Gerrard has also shown faith in the club’s young players, most recently starting both Jacob Ramsey and Tim Iroegbunam in midfield against Norwich on Saturday.

Described as “a friend and confidant to numerous generations of players and staff”, the boyhood Rangers fan worked at the Scottish club for more than 30 years. Bell initially drove the Rangers team buses to matches across the country, before moving on to his role as first-team head of kit. The popular staff member’s death came as a shock to everyone associated with the club as Rangers announced his passing on Tuesday morning. He had been in the technical area alongside manager Giovanni Van Bronckhorst as Rangers drew 1-1 away to city rivals Celtic on Sunday.

Rip Jimmy Bell x."" Rangers chairman Douglas Park also commented on the news by stating: “As a club, we are absolutely devastated to learn of the loss of our colleague and more importantly, our dear friend, Jimmy Bell.“Jimmy dedicated his life to Rangers Football Club. Having worked under managers from Graeme Souness through to Giovanni, he experienced some of the greatest days in our 150-year history. “Of course, he was here during some of the lowest points, and showed selfless dedication, regardless of the challenge ahead of him.“Jimmy’s work ethic was second to none. He dedicated countless hours to preparation for each training session and game. No job was too big or too small for him, and he thrived on working for his boyhood club. “I spoke with Jimmy regularly, having known him from his time as a mechanic and bus driver at Park’s. He was excited for Thursday night’s game at Ibrox (against RB Leipzig), particularly having experienced a European semi-final before under Walter Smith. “Rangers, and Scottish football as a whole, have lost a legend and a friend today. He was a family man, a devoted father, grandfather and husband. “Jimmy will be sorely missed and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Bell family at this difficult time on behalf of Rangers Football Club.” ",positive

Konsa, 24, has struggled to replicate the same consistent form he displayed in the 2020/21 Premier League season which saw Villa keep an impressive 15 clean sheets across their 38 games, of which Konsa featured in 36 of them. He is one of only two players in the league two have received two red cards this season, highlighting a frustrating campaign which has been hampered by some poor decision-making and uncharacteristic errors. One such example was the slip against Wolves which led to their opening goal in the 2-1 defeat in April. READ MORE: Aston Villa's best and worst away days with Leicester and Wolves standing apart READ MORE: Aston Villa set for dramatic transfer shift after blunt Steven Gerrard comments John McGinn ambled forward in possession in the opening moments of the game but was dispossessed by Joao Moutinho following a slip in the middle of the park. The Portuguese midfielder then drove forward and chipped a ball in the direction of Daniel Podence, which looked like it was going to be dealt with by Konsa, until the defender also slipped and allowed the winger a clear run into the penalty area. A chaotic series of events then followed which eventually led to Spanish fullback Jonny wrapping his effort home to give the hosts a 1-0 win. A slip went on to decide this game as Steven Gerrard's men lost 2-1 and a similar situation also played a key role in deciding Villa's most recent fixture against Norwich City. Danny Ings played a lofted ball over the top for Ollie Watkins to battle Brandon Williams for, who looked to have a chance in the encounter until he slipped at the last moment and allowed Watkins a clear sight on goal. The striker lashed his effort past Tim Krul in the Norwich goal and Villa went on to win 2-0. Analysing the first goal for Villa against Norwich last weekend, Warnock outlined the issue that has plagued Konsa, McGinn and Williams this season and pinpointed why the issues may be occurring. Speaking on Sky Sports News Warnock stated: “This is one of my biggest pet hates, when I see players slipping on a football pitch, because the big thing I think is just sort your footwear out. “That can’t happen (slipping). Why? Because he is a defender. That is something that can’t happen. You can’t lose your balance because you have got the wrong footwear on. It is nothing to do with your ability and what you’re doing, that is the wrong footwear and the wrong studs in your boots. ""At the highest level I see players now and defenders wearing moulded studs and I just think ‘you are not going to be able to stand up on these pitches’. I mean the pitches now are like carpets and there is not much mud on them to grab hold of. It was in the Liverpool game the other day (against Newcastle), there were players falling left right and centre. I was going mad.” Sue Smith, who scored 16 goals for England Lionesses, then went on to add: “The difference between a defender and an attacker, I wore moulded studs all the way through my career even if it was the boggiest pitch, whereas defenders make sure they have the right boots on because slipping like that in a vital moment can cost a goal.” ",negative

The talented midfielder has produced t wo goals and three assists in the 16 games he has played since joining from Rangers in January. He has become a fixture in Lee Bowyer’s side, impressing with his composure on the ball and his distribution. But no-one has ever doubted the 24-year-old’s technical gifts, the challenge for him has been to continually strive to get the best out of himself. And speaking to BirminghamLive he has explained how at home he feels with Blues. “I have definitely enjoyed it,” he said. “I have been playing games, that is the most important thing.

Bailey, 24, was substituted in the first half against Norwich City due to injury for Danny Ings, who would then go on to help Gerrard's squad open the scoring on the afternoon just seconds after coming on, as his pass found the feet of Ollie Watkins who made no mistake in front of goal. In the aftermath of the injury, Gerrard spoke about the setback for the Jamaican winger by stating: ""It’s an ankle issue. In terms of the extent and the damage I’m sure he’ll be MRI scanned in the next 24 to 48 hours. I’m really disappointed and frustrated for him because he’s worked really hard to get back, he’s been training ever so well.

He’s frustrated, we’re frustrated and I’m sure the supporters are as well. ""He said there was a bit of a twist after the contact so we’ll get him looked at. He’s obviously going to be a major doubt for the next game against Burnley because it’s very rare that you come off the pitch and you’re available for the next game, so we are concerned about it."" Injury expert Ben Dinnery has since given his opinion on the severity of the injury for Bailey whilst speaking to Football Insider, where he stated: “ It’s been very stop-start with Bailey. He is a player who has had a couple of big issues with his thigh. He has need to be managed carefully. It’s been a bit of a nightmare. “With this problem, we are waiting for imaging. Sometimes when you see players on crutches or wearing a cast, the assumption is that is bad, but that isn’t always the case. “Sometimes it can just be a precautionary measure. You don’t want to take any risks and allow the player to bear his own weight before you assess him. “If it is a mild sprain, I’d give him every chance to return this season.

Jimenez, who turns 31 on Thursday, was dropped from Wolves’ starting line-up again for the 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday. Lage opted for Hwang Hee-chan and Fabio Silva instead, before Jimenez replaced the latter at half-time. The Mexican striker cut a frustrated figure in another goalless outing and gifted Brighton possession in the build-up to Leandro Trossard’s game-clinching second goal. Jimenez’s record now reads six goals in 30 Premier League outings having scored 13 and 17 respectively in his two previous full campaigns at Molineux. READ: Fosun have simple Bruno Lage decision after rotten Wolves run continues READ: Barcelona boss Xavi sends pointed message to Wolves over Adama Traore transfer “This kind of season can happen to a player,” said Lage, speaking before the defeat to Brighton. “Raul has been scoring 15, 15, 15, so when he scores six it’s not good. But when you look at the other teams, how many goals do their strikers score? The average is five or six. These kinds of things can happen.” With three assists to his name, Jimenez has nine goal contributions in total, putting him ahead of his Wolves teammates. But the striker’s inability to find the net regularly has been a major problem for Lage, who has now benched Jimenez on four occasions. Silva, a £35million signing from Porto two years ago, hasn’t netted yet this season and Wolves are already eyeing up strikers heading into the summer window. The days of Jimenez being undroppable at Molineux are over. “We have changed our way of playing a little bit,” explained Lage. “Teams respect us more and defend more inside the box so he needs to adapt. He has good movements. “What happened with him against Leeds was frustrating because he was in a good moment, then he was out for three weeks because we didn’t have a game. It’s not good for a player. It was the second time this season he saw a red card.” In Jimenez’s defence, there have been international exertions with Mexico to factor in, as well as teething issues with the protective headgear he must wear for the rest of his career. He has now switched to a lighter headband, which should allow him to become potent in the air once more. “I can see the same player,” added Lage. “The band gave a different direction when he was heading, this one doesn’t. I see him with more confidence when he is running, it’s lighter. The doctors are doing their best to help him to be the Raul we know.” ",positive

The 18-year-old scored a first professional goal last weekend to give Barnsley the lead over Preston North End after being handed a first start in the Championship clash. Devaney's side went on to lose 3-1 at Oakwell, but that did not diminish the significance of the academy graduate's goal for the already relegated Tykes. Injuries, as well as impending relegation, saw some senior players make way for the club's academy prospects up in South Yorkshire as Carlton Morris was a relative senior citizen up front in a starting XI that had an average age of just under 22 years old.

I thought they dealt with the situation really well, and that was great to see.” On Marsh, Devaney was pleased at how the player took such an opportunity. “It was a good opportunity for him,"" the Barnsley boss added, ""and to get the goal as well was fantastic.” “It’s all about consistency in his performances for Aiden now,” Devaney continued. “Making sure this isn’t just a one-off.

They will do so looking to win for the first time in six matches, for the first time on the final day for four years and to round-off what has been another challenging campaign in slightly more positive fashion. It is a bitter irony that after struggling with injuries for virtually the whole season, Lee Bowyer is likely to have a fully fit squad from which to choose. While speculation about his future continues – it does seem clear that some of his charges will play, or already have played, their last games for Blues. Indeed with Tony Mowbray ending his five years in charge of Rovers on Saturday, there seems an air of finality to the fixture.

READ MORE: Panathinaikos, Atlanta, Fleetwood - Where Birmingham City's relegation dodgers are now READ MORE: Berahino, Mousset, Ladapo - Free agent strikers Birmingham City could sign for nothing this summer Bowyer has adopted a very pragmatic approach since the Blackpool defeat, focusing on senior players and naming an unchanged side at Cardiff City last time out. He explained: “They fought for the shirt [against Millwall], you do that for me and you deserve to go again.” It would be no surprise to see that ethos continue, nor would it be a shock to see a 3-4-1-2 utilised again, particularly with the expected return to fitness of Tahith Chong. In goal Neil Etheridge has played since returning to fitness, ahead of Connal Trueman and Zach Jeacock. Nico Gordon and Marc Roberts have started the last ten games as two-thirds of the back three, with George Friend returning for the final few matches. Kristian Pedersen, who is available again after being given compassionate leave, did not feature in the squad at Cardiff. Maxime Colin has started three of the last four games at right wing back, while Jeremie Bela has been in for the last two and scored for the first time in seven months in south Wales. Pedersen and Jordan Graham are the other two options now that Onel Hernandez has been deployed in a more offensive role. There are abundant options in the middle of the park, although Gary Gardner has been the one constant other than when illness spared him participation at Bloomfield Road. With Chong almost certain to return, fitness permitting, that would limit Blues to just one other out-and-out centre-mid. It’s impossible to look past Juninho Bacuna. Bowyer has a lready spoken about saving Chong for the final home game ‘so everyone can show their appreciation for what he's brought to us’. Lyle Taylor remains his go to striker, while Hernandez demands inclusion. ",positive

Asked if Iroegbunam could become a regular in the starting XI, Gerrard replied: ""I think in time. You have to take into consideration that he’s a baby in football terms.

14,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fosun-bruno-lage-wolves-news-23850358,Fosun have simple Bruno Lage decision after rotten Wolves run continues,"For the first time as Wolverhampton Wanderers head coach, Bruno Lage is receiving criticism from supporters. A rotten run of form - seven defeats in 10 Premier League matches - at the business end of the season has understandably sparked some frustration from the terraces. Wolves’ players were booed off the field at half-time and full-time of their abysmal 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday. The manager takes the brunt of the blame in this game, so Lage is having to accept criticism - just as he lapped up supporters’ adulation earlier in the season. However, talk of the S word is incredibly premature for Lage who would have been in contention for manager of the season had his players not wilted in April. READ: Bruno Lage makes transfer demand & fires warning to Wolves players before Chelsea READ: Barcelona boss Xavi sends pointed message to Wolves over Adama Traore transfer Granted, Wolves’ recent woes have been reminiscent of those final few months of Nuno Espirito Santo’s tenure, where the lack of a clear strategy led to turgid performances. But for the vast majority of this season, Wolves have had a clear way of playing. At times, the football has been free-flowing and joyous to watch - no regular watcher of Wolves can deny that. It is no coincidence that Wolves’ identity crisis has appeared in the weeks since Ruben Neves’ injury, the player Lage has built his team around. Neves is back for the run-in, but the fixture list isn’t kind to Wolves. Fans would be grateful for a goal in the final four matches against Chelsea, Manchester City, Norwich and Liverpool - all teams they have failed to score against this season. After months of enthusiasm in a season which promised so much, apathy has set in. It now falls on Lage, along with his trusted coaching staff, to turn the tide at Molineux. He deserves a fair amount of time to do that. Backing is required too. Lage has been supportive of owners Fosun over the past few months and deflected anger away from chairman Jeff Shi by dampening transfer window expectations at the beginning of January. The time has now come for Fosun to repay their manager, and provide him with the same financial backing that his predecessor Nuno enjoyed. Given the fact Wolves made a profit in last summer’s transfer window, and weakened their squad with the perplexing loan departure of Adama Traore in January, Lage did a pretty remarkable job up until April. And he did it all with Nuno’s squad. Lage hasn’t even had the chance to implement his preferred formation at Molineux due to the characteristics of the players he inherited from Nuno. The real world equivalent would be to ask a builder to build a house with a plumber’s tools. Before we criticise Lage, we should stop and assess how he has performed against expectations set last August. Improvements need to be made, that much is true, but Fosun must allow Lage to spend the money to make them. ",positive

The England international scored his ninth goal of the season in Villa's 2-0 win over Norwich City at the weekend. The result relegated the Canaries and the striker's former head coach Dean Smith, but the 51-year-old will be proud of Watkins as he continues to make an impact at the highest level. Smith recruited Watkins for Brentford and later Villa, as he broke the club's transfer record to bring the versatile forward to Villa Park for £30million two summers ago. And since Watkins made his Premier League debut, only three strikers have scored more Premier League goals than him. READ MORE: The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort READ MORE: Dean Smith pinpoints Aston Villa weakness Steven Gerrard must take note of Only Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Diogo Jota can eclipse Watkins' 23-goal haul since the start of the last Premier League campaign. The 24-year-old scored 14 goals in the Premier League last season and earned himself a call-up to the England national team in March 2021. After scoring against San Marino on his Three Lions debut, he was handed four more caps, but wasn't picked for England November internationals. Speaking in December, Steven Gerrard claimed that the Villa forward could force his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans before the 2022 World Cup. ""It’s been a pleasure to work with him and I’m looking forward to the future. I’m delighted to have him here,"" Gerrard said. ""Ollie has just got to be the best he can be for Aston Villa and I’m sure that will be enough for him to get back in the England squad and I’m sure Gareth Southgate will be watching him closely. But the best thing you can do to get into England squads is to be consistent and do your stuff for your club, and Ollie is certainly doing that."" Villa head coach Gerrard was also certain that Watkins would thrive in his system. He said: ""I don’t think there is a limit for Ollie. ""He’s got the lot – pace, power, aggression. He will grow, he will enjoy the style we play so there isn’t a ceiling for him."" And Gerrard was proven right as Southgate turned to Watkins in the March internationals when Tammy Abraham was ruled out of the squad due to injury. Watkins played one minute of the game against Switzerland, before he was handed a start against Ivory Coast in the second fixture of the break. He scored his second goal for the Three Lions against Ivory Coast and has since played with a spring in his step for Villa. Despite Gerrard's side being on a tough run of form, Watkins has impressed in the past month or so, netting two goals in four games. He is now aiming to get at least his 10th goal of the season with a double header Burnley, two games against title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City and a game against Crystal Palace all to come this month.

Trevor Francis liked a double arm lift, Christophe Dugarry was a kiss blower and few smiles will ever be as broad as Kevin Phillips’. But for all their grandeur they weren’t legendary celebrators, indeed Mikael Forssell was decidedly understated. When players get it right the celebration can be more memorable than the goal itself, though in truth the it’s a heady cocktail of circumstance and quality which stick in the mind. So we at BirminghamLive have had a go at picking the best goal celebrations in Birmingham City history. They’ve not all derby related honestly but this one takes the Audience Participation award. No sooner had Zigic spooned home the winner and lolloped off to the Tilton, than he was wrestled down in a headlock by Craig Gardner. Seb Larsson arrived on the scene booted the advertising hoardings and then the substitutes started a pile on, finished by an exuberant supporter as the cherry on top. READ: 'In tears' - The day The Saviour rescued Birmingham City READ: Berahino, Mousset, Ladapo - Free agent strikers Birmingham City could sign for nothing this summer Not a goal celebration but one of the most memorable reactions to a final whistle. Redknapp had steered Blues to safety on the final day with a victory at Bristol City. Fans cavorted in the away end for several minutes when Harry was drawn like a moth to the flame, out came the scarf, the fist pumped and he was suddenly 50 years younger. Those scenes tempted him out of semi-retirement. The midfielder cracked home an equaliser in front of the Tilton and flew up the sideline bellowing defiance. As he got closer to the Villa supporters off came the shirt and the enviable torso rippled. It just about trumped the wagging finger at Wolves a couple of seasons later. Barry Fry took his Blues team to the Terriers on the final day of the 1994/95 season knowing a win would put them back in the second tier. With his back to goal ten yards out Claridge spun and somehow rammed the ball past the entire home defence and set off behind the goal in whirl of arms and legs, similar to the way an octopus would attack the Can-Can. Thankfully he was engulfed by supporters before further embarrassment ensued. The youngster lasered in a daisy-cutter from 20 yards, a goal which was enough to put Chris Hughton’s Blues in the Championship play-offs. He then glided towards the visiting supporters and gave it the old snake-hips routine before being engulfed by team-mates. The boy could move. Clinton hooked it goalwards, Sorensen made a mess and off the Londoner went, fingers planted on lips with the other hand pointing at anyone who’d catch his eye, ending in a good old chest-beat Blues were still fuming about the career threatening injury Kevan Broadhurst had suffered at Villa Park earlier that season. They exacted retribution a few months later with a 2-1 victory sealed by Howard Gayle who raced away from the visitors’ defence and stroked home the decisive goal. He then leaped over the hoardings, climbed the fences and stood there, Messianic-like holding on with one hand, pumping the other as Bluenoses celebrated beneath him. What an image. As soon as Ricky Otto’s cross brushed off Tait’s floppy hair and into the Carlisle net Wembley erupted. It was the most golden of goals. And the celebration was even more memorable. The midfielder turned left and went off to the stands in search of the friends old and new. The shirt was ripped off to reveal the legend suggesting toilet-related activities in relation to Blues’ local rivals. Eight years ago today. Obviously the goal meant everything, it saved Blues from relegation. But it’s the scenes it sparked which stand out. In went the ball, out came the pasty Scottish complexion and round and round and round went the shirt as Caddis headed up the touchline and off towards Darren Randolph. Seconds later Lee Clark was haring in the other direction and throwing himself into the crowd. Stern John at Millwall in the play-off semi-finals gets an honourable mention in the shirt swinging category. Who put the ball in Arsenal’s net? Who gave Blues fans the proudest day in club history? Oba-Obafem, Obafemi Martens. He swept the ball into the empty goal, shrugged off Nikola Zigic, zigzagged away from his team-mates then flew into a triple flik-flak as Bluenoses kicked down the gates of heaven. A stunning celebration to go with a simple goal. ",positive

The 23-year-old is far from unfamiliar with such a position after featuring in the role during the run-in of Albion 's promotion campaign under Slaven Bilic and also previously been used by Bruce there earlier in the season. O'Shea 's first two starts since returning from a fractured ankle were in the role too, in back-to-back late February defeats to Middlesbrough and Swansea City. During the latter of those two, the Republic of Ireland international was substituted for Darnell Furlong and didn't feature in the first team in six of the next seven as West Brom reverted to a back three, leaving O'Shea on the substitutes bench. The 1-0 win at Reading was the first foray as a full-back in over two months. READ: West Brom strikers sent clear Steve Bruce message after Andy Carroll decision READ: Steve Bruce admits West Brom 'mistake' as Reading switch offers food for thought That absence is not deemed as a reflection of the defender's ability to fulfil the responsibilities required in such a role, though, with Bruce happy to have O'Shea as an option in an area lacking in depth. “I believe he can play there comfortably,” the Albion boss said. “I think he struggled (against Middlesbrough and Swansea) because they were the first games he had played in six months. I take the responsibility of playing him there when I probably needed to play him at centre-back to ease him back in, but I’ve got no problem with him playing right-back. “But therein lies the problem with the squad. We’ve got one recognised right-back in (Darnell) Furlong and one recognised left-back in (Conor) Townsend. That’s the imbalance of the squad and what we’ve got to put right.” ",positive

An instant return to the Premier League was on the agenda in pre-season, but instead they have fallen well short of even making the play-offs. It is not what the Baggies faithful had in mind when they returned to the second tier. This is the first full campaign since fans have been allowed to attend games since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. While this term has not been what supporters expected, it has at least given them the opportunity to cheer on, or vent their frustration with, their team. CHANGE: West Brom chief set to leave for Championship rivals next month TRANSFERS: West Brom boss confirms major Carroll decision ahead of summer transfer window Attendances have unquestionably been down, not just at Albion but throughout the Championship, due to the cost of living crisis and concerns over Covid-19, while West Brom 's inconsistent form also hasn't been an attraction to the average punter. That said, the club still have the fourth-highest crowds in the entire division. According to Transfermarkt, the Hawthorns had an average gate of 22,222 across the 22 Championship games it has so far hosted, which represents a 7.6 percent drop on the 2019/20 campaign. There are caveats to that figure because the Baggies publish tickets sold, as opposed to bums on the seats in attendance, but that is also the case across the league. As you can see below, with the exception of Middlesbrough, and Coventry - having been in League One and playing at St Andrew's - all of the second tier's 10 most attended stadiums suffered declines in attendance; although Sheffield United were a Premier League side in 2019/20. It should also be added that half the league still have one remaining home fixture to play this Saturday which could slightly alter figures. Focus will now turn to the summer transfer window and next season, where improved performance on the field could lead to more bums on seats. Average attendance | +/- on 2019/20 season 1.

20,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-aston-villa-squad-issues-23838431,The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort,"Aston Villa are set for another busy transfer window this summer with plenty of outgoings and several incomings expected. Steven Gerrard will be backed in the market with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens hoping the club can challenge for European football next season. Following a positive January window where the club signed Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne and Calum Chambers, the Villa boss wants to add more quality to improve his starting XI. A holding midfielder and more defensive reinforcements are at the top of Gerrard's wish list, while Villa will also target more attacking talent, according to reports. Here are five issues that the Villa head coach must sort this summer. READ MORE: Fresh Carney Chukwuemeka transfer claims emerge amid Aston Villa uncertainty READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer WHO WEARS THE ARMBAND? One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things."" READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer priority READ MORE: Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season CONTRACT DILEMMAS Carney Chukwuemeka is no closer to signing a new contract with Villa, while Douglas Luiz is also yet to pen fresh terms and could leave the club this summer. Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will."" ",positive

The 19-year-old is a player with a budding reputation across Europe, following his performances for Serie A side Bologna. The Scotland international has scored five goals from left-back this term, as speculation continues to grow around the teenager ahead of the summer transfer window. Villa  were one of several clubs linked with a move for the former Hearts defender in January and it is understood that the club will  maintain their interest this summer . However, it has been suggested that Steven Gerrard will face a battle for Hickey’s signature. READ MORE:  The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort READ MORE:  'I don't care' - Steven Gerrard fires warning to Aston Villa squad with Tim Iroegbunam message It has been  reported by an Italian radio station  that Mikel Arteta’s side have ""started negotiations"" with Bologna over a potential deal. That would see Hickey compete with Scotland teammate Kieran Tierney for a left-back berth at Arsenal. The report further suggests that the Italian club values Hickey in the region of £17m, after an impressive two seasons at the club. That would represent a significant profit for Bologna, who signed Hickey for just £1.5m in 2020 despite competition from Bayern Munich, while it is believed Hearts would also receive part of the sum as a sell-on fee. Villa are claimed to be joined in the hunt for the defender by AC Milan, Liverpool, Brentford and Napoli. Newcastle are also listed as possible suitors, despite having signed  Matt Targett on loan  earlier this season. The Villa loanee has won over Newcastle fans with his displays under Eddie Howe, after going in search of first-team football following the arrival of Lucas Digne. It has been reported that the Magpies have an option to sign the 26-year-old on a permanent basis for £15m this summer, but have also recently been linked with a move for Atletico Madrid full-back Renan Lodi.

They have recently changed the name of the parent company and recapitalised the company to really begin the next phase of the Aston Villa strategy. ""This next phase is more global, to try and put Aston Villa at the heart of an international talent development, talent recruitment model for professional footballers. This will see the club investing in different regions and territories around the world where talent is not accessible directly by Aston Villa under the current rules and regulations. ""The next phase is to think carefully about how we secure access to the best footballing talent in the world. We think there are regions in the world where the kind of way Aston Villa has gone about developing young players, we can bring that knowhow and skill in emerging markets and somehow find ways to root those players into either professional clubs in those territories that we might invest in or, ultimately, back to Aston Villa. We think that can be a source of competitive advantage for our club.""

And whether it is a shining example to all other clubs of how a football ground should be or a right dump doesn’t matter. After all, it is our dump, and that’s what is important. But then there are those other grounds we have a hankering after too - those of footballing foes but which spark warm feelings because of a brilliant victory there or a favourite incident, the culmination of a promotion success or huge cup upset. READ MORE: Simon Jordan delivers Aston Villa relegation verdict READ MORE: Two Aston Villa pre-season friendlies revealed These days, as more and more modern stadia spring up across the country, another category of favourite springs to mind - those old-fashioned grounds that help carry us back to another era, complete with towering stands, hostile crowds thrust right to the edge of the pitch and the brilliant atmospheres that football should be all about. So, our question to you is what are you favourite football grounds and which are the ones you loathe? We've got a survey at the bottom of this article Let us know what you think in our comments section For Villa fans, Villa Park is always going to be the beating heart of your footballing love affair, even if it does take you hours to get home after a game because of inadequate public transport. What’s more, after all the famous old FA Cup semi-finals hosted by Villa Park in years gone by, plenty of fans of other clubs will feel the same way. But where else do Villa fans feel “at home”. Our Villa man, Ashley Preece, says: “If you ask the majority of Aston Villa fans, Brighton away in the summer sunshine is a tough away-day to beat. The weekenders - the Newcastles, Norwichs and Southamptons - are always well-received given the two-dayers. “Leicester isn't a bad one, either, given the short distance and the fact the away pub - The Counting House - is just over the road. West Bromwich Albion's away end is decent and, again, it's another one down the road while other favourites from days in the Championship include Sheffield Wednesday and Derby County. “Looking ahead to next season, Villa supporters also love a trip to Fulham along the Thames while, since promotion, Tottenham is a must for obvious reasons.” So they are the good grounds, but what of the ones Villans dislike? Ashley adds: “In terms of stadiums and grounds Villa fans loathe, there's a fair few. Wolves at Molineux, they spread away fans across the Steve Bull Stand, meaning it's difficult to stoke up an atmosphere. “Selhurst Park and Crystal Palace isn't well-liked, while it's the same for Turf Moor for Burnley and Everton’s Goodison Park. Elsewhere, many supporters who've been to West Ham's London Stadium won't be revisiting given just how far you are away from the action.” Now it's time for you say.

And when asked how much of a lift it gives him when supporters are chanting his name, Ramsey replied: ""Obviously being a local lad, I’ve been going to Villa Park since I was the age of eight now. ""I know what it’s like to sing those songs, when I was singing about Jack (Grealish), so now for the fans to sing it about me, it gives me a real buzz to go out and play.

They obviously played Liverpool in the final and I was aware of the commentators speaking of the Ramsey brothers, also the Carneys (Chukwuemeka) and Tims (Iroegbunam), those around the game. ""It probably wasn't until Arsenal away where he curled one into the top corner. I really liked the technique of that goal. I think that was the moment where I thought, 'Ooh!' ""To score a goal like that, in an environment like that at Arsenal at that age, that is normally a moment, being a lover of the game, where it makes you think, 'Hang on a minute, this kid might be a player!'

In the must-see chats Withe talks about his career leading up to his crowning moment, scoring the winner in the 1982 European Cup final. His goal - part shin/part foot - against Bayern Munich in Rotterdam on May 26 ensured his place in Villa folklore. In an exclusive excerpt from Gould's series (see the video at the top of this piece), Withe describes the legendary strike in his own words. ""It hit a divot and sat up a little bit,"" smiles Withe. ""Not a lot, but it sat up enough. ""My mind was slow motion, 'make good contact with the ball, just make contact with the ball'. ""People say 'How do you get all that time?'.

Elokobi represented 11 different clubs during his playing career, but his longest spell came at Molineux.

34,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-cardiff-player-ratings-23832762,"Birmingham City player ratings vs Cardiff City: Bela strikes, Bacuna shines but Blues are held","Birmingham City were denied what would have been their first win in five matches by Will Vaulks' late penalty. Jeremie Bela's first goal in seven months gave Blues a lead they held for an hour - but it was not one they could convert. As a result Blues end their away programme with just four wins from 23 attempts, while Cardiff's home record is one of the poorest in the division. Lee Bowyer kept faith with the team which drew at home to Millwall last time out - opting for experience over the chance to give some of the club's young players Championship game-time. That continuity seemed to serve the visitors well in the opening period, the highlight of which was Bela's strike midway through. The excellent Juninho Bacuna was the inspiration for that goal - and much of what Blues did well. The Curaçao international was first to try his luck, with a low, second-minute shot that was straight at Dillon Phillips. Soon after, neat build up play by Lyle Taylor and Maxime Colin saw Bacuna play the ball into the box for Onel Hernandez with his back to goal. The Cuban turned and slid a shot through to the Bluebirds' goalkeeper. The deadlock was broken in the 22nd minute when Colin headed clear a free kick, Bacuna took it down near the centre circle, held off a challenge and sent Bela away with an incisive pass. The Angolan finished well with his left foot, across Phillips. Taylor and Hernandez also tried their luck from just inside the area but their attempts to beat Phillips at his near-post were foiled. The Bluebirds also had their moments, not least on the half hour when Bela skied a clearance back across his own box. Perry Ng took it down and sent in a 20-yard shot that bounced in front of Neil Etheridge and needed pushing aside. Cardiff gathered the rebound, Cody Drameh surged into the area and stabbed a shot straight at the 32-year-old. Just before half time the Blues 'keeper was also well placed to claim Tommy Doyle's 30-yard free kick. Steve Morison made a couple of changes at the break which fortified Cardiff - and but for a couple of headed openings for Gary Gardner, the hosts dictated after the resumption. Indeed they thought they had equalised ten minutes in when Hugill lifted Mark Harris' pass past Etheridge only for the offside flag to go up. To be fair to Blues' defensive shape, though, it was rarely distorted and while the Morison's men applied pressure they didn't overwork Etheridge. In fact Blues had the two best chances on the counter and from set-pieces. First Bacuna's flat corner found Gardner at the back and while his header had plenty of power it lacked accuracy. Then with the game breaking up Hernandez work his way into the box and found sub Jordan James. The teenager hooked his shot wide. The Bluebirds were always going to have one more chance - and it came with eight minutes to go after Max Watters got into the area to latch on to Ng's ball forward. Etheridge came out and caught the striker. Vaulks absolutely hammered the spot-kick high into the corner. 3-4-1-2 Etheridge 7 Produced a good double save on the half hour to deny wing backs Ng and Drameh. Looked pretty solid until near the end when he came from goal and brought down Watters. There was no saving the penalty. Gordon 6.5 On the stretch a bit at times - and booked for pulling back Hugill. But did produce a vital sliding tackle when Hugill threatened to get in and a touch away from the striker to prevent a 71st minute chance at the back post.. Roberts 7 Sharp near post clearance when Doyle tried to find Hugill. Defended pretty well. Won his headers, made his tackles and cleared when needed. Friend 6 Often up against his former Boro team-mate Hugill and made it hard for the striker. Blocked a shot from Drameh in the second half. Colin 6 Keen to get forward involved in some good build-up - and it was his headed clearance that set-up the counter-attack for the opening goal. Sunjic 6 Showed for the ball and put in his tackles. To be fair to him he never stopped working. Gardner 6 A quiet opening 45, notable for an attempt to pick out Phillips' top corner which flew over. Showed up well in both boxes in the second half - although he might have put Blues two-up from a corner. Important late block on Watters shot. Bela 6.5 More involved than he had been against Millwall. Clearly not a natural defender but he applied himself to his defensive responsibilities, showed up in attack and took his goal very well. Bacuna 8* An inventive display from the 24-year-old who not only set-up Bela but worked hard to find space and knit play together around the Cardiff box. Another assist, which is exactly what you want from someone in his position. Taken off after an hour. Taylor 6 The focal point of the team, held the ball up and brought team-mates into play in the first half. Possession dried up in the second though and his influence faded. Hernandez 7 Threatened Cardiff with his pace, had a couple of scuffed shots in the first half. Skinned McGuinness early in the second half which saw the defender booked.

Bailey hobbled off the pitch five minutes before half-time and was replaced by Danny Ings. The former Southampton striker made an instant impact on proceedings as he played the ball to Ollie Watkins, allowing his strike parter to break the deadlock. Ings then scored a goal of his own to double Villa's advantage in second half additional time. And Villa boss Gerrard was delighted with the result, rather than the performance at full-time. He was also deeply frustrated about Bailey's latest injury blow. Gerrard said: ""It’s an ankle issue. In terms of the extent and the damage I’m sure he’ll be MRI scanned in the next 24 to 48 hours. I’m really disappointed and frustrated for him because he’s worked really hard to get back, he’s been training ever so well.

He’s frustrated, we’re frustrated and I’m sure the supporters are as well. ""He said there was a bit of a twist after the contact so we’ll get him looked at. He’s obviously going to be a major doubt for the next game against Burnley because it’s very rare that you come off the pitch and you’re available for the next game, so we are concerned about it.""

Steve Bruce showed his hand for next season from the off against Reading as Albion took to the field back reverting back to the four-man backline that the manager started his stint after replacing Valerien Ismael with. While on paper it could have easily been a three with Semi Ajayi and Dara O'Shea kept from the 0-0 draw with Coventry City while Kyle Bartley came in for Matt Clarke, it was clear from the outset that wasn't the case. O'Shea was the was shifted out to right-back, as was the case earlier in the year when it was deployed, as Ajayi and Bartley remained centrally with Conor Townsend reigned in from wing-back to complete the quartet. As the unlucky one shifted out of position, the Republic of Ireland international took time to adapt initially but grew into the role, particularly going forwards. Ajayi was the pick of the bunch and looks like a key component of deploying the system in future. The Nigeria international was no less influential driving forward with the ball with just Bartley to the left as when overlapping on the right of a back three as against Sky Blues last weekend. The 28-year-old was equally imperious at the back, keeping Lucas Joao out of the game from open play by sticking tightly to the Reading centre-forward and being physical to keep Reading at bay. Ajayi was also adept at covering in behind Bartley when the hosts raced in behind. As far as early returns go, this was a particular positive of the day at the back. David Button was a relative spectator throughout as Reading failed to muster a single shot on target and just six in total as Albion's new look set-up kept them at bay. Just over a fortnight ago, Callum Robinson was withdrawn against Blackpool to be protected from Baggies boo-boys at The Hawthorns for a perceived lack of effort on Good Friday. Today, the 27-year-old's introduction was the spark Albion needed off of the bench to stop the match from meandering towards another 0-0 stalemate. After being summoned from the substitutes bench in added-time against Coventry last weekend, but still managing to win a penalty that gave Albion an opportunity to steal all three points at the death except for Grant's spot-kick woes, Bruce gave Robinson an actual opportunity to make an impact in Berkshire. Replacing Adam Reach in an attacking change for the best part of the final 20 minutes, the Republic of Ireland international offered an instant injection of energy which was exactly what was required. That was no more evident than six minutes after entering the fray. After Jake Livermore pushed up on the halfway line to force a mistake from Reading, Robinson was on hand to collect from the Baggies skipper with room in front to exploit. Whereas others may have dawdled and looked to retain possession, the substitute drove forward with a purpose to keep Reading on the back foot. Grant pulled to the left and, after waiting until all but reaching the penalty area, Robinson fed the striker who himself seemed energized by the introduction to execute a far from simple phase of play to come inside and apply a finish full of composure past Nyland. Robinson could well have played his way into the side from the final day against Barnsley and an opportunity to complete an Albion rehabilitation at The Hawthorns. Returning to form and building momentum into the summer individually can only be a positive for the Birmingham-native. Bruce has spoken in recent weeks about giving youngsters a chance to shine. Therefore, it was somewhat of a surprise that no one under the age of 22-years-old were involved from the off in the penultimate match of the season. There were, though, options off of the bench to be utilised and do that Bruce did. While perhaps forced in its implementation, showing faith in teenage Zac Ashworth for a place on the bench despite Conor Townsend being available to line up from the off was still a decision that had to be made. And, lo and behold, the 19-year-old was called upon perhaps earlier than anyone could have expected. After expectant father to be Townsend twisted an ankle just before the half-time interval which will now require a scan to ascertain its severity, Ashworth's time had come. Emerging after the break to little fanfare due to the nature of the substitution, any Albion fans that weren't there to witness that particular moment were left with a fine performance to recall on the trains back up north. The left-back was assured in possession and ultimately didn't look out of place at all in the first team environment. ",positive

King has spent five years at The Hawthorns since arriving at the club from Hull City in February 2017 but is believed to be serving a notice period ahead of joining the Championship rival next month. Stoke have been rearranging the structure of their hierarchy in recent months following the departure of long-time chief executive Tony Scholes to the Premier League. The Hull-native is a part of the club's management team alongside recently-appointed CEO Ron Gourlay, who arrived in February after the departure of Valerien Ismael. King was involved with setting up the sponsorship deal with current shirt sponsors Ideal Boilers and the introduction of the Boilerman mascot at home games.

Before arriving at Albion and working at hometown club Hull, King entered football for the first time by fighting against administration at Stockport County while they were still a Football League club in Leagues One and Two, which was described as a ""great grounding"".

Lee Bowyer admits he is torn between giving some of Birmingham City’s youngster’s valuable Championship experience and the need to pick up wins on the basis that’s the metric by which he is being judged. Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of the trip to Cardiff City this weekend the head coach summarised the situation thus: “I get judged every week and if I do try to do the right thing by the club and play some youngsters, which has been a positive thing, then we might lose more games than what we should have done and people might judge me on that. So sometimes it’s a no win situation being in my position.” However, he did divulge which of the brightest stars from the Wast Hills academy that have caught his eye and could get a call-up in the final two matches. “He’s a good player who’s developing all of the time, improving all of the time. He’s definitely going to be one for the future. I used him at Preston away, that’s a game that comes off the top of my head. Preston away, he came on, we were losing 1-0 and came on for the last 10 minutes and helped us get a point there, so he’s definitely one.” ""Another one, poor lad, making his first start against QPR at home, done nothing wrong and finished the game, or maybe came off a little towards the end. He was excellent in that game. Then he got injured in that game which we didn’t even know. Then he was out for a long time after that but he’s another one that’s a good player. Lee Bowyer says his future will be decided at the end of the season, with Birmingham City due to play their final away game of the campaign at Cardiff City this weekend. Blues play their last match at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday week. At that point Bowyer says he will meet with chairman Zhao Wenqing to see what happens going forward. Bowyer has 12 months left on the contract he signed when he returned to Blues from Charlton in March 2021. Speaking after the 6-1 hammering at Blackpool the former midfielder admitted his job might not be entirely safe, saying: “I would be stupid to think that my job is as safe as I think it should be.” In the build up to the 2-2 draw with Millwall he added that he wants to speak to the board, with a view to planning for next season. And he has told BBCWM he has not yet been able to do so, instead talking to technical director Craig Gardner. “I have spoken with Craig,” he said. “Obviously I was waiting for a response and I have gone through Craig and Craig is saying that the chairman wants to wait until the end of the season to have a discussion. “Everybody can look at it in whichever way they want, you can look at it in a negative way, in a positive way at the end of the day it’s still my career as well that I have to think about. Cardiff is a town which will always have a footnote in Birmingham City’s history, even if the day when a teenage Darren Carter put the club into the Premiership seems far more than two decades ago. Blues wrap up this season’s away programme in the Welsh capital this weekend, looking for a first ever victory at the Cardiff City Stadium. They make the trip with Lee Bowyer torn between giving the next generation of Blues hopefuls an opportunity and the need to sign off – and send a message to the owners – with a victory. Certainly the thousands of Blues supporters who have spent the last nine months travelling the nation deserve something to smile about. They will find a home side that has lost its last four – and in a similar position, with nothing to play for and wondering how many of their youngsters they can afford to name in the starting XI. Predicting either side is virtually impossible. Bowyer has noted the irony that for once he has a virtually full strength squad to choose from. Only Tahith Chong, his best player, seems set to miss out through injury. Kristian Pedersen and Taylor Richards are available and the Blues head coach wonders how much work experience he can afford to dole out whilst retaining a competitive XI. To that end it would be something of a surprise to see him make huge changes both in personnel and formation, so either a 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 feels like the most likely system, with one of two younger players in from the start and others introduced off the bench. The relationship between Birmingham City and the HerGameToo movement is still in its infancy but Blues ambassador Emily Drakeley says she has already seen big progress. Indeed it was little more than a month ago that Blues confirmed their partnership with the project, dedicating their home match with Middlesbrough to publicise issues around sexist abuse and the experience female supporters have at football grounds. The match day programme, Blues News, carried a QR code to the HerGameToo report line, while there were posters around the ground to promote the cause and future plans include free sanitary products. Talks about further progress that can be made next season have already started. The developments come just under 12 months after the movement was launched by a dozen co-founders intent on raising awareness of sexist abuse. They did so by releasing a video on FA Cup Final day in which they highlighted the problems they’ve had watching the men’s game. Emily says Blues have pledged support while also taking guidance from the campaign: “Being part of the HerGameToo co-founders has allowed me to be a part of this campaign since the beginning,” she said. “My aim was always to get Birmingham City involved as soon as possible. “I was honoured when Birmingham City signed up to the initiative. This is something that is so important to me and to many others that I know within the fanbase. Birmingham City is a great club and one I am so pleased to be representing. I’ve had difficulties being a female football fan and I am dedicated to addressing these issues and making the whole footballing world better for everyone.” Cardiff City will have Uche Ikpeazu available to face Birmingham City in their final home match of the Championship season this weekend. The powerful striker, on loan from Middlesbrough, is an option for boss Steve Morison after missing out against his parent club on Wednesday evening. Left back Joel Bagan also missed the defeat at the Riverside. Ikpeazu made a strong start to his City career with three early goals but he has only started one of his 13 league matches. He did, however, play against Blues at the Riverside and his physicality caused them problems before he hobbled off before half time. Morison also hopes to have Isaak Davies after he also missed out against Boro and the previous match at Sheffield United. However, the Bluebirds will be without experienced midfielder Joe Ralls, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the season by a tight groin. Sean Morrison is another definite absentee having suffered a serious knee injury in February, while former Blues striker Issac Vassell has not featured for Cardiff since August 2019 and is in the final few weeks of his Cardiff contract. Cardiff come into the game on the back of four straight losses – yet still sit three points above Blues in 19th place. The visitors arrive with an almost completely fit squad – with Tahith Chong the only doubt. Kristian Pedersen and Taylor Richards are available again after missing out last weekend. ",positive

The winger is back after his recent hamstring struggles and the Birmingham City boss wants the Dutchman back for a full campaign next term. Bowyer, 45, held his pre-Cardiff City media briefing from Wast Hills this afternoon and he's everything he told the broadcasters. You wanted a reaction after Blackpool and you got one against Millwall. Has that continued into this week? Yeah, when players perform the way they did it showed good character, good spirit and, most importantly, they care. Around the training ground this week, it's been the same. I've just said to the players there, it's takes a lot of courage for what you've done (vs Millwall). It could have easily gone the other way but they understand that for their own pride, you know. It's been a good week. READ MORE: Birmingham City interested in 'new Cafu' as Blues chief issues update on St Andrew's repairs READ MORE: How Riley McGree is doing since leaving Birmingham City for Middlesbrough Both teams are safe, these games about professional pride now? Yeah. And again, what I've reminded the players this morning is that you play for your own pride because you've got two games to go and people are always watching. You're always being judged. If you do well in the next two games, we have players who are out of contract [Pedersen, Bela, Trueman, plus loanees Taylor, Richards, Hernandez, Mengi, Chong] and it could get them a move somewhere else. We've also got players who have a year or two left and they want to extend their contract. We've got young players who are always being judged and watched because the bigger clubs want to take the younger players. The most important thing is to play with pride. You can easily go the other way and say, 'Ah, the season's finished' and just tick over. When it comes to match day and, if you have that winning mentality and that fight in your belly, that should never happen. Started the season with a win at Sheffield United, be great to do that in the last away game... There's been a lot of positives from this season. Sheffield United away, nobody would have predicted us to go there and upset them in the way we did. We won 1-0 and it could have been more. We had a great away day at Luton to win five there. We've had some good performances home and away. We lost against Fulham at home. Everybody got a standing ovation and got clapped off the pitch. There's been some good times, you know. There's been a lot of young players who have played this season; 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds. They're young kids to be given a chance in today's game. We've had a lot of them this season. That's building for the future. There's been a lot of positives. Thought about bringing younger lads into the fold for Saturday? Yeah, it's a difficult situation to be in because, at the end of the day, I tried it at Blackpool and, looking at the two results at the back-end of the season, you look at the score lines coming off the Blackpool result and we all get judged. This is my career as well and, of course, I want to give youngsters an opportunity and be able to say, 'Do you know what, it doesn't matter about the result' but people care about the result. We see that after the Blackpool game because we were safe then as well. Them sort of results hurt. It's a difficult situation to be in but, of course, I want to keep giving them minutes, the young lads. Nico's still playing but there are others I want to introduce more in the next couple of games and give them more game time, for sure. But it has to be done right. Cardiff, they've lost their last four, what are you expecting? It's going to be tough. They've got some good players and have brought some decent loan players. Watching their game last night, they've got a big turnover of players happening this summer. I didn't see their players quitting last night, I seen them working hard for the manager. They're good on set-pieces, as we know, because they done us at our place in injury time to get the draw. That was a game I thought was done and we had won. We have to the right things and not concentrate on them. They've played about four or five different formations in the last few games so it's hard to predict what they're going to do. It's about us, how we're going to impose ourselves on them and how we believe we can hurt them. Concentrating on ourselves has been a big thing for me. Will we see Tahith Chong this weekend? Tahith has obviously been training this week but I don't want to take any risks with him. I think that will be unfair to him and to us, you know. He's a young lad with a big future in front of him. I want to make sure he's right when I do play him again. This one might be too quick for him and save him for the last home game so everyone can show their appreciation for what he's brought to us. Any other injury concerns or knocks going into Saturday? No. Kristian wasn't around last weekend but he's back now. Taylor's back from illness as well. It's good to have everyone available - just in time for holiday! Backed by another sold-out away end, message to fans? I just want to thank them. I can't thank them enough. Every time that we've travelled, they've been there in their numbers and haven't stopped singing no matter what the result. I promise them that this performance and effort will be better than the last one. My message is thanks, appreciate it and at times I've stood on the side and get goosebumps. I'm really grateful and so are the players for their support this year. ",positive

Of course, Blues fans have something of a love-hate relationship with St Andrew’s for a while now, or at least with those people tasked with keeping the famous old ground in reasonably decent nick. Blues have been operating at a reduced capacity for the whole of the 2021/2022 campaign, with the ground requiring expensive remedial works. But whatever the rights and wrongs behind the problems at St Andrew’s, it remains the their spiritual home and means just as much to most supporters as the swankiest of big-money stadiums at the likes of Spurs and Arsenal.

These days, as more and more modern stadia spring up across the country, another category of favourite springs to mind - those old-fashioned grounds that help carry us back to another era, complete with towering stands, hostile crowds thrust right to the edge of the pitch and the brilliant atmospheres that football should be all about. So, our question to you is what are you favourite football grounds and which are the ones you loathe? For Blues fans, St Andrew’s is always going to be the beating heart, even if two of those heart chambers aren’t even functioning at present. The reopening of the lower tiers in the Kop and Tilton stands cannot come quickly enough because something needs to be done about the atmosphere. But where else do Blues fans feel ‘at home’? Blues writer Brian Dick says: “The recent trip to Blackpool, a sunny Easter weekend by the seaside, was a real opportunity for 3,500 supporters to let their hair down. Unfortunately the team let them down too. “The biennial trips to yo-yo club Fulham are always fun, Blues take a huge following and pack out the away end. Crossing the city to the other place is always something to look forward to. Derby away is always, always eventful.” So they are the good grounds, but what of the ones Blues fans dislike? Brian adds: “In terms of stadiums Blues fans loathe, it depends to be more a personal thing. Reading away is pretty soulless, matches tend to be midweek 8pm kick-offs in a half empty gr0und. “Blackburn’s Ewood Park is always cold and Hull is a long journey, there’s nothing remarkable about the ground and results are always terrible. Elsewhere, West Ham’s London Stadium isn’t really fit for purpose as a football venue.” Now it's time for you say. If the survey below doesn't load, click here.

Fosun frontman Shi has come under-fire from supporters over the club’s lack of spending in recent transfer windows. Head coach Lage missed out on multiple targets in the summer window, while Wolves’ January business is likely to be dependent on what they can rake in through sales. Supporters’ frustrations have been tempered by Wolves’ impressive start to the season with a 1-0 win over Manchester United on Monday lifting the team up to eighth in the Premier League.

Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoring with a first half penalty having missed an earlier spot-kick. Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma piled on the misery for Wolves after half-time with well taken goals. Wolves have now lost seven of their last 10 Premier League games and missed another opportunity to draw level on points with seventh-placed West Ham. Bruno Lage’s team face Chelsea, Manchester City, Norwich City and Liverpool in their remaining four fixtures. READ: Bruno Lage given nightmare injury blow during Wolves vs Brighton READ: Bruno Lage confirms plan for Wolves loan players ahead of summer window Jose Sa 5 Sa can hold his head high after keeping the score down in the first half. He made a stunning save from Trossard moments after Mac Allister had struck the post with the first penalty, and he came within a whisker of stopping the second spot-kick. Willy Boly 3 Boly gave Brighton a helping hand with a clumsy challenge on Welbeck which resulted in the second penalty. He didn’t cover himself in glory all afternoon in comfortably his worst display of the season. Conor Coady 3 The captain hasn’t had many bad days this season, but Wolves’ lack of organisation at the back will be giving him sleepless nights. They were hopeless against Brighton and can count themselves lucky to have not lost by more. Trossard whipped the ball around Coady to score Brighton’s second. Romain Saiss 3 Wolves were two goals down when Saiss started trying to beat his man with stepovers inside his own box. The response from the crowd, understandably, was one of anger. Saiss can probably count himself a tad unfortunate with the first penalty, but his performance was poor based on what he’s produced previously this season. He constantly gave the ball away and created problems for his teammates. Nelson Semedo 5 Semedo has been hugely influential going forward this season, but he struggled to find any space on the right flank against Brighton. His game was cut short due to a hamstring injury at the beginning of the second half. Leander Dendoncker 3 Dendoncker was asked to play as a hybrid between a midfielder and a right winger to begin with, and it didn’t work. He gave the ball away in crucial areas and wasn’t his usual destructive self in midfield. Ruben Neves 5 It was a brave call by Lage to start Neves, who had only trained a handful of times after six weeks out with a knee injury. Despite his lack of recent football, Neves was one of Wolves’ best performers in a drab first half showing. He was taken off at half-time as Lage brought on Neto and Jimenez. Joao Moutinho 4 Moutinho at least found his targets with his passes, but the veteran Portuguese continues to look lost whenever Neves isn’t alongside him. Moutinho completely lost control of the game after half-time. Rayan Ait-Nouri 4 The youngster was positive going forward and got himself into some good positions, but his delivery was awful on more than one occasion. Ait-Nouri’s chances are becoming less frequent, so he only has himself to blame when he’s dropped at Stamford Bridge. Fabio Silva 5 The youngster deservedly kept his place in the team after three good performances. But Silva’s goal record makes him an easy target for Lage when he’s looking to make changes and the striker was hooked at half-time. Hwang Hee-chan 3 Hwang was incredibly fortunate to be named in Wolves’ starting line-up for the third successive game and he offered very little threat once more. His touch was woeful at times in the second half and one miscontrolled ball led to him making a foul and getting booked. Pedro Neto (for Neves, 46) 7 Showed a bit of endeavour to cause Brighton problems and fired across a few dangerous deliveries from out wide. He hit the post at the death too. Raul Jimenez (for Silva, 46) 4 There’s very little evidence at the moment to suggest Jimenez should play ahead of Silva. Jonny Castro Otto (for Semedo, 53) 5 Nowhere near his usual high standards after replacing Semedo off the bench. Not used: Ruddy, Marcal, Toti, Cundle, Trincao, Chiquinho ",positive

The ex-Newcastle and Sunderland midfielder has had a nomadic last few months coaching in Africa and the Middle East. After a year or so out of the game the 49-year-old was made head coach of Al-Merrikh, only to resign from the Sudanese club three months later. He was named head coach of Omani club Al-Ittihad in November but a couple of months later it was revealed he had returned to Al-Merrikh after they sacked Brazilian coach Leonardo Neiva without taking charge of a game. At least Clark got to do that, indeed he produced three wins, three losses and a draw in his seven match tenure. But the last of those came last week as Al Merrikh lost 3-1 to Egypt’s Al Ahly in the African Champions League, which left them bottom of Group A and unable to progress to the quarter-finals of the African Champions League.

On this day in 2014 the popular defender etched his name in club folklore when he headed a stoppage time equaliser to give Blues a 2-2 draw at Bolton - and the point they needed to dodge relegation. It was an iconic goal that sparked wild celebrations, made all the more memorable for Caddis’ topless shirt-whirling euphoria and at the end Lee Clark’s passionate sprint towards the visiting supporters. But speaking in 2018 Caddis has recalled how an idea conceived days before, during an orderly build-up to the match, helped inspire Blues. “The gaffer had asked secretary Rita Greenaway to contact the players’ families to see if they would record messages for us - and he played them to us in the hotel the night before. “They told us how proud they were of us and that we had their support - and that kind of reminded you of what you were playing for. “I helped us relax a bit more but also made you realise that we were doing it for the people behind the scenes who might lose their jobs or struggle to pay their mortgage or whatever. “For Lee Clark to have done that was a really good touch.” But even on that afternoon the road was still long for Blues as they went a goal down - and then ironically Lukas Jutkiewicz made it 2-0 with only 14 minutes to go. “As soon as we kicked off it was just a case of - get one back and go from there. Thankfully Ziggy [Nikola Zigic] did that.” But the real drama was to come. The game was deep into added time when a Zigic header was kept out and the ball looped invitingly back to Caddis. “For three or four seconds the weight just lifted off your shoulders. I remember thinking 'I needed to waste as much time as possible'. “I’d taken my shirt off and I knew I was going to get booked so I thought I’d run back into our half so the referee would have to come a long way. “I was also conscious of the fact Darren Randolph had been in tears after he let big Juke’s shot through his legs - he thought he’d cost us, so I went for him too.” Blues managed to see out the remainder of the game and a story-line for the ages had been written. The Scot, who now plays for Swindon, wil forever be remembered - and the game will go down as the most dramatic in Clark's tenure. “It’s a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life.” And he’s not the only one.

O'Shea 's first two starts since returning from a fractured ankle were in the role too, in back-to-back late February defeats to Middlesbrough and Swansea City. During the latter of those two, the Republic of Ireland international was substituted for Darnell Furlong and didn't feature in the first team in six of the next seven as West Brom reverted to a back three, leaving O'Shea on the substitutes bench.

I take the responsibility of playing him there when I probably needed to play him at centre-back to ease him back in, but I’ve got no problem with him playing right-back. “But therein lies the problem with the squad.

The former Liverpool striker joined the Baggies on a free transfer in January after his short-term deal with Reading expired. He has since gone on to score three goals in 15 Championship appearances. Although Carroll has not been hugely prolific in front of goal, he has impressed with his general play in leading the line and has been arguably the team's top performer since arriving as injury cover for Daryl Dike.

Villa were linked with midfielders such as Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in the January window but a move failed to materialise. Moving into the summer, Gerrard has outlined the priority for his recruitment team as he looks to bolster the midfield options within his squad, as he aims to sign a player capable of playing as a 'number six' this summer. Speaking on the impact a signing such as this could have on current Villa midfielder John McGinn, Gerrard stated: ""John likes to be a bit more of a free spirit. But it was a priority in the last window to make a six happen but we couldn’t possibly do that, it wasn’t right, the timing wasn’t right. READ MORE:   Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer ""So we have to be patient for the right thing in the long run. But with different personnel around John we’re hoping to give him some more freedom."" A player ahead of the defence to offer both an added layer of security but also help progress the team is clearly at the top of the list for Gerrard, so here is four players he could sign to fill this void in the squad: Boubacar Kamara Christian Purslow (chief executive), Johan Lange (sporting director) and Gerrard himself were all present for Olympique de Marseille's fixture against Nantes recently to watch the Boubacar Kamara, who will be out of contract come the end of the season. The 22-year-old offers the composure, defensive instinct and reading of the game to perfectly orchestrate and solidify the midfielder for Gerrard's side. However, the club will likely face a line of competitors queuing up to secure his long-term future this summer given his talents. Christian Norgaard No player across Europe's top five leagues has made more tackles than Brentford's Christian Norgaard (121), with the player also ranking sixth in midfield pressures (349). He clearly offers a reinforcement defensively but can also be relied upon to progress the team forward with just under five progressive passes per game averaged. Villa have dealt with Brentford before whilst bringing Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa to the club and could look to delve into their pool of talent once again here to sign the 28-year-old Danish international. Kalvin Phillips The 26-year-old England international is valued at around £60 million by Leeds United and it comes as no surprise given the services he offers within the midfield. Both Villa and Manchester United have been credited with an interest in the player but could see the price tag drastically reduced if Leeds do drop into the Championship this summer, given the likelihood that Phillips would actively pursue a move away from the club if they did drop into the second tier of English football. Phillips ranks in the top one percent of midfielder across Europe's top five leagues for pressures (30) and the top three percent for blocks (2.5) and tackles (3.8), outlining the clear benefit signing him would have on Gerrard's current midfield. Wilfred Ndidi In terms of players who would anchor the midfield and allow the talent to thrive around him, it would be hard to find someone better suited to the role than Leicester City's Wilfred Ndidi. The 25-year-old Nigerian midfielder ranks in the top ten percent for aerials won (2.6) per game, clearances (3.4), interceptions (2.7) and tackles (4.2) across Europe and Villa would have to pay a price in the region of £50 million if they were to acquire a player of this calibre. Commenting on the rumours linking him with a move in the summer, Ndidi stated: “At the moment I am enjoying myself in Leicester,"" he replied. My family is here. My business degree is on hold. There was lockdown and then my daughter was born. I am looking forward to it maybe next year.” ",positive
53,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-transfers-loan-summer-23842280,Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season,"Aston Villa have used the loan market to great effect in developing their current crop of exciting prospects within the squad throughout the 2021/22 season and could be set to replicate this once again. Cameron Archer, Keinan Davis, Louie Barry, Kaine Kesler Hayden are just a few of the names that have thrived when given the chance of regular game time throughout the lower divisions in English football. This route could pave the way for either a return to the squad under Steven Gerrard's watchful eye like Archer, or an opportunity at securing a permanent move away from the club, like Davis at Nottingham Forest. Whether it leads to Villa receiving an increased transfer fee or a more confident young player, the loan market is a vital asset for this club given the talent it is currently producing within the academy. Ahead of the 2022/23 BirminghamLive have looked at five more academy prospects that could look to secure a loan move away next season to continue their development. READ MORE:   Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer Ben Chrisene The 18-year-old left-back recently has made the bench on five occasions for Steven Gerrard but is yet to make his Premier League debut with both Lucas Digne and Ashley Young preferred to him at this current stage of the season given his inexperience. The Villa boss has been keen to outline the hopes he has for the player after stating this regarding his development moving forward: ""Really good prospect and we’re really excited to try to help him become a Premier League player."" Chrisene has played senior football in both the FA Cup for Villa and two appearances for Exeter before making the switch to Birmingham in 2020. A loan move to offer the player regular football in a senior side could be key in ensuring the development plans the club have for him are fulfilled. Aaron Ramsey The younger brother of one of the hottest prospect in English football, Jacob Ramsey, is none other than the equally as promising Aaron Ramsey. Currently on loan at League One side Cheltenham Town where he has started nine games since January, recording one assist and his first goal in the Football League just over a week ago against Bolton Wanderers. Ramsey has shown his quality against senior opponents both on loan and in the U21s side in the EFL Trophy, where he recorded one goal and one assist in the 4-2 win against Milton Keynes Dons in October. The 19-year-old could benefit from another loan move possibly in the Championship next season. Caleb Chukwuemeka Prior to departing for Scottish Premiership side Livingstone in January, Chukwuemeka was in red hot form for the U23s side at Villa with seven goals and six assists in eight starts across the PL2 division. However, the loan move currently hasn't gone to plan in Scotland with just 102 minutes recorded across six appearances as a substitute in the league. Speaking on the loan move for Chukwuemeka, Livingstone boss commented on the players first start for the side which led to him being substituted after just 45 minutes of action against Ross County. David Martindale stated: ""The boy has talent, there is no doubt about that, I've seen it in training. I can coach him into how I want him to play. He needs to work on the intensity and the fitness because you could see maybe in the transition the application wasn't quite there. ""That's up to me as a coach to work on that. I think he'll be a very good player for us but as with most foreign players and also English players coming up, I think they get a massive shock. Through both an injury to his hamstring and a struggle to adapt to the coaching ethos from his new boss, the loan move hasn't been a success for Chukwuemeka and could benefit from a new situation next season in order for the talent he possesses to shine through in a senior side. Kerr Smith The 17-year-old defender was recently promoted to first team training after signing from Dundee United in the same transfer window which saw Philippe Coutinho arrive through the door. Smith has played senior football before after making ten appearances for Dundee and could benefit from getting regular game time in the lower divisions within English football. Louie Barry Barry has had a mixed experience whilst out on loan this season after failing to settle at League One side Ipswich Town after arriving at the beginning of the season. The 18-year-old attacker made just one league start for the Tractor Boy's before returning to Villa in January. Barry then dropped down into League Two after signing for Swindon Town and has gone on to thrive throughout the second loan spell. With six goals and one assist in 11 starts, Barry is beginning to display the talents that many thought he would during his time in League One. He now has the confidence and development to build on next season which could see him benefit from another loan move within League One to test himself against greater opponents on a regular basis.

Leon Bailey and Emi Buendia also arrived, but they have all struggled to settle for one reason or another. For Ings, who scored just his sixth goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Norwich City on Saturday, he has battled with injury niggles and a lack of match fitness as a result throughout the campaign.

No matter who the manager picks we all have a responsibility to create and help each other out, provide goals and assists. For me it is about working hard each game, whether I am starting or coming on."" When asked about Villa's inconsistent season, Ings replied: ""It has been a strange season. It is always difficult. We have changed managers and a lot of things have happened. But ultimately we are trying to improve individually and as a team. Hopefully we can finish the season strong."" Much has been said about Villa's struggles to fit both Ings and Ollie Watkins in the same team, but Steven Gerrard believes it can work and he has proven the duo can hit up a relationship on the pitch. They combined to score their first goal together in the 4-0 win over Southampton back in March, and managed to do it again in the win over the Canaries last time out. ""When strikers come together, things do take time,"" Ings added. ""We have had some really nice moments linking up. We have plenty to work on and keep building on but ultimately, the direction we want to go as a team, it is not just down to us to score the goals.

Speaking previously of Villa's plans to expand their club portfolio to mirror what clubs such as Man City and Chelsea have achieved in Europe, Purslow said: ""This next phase is more global, to try and put Aston Villa at the heart of an international talent development, talent recruitment model for professional footballers. This will see the club investing in different regions and territories around the world where talent is not accessible directly by Aston Villa under the current rules and regulations.

Gerrard wants to add more quality to his squad in the coming months and will be handed the funds necessary to continue building his team. In January, Villa recruited Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne, Calum Chambers and Robin Olsen to bolster Gerrard's squad in for the second half of the season. But much like the first five months of the season, Villa have been on good runs of form and also very worrying spells too. Dean Smith was sacked for losing five in a row back in November, and the club are currently in their worst run of form since then, having lost four of their last five and are without a win in that time.

And Villa's spending shows no signs of letting up, after owners NSWE have already spent over £350million on transfer fees alone since the club was promoted back to the top-flight in 2019. In fact, since the 2012/13 season, only eight clubs across Europe have spent more than Villa. The CIES Football Observatory has recorded the net spends of clubs across Europe since the 2012/13 season and their results are staggering. In at number one and two are the two Manchester clubs, United and City. Man United are the only club in Europe to have recorded a net spend of over €1billiion since the 2012/13 campaign, while City register a figure of € 984million, according to theCIES Football Observatory study. Their report concludes that PSG, Barcelona and Arsenal make up the rest of the top five. While Italian giants Juventus and AC Milan are then followed by Everton and Villa, in ninth place - with a £424million net send - one place in front of Chelsea.

Fans, meanwhile, have been warned of severe delays due to the upcoming Storm Eunice with forecasters warning of 100mph winds which is expected to cause disruption to road and rail networks from Friday onwards. Travel disruption to and from Villa Park continues to be troublesome with poor transport links believed to be one of the main reasons why Villa have delayed their hotly-anticipated stadium expansion proposals. Back in November and, following Steven Gerrard's first match in charge against Brighton, Villa supporters hit out at ""chaotic and shambolic"" train services as hundreds upon hundreds were forced to queue for hours in freezing conditions. *TAKE PART IN OUR VILLA TRAVEL SURVEY BELOW The issue was picked up by Villa chief executive Christian Purslow and he was quick to address supporters while outlining how travel and transport to Villa Park remains a stumbling block in terms of wanting to increase capacity. ""I want to make fans aware that there's an urgent consideration that forms part of our stadium thinking and that's transportation,"" he said. ""Those fans who found themselves recently really struggling to get away from the ground after matches need to know that I'm on the case. ""I think fans that have gone to the trouble of using public transport, trying to get away on local trains, finding themselves queuing in the freezing-cold for way too long, actually danger trying to squeeze into platforms that are too small for trains that arrive too infrequently. ""It really does need to change and we are putting all of our best efforts into trying to persuade local authorities that they need to really improve that aspect of infrastructure around Villa Park because, let's face it, if the local authorities can't get our fans away safely and quickly after games with a 42,000 crowd, imagine what it would be if we were to go to 50,000 without that improvement being in place. ""Those fans that have been through it - I'm sorry you've had to experience that, it's unacceptable, and I'm in discussion with local authorities about how they can improve that as soon as possible."" Since the beginning of 2022, West Midlands Railway has reiterated that improvements have been made to match day rail services around Villa Park. On Saturday following the Watford fixture, there's five trains from Witton back into Birmingham New Street between 5pm and 6pm while, at Aston, there's trains at 01 and 32 past the hour post-match on the Cross-City line back to Lichfield. In terms of supporters driving, motorists have explained to BirminghamLive of the ""nightmare"" they're facing to get back on the Aston Expressway and the M6, while ongoing roadworks around Perry Barr continue to be incredibly problematic. This week, Birmingham City Council apologised to drivers stuck in ""horrendous"" queues along the A34 in Perry Barr because of a new traffic management layout. The council has now admitted there have been ""teething problems"" and engineers were resetting the temporary traffic signals, in order to minimise delays. The situation is set to worsen from 7pm on Saturday (February 19) until 6am the following Tuesday (February 22) when Birchfield Island - situated less than a mile away from Villa Park - is closed.

If Villa have designs to have a 50,000-capacity stadium and for that to be an enjoyable experience at Villa Park to park and leave easily, there's so much work to be done!

Debbie Beamond told us: ""I travel from Norton Canes, Staffordshire, by car. It's fine getting there but getting out is a nightmare as roads are gridlocked for at least an hour after the match. The island at Witton Road is ridiculous. It needs traffic management. The works at Perry Barr flyover are making it worse.""

Villa supporter Chris White added: ""Worst ground to get away from, feel like it's got worse in recent months, too. Trains are farcical and regularly depart half empty, parking is non-existent and roadworks in and around the city centre cause gridlock near the ground.""

Withe was as synonymous for wearing sweatbands as he was for scoring goals during Villa’s 1980s glory days. The revered No.9 used to use the bands to keep his brow clean for banging in bullet headers as he achieved iconic status in claret and blue. And now the lovable 66-year-old has revealed how the garments helped to calm a hostile Besiktas crowd during Villa’s 1983 European Cup campaign. Villa had to play the first round first leg at Villa Park behind closed doors in September 1982 as a punishment for trouble at their European Cup semi final win at Anderlecht five months earlier. Withe, Tony Morley and Dennis Mortimer scored in a 3-1 home victory to give Tony Barton’s men the upper hand over Besiktas - before the daunting second leg in Turkey. The first game might have been played in front of an empty Villa Park - but for the away match there were 45,00 fervent supporters. Withe takes up the story: “It was funny, we played in a game against Besiktas which we had to play behind closed doors in a European match. “We beat them and then we had to go there to play. “I’d played at this stadium for England and it was a really hostile stadium, I mean really hostile. “I remember the hotel was right on the top of the hill overlooking this stadium. I think it was an 8 o’clock kick off.

I open the curtains and the stadium’s full. Absolutely rammed. “I’m thinking ‘Have I got the kick off time wrong here?’ “So I run downstairs I say ‘What’s going on?’ They say ‘No, no it’s an 8 o’clock kick off, it’s first come first served, so they've all gone into the stadium. “We get down to the stadium and the bus is getting pushed and everything’s happening. All of a sudden we end up with this hostile crowd. “We come out onto the pitch and they’re pelting us with things because we’ve won the first game. “I looked to the side and I thought to myself ‘Ok, I understand now’. So I went downstairs and I said to Jim Paul, the kitman, ‘How many sweatbands have you brought? You need to give them to players’. “So we’ve got sweatbands, tie pins, all this different memorabilia. “I said ‘When we come out behind the goal, look to the left’. “The crowd were giving us so much stick, and at the front were all people in wheelchairs so we went over and started giving them all these things. “We played out a 0-0 draw and the crowd was okay!” It wasn’t the first or last time Withe would use his popular wristbands for bargaining purposes. He often used to exchange them for sweets - and once left the Villa Park pitch with fish juice running down his bare arms after swapping the bands for a trout! “I wore them at Newcastle and when I came to Villa the kitman was Jim Paul and I’d said to him ‘Do you have sweatbands and things and he said ‘Yes, what do you want me to get you? “I told him I like wearing sweatbands because I sweat a lot. I like them to wipe my brow. “He asked the shop to supply them then Evo (Allan Evans) started wearing them as well. “Jim just made sure we had an abundance of sweatbands, sometimes I’d wear a set until half time and then change them because they were all sweaty. “At the end of the game I started a tradition of throwing the sweatbands into the crowd, so everyone just expected it. “I had a friend of mine who was a builder who used to always be in that far side in the old Witton Lane near the Holte End. “It was always in that corner and he had eight tickets so he always had different family members at games. “He used to come round to my house and he’d say ‘I’ve got someone coming down from such and such a place, is there any chance you can come over and give him the sweatbands?’ “That’s how it started. I’d give him the sweatbands and he’d give me a bag of sweets. “He would always buy sweets for the family. If it’s an exciting game there’d be loads of sweets left and if it’s a dull game everyone eats the sweets. “So he’d give me this bag of sweets which I used to take home and dish out to the kids. “One day, I always remember, he used to go fishing and he said to me ‘Do you like fish?’. I said ‘yeah’. “He gave me this bag and I said ‘Flipping hell, that’s a bit heavy isn’t it?’. “I was walking off the pitch and this thing ran across my arm. It was a trout that he’d put in the bag he’d brought it to the match. “So that’s how the sweatbands thing started!” Withe was speaking to promote his autobiography All For The Love of The Game which is released on November 23. It will be on sale at WHSmiths in Solihull. Copies can also be ordered from Withe’s official Facebook page www.facebook.com/peterwitheofficial.

Remarkably, Villa came into this one having lost four of their last seven games against sides bottom of the table, which is more than they had in their first 37 such games. They did of course win their previous match against the bottom Premier League club by beating Norwich 2-0 in the reverse fixture this season. Gerrard has now done the double over two managers as Villa boss, against Graham Potter and Smith, as he claimed his ninth win as head coach in his 21st game in charge. Gerrard called for an 'aggressive, front-foot performance' against the Canaries, but was made to wait until the 20th minute before the game's first opening. It was Leon Bailey's effort which got bums off seats for the first time in the contest as he was denied by an outstanding save from Tim Krul. The Norwich goalkeeper got fingertips to his effort from outside of the box as the Jamaica international bent the ball in search of the top corner. Seven minutes later and Villa 'keeper Martinez was called into action to prevent Milot Rashica's effort from range. In a first half devoid of chances for either side, Gerrard would have been far from the happier manager going into the interval if the score stayed level. But after Bailey was forced off the pitch due to injury and was replaced by Danny Ings, the former Southampton striker carved open the best chance of the half in the 41st minute. His ball over the top for Watkins worked a treat as Brandon Williams slipped over and allowed the striker to get a shot off at goal from inside the box. With the help from a deflection off Sam Byram, Watkins' effort fired past Krul to hand Villa a much-needed advantage minutes before the break. Villa kicked off looking to win five Premier League games in a row against another club for the first time since they achieved that feat against local rivals Birmingham City between October 2005 and April 2010 - they were surely favourites to beat Norwich today, but Gerrard's side were made to work hard for the three points. The second half started as the first had ended with Villa the more likely of the two teams to score the next goal. Ings struck the post with a header after coming close following a neat interchange with Watkins moments before then. The striker's introduction made Villa a whole lot more threatening in the second half. Norwich played with poise in the closing stages of the second period, but Villa held out for the win and doubled their advantage late on as Ings got his deserved goal. The Canaries are now winless in their last nine top-flight visits to Villa Park. Gerrard's team will travel to Turf Moor to face a Burnley side fighting for their life at the foot of the Premier League table next weekend. Emi Martinez - 7 Reliable as ever, Martinez kept his 11th clean sheet of the campaign and his second in a row following on from the 0-0 draw against Leicester last weekend. The Argentine was first called into action in the 27th minute to deny a fine effort from Rashica and was hardly called upon in the second period. Matty Cash - 6 Cash provided good width while Villa were in possession and looked to form an effective link with Bailey down the right channel until the winger came off injured. The Poland international is a player who has come on a lot over the past few months after a sticky spell of form towards the back end of the year. He will be a key part of Gerrard's first XI next season and is keen to end the campaign with a flourish. Calum Chambers - 7 He replaced Ezri Konsa in the starting side and performed well. It was a solid showing from Chambers who helped Mings keep Pukki quiet throughout. The 27-year-old stepped up this afternoon and could keep his shirt for the trip to Burnley next weekend. Tyrone Mings - 8 Mings was a dominating presence for Villa. He won all his battles and kept a lid on things at the back. An impressive showing from the skipper. Lucas Digne - 6 Made a recovery from a collarbone injury to start his 11th game for the club. Digne showed what Villa were missing in his absence with accurate crosses from the left flank, but he is still developing a relationship with Coutinho, who was frustrated when the Frenchman wasn't available for the overlap on a few occasions in the first half. Tim Iroegbunam - 7 The 18-year-old made his first Premier League start this afternoon and looked the part. He replaced Douglas Luiz in that number six role, despite the fact that the Brazilian has started 19 of Villa's last 20 games, having only missed out on the starting XI three times under Gerrard. The club are looking to sign a new holding midfielder this summer, but the Villa boss would have been impressed with Iroegbunam's classy showing. Every tackle he made was met with loud cheers from home fans. John McGinn - 7 McGinn was all-action and set the tone for Villa against Norwich. The Scot kept good distances between himself and youngster Iroegbunam at the heart of midfield, not letting Norwich's creative players get a look in for the most part. Jacob Ramsey - 7 Fresh from signing a bumper five-year contract extension, Ramsey was in the mood this afternoon. Knocking off passes, collecting the ball and driving at Norwich players, the 20-year-old has it all in his locker and Gerrard is so excited to see how he develops over the coming years. He combined well with Coutinho and Digne when he buzzed around the left-hand side of the pitch. Philippe Coutinho - 6 Coutinho had been criticised for failing to find that cutting edge to his game in recent weeks as his productivity tailed off in tandem with Villa's poor run of form. His last goal contribution came in the 3-0 win at Leeds, which was of course the last time Villa had won before losing four of their next five games, and they scored just twice in that time. He threatened to make an impact against Norwich, but struggled to take the game by the scruff of the neck like fans know that he can. Leon Bailey - 5 Gerrard said pre-match that he wanted to keep giving the Jamaica international more opportunities to get 'into his own rhythm' and he started his second consecutive game against Norwich this afternoon. He looked lively in spells, but we're still yet to see the winger at his very best in claret and blue. He came off injured in the first half which will come as a huge disappointment for the Villa boss. Ollie Watkins - 8 One of several players who were signed by Smith when he was manager of Villa, but Watkins was a player that the former boss loved to work with above most. He showed Smith what a mature Premier League striker he has developed into today, as he netted his ninth goal of the campaign. Linked play effectively with Ings when he replaced Bailey off the bench. Danny Ings on for Leon Bailey, 40 minutes - 8 Ings made an instant impact by assisting Watkins for his opening goal. He's clearly the back-up option to Watkins, but he has so much to offer it will be hard for Gerrard to keep leaving him out of the team. Ings struck the post in the second half with a header and went close with another effort too. His link play with Coutinho and Watkins was excellent. He got his deserved goal in second half additional time. Douglas Luiz on for Tim Iroegbunam, 73 minutes - 6 Emiliano Buendia on for Philippe Coutinho, 76 minutes - 7 Looked sharp when he came on and had a point to prove to Gerrard. Got an assist for Ings' goal. Subs not used: Olsen (GK), Konsa, Douglas Luiz, Traore, Young, Nakamba, Chukwuemeka Norwich City: Krul; Aarons, Hanley, Zimmermann, Giannoulis; Normann, Gilmour; Dowell, Lees-Melou (Sargent '66, Rupp '81), Rashica (Rowe '76); Pukki.

The 19-year-old has been drafted into the first team earlier this week because of doubts over the availability of Townsend with the player's wife due to give birth. That possibility didn't transpire and the 29-year-old started in Berkshire, but was unable to end the match for other reasons. Townsend twisted an ankle just before the break and was unable to continue, opening the door for Ashworth to make his Championship bow. The teenage son of former Albion technical and sporting director Dan Ashworth, who was apparently in attendance as part of a bumper away following, will certainly have a pair of proud parents, according to Bruce, after hardly putting a foot wrong on the afternoon. READ: West Brom defender set for 'scans' as replacement impresses at Reading READ: West Brom player ratings as Molumby impresses and Grant downs Reading ""That is the big plus to me to see young Zac play,"" said Bruce ""He twisted his ankle, Connor, and his wife's about to give birth, so it was good that he was on standby. ""How well did he take his chance? He was excellent. The young kid did really, really well, I'm pleased for him. He'll have a proud Mum and Dad tonight."" Albion finally broke through in this drab affair 12 minutes from time following a quick counter and incisive pass from substitute Callum Robinson. Karlan Grant did well to engineer space for himself before drilling home his 16th goal of the season to seal a welcome away victory for his side. ",positive
69,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-reading-bruce-ince-23833119,West Brom player ratings as Molumby impresses and Grant downs Reading,"West Bromwich Albion returned to winning ways away from home to cap off their travels for the season as Karlan Grant sealed a 1-0 victory at Reading. Steve Bruce sprung a surprise as Albion reverted to a four at the back system for the first time since their defeat at Swansea City back in February. Dara O'Shea shifted out to right-back with Conor Townsend dropping back from wing-back to full-back either side of Semi Ajayi and Kyle Bartley in the centre. The new-look Baggies were first to trouble the goal through a member of the back four when Adam Reach's looping cross from the left arrived at the head of Ajayi inside the Reading penalty area. His effort could only find the foot of the post, though, as Reading scrambled the ball away for a corner that came to nothing. On an afternoon when plenty of former Albion players were saluted by a strong away following for the final trip of the season, it was perhaps fitting that a rendition of 'One Andy Carroll' broke out just after the half-hour mark with the centre-forward's days as an Albion player appearing numbered after not featuring in the matchday squad. A few half-chances followed before the break for Molumby and Phillips as Albion finally tested former Aston Villa goalkeeper Orjan Nyland through the former. The visitors just about shaded a tight first half purely by being the side more willing to let fly as opposed to Reading's pressure, particularly from set-pieces, that couldn't conjure up a final ball. Zac Ashworth was introduced at the break as expectant father to be Conor Townsend had picked up a knock that saw the left-back limping in the latter stages of the first half. The 19-year-old instantly impressed on what was a Championship debut as Albion focussed attacks down the left-hand side. Phillips continued to be involved in the second, forcing a save of sorts from Nyland as the 'keeper tipped over a tempting cross for a corner before the winger spurned the first real chance of the half. After being found in the centre by an O'Shea cross, the winger leant back from around the penalty spot and lifted what was at best a half-chance well over the crossbar. As the match appeared to be drifting towards a second stalemate for Albion in a week pressing high on the halfway line proved dividends for Albion. Captain Jake Livermore stole the ball away and into the path of substitute Callum Robinson who drove forward with intent minutes after entering the action before finding Karlan Grant for the striker to stick away in composed fashion. The assister almost turned goalscorer after being presented an opportunity to double the advantage after combining with Diangana. The left winger cut the ball back for the Robinson but the substitute couldn't crown a fine cameo with a goal and only found the arms of Nyland. Albion ended the game by far in the ascendancy and looked a completely rejuvenated outfit after the goal. It stayed just a one-goal margin though as Bruce got one over old teammate Paul Ince in the Berkshire sunshine to end an ultimately unacceptable away record this season with a high. Button 6 A spectator for much of the first half aside from a few moments of threat off of set-pieces that ultimately did not require an intervention from the Albion 'keeper. Just about claimed a second-half corner after multiple attempts in a nervy moment at the back. O'Shea 5 Solid in the air as you would expect from a centre-half shifted out to full-back, perhaps unfortunately so after growing into the role in the centre over recent matches. Offered little going forward initially, filling in for Ajayi when the defender broke the lines with the ball at feet, but did improve as the game progressed in the final third after settling into the role again. Ajayi 6 Dealt with Lucas Joao well early on by being physical and leaving the centre-forward in a heap after a robust aerial challenge that had the hosts asking for a penalty. Should've really got a better connection and scored from Reach's cross in the first half. Continued to bring the ball forward as one of two rather than three centre-backs and linked defence with midfield well in doing so. Covered behind Bartley well. Bartley 5 Tidy in possession by and large, but bailed out by Ajayi on occasion after being caught as Reading ran in behind. Strong in the air as has come to be expected but is perhaps the one centre-back at the club most well-suited to the back three. Townsend 5 A solid, if not spectacular, showing up against Junior Hoilett Picked up a knock just before the break and was visibly limping and didn't come out for the second half. Phillips 6 Lively and took up an advanced role on the right early on in a first start for three months, getting off Albion's first shot which was narrowly off target. The most incisive attacking threat for the first 45 minutes. Continued in the second by forcing Nyland to tip over a teasing cross for a corner kick. Spurned the best chance of the second half over. Livermore 5 Took on the more reserved role of the two alongside the dynamic Molumby, allowing the midfield partner to flourish further forward. Looked uncomfortable when called on to work further upfield as is demanded in a two-man midfield tandem. Won the ball back well on the halfway line in the lead up to the goal. Molumby 7 Sprayed a perfect pass out to the left early on the find Phillips for the first shot of the match. Combative in midfield and pressed up high on occasion to force turnovers in the Reading half. Far from shot-shy when presented with an opening and tested Nyland from distance for the first time. Risked undoing all the good work with an ugly attempt to win a loose ball by followed through on the opposing player and earned a well-deserved booking. Reach 5 More of a threat with deliveries from the left as a more natural winger rather than being inverted on the right as of late. Combined well with the impressive Ashworth once the teenager came on at half-time for 20-odd minutes before being withdrawn. Diangana 5 Dropped off deeper out of the two forwards but had mixed success as Albion couldn't consistently hold the ball up in advanced areas sufficiently to link back with the midfield. Had much more success on the left for the final 20 minutes after Robinson was introduced by being granted more freedom to run at defenders down the wing and cut inside. Grant 6 Snatched at a chance to profit from a turnover in Reading's half by shooting rather than continuing to drive at the Reading backline. Let down by a less than ideal touch when found in behind all too often. Made amends with a well-taken goal when the confidence seemed to come flooding back in an instant SUBSTITUTES Ashworth 6 (forTownsend 45') Got a good first half of Championship football under the belt after replacing Townsend at the break. Assured in possession considering the occasion on league debut, combining well with Reach on the left. Robinson 6 (for Reach 72') Came on upfront allowing for Diangana to take up a more natural role on the left. Carried the ball well with purpose before playing in Grant for the goal. Could've doubled the lead late on but only found the arms of Nyland from close range. Castro 5 (for Phillips 81') Wanted to get on the ball down the right and press for a second.

Albion supporters rarely heard from predecessor Xu Ke, save for the odd written statement, and ex-chairman Li Piyue even less so. Upon arriving at the decision to sack Valerien Ismael last week, owner Guochuan Lai ripped up the structure of the club at senior level; it points to a fresh start, under Gourlay, with improved communications across the board. It’s an issue that Gourlay, during his days as part time club consultant, has sensed needs resolving - and began with a progressive discussion at Monday night's Albion Assembly meeting, which was also attended by Mark Miles and Simon King. “There are some things that have been rumbling on a lot longer than this season which we have to put right as a club,” Gourlay admitted. “We have to be more transparent with you guys [the press], we have got to be more in touch with our fan base. “We have let that drift. It is one thing we have got to address. I think that just helps the whole thing. It does. I have been at The Hawthorns many, many, times and the atmosphere has always been incredible. “We need that on our side, we hope we can drive results and get Albion fans back on our side so we can take this football club forward. We (Gourlay and Bruce) are very confident together. I have been here for five months. I have seen a lot of the good things in the club and together we can unlock that very quickly. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe me, Steve, the board, the fans – with the support of the owner – can take this club forward. We really do believe we can take it forward.” On the field Albion need improvements too, hence the installation of Bruce as their new boss. He took charge of training on Friday before being unveiled and continues preparations again ahead of the trip to former club Sheffield United on Wednesday night. Bruce himself spoke of his belief that he is inheriting one of the best groups of players in the Championship, and that’s an assessment shared by Gourlay. That quality married with Bruce’s experience needs to see an upturn in results - and the early signs are promising. “I believe there is so much quality in the side,” Gourlay added, “and the reason Steve is perfect for us is because we don’t have time, we need to hit the ground running. “We have got 17 games left and we have got to start winning games very, very, soon. I know Steve has been in positions like this before and he has proven himself many times. He is so highly respected by the players. “No disrespect to Valerien, but we have seen a nice lift since his arrival. I think we have to push on from his now. We have been underperforming there is no doubt about it.” ",positive

Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of the trip to Cardiff City this weekend the head coach summarised the situation thus: “I get judged every week and if I do try to do the right thing by the club and play some youngsters, which has been a positive thing, then we might lose more games than what we should have done and people might judge me on that. So sometimes it’s a no win situation being in my position.” However, he did divulge which of the brightest stars from the Wast Hills academy that have caught his eye and could get a call-up in the final two matches.

Preston away, he came on, we were losing 1-0 and came on for the last 10 minutes and helped us get a point there, so he’s definitely one.” ""Another one, poor lad, making his first start against QPR at home, done nothing wrong and finished the game, or maybe came off a little towards the end. He was excellent in that game. Then he got injured in that game which we didn’t even know. Then he was out for a long time after that but he’s another one that’s a good player. “Young JJ, obviously, who’s been in and around us all season. Once he got his opportunity, he surprised us all. He grabbed it with both hands and, again, improving.” “He’s doing a lot better than what I thought he would have done when he first came in. I see him growing. He makes the odd mistake here and there, he’s cost us the odd goal here and there. But, what do you do? You don’t just take him out. He’s learning the game. He’s a 19-year-old kid [sic] that’s learning the game.” “Then you’ve got young Marcel, who played at Coventry away. He’s played more games but Coventry away was the one that stood out for me. I thought he was excellent and had to come off injured and, again, has been a little bit in and out with little injuries, ankle injuries and knocks. “He’s another one I like a lot. He gives you everything. Whatever you ask him to do, full-back, wing-back, he doesn’t ask no questions. Again, another young player who has a future.” ",positive

You have to remember I have played for this club and everybody knows me. Those fans know who I am and what I am, I am a winner and a fighter and that will never change. ""But the players step across the line, they have to go home and take a good hard look at themselves because there is only so much I can control. If they want to stroll around and think we are better than what we actually are then I can't control that. ""I will be here for as long as wanted because I care about the club - that's why I came.

Blues wrap up this season’s away programme in the Welsh capital this weekend, looking for a first ever victory at the Cardiff City Stadium. They make the trip with Lee Bowyer torn between giving the next generation of Blues hopefuls an opportunity and the need to sign off – and send a message to the owners – with a victory. Certainly the thousands of Blues supporters who have spent the last nine months travelling the nation deserve something to smile about. They will find a home side that has lost its last four – and in a similar position, with nothing to play for and wondering how many of their youngsters they can afford to name in the starting XI. Predicting either side is virtually impossible. READ: Cardiff City boosted by return of striker for Birmingham City clash READ: Lee Bowyer made to wait for 'discussion' on Birmingham City future Bowyer has noted the irony that for once he has a virtually full strength squad to choose from. Only Tahith Chong, his best player, seems set to miss out through injury. Kristian Pedersen and Taylor Richards are available and the Blues head coach wonders how much work experience he can afford to dole out whilst retaining a competitive XI. To that end it would be something of a surprise to see him make huge changes both in personnel and formation, so either a 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 feels like the most likely system, with one of two younger players in from the start and others introduced off the bench. Neil Etheridge will want to start against his former club and will probably remain in goal. The three centre backs could well see Nico Gordon continue alongside Marc Roberts and George Friend. Even when Bowyer picked his most experienced team to try and stop the rot against Millwall last time out, he kept Gordon – who has this week celebrated his 20th birthday, in his line-up. Gary Gardner is his captain and he could be partnered by Jordan James in the middle of the park. As the closest thing to young and Championship-ready Blues have, the 17-year-old could get his 20th appearance of his breakthrough season in south Wales. The wing backs could be anything from adapted full backs Maxime Colin and Kristian Pedersen, to shoehorned wingers, Jordan Graham and Jeremie Bela. Or a combination. Bowyer has always picked Colin when he can – and could well ask Bela to provide a supply line from the left. If Bowyer goes with a 3-4-3, Juninho Bacuna should start given the fact his form has remained commendably high through the collective struggles. He was excellent against the Lions. Onel Hernandez returned to the attacking line last Saturday and was back to his defence-shredding best, creating the confusion in the Millwall defence to allow Bacuna to score and tearing past defenders when given the ball. Blues’ best chance of a positive result comes with the Cuban in the side. Bowyer’s relationship with Lyle Taylor means the Nottingham Forest man is likely to stay up front. ",positive
75,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-troy-deeney-hergametoo-23823213,'Something I never felt' - The Birmingham City fans fighting sexism in football,"The relationship between Birmingham City and the HerGameToo movement is still in its infancy but Blues ambassador Emily Drakeley says she has already seen big progress. Indeed it was little more than a month ago that Blues confirmed their partnership with the project, dedicating their home match with Middlesbrough to publicise issues around sexist abuse and the experience female supporters have at football grounds. The match day programme, Blues News, carried a QR code to the HerGameToo report line, while there were posters around the ground to promote the cause and future plans include free sanitary products. Talks about further progress that can be made next season have already started. The developments come just under 12 months after the movement was launched by a dozen co-founders intent on raising awareness of sexist abuse. They did so by releasing a video on FA Cup Final day in which they highlighted the problems they’ve had watching the men’s game. READ: Birmingham City chief provides 'positive' update on St Andrew's repairs READ: Key change to English football confirmed amid Birmingham City takeover talk Emily says Blues have pledged support while also taking guidance from the campaign: “Being part of the HerGameToo co-founders has allowed me to be a part of this campaign since the beginning,” she said. “My aim was always to get Birmingham City involved as soon as possible. “I was honoured when Birmingham City signed up to the initiative. This is something that is so important to me and to many others that I know within the fanbase. Birmingham City is a great club and one I am so pleased to be representing. I’ve had difficulties being a female football fan and I am dedicated to addressing these issues and making the whole footballing world better for everyone.” HerGameToo’s report line enables fans to report any sexist abuse or concerns they have – with an option for this to be confidential – through their website. These reports are then passed on to the respective clubs who take appropriate action. The campaign has continued to grow with over 100 clubs across the UK signing up, right from Premier League to grass-roots level. Fellow Bluenose Helena Banks was recently recruited by Emily to be part of the wider HerGameToo team as Birmingham City Advocate. Helena said: “As a young girl supporting the Blues, I always felt like I didn't belong as it wasn't the 'girly thing' to do at that time to be as passionate about football as I am. “Joining the Her Game Too movement was a no-brainer for me as I wanted to make sure that young girls today are given equal opportunities in the sport, which includes going to games and having opportunities to play grass-roots football. I am determined, alongside Emily and the other girls involved, to make a difference and give girls the opportunity and right to feel comfortable and included in football as that is something I never felt as a child myself.” ",positive

The powerful striker, on loan from Middlesbrough, is an option for boss Steve Morison after missing out against his parent club on Wednesday evening. Left back Joel Bagan also missed the defeat at the Riverside. Ikpeazu made a strong start to his City career with three early goals but he has only started one of his 13 league matches. He did, however, play against Blues at the Riverside and his physicality caused them problems before he hobbled off before half time. Morison also hopes to have Isaak Davies after he also missed out against Boro and the previous match at Sheffield United. However, the Bluebirds will be without experienced midfielder Joe Ralls, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the season by a tight groin. Sean Morrison is another definite absentee having suffered a serious knee injury in February, while former Blues striker Issac Vassell has not featured for Cardiff since August 2019 and is in the final few weeks of his Cardiff contract. Cardiff come into the game on the back of four straight losses – yet still sit three points above Blues in 19th place. The visitors arrive with an almost completely fit squad – with Tahith Chong the only doubt. Kristian Pedersen and Taylor Richards are available again after missing out last weekend. ",positive

The Sun report that Edwards is on the 'wanted list' of Blues and Salford City, the League Two club owned by Gary Neville and his former Manchester United team-mates. It is being claimed that Blues could look for a 'successor' to Bowyer with Edwards' attractive style of play earning admirers elsewhere having steered Rovers to promotion to League One this season. Uncertainty around Bowyer 's future continues as a disappointing campaign nears a conclusion with Blues only two places above the relegation zone in 20th with a game to play. Twentieth position is where Blues are almost certain to end the campaign given they are three points behind Cardiff City a place above them after a 1-1 draw in the Welsh capital on Saturday. When Reading and Derby County's points deductions are not taken into account, Blues would be outside the relegation zone on goal difference heading into the final day of the season. Before the Cardiff game Bowyer confirmed that he had spoken to technical director Craig Gardner but not with Blues' hierarchy.

The reports suggest Forest Green manager Rob Edwards is on the ""wanted list"" of Blues after he led the Gloucestershire outfit into League One with promotion from the fourth tier. The Green Devils have spent just four years in the English Football League, but have become a clear promotion contender by winning 23 games and losing eight times so far. One supporter said: ""As much as Lee Bowyer has made mistakes this season, I still believe he could turn our fortunes around with a new owner, some financial stability and backing...otherwise it's groundhog day again.""

79,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-st-andrews-repairs-22823221,Birmingham City break silence over the open wound that is St Andrew's stand closures,"After months of silence Birmingham City have finally revealed the full extent of the stadium repairs which mean sections of St Andrew’s remain shut more than a year after safety issues came to light. Problems with the stadium emerged in December 2020 when a structural survey meant the Kop and Tilton Road stands were immediately closed – and have remained so to this day. While there is no exact date for reopening of the whole ground – the club’s project manager Michael Moran expressed hope that some sections – if not the entire stadium, could be available for supporters at the start of next season. The club is also giving consideration to installing safe standing in some areas. However, what became clear in a special presentation from Moran was the difficulties the club have experienced as soon as the remedial works started and the conditions under the stands became apparent. Moran, who was appointed in August 2021 outlined how industry pressures around the availability of labour and materials – as well as the sheer scope of the works have caused delays. “It has grown and grown and grown over time as the issues have presented themselves,” Moran said. “A lot of what we have dealt with are legacy issues. Our brief was to reinstate the stadium to its original design and a lot of the problems we have stem from a lack of access. “The stands were built over the old terraces which were broken up and at a time when regulations for maintenance were not as good. “The upper tier areas required trained operatives who effectively abseil into position – these are highly skilled people, some of whom operate on oil rigs – and it’s a niche market which suffers from high demand. We wanted to flood it with operatives but there are only so many you can get your hands on.” When workers first went into under the Tilton they found standing water, the source of which had to be identified and addressed. There was also corrosion on rakers, particularly on the lower tiers and there was also rubble, including heavy lumps of concrete, which had to be removed to allow access to areas some of which required workers to crawl through tunnels just 2ft wide. Materials were another issue, hundreds of bolts needed replacing or solidifying with structural grout – at a time when there was an industry shortage. Moran also claimed that a member of the club’s board even visited depots to source the material. There have been occasions when asbestos monitoring teams were called to the site, causing work to cease while the suspected materials were sent away for testing. Moran added; “Teams of workers were doing 11 hour shifts, seven days a week, with as many as 15 operatives, heavily incentivised and on double pay.” Indeed Blues ’ Chief Financial Officer Mark Smith said the club had already spent five times the original quote. Moran maintained that finance has not been an issue during the project. Moran said he is in the process of negotiating a time frame with the contractor, who will provide the club with options of either repairing and galvanising the affected beams, or replacing them. During this process consideration will also be given to areas of safe standing. It is thought that if beam encasement is deemed to be an acceptable way forward there is a chance sections could be open by the end of July. A decision on that is expected to be made in the couple of weeks. ",positive

The Portuguese playmaker cracked home eight minutes from time to hand Bruno Lage’s side an impressive away win against one of the so-called ‘Big Six’.  Moutinho's goal clinches a first three points in the Premier League for Wolves at Old Trafford and their first league win on this turf since 1980. Wolves dominated the early exchanges with Daniel Podence and Ruben Neves forcing David De Gea into saves inside the opening 12 minutes. Podence was first to test De Gea with a stinging left-footed shot that United’s goalkeeper parried around the post. From the resulting corner, United cleared the ball as far as Neves - who took a touch before producing an almost identical volley to the one he scored against Derby County almost four years ago. Fortunately for United, De Gea managed to tip Neves’ rasping volley over the crossbar. De Gea was soon called into action again to beat away Nelson Semedo’s effort. The Wolves wing-back advanced forward down the right before unleashing an effort from inside United’s box which De Gea dealt with. Wolves’ best chance of the first half arrived 10 minutes before the break - and it fell to Raul Jimenez. It looked as though the attack had fizzled out but Cristiano Ronaldo’s misguided header back to De Gea allowed Jimenez to keep it alive and nod the ball wide to Marcal. Marcal found Jimenez unmarked at the near post but the Mexican’s header rippled the netting on the outside of De Gea’s right-hand post, rather than the inside. Wolves produced an excellent first half display to dominate possession and attempt 15 shots - but the scores were all square at the break. United boss Ralf Rangnick couldn’t have been pleased with his team’s performance during a lacklustre first 45 minutes. They improved after the break and almost broke the deadlock through substitute Bruno Fernandes in the 67th minute. Nemanja Matic crossed from the left and Fernandes arrived on the scene late before rattling the crossbar from 10 yards. For the first time in the match, Wolves’ players panicked and a free-kick was conceded out on the left. Fernandes turned provider this time and his free-kick was turned home by Ronaldo. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner was flagged offside and Wolves were let off the hook. READ: Wolves confirm early January transfer window decision READ: Wolves star Raul Jimenez draws comparison to Lionel Messi Ronaldo was played through on goal by Fernandes within seconds, but the Portuguese screwed his strike wide of the goal on this occasion. Adama Traore was introduced to give Wolves fresh attacking impetus and his ball-carrying wizardry earned his team a free-kick right on the edge of United’s penalty area. Neves hasn’t had much success recently, so Romain Saiss stepped up and hit the crossbar. Time was running out for Wolves - who, aside from a three-minute spell of United pressure, were the dominant team - to find a winner at Old Trafford.  Step forward, Joao Moutinho. Traore collected the ball on the right and crossed dangerously into the box. United cleared their lines, but Moutinho was lying in wait on the 18-yard line and brought the ball down before firing into the corner. There was still one scare to come as Fernandes whipped a free-kick goal-wards in the fifth minute of stoppage time, but Sa produced his most notable save of the game to seal three points. Jose Sa 8 Sa would have been expecting a busy evening after stepping off the coach at Old Trafford, but it turned out to be one of his quietest outings of the season. Clean sheets at Old Trafford don’t come easy though, and Sa was forced into a world class save in stoppage time by Fernandes to preserve the points. Max Kilman 9 Showed speed and skill to evade three United players with a dart down the right wing early in the second half, before the big centre-back lost his footing at the crucial moment. When he wasn’t producing runs like Ronaldo in his prime, Kilman was bossing United’s number seven and Co at the other end. Conor Coady 9 Coady has been outstanding in recent weeks and Ronaldo should have posed his toughest test yet, but the United forward was handled comfortably. Romain Saiss 9 Africa Cup of Nations bound Saiss said goodbye to Wolves with a top-notch defensive display. He repelled everything that United tried down Wolves’ left side and distributed the ball really intelligently. Nelson Semedo 8.5 Semedo was a threat throughout and carried the ball forward menacingly down the right wing all evening. He didn’t put a foot wrong defensively either. Ruben Neves 9 The effortless ball Neves played out to Traore in the build-up to Moutinho’s winning goal sums him up. He’s playing a different game at times. This was yet another fantastic performance from Neves. Joao Moutinho 9.5 Moutinho is having an excellent season under Lage, and this was his best showing in a good while. Not only did the 35-year-old control the game from start to finish, barely losing the ball across the 90 minutes, he also provided the winning goal. Goals for Moutinho are so rare that he’s scored more at Old Trafford than Molineux in his four seasons with Wolves. Marcal 8 The Brazilian has returned to the team and helped Wolves keep three successive clean sheets. He also offered a useful attacking outlet down the left at Old Trafford and put in some dangerous crosses - one of which Jimenez should have scored from. Francisco Trincao 7.5 Trincao was outstanding against United back in August, so it wasn’t surprising to see Lage hand him a start at Old Trafford. The Barcelona loanee was involved in lots of Wolves’ good attacking play in a much improved showing away from Molineux. Raul Jimenez 7 Not as effective as Wolves’ other forwards on the night and missed a big chance to open the scoring, but he linked well with his teammates. Daniel Podence 8 Podence is coming into his own under Lage now having nailed down his place in the XI. Some of his footwork was sublime and the former Olympiakos winger could have bagged himself a couple of goals had it not been for De Gea. Adama Traore (for Trincao, 66) 8 Crafted Moutinho’s winner with excellent wing play and carried a huge threat in the final 25 minutes. Fabio Silva (for Jimenez, 81) 7 Made a big contribution with excellent hold up play in the build-up to Moutinho’s winner.

That’s what the 70-odd thousand Manchester United fans must have been expecting when they arrived at Old Trafford for tonight’s game with Wolverhampton Wanderers. What they wouldn’t have been expecting was for those statistics and points to belong to Wolves. On a night where Ralf Rangnick’s Man United side displayed nothing more than an identity crisis, Wolves were absolutely outstanding. Wolves had 15 shots at goal in the first half. That’s the most any visiting team at Old Trafford has had in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League game since the 2003/04 season (thanks to Opta). Wolves fans watching inside of Old Trafford were encouraged, but they weren’t confident because they’ve watched Bruno Lage’s team fail to kill off their opponent on more than one occasion this season. United themselves were ripped apart by Bruno-ball in August, only for Mason Greenwood to net a controversial winner which still rankles those of a Wolves persuasion. How Paul Pogba’s challenge on Ruben Neves in the build-up to that goal wasn’t deemed a red card, let alone a foul, remains a mystery to us all. Neves, alongside compatriot Joao Moutinho, was key to Wolves exacting revenge at Old Trafford. Moutinho will grab the headlines after his 82nd minute strike clinched a first league win on this ground since 1980, but Wolves’ supporters paid tribute to their manager at the final whistle. Lage has quietly put Wolves in contention for a place in Europe, despite no financial backing and a catalogue of injuries to his already threadbare squad. The Portuguese quickly made his way over to the travelling fans at the final whistle, where he was serenaded and applauded. “Bruno’s taking us to Europe,” they chanted. Even after these impressive three points lifted Wolves up to eighth, three points shy of seventh-placed United, that remains a tall order. All of their rivals for those top seven positions will probably strengthen in this transfer window, whereas Wolves’ business is largely dependent on what they can rake in through sales. Whatever way you look at it, Lage is doing a remarkable job and this victory has laid the benchmark for what could be a memorable 2022.

Semedo pulled up during a run down the right flank with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. The defender needed to be replaced by Jonny Castro Otto in the 53rd minute. Bruno Lage had already made two changes at half-time, bringing on Pedro Neto and Raul Jimenez for Ruben Neves and Fabio Silva after a dire first half at Molineux. Alexis Mac Allister put the visitors ahead before half-time with his second penalty of the game after the first struck the post. READ: Bruno Lage confirms plan for Wolves loan players ahead of summer window READ: Bruno Lage reveals one reason Wolves will ‘drop’ players in summer transfer window But Wolves head coach Lage was forced into his third and final change shortly after the restart to replace Semedo. The defender’s injury is his second hamstring problem this season after he missed a month of action after hobbling off in the 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in late February. Semedo has been an influential player for Wolves this season with his efforts at right wing-back. The former Barcelona man joins Max Kilman and Daniel Podence on the sidelines. Kilman is likely to miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury, while Podence hasn’t been able to train in weeks due to a foot problem.

The striker is currently enduring his worst goal scoring season for Wolves since arriving from Benfica in 2018. Jimenez has netted six times in his 29 Premier League games to cut a frustrated figure at times, while he’s also been sent off twice against Manchester City and Leeds United. Jimenez was a regular contributor in his first two seasons with Wolves, and scored 27 goals in the 2019/20 season - 17 in the Premier League and a further 10 in the club’s run to the quarter-finals of the Europa League. He started the 2020/21 campaign in good form too, with four goals in 10 matches before he fractured his skull in late November. READ: Jack Grealish explains Bruno Lage’s colossal transfer demand to Man Utd READ: Wolves dealt major blow as Bruno Lage rules key player out for season The 30-year-old has enjoyed spells of good form this season. He registered three goals and two assists in six Premier League starts during a two-month spell before Christmas, but the goals have dried up since. Jimenez has only scored twice from open play since that mini goal glut ended in late November, and he hasn’t been guaranteed of his starting place in recent months. But the Mexican is certain the goals will flow once more. “I know I can give more to the team,” he said. “I know I haven’t been scoring too much this season, but I know it’s there, so it’s just a matter of time to come out again. Patience, I can never lose, I think it's an important part in a footballer’s career. I need to stay confident and be sure that I’m going to be there again. “Last season I was just watching the games in the stands, so it was a little bit frustrating. I wanted to be there on the pitch helping the team, but it was not possible. Now I’m there on the pitch, I want to give my best to forget all about that.” Jimenez scored the most headed goals in the Premier League during the 2019/20 season, but he hasn’t netted one since his return. Bruno Lage believes the protective headband Jimenez now wears has been detrimental to the striker’s aerial prowess. He debuted a new headband against Burnley last time out and says it is an improvement on the previous one. Wolves’ number nine said: “It’s lighter, so I think it’s going to be better for me – I feel more comfortable. “I have to get used to it. I played almost the whole season with the other one, it was a little bit difficult, but I got used to it and now I have to get used to the new one, and I think it’s going to be easier. “It’s better for me. It’s not going to make me feel compressed, the head, it’s going to make me feel more normal, more natural, it just covers the fracture, so I think it’s much better. It’s just like a band to hold the hair, so it doesn’t make the ball go anywhere. It’s going to help.” ",positive

The 20-year-old, dubbed ""Baby Zigic"" by fans, played for the first time since injuring his ankle January and is set to return to League Two Rochdale to continue his loan spell. Home grown striker Andrews had scored five times in 17 games for Robbie Stockdale’s men before he was injured playing against Bradford City a couple of months ago. He is nearing the end of his rehabilitation and judging by his display last night has clearly benefitted from playing senior football. That’s certainly the view of Under 23s’ head coach Steve Spooner who praised the 6ft 6ins forward both for the quality of his finish, a sharp turn and thundering low shot across the goalkeeper – and his development at Spotland. READ - One-Eyed Baz dead after heart attack - how Birmingham City paid tribute to 'lifelong Bluenose' Barrington Patterson READ - Birmingham City and Onel Hernandez: How Norwich City see the future of Blues' fan favourite “It shows,” Spooner told BluesTV. “He is looking after himself better. He is using that enormous frame, I thought he was very competent playing up there. “He gives you a threat behind as well because for a big man he is quick and then the goal, he took it so well. I was really pleased to see him back in a Blues shirt and playing for us. “But he has got to go back and learn part of his development again now at Rochdale and hopefully he will be near the starting line-up and bang some goals in there.” Rochdale have ten games remaining and although they are nine points clear of the bottom two, in 19th place they still have a bit of work to do to secure their Football League status. By contrast Blues ’ 23s appear to have turned a bit of a corner in their first Premier League 2 campaign. After a difficult start to the season when the step up was clearly challenging, they have won four and drawn three of their ten games since the New Year and last night’s 2-1 win came over the second placed Canaries. Blues are now 11th in the 14 team division as they near the end of the campaign. “It’s been very pleasing post Christmas,” Spooner continued. “If you look at our results they have been very positive. Some of that is to do with the fact we have got players back from injury and some of it is due to we have young players maturing now, they have had six months of Cat One . “I said at the time it wasn’t nice but it would bode well for the second half of the season.

Speaking to BirminghamLive the 38-year-old has revealed how he has reached the difficult conclusion to return to Catalonia and has thanked the club’s supporters for the backing they have shown him and the team. “Sometimes people have to decide between two different options and with the situation we are living in and the situation of my family, it is not easy, but I think they need me more than football at the moment,” Calm explained. “I have to prioritise and now I think they are the most important.

The Sun on Sunday claims second tier teams see the ability to sell players as a vital source of income in the current lockdown. Under the current regulations they would only be able to do that until the end of August – the window has already been extended a few weeks this summer following last year’s early closure. With no clarity on when football can restart, never mind when paying customers will be allowed through the gates once more, transfers could be an important source of revenue. Those who miss out on promotion could be forced to cash in on their prize assets and the report claims they want to be able to do that until February – right through to the end of the mid-season window. The story points to players like Kalvin Phillips at Leeds, Ollie Watkins at Brentford – who harbour ambitions of promotion - as potentially up for grabs if the Premier League remains out of reach. It also mentions the likes of Blackburn’s Bradley Dack, Swansea’s Joe Rodon and QPR’s Eberechi Eze. Birmingham City have already turned down offers for crown jewel Jude Bellingham this year – with continued speculation that Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund are keen on the teenager.

The disastrous decision to replace Gary Rowett with Gianfranco Zola had left the club staring into the abyss. The Italian’s record of two wins from 24 games had seen a hard-working and functional side reduced to a shadow of itself. A possible play-off challenge had melted away to be replaced by the white heat of a relegation battle and for the second time in three seasons Blues were on contemplating League One. And then came Harry Redknapp, the veteran manager who had the charisma and experience to resuscitate a team that had slipped into a coma. Redknapp’s first game had ended in a 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa – and in the dismissal and suspension of club captain Paul Robinson. Blues ’ fate would be decided by the final two matches, at home to Huddersfield on April 29, 2017 and away to Bristol City a week later. The 70-year-old who had been everywhere and seen and done everything, walked out at St Andrew’s as Birmingham City’s manager for the first – and potentially only – time. There was no fanfare, he sloped quietly down the touchline just before the game was about to kick-off, unnoticed by the biggest attendance in six years. Nearly 27,000 had filled all four stands responding to the crisis – and answering of a call to arms that sticks out in Michael Morrison’s memory. The centre half was captain that day and making his first appearance in three months after complications following surgery on a hernia had left him bed-ridden. “When the team’s at it lowest point you can always rely on the club coming together and the fans connecting with the players – especially at St Andrew’s,” Morrison recalls. “There are a few times I have seen that, at home they can really get behind the lads and be that twelfth man. “I know it’s a cliché but certainly that day, you look at all the adversity – they didn’t have to get behind the players – we hadn’t been performing for a long period – but that shows their loyalty to stick with the team.” If the support from Bluenoses could be guaranteed, the outcome could not. Redknapp was brought in to extinguish Zola’s fire for the final three matches. “Looking back probably keeping Gianfranco for those couple of games over Easter, we had a real bad spell where we drew at Rotherham and lost at home to Burton. “I think many thought that should have been the point where he changed the manager – but we didn’t and that’s why it stretched to the last three games. “People were surprised Harry had taken the job, I had spoken to Paul Robinson because I thought he would. ""I had said ‘If they do want you to do it you will have the backing of the players’. “Somebody of Harry’s profile really did lift the place and he gave all the players an uplift ‘It’s Harry Redknapp talking to you’. “And to be fair Steve Cotterill really knew his stuff at that time and him and Harry worked quite nicely together. “There was a clear plan how we were going to play against Huddersfield. We had gone back to basics a bit, concentrating on being a bit more resolute and to be honest just Harry coming in gave everyone a new lease of life. “Going into the game Che Adams had been terrific in training, Harry had just sort of lit up Che a little bit. “You could see he had enjoyed training that week. He had a little spring in his step that Harry had given him.” Even then Blues made it hard for themselves. The hordes watched on as Lukas Jutkiewicz missed an early penalty, before Adams was shown a nonsensical red card. Thankfully Jonathan Grounds gave the ten men something to cling to in the 41st minute. If you want to follow all things Birmingham City via social media then this is the place to find out how.

I had a lot of problems I couldn’t get rid of - that was a bad time for me personally. “It came to it that I did need to play – the Huddersfield game was that real turning point.” A turning point for Redknapp – who was convinced to stay on permanently, for better or worse, a turning point for Blues who completed the salvage operation at Ashton Gate. “It didn’t work out for Harry in the long run – but he was crucial in that period. “As for the fans, other clubs' would not have done that but they dragged us through it. ""I’d give them a couple of assists – if Groundsy scored someone must have helped him.” Someone, or 27,000 someones. ",negative
88,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/heartbreaking-birmingham-city-man-reveals-18181323,'Heartbreaking' - Birmingham City man reveals his biggest Blues disappointment and his happiest day,"There are themes which run through Jonathan Spector’s career in English football, like writing through a stick of Blackpool rock. So often the affable American found himself stuck between that rock and a hard place, with relegation battles, injury struggles and managerial changes making sure life was never straight forward. Whether it was in the Claret of West Ham, or the Blue of Birmingham City, the defender ducked and dived the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for more than a decade. He amassed more than 300 Football League appearances, mounted two European campaigns and dodged the drop on a couple of occasions before returning to his homeland for a quieter life. It is one that finds now finds him as the Head of International Player recruitment at Atlanta United and a 34-year-old for whom the upheaval of Upton Park and St Andrew’s must seem to belong to a different lifetime. Upheaval was the one constant. “I feel my time in England, the five years at West Ham and five-and-a-half at Birmingham there was always some sort of existential crisis or something in the club that became an issue,” he told BirminghamLive. Coincidentally Spector made his debuts for both the Hammers and Blues in European competition. He also worked under Gianfranco Zola at both clubs. His West Ham bow came when Alan Pardew’s team lost 3-0 to Palermo in the UEFA Cup in August 2006. For Blues it was five years later as part of Chris Hughton’s Europa League adventurers in a 0-0 draw with Nacional on the island of Madeira. If the game didn’t live long in the memory, the journey to an imposing cliff-face citadel certainly did. “That trip to Portugal which was pretty memorable, particularly the setting of the stadium,” he recalled. “I don’t think you could even park on the side of that mountain, people had to park lower down and walk up. “The airport was on the side of a mountain too. We had to stop in Lisbon to pick up a pilot that was qualified to land on Madeira. There were only a certain amount who were able to land there. “And I remember seeing a documentary a few months later about the world’s 15 most dangerous airports and that was one them. I’m glad I saw it after we’d been there.” Spector’s first season at Blues’ – a marathon 2011/2012 campaign that saw them play 62 matches – also brought the most painful experience as they fell short of the summit. If narrowly failing to qualify for the EL knockout stages was bad, crumbling in the play-offs to Ian Holloway’s Tangerines was way worse. “There were two sides to that Europa League coin. “We had such a new team, there was such a big turnover of players, having that competition really brought us together in a cohesive way. “Then at the end of the season in terms of the play-offs you could argue it hurt us a little bit because we were just worn-out and had a difficult time keeping players fit. “I had torn my quad in March and was pushing to get back. I came on as a sub away from home in my first appearance in about two months and we lost 1-0. “Then I started the home leg and tore it again just before half time. “I remember walking off and Blackpool scored, I remember the frustration and disappointment of the injury, what was happening on the pitch and our season as a whole. It was heartbreaking to be honest. “I felt like that was our best chance. We had a really good side, a really good manager in Chris Hughton. “We were so organised, playing so well and had some really good players. It was so frustrating, probably the most difficult moment of my time there.” Hughton departed later that summer as the scale of Carson Yeung’s problems became evident. Lee Clark came in to try to take the club one step further. “It felt a little bit like going back to a different club, we lost a lot of core players but I actually felt we brought in some really good players too. “Darren Ambrose, Hayden Mullins, Peter Lovenkrands, we had a lot of experience. “Unfortunately we just didn’t seem to gel as a group. We struggled to come together and find a way of playing the way we had the previous season. “That was disappointing, there was certainly a lot of enthusiasm going into the season, we had high hopes, it just didn’t come together for us. “Lee Clark had a different managerial style to Chris Hughton, who was a little bit more reserved. “If he had to say something he would but I think he was less reactive. If something happened he would be reflected and then say something whereas Lee Clark reacted to situations differently. “That was his managerial style and kind of what worked for him. Unfortunately under Lee we weren’t able to find the same form we had found previously.” Clark’s tenure will be best remembered for the Miracle at the Macron, or Paul Caddis Day – whichever you prefer. Spector actually had a hand in the Scot’s goal, regaining possession deep into stoppage time and enemy territory by barrelling over a Bolton player. Some claimed it was a foul. “I suppose you could argue that. I would not. “That day was nerve-wracking to say the least. I have been in two situations, one at West Ham and one at Birmingham, where we have avoided relegation on the last day. “The euphoria afterwards is incredible. “I remember getting home after the game and my wife telling me she was pregnant and that we were expecting. It was an unforgettable day. “She said she was praying we stayed up because it made the news she had to tell me so much sweeter. It was certainly a day I’ll never forget.” A few months later, in October 2014, Clark was replaced by Gary Rowett and so began a relatively calm period in Blues’ history – and Spector’s career.

That never quite materialised, though it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had Rowett not been sawn off at the knees by new owners. In December 2016, the former Blues defender was sacked hours after his team had beaten Ipswich to move to within three points of third. “His strength was realising the strength of the team and what we were good at,” Spector said. “Obviously there were still financial issues around the club and a lack of ability to bring as many players he would have liked. “But he found a way that worked for us with the players he had – that’s a real skill and talent. “I felt we were moving in the right direction but we had some pieces missing that we really needed to fight for promotion. “I was surprised when he left, I didn’t see it coming, we were in seventh place and in that play-off form up until the point he was released. “I knew Gianfranco Zola really well from my time at West Ham and I really liked him and hoped that things would change and work out for the better. “Unfortunately I don’t think we had the players to play the way he wanted. That made it difficult. “Fairly early into his tenure in January 2017 there came an opportunity to go back to the States, which was something I had wanted. “Our son had been born, we planned on having more , my family had some health issues and that put things in perspective of what was important to me at the time and I wanted to be a bit closer to home. “I am forever grateful to the club and the supporters for the time I had there.” Forever grateful and presumably relieved the flight back to America was rather less hazardous than the one that started his Birmingham City career.

He was in charge at St Andrew’s from May 1970 until September 1975 during which time he returned Blues to the First Division and led them to two FA Cup semi finals. Certainly his second season in charge - 1971/1972 goes down as one of the best in club folklore. Promotion to the top flight played out in front of average crowds of 32,000 and some thrilling football. He pioneered training practices like yoga and psychological testing which were considered new age at the time but are now regularly employed in the professional game. He also built arguably the best team in the club’s history, fielding the legendary forward line of Trevor Francis, Bob Latchford and Bob Hatton. GK Paul Cooper Better remembered for his career at Ipswich Town with whom he won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup. Cannock-born he spent three years at Blues and in this season shared time with Mike Kelly and Dave Latchford. DF Tommy Carroll Right back who finished his career at Blues, a career that included 17 caps for Ireland. DF Roger Hynd No nonsense centre half whose displays over five years at St Andrew’s earned him a place in the club’s Hall of Fame. DF Stan Harland Spent four years at Blues at the end of his career. Played a pivotal role in the promotion season - but younger models Joe Gallagher and Kenny Burns were the coming men. DF Gary Pendrey A Blues legend who spent 14 years at the club and made more than 360 appearances. MF Gordon Taylor Before his life as chief executive of the PFA Taylor was a classy winger for Bolton and Blues. Netted ten times in 203 appearances before leaving in 1976. MF Malcolm Page Wales international who made just under 400 appearances for Blues in a 17-year career at the club. MF Alan Campbell Spent six years at Blues, made 200 appearances and was an ever-present in this promotion campaign. MF Trevor Francis Britain’s first £1m player and probably the best ever to pull on a Birmingham City shirt. CF Bob Hatton Feted goalscorer who combined to lethal effect with Bob Latchford. Struck 73 goals in 218 appearances. CF Bob Latchford Local lad who plundered goals for fun and earned a move to Everton and also played for England. He scored 23 times in 1971/1972. Others who played in 1971/72 Dave Latchford, Ray Martin, Dave Robinson, Kenny Burns Arthur Turner’s 1956 side, which featured greats like Eddy Brown, Peter Murphy and Alex Govan finished sixth in the First Division and reached the FA Cup final Goodwin built another great team which made the 1975 FA Cup final which featured Kenny Burns, Joe Gallagher and Howard Kendall. But they only finished 17th in the league. Trevor Francis’ 2001 team came fifth in what is now the Championship but ended up missing out in the play-offs. They also reached the final of the Worthington Cup. Steve Bruce’s 2004 side finished tenth in the Premier League built around the goals of Mikael Forssell and the central defensive partnership of Kenny Cunningham and Matthew Upson. All three were internationals. Alex McLeish’s first full Premier League season ended in ninth place and a real missed opportunity in the FA Cup - where they were beaten by Portsmouth in the quarter finals. Stephen Carr James McFadden, Lee Bowyer and Roger Johnson made the most appearances.

The flying forward made about 20 yards before Cardiff’s Mark McGuinness recognised the danger and snuffed it out. With no hope of catching Hernandez the centre back slid in from behind and took the 29-year-old’s legs out from underneath him. Referee John Busby gave McGuinness and needlessly long talking to and then brandished the yellow card. It was a fair cop. But it also brought to mind an almost identical situation that had happened in another Blues game – in a 0-0 draw with Coventry in November 2021. That time Ryan Woods was the protagonist, Ian Maatsen the victim, the circumstances, as identical as you can get in two different football matches. READ MORE: Birmingham City player ratings vs Cardiff City: Bela strikes, Bacuna shines but Blues are held READ MORE: Simon Jordan gives brutal Lee Bowyer verdict after claims of Birmingham City’s ref justice Yet the referee that day, Leigh Doughty, saw red and sent Woods off. It was a decision that landed Woods a three game ban at a time when central midfielders were as abundant as hen’s teeth and saw Blues waste time and money with an unsuccessful appeal. According to Lee Bowyer the incidents were ‘the exact same’. A point he made to Andy Woolmer on the touchline at the Cardiff City Stadium. “I said that to the fourth official, ‘I am not asking for this player to be sent off – please don’t take it this way, I never want to see a player sent off. But I had a player do exactly that and get sent off’. He said ‘Sorry’, he wasn’t reffing that game. “The rules just seem to change – and again – you brought it up, I am not saying it because I want to see red cards, but it has to be the same across the board. What are the rules? Why was Ryan’s a red card and this one wasn’t. It baffles me. But I am not wasting my time on the officials.” ",negative

Saturday was far from a vintage performance from the 24-year-old, who was adapting to life without Andy Carroll to play off of upfront as Bruce looked to next season by leaving the soon-to-be free agent out of the matchday squad entirely. Grady Diangana was brought into the team, and two showed signs of striking up a connection but struggled to hold up the ball in the final third. That was until a switch to bring Callum Robinson on from the bench in place, which saw Diangana move out to a more natural role on the left with the introduced Republic of Ireland international supporting Grant instead. Less than five minutes later, Albion had the ball in the back of the net after Robinson fed the striker, who kept his composure to finish past former Aston Villa goalkeeper Orjan Nyland. READ: Steve Bruce reveals 'big plus' for West Brom after Reading win READ: West Brom defender set for 'scans' as replacement impresses at Reading ""He’s had a decent return,"" Bruce agreed when Grant's goal return was put to him post-match. ""I still think he can do more, and I'm sure he can do more. ""He's finished with 16 goals in a team that is 10th, but I'm sure he’ll still think that he can be a little bit more."" It is the third season that Grant has hit double figures in an EFL campaign, for three different clubs. The first was for Charlton Athletic in League One when 14 goals were scored in just half a season under Lee Bowyer before joining then-Premier League side Huddersfield Town late in the January transfer window. Four goals followed in the remainder of that season in the top flight as the Terriers were relegated back to the Championship after a two-year stay. The following campaign, in a first season at send-tier level since featuring infrequently as a teenager at Charlton, 19 goals were netted, which ultimately tempted Albion to make a move for the centre-forward.

Dike sustained what has proved to be a season-ending injury issue against Peterborough United just two matches into his Albion career and another two before the change of manager. Zohore, however, hasn't featured since August due to a combination of injury issues and being frozen out of the first team by Valerien Ismael.

Maybe it will be three, four, five, six, maybe.” ",positive

The 29-year-old was a surprise starter in Berkshire as an expectant father but was selected by Steve Bruce to start the afternoon's outing. But Townsend was visibly limping minutes before the break after picking up a knock and was forced off at half-time. An almost ever-present for Albion this season, it was the first time Townsend had been withdrawn before the 75th minute this season, which indicated it was something untoward. The defender has only missed out on the matchday squad for a Championship match once all season, but must now be considered a doubt for the final day of the season. READ: West Brom player ratings as Molumby impresses and Grant downs Reading Asked about the withdrawal and whether it had anything to do with a call from home, Bruce confirmed that an injury had forced his hand. ""He twisted his ankle just before half-time and he will have scans and we’ll see how he is."" The full-back's replacement Zac Ashworth was a more than adequate replacement for the stricken teammate. After training with the first-team all week on standby to replace Townsend should the baby be on the way, the 19-year-old took the chance with both hands and must be in line for a start next weekend based on that showing. West Brom secured the win in the 78th minute, when leading marksman Karlan Grant pounced after a quick break. ",positive
