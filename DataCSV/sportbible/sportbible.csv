Garcia's goal sent Liverpool through to the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, where they would come from three goals down to beat AC Milan on penalties in one of the greatest games in history. Liverpool could book their place in yet another Champions League final this evening if they beat Villarreal in the second leg of their semi-final tie, with Jurgen Klopp's side holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg at Anfield. Loadingâ¦ Back in 2005, it was Chelsea who were Liverpool's opponents in the last four of the competition. The first leg at Stamford Bridge had ended in a goalless draw to leave the tie delicately poised heading into the second leg at Anfield. And it burst into life just four minutes into the reverse fixture on Merseyside. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard played a chipped through-ball over the top of the Chelsea defence, which striker Milan Baros attempted to reach before Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech. Baros managed to get a touch on the ball before being brought down by Cech in front of the Kop. #OnThisDay in 2005, @luchogarcia14 sent us to Istanbul ð pic.twitter.com/eBNbIm4fPN As the home fans pleaded for a penalty and a red card, Garcia latched onto the loose ball and directed a shot towards goal which deflected off Chelsea captain John Terry. William Gallas raced back towards goal to make a desperate clearance on the line as Garcia wheeled away in celebration. After a few moments of confusion, the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel signalled that the goal had been given, sending Anfield into a state of euphoria. Rafael Benitez's side would go on to grind out a 1-0 aggregate win to book their place in the final in Istanbul. The goal remains hugely controversial to this day, with Chelsea and Liverpool fans in disagreement over whether the ball crossed the line. Chelsea's manager that day, Jose Mourinho, dubbed it the ""ghost goal"" after the match and insisted it should not have been given. ""It was a goal that came from the moon â from the Anfield stands,"" Mourinho said at the time. ""I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent. I felt it didn't interfere with my players but maybe it interfered with other people and maybe it interfered with the result."" A post shared by Luis Garcia (@luchogarcia14) Mourinho doubled down on those claims in 2019, telling beIN Sports: ""Anfield is a magic place to play, it is a beautiful place to play. ""They can even score goals that the players don't score, like it happened in 2005. ""It wasn't Garcia that scored the goal, it was the crowd that scored the goal, but now it isnât possible with VAR and goal-line technology."" Should the goal have been given?

Ralf Rangnick's side earned all three points in their final home game of the season against Thomas Frank's side thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, who netted a 61st minute penalty to take his Premier League tally to 18 goals, was named Sky Sports' Man of the Match for his efforts against the Bees.

The 37-year-old once again played a key part at Old Trafford â a ground he has scored 13 goals at this season. And as he set himself to score to make it 2-0, teammate Anthony Elanga was in confident spirits. In fact, the academy product started making his way to the corner flag before Ronaldo had even hit the ball.

Very good movement, but poor defending,"" the former United captain told Sky Sports. âThatâs what you want from young players. You got to mix your game up, when to go short, when to spin. Itâs a good ball from Dalot. âRight into the area and Fernandes, very simple but very effective. Lovely ball (from Elanga),â Keane added: âHeâs definitely got a bright future. Everything he does, on the pitch, is always positive.â will always remember when Elanga missed the penalty that knocked us out the FA Cup and Ronaldo went over to him a said that it was his fault and not Elangaâs, a true leader and role model. pic.twitter.com/JD1Gq27iVk It looks like Ronaldo may stay at Old Trafford for another season following Rangnick's post-match comments after the Brentford game. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports when asked about the forward's future. ""Heâs showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but itâs obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, itâs pretty obvious. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldnât be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks.

Former Watford boss Mazzarri was dismissed by Cagliari on Monday with the club 17th in the table, two points outside the relegation zone with three games remaining in the season. A one sentence statement announcing his dismissal was released on the club's website, which read: ""Cagliari Calcio announces that it has relieved Walter Mazzarri from his post as first-team coach.ï»¿"" However, Mazzarri could technically remain employed by Cagliari until 2024 because of a bizarre clause that is rumoured to be in his contract. In September, Mazzarri signed a new deal with the club which reportedly included the clause that stated he would have his contract extended until 2024 if he was dismissed from his role while the club was outside the relegation zone. Despite losing 2-1 to Verona on Saturday, Cagliari remain outside the bottom three after 18th-place Salernitana were held to a 1-1 draw at Atalanta on Monday. Walter Mazzarri is set to be fired from Cagliariâ¦whilst having his contract renewed.Mazzarri signed a contract in September which was subject to a clause: if he is sacked while his team is outside of the relegation zone, his contract will be extended until June 2024. pic.twitter.com/2YMqLcGNnE Cagliari return to action on Sunday against Salernitana, who have a game in hand against their relegation rivals. The Sardinian side will then face Inter Milan and Venezia in their final two games of the season. Cagliari's youth team coach Alessandro Agostini is set to take charge of the team for their three remaining games. Meanwhile, Mazzarri â who was linked with Liverpool before Jurgen Klopp's arrival on Merseyside â is set to go on gardening leave. Should the reports of the clause in his contract turn out to be correct, Mazzarri is likely to receive a significant pay-out from Cagliari to get him off their books before 2024.

Keane, 50, captained United during the most successful period in the club's history, winning seven Premier League titles and the Champions League in 13 trophy-laden seasons at Old Trafford. Ahead of Monday's Premier League match between United and Brentford, Keane was asked to pick his best United XI from the modern era. Loadingâ¦ In goal, Keane selected Peter Schmeichel ahead of Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, despite claiming the fiery Dane ""wasn't as good"" as everyone thought. He then picked Dennis Irwin at left-back and Gary Neville at right-back, before naming Jaap Stam and Gary Pallister as his preferred centre-back pairing. Explaining his decision to pick Pallister over the likes of Ferdinand, Steve Bruce and Nemanja Vidic, Keane said on Sky Sports: ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister. Brucey was a brilliant player but you have to leave someone out. ""Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. ""Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" Keane modestly chose to leave himself out of the side, instead selecting former United captain Bryan Robson in central midfield. ""Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best,"" added Keane. Surprisingly, Keane then selected Paul Ince to pair Robson in central midfield, snubbing former teammate Paul Scholes. ""Incey was a very good player, maybe tarnished his United reputation with him playing for Liverpool or whatever,"" added Keane. ""There is a lot of talk about Incey being the 'Guv'nor' and that was held against him but that was just banter. There was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and I thought he was a very good player. ""It was tough leaving Scholesy out and [Nicky] Butt, brilliant players and brilliant characters. But I just thought Incey in that first season I was there, when we won the double, he was brilliant in midfield. ""He was a good team-mate to have next to you in the trenches."" Keane completed his midfield with Ryan Giggs on the left wing and David Beckham on the right. And up front, he named Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as his two strikers, leaving out the likes of Eric Cantona, Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

It looks increasingly likely that the 29-year-old midfielder will leave in the coming weeks after a frustrating few months at Old Trafford. After an impressive loan spell at West Ham last year, Lingard has made just 22 appearances in all competitions for the Premier League strugglers this season, but most of them have come from the bench. Lingard, who is out of contract at the end of the season, could feature for United in their final two Premier League away games against Brighton and Crystal Palace. But interim manager Ralf Rangnick decided against giving his first-team minutes on Monday night in their last game of the season at Old Trafford â a decision that didn't go down well with his brother, Louie Scott. After 20 years at the club, Scott believes his sibling should have been given a proper send off in front of over 70,000 fans. ""20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell,"" Scott wrote on his private Instagram story. ""No wonder it's Conference League next year. ""Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you're ran by people who don't even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! ""Been there since nine years of age and didn't even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud."" Lingard is set to end his 20-year association with the club this summer, with Serie A giantsAC MilanandJuventus 'leading the chase' to land the England international on a free transfer. That being said, the Italian clubs face stiff competition from a number of Premier League outfits, with Newcastle thought to be keen on snapping up the 29-year-old, while former club West Ham may reignite their interest. The disrespect our club has showed @JesseLingard tonight makes my blood boil @ManUtd you are a joke regardless how the club has treated you jesse just know us united fans love and will miss you youâve always given your all for the club i hope your next club appreciates you moreâ¤ï¸ Last month, Manchester United's all-time top goalscorer Wayne Rooney named four players who they should build the team around, including Lingard. ""I think [Jadon] Sancho will be better next year, Marcus [Rashford] will be better next year,"" the club's all time top goalscorer said on Monday Night Football. ""They've got good young players. I think Jesse Lingard should be playing for them because he brings energy, brings quality. Scott McTominay's done well, ""So they do have some good young players, you just have to get some confidence and get them believing that they're good players and perform at the best level.

Who knew? Ralf Rangnick gave the Spanish playmaker his first Premier League start for Manchester United on Monday night in their clash against Brentford â and they looked a better side with him on the pitch as they recorded a comfortable 3-0 win. It was a night of firsts. United made over 400 passes in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time this season against Thomas Frank's side; an improvement on a host of poor performances in recent months. And top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo linked up wonderfully with Mata, who appeared to say his final farewell to fans at Old Trafford after an eight-year spell with the club. The Mata-Ronaldo show. pic.twitter.com/MCq3eLxJLi The 34-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and although he has yet to confirm his plans regarding his future, it appears the former Spain international will leave after waving to all corners of the stadium on Monday night. It has been a journey of mixed feelings for former Valencia and Chelsea attacking midfielder Mata. He's made a total of 283 appearances for United since being brought in by David Moyes for Â£37.1 million in 2014, but he has struggled for first-team minutes in recent years, despite showing glimpses of brilliance. Despite a lack of opportunitues at United, the experienced playmaker has always maintained his class off the pitch. After the full-time whistle on Monday night, he stayed behind at Old Trafford to sign autographs and take pictures with fans in the pouring rain.

According to a report from The Daily Mail, he helps unload the dirty laundry after games, as well as cleaning up the boots and other clothing. A source at the club spoke about his contributions off the pitch. ""Juan is a special guy, he has started to help the kit man and his staff over the last couple of months."" he said. ""It sums up what kind of person he is. While his team-mates just jump into their flashy motors and zoom off after being dropped off back after away games, Juan has taken it on himself to stay behind and give a helping hand to the ordinary staff. ""It's a huge job to unload all the gear off the coach and takes a good while. ""People have been saying what a great gesture it is but to be honest it's just typical of the man - we are saying he has to be the nicest man in football."" Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick labelled Mata as a ""magician"" after the 3-0 win against Brentford. When asked if he could have used Mata more often throughout the campaign, the interim boss said: ""Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game.

UEFA suspended Russia's national teams and club sides from competing in its competitions earlier this season following the invasion of Ukraine. European football's governing body has now confirmed that the measures have been extended to next season. Russian clubs will be banned from competing in the men's and women's Champions League, Europa League and UEFA Conference League in the 2022-23 campaign.

The women's team will no longer compete in European qualification for the 2023 World Cup, while the men's team - who were kicked out of the European play-offs for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - will also be prevented from competing in next season's Nations League. Russia has also been banned from bidding to host the men's European championship in 2028 and 2032.

A draw to Crystal Palace on Monday and 4-0 hammering at the hands of Manchester City has seen them dragged back into it, with Burnley now the form team of the trio. The Clarets parted company with long-time boss Sean Dyche last month and placed caretaker Mike Jackson in charge. Since then they've taken ten points from 12 games and scored six goals.

Loadingâ¦ The Bayern Munich captain helped his side wrap up their tenth consecutive Bundesliga title last month to take his personal trophy haul to a remarkable 27. Neuer helped redefine what it means to be a goalkeeper in the 2010s, regularly showing his complete lack of respect for the sacred goal-line. At any opportunity, the Germany international would be out and about in the Bayern defence for a touch of the ball. His distribution was unmatched for years and he's still got a wicked kick and throw. Manuel Neuer - The art of Goalkeeping pic.twitter.com/XzCcBJVjCf The 36-year-old has a nerve like no other and is partial to a Cruyff turn in his own area at least once per half... That might be slightly overboard. We'll settle at once per game. What good is a goalkeeper who can't save shots though? Between the sticks Neuer is an absolute phenomenon too. Over the years he's gone one on one with Robert Lewandowski, Lionel Messi and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and others only to come out on top. He also saved a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty in a Champions League semi-final shootout back in 2012. Not many can say they've denied Mr. Champions League in his competition. Fans have had their say and they think Neuer deserves to go down as perhaps the greatest goalkeeper in football history. One commented: ""I needed this today, what a comp sir. The greatest."" Another said: ""Easily the best goalkeeper I've ever seen. Complete package."" A third put: ""Best player after Messi and Ronaldo this generation. I donât wanna hear Neymar, Luis Suarez, Sergio Ramos. You simply cannot be the GOAT keeper and be below them."" While someone tweeted: ""The blueprint for modern goalkeepers. Far ahead of his time."" All in all Neuer has won ten Bundesligas, five DFB-Pokals, six DFL-Supercups, two Champions Leagues, two Super Cups and two Club World Cups in addition to the 2014 World Cup. Get all that? He very nearly ended up playing a game in midfield for Bayern as well. Pep Guardiolagenuinely considered the idea during his time as manager according to former CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""Manuel invented the art of being a footballer as a goalkeeper and revolutionised this position,"" Rummenigge told51, the club's official magazine. ""I still remember how Pep Guardiola, after winning a championship, seriously came up with the idea of ââputting him in midfield for a game."" There's no denying Neuer is closer to the end of his career than the beginning. Ederson and Alisson Becker have taken up the mantle as the next generation's go-to 'sweeper keeper'. It's always worth remembering there was one before, who paved the way. And he's got a lot left in the tank. ",positive

Foden rotates with a number of elite forwards in the City frontline and has eight league goals, while Salah is Liverpool's talisman and currently leads the Golden Boot race with 22 goals in the league. Crouch thinks Foden should win the award over Salah and teammate Kevin De Bruyne if City end the season as Premier League and Champions League winners. He wrote in his Daily Mail column: ""This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. Iâd potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. ""There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. ""The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off.

""Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks."" Salah's goal tally has decreased in 2022 but he's still one of Jurgen Klopp's most consistent performers. The Reds still have a historic quadruple in their sights and Crouch concluded if City and Liverpool share the spoils, it has to be Salah. He continued: ""Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them. If the two clubs trade trophies, Salah pips the others in my view for his sheer weight of goal contributions."" Liverpool ran out 1-0 winners over Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon to temporarily go top of the league.

In 2017, Van Persie was involved in a very angry goal celebration, after scoring in an Istanbul derby during a very heated Turkish Cup game. The Dutchman and Ozyakup had been mates when the pair were at Arsenal at the same time, though the Turkish international only ever played twice for the Gunners. However when the pair met in Turkey things went downhill quickly, with them exchanging words during the game after Ozyakup's teammate Dusko Tosic was sent off for pushing Van Persie.

Loadingâ¦ Six years ago, Leicester were on the verge of the most incredible league winning campaign in the history of the Premier League's history. Having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, the club had appointed Claudio Ranieri in the summer and the team went on an incredible run to make the impossible suddenly seem possible. On May 2nd title chasers Tottenham Hotspur, themselves trying to win a first league title since 1961, travelled to champions Chelsea in a must win game. The Blues were having a dreadful season but knew that stopping London rivals Spurs picking up all three points would result in Leicester being crowned champions. Whilst things were about to heat up in London, the Foxes' players gathered at Vardy's house to watch the game, as life imitated art, with the fan's ""Jamie Vardy's having a party"" chant came to life. The game at Stamford Bridge would become to be known as the 'Battle of the Bridge,' but it started in relatively basic circumstances for that campaign. Harry Kane scored his 25th goal of the league season, and when Son Heung-min doubled the lead before half time it looked like the champagne would have to be put on ice, as Spurs eyed their first win away to the Blues since 1990. A challenge by Danny Rose on Willian sparked angry scenes, with Mauricio Pochettino entering the pitch to split the two men, before Moussa Dembele gouged Diego Costa's eyes in the melee. Spurs were lucky Rose wasn't sent off for the challenge but then at half time momentum shifted as Eden Hazard was brought on as a substitute. Chelsea got on top with the introduction of the Belgian, despite his poor season to that date, but it was Gary Cahill who scored their first goal. Hazard grabbed the equaliser with seven minutes to go and things got uglier with challenges flying in from the visitors, inspired by the Chelsea players who had said they wanted to get one over their rivals and help Leicester, in the build up to the match. When the full time whistle blew it ended Spurs' slim hopes of winning the league and sparked incredible scenes at Vardy's house party.

It wasn't Spurs who they beat however, with Pochettino's side losing 5-1 to relegated Newcastle United on the final day and slipping behind Arsenal into third. Though it was the Battle of the Bridge that ended up giving Leicester their incredible title, that night it was all about the scenes at the Vardy residence.

DEADLOCK BROKEN! ð¥Richarlison picks the pocket of Azpilicueta on the edge of his own area and cooly slots the ball past Mendy! ð pic.twitter.com/P0VEFoeDi4 At the time fans on social media felt the 24-year-old could have been sent off but Everton claimed the player was looking to get rid of the flare but away from the fans. ""We will look into the matter,"" the club said. ""As far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" The club and the FA will both investigate the issue, with the FA having previously written to Liverpool's Harvey Elliott earlier this season when he handled a flare. That came in the Carabao Cup final win on penalties, also against Chelsea, with the 19-year-old picking up the flare before putting it back down again. In 2009 Didier Drogba was cautioned by the police after throwing a coin back into the crowd, after a Burnley fan had thrown it in his direction whilst he was celebrating a goal against the Clarets. As well as Richarlison's goal, Lampard and Everton were grateful for Jordan Pickford's brilliant performance in goal, somehow saving from Azpilicueta's shot, after the initial chance had left the goalkeeper on the other side of the goal. The Merseyside team are now just two points below both Leeds and Burnley, with the former dropping below the Clarets after recent results. They have a game in hand and next travel to Leicester City and then Watford, although they have not won an away game in the league since August. ",positive

Loadingâ¦ The USA international has found it hard to nail down a starting spot under Thomas Tuchel this season, with 17 of his 33 appearances coming from the bench. Pulisic's last full 90 minutes came against Burnley back in March and he managed to score as well as grab an assist in that 4-0 thrashing. He also scored a last-gasp winner against West Ham United last month. Chelsea have a wealth of attacking talent, but Mark Pulisic decided to voice his frustration on social media after seeing Christian come off the bench once again at Goodison Park. In a now deleted post he vented: ""The sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London.â¦ puts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boyâ¦ big 6 months ahead.."" The 23-year-old joined Chelsea in 2019 and had the big task of filling Eden Hazard's boots, who moved on to Real Madrid. His arrival coincided with the club's season-long transfer ban and expectations were big. Since then, Pulisic has gone on to make 111 appearances in all competitions and featured in last season's Champions League final victory against Manchester City. He'll be at the World Cup in Qatar with the USA, which is what Mark could be referring to in his tweet rather than a transfer. Pulisic isn't the only attacker to fall down the pecking order. Hakim Ziyech and summer signing Romelu Lukaku regularly join Pulisic on the Blues bench with Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mason Mount the preferred front three right now. It was a fiery affair against the Toffees as Frank Lampard's side took a massive step towards Premier League safety. Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta just after the break and slotted past Edouard Mendy for the only goal of the game. Jordan Pickford made a number of vital saves in the Everton net to preserve their lead. Everton are still 18th in the table, but have closed the gap on Burnley and Leeds United to just two points while having a game in hand. Burnley snatched victory from Watford on Saturday while Leeds were pummelled 4-0 by Manchester City later in the day. Meanwhile, Chelsea have comfortably been third for some time but are yet to mathematically qualify for the Champions League. ",negative
