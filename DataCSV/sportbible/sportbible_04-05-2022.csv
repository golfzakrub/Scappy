Loadingâ¦ On Tuesday night, Liverpool faced Villarreal in the second leg of their Champions League semi final, taking a two goal lead to El Madrigal. After being called a 'disgrace to the Champions League' in the first game, Villarreal were expected to show fight at home but no one was thinking Unai Emery's side had much chance, despite previous shocks against Juventus and Bayern Munich. They proved everyone wrong early in Spain though, with Boulaye Dia putting his side ahead in just the third minute, to rapturous scenes in the stands. It wasn't just the Villarreal fans who enjoyed the goal though, with Neville getting straight on Twitter to post a picture of him enjoying a glass of red wine, with a stunned look on his face. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ pic.twitter.com/bbnzPxSNPW Things then got even better for both Villarreal and, more importantly to this article, Neville. After Mohamed Salah has missed Liverpool's best chance, the hosts thought they should have had a penalty. The referee thought Giovani Lo Celso had jumped into Alisson, rather than the other way round, and VAR agreed, but just minutes later it was 2-0. Francis Coquelin headed home whilst unmarked in the box, from Etienne Capoue's cross, levelling things up on aggregate and getting Neville back on social media for another post. ð¤ pic.twitter.com/SmwdYINMQm However, the Manchester United legend, who was picked by Roy Keane for his all time United XI on Monday, didn't have much to smile about in the second half. The introduction by Jurgen Klopp of Luis Diaz, plus an absolute and utter disasterclass from Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the second half turned things on their head. Fabinho, Diaz and Sadio Mane all got on the scoresheet, with the host's keeper playing a part in all three goals, as Liverpool ended up winning the tie 5-2. Neville reacted by nearly crying into his wine glass and things only got worse for him as fellow Sky Sports pundit Carragher was ready to pounce. ð pic.twitter.com/oNBDYTFq9u The former Liverpool defender, who was no doubt as worried as many of the Reds fans at half time, had three excellent tweets for Neville all ready to go. First of all Carra retweeted his frenemy almost as soon as the full time whistle sounded, also taking jabs at all United, Manchester City and Everton fans.

Loadingâ¦ Jurgen Klopp's side arrived in Spain with a 2-0 lead from the home leg just six days ago, with the expectation that they would do enough to go through.

However just minutes later, Coquelin jumped unchallenged in the air and nodded home from Etienne Capoue's cross, after he got past Andrew Robertson.

Even ahead of the first leg it was being suggested that beating Liverpool would be a step too far, with the Premier League team still hunting an incredible quadruple. The Europa League champions weren't able to make much of an impact on the game at Anfield and didn't manage a single shot on target. That led to talkSPORT pundit Jason Cundy to call the Spanish side a 'disgrace to the Champions League,' an opinion that looked misguided at the time and has aged terribly. But Liverpool needed some look to win the first leg, with an own goal and some VAR controversy handing them their two goals on the night. Klopp's side haven't been behind too many times in recent weeks but at least when they have they've managed to turn things around, as they did against Manchester City in the Premier League. Will they be able to get the goal they need or can Villarreal see out one of the greatest European comebacks ever? ",positive

5,https://www.sportbible.com/football/chelsea-takeover-hits-problems-over-roman-abramovich-loan-uturn-20220503,Chelsea Takeover Hits Problems Over Roman Abramovich Loan U-Turn,"Roman Abramovich could cause serious issues for Chelsea, with reports that he wants to make a u-turn over the decision to cancel the club's loan to him. Loadingâ¦ Abramovich decided back in February to sell the Blues, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the need to sell sped up by sanctions on the Russian by the UK government. Initially it was reported that the billionaire was ready to waive the Â£1.6 billion the club owed him in loans in order to help the sale go through. Last week Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the UK's richest man, launched a late bid to buy the club but the American Boehly group were expected to be named as the preferred bidder. However, on Tuesday, things hit a barrier, with the Times reporting that Abramovich is 'attempting to renege' on waiving the money owed. The report says that Chelsea told the UK government and the preferred bidder that they wanted to restructure the deal, with the Â£1.6 billion going to the Blues' parent company, which appears to be linked to the current owner. The sanctions against the 55-year-old has meant his assets have been frozen and the money from the sale was meant to be used for good causes, including those in Ukraine affected by the war. Daily Mail sports writer Rob Draper explained on Twitter what the repercussions of the Abramovich decision could have on the Premier League side, and they could be very serious. The Premier League meet on June 8th to constitute the new league for 22-23. If Chelsea arenât licensed to operate by then - and they are only licensed now on UK Govt sufferance - then they canât be part of PL. Simplesâ¦.. Imagine if it came down to May 30th and there was genuine chance Chelsea could fold but somehow a Ratcliffe bid could save the day if only the UK Govt agreed to a let the proceeds to an independent charitable foundation? Well, that would be better than letting Chelsea foldâ¦ Draper explained that though there is a deadline for May 31st for the sale, the club would be in trouble if they weren't sold by June 8th, when the Premier League clubs meet. At that point their temporary license, which has allowed them to continue trading for the rest of this season, but also stopped fans buying tickets and merchandise, would have expired. Without a license to operate as a business, the club would not be able to continue in the league, which is obviously something everyone would want to avoid. Earlier in the process it was claimed that Abramovich could have taken the club into administration if he refused to sell to anyone from a country which placed sanctions of the billionaire. That clearly isn't the case, with an American led consortium set to be named as the preferred bidder and Ratcliffe still a potential buyer, but things could be just as bad in this current scenario.

6,https://www.sportbible.com/football/when-richarlison-called-fifa-president-baldie-whilst-getting-a-medal-20220503,When Richarlison Called FIFA President 'Baldie' Whilst Getting A Medal,"Richarlison was back in the headlines for his celebration on Sunday, in Everton's big win, but we prefer to remember how he celebrated winning a gold medal at last summer's Olympics. Loadingâ¦ The Everton forward scored what could be a hugely important goal against Chelsea last weekend, reducing his side's gap to Premier League safety down to just two points. Afterwards he picked up a flare thrown by the crowd and looked to have chucked it back from where it came, leading to an FA investigation. Richarlison has certainly had more to celebrate than maybe getting out of relegation in recent times, as he was part of the Brazil team that won at the Olympics in Tokyo. FIFA chief Infantino was in Japan to award the gold and silver medals to the finalists and the Everton forward had some rather insulting, or amusing depending on your position, words for the 51-year-old. As the forward was presented his medal he said, ""Hey, baldie, next year [we are winning it] in Qatar,"" referencing the upcoming World Cup. Richarlison to FIFA President Infantino: âNext year it will be in Qatar, baldie.â https://t.co/I8yRFtctem Here's Richarlison telling FIFA President Gianni Infantino ""see you next year in Qatar, bald man!""#EFC #Olympics pic.twitter.com/TEQDCkpT8C The 24-year-old was certainly relieved at the end of that match, having missed a penalty at 0-0 in the final against Spain, after just 38 minutes. The Selecao did manage to go into the break 1-0 up, Cunha scored the opener just as the first half was coming to an end, slotting home from inside the area after bustling past the Spanish defence. Spain got level through Mikel Oyarzabal, when he equalised just past the hour mark with a brilliant sliding volley at the far post, after a perfect cross. Malcolm then saved the game from going to a penalty shoot-out, which probably helped Richarlison having already missed a spot kick, scoring the winner in extra time to seal back-to-back gold for Brazil.

Loadingâ¦ Neville is undoubtedly one of the best full backs in the Premier League era, and helped win eight league titles in his 19 seasons at Old Trafford. On Monday night, Keane picked his former teammate in his all time XI for United, although he missed out another former teammate in Paul Scholes. Keane was sat alongside Jamie Carragher on Monday Night Football, after United's win against Brentford, whilst picking his team, after they'd watched the Irishman's old team beat Brentford. Whilst with Carragher, it's no surprise that Keane wanted to take shots at their fellow Sky Sports pundit Neville, and he revealed a rather embarrassing and bizarre truth about the 47-year-old's bedroom habits whilst he was playing. ""Gary was a brilliant player,"" the former United captain said on MNF, ""But Gary was a great character in the sense that, when he came into the group, into the first-team squad, I think Gary used to go to bed at half-past eight every evening and he'd be going to bed with his bowl of cereal and we'd be criticising him but he was a really top professional player.

""Gary was an excellent player, a really good pro, he really looked after himself and did very well with United and, of course, with England. You have to have quality to do what Gary did."" It's not the first time that the former right back's cereal habits have come up, with Neville revealing in 2014 that he used to take his own own bowl, spoon and Weetabix to games. ""The other players liked to tease me about travelling with my own bowl, spoon and Weetabix,"" he told the Guardian. ""I didn't eat Weetabix as a child; I didn't really like any cereals. But as a professional footballer, Weetabix became my thing.""

Madrid head into the match as Spanish champions, having clinched the La Liga title with a 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday. Loadingâ¦ While holding his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Guardiola was bizarrely asked by a member of the Spanish press if City will give Madrid a guard of honour. The act, which is performed by teams as a mark of respect to newly-crowned champions, is typically reserved for domestic league competitions. ""Will you give Madrid the guard of honour for winning La Liga?,"" asked the Spanish journalist. Former Barcelona manager Guardiola responded: ""I don't have an opinion on that.""

While they will almost certainly not receive a guard of honour from City, Madrid may also have to go without one when they visit bitter rivals Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Sunday. Atletico defender Jose Gimenez has suggested the home side won't perform the gesture at the Wanda Metropolitano. ""A guard of honour to Real Madrid? We congratulate them, but we have a lot of respect for our fans,"" said Gimenez. Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak has also expressed his opposition to performing the act.

Loadingâ¦ Not many players have come out of United's season with their reputation enhanced, with the team needing to win their final two matches just to match their worst points tally in the Premier League history. Even Ronaldo has had his detractors at times, despite the fact he's easily the team's top scorer, and Mark Goldbridge recently explained why the 37-year-old isn't the problem at the club in an epic rant. On Monday night, the former Juventus striker put in a brilliant performance, as United won their final home game of the season 3-0, with Anthony Elanga so certain his teammate he would score his penalty that the Swedish forward started celebrating early. After the match, the players took part in a 'lap of appreciation,' as they thanked the fans for their support during a terrible season, despite some being outside Old Trafford protesting. At the end of his walk around the pitch, Ronaldo looked into the camera and said something, which fans first believed to be ""I'm not finished.""

That took fans back to the drawing board to try and work out exactly what it was Real Madrid's all time top goalscorer actually said to the camera. They went back to social media to say that he told the camera, or more specifically the person controlling it, 'come on finish,' in a jokey way.

""I was crying at the final whistle when he was waving and blowing kisses to the fans saying goodbye,"" she says. ""Seeing him play at Old Trafford for the last time was amazing but sad."" After saying farewell to the former Paris Saint-Germain forward from the stands, Lola decided to chance her luck and wait for the 35-year-old in the stadium's car park. Her perseverance paid off. She shouted over to Cavani, who embraced the youngster as she started to sob. ""It made my life meeting him, especially as he will probably go back to South America now,"" Lola says.

The statue outside the Stadium of Light shows former Sunderland manager Stokoe celebrating his side's 1-0 win over Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup final. Ironically, Stokoe also won the FA Cup with Newcastle as a player in 1955. Northumbria Police have confirmed a 21-year-old man has now been arrested in connection with the video. A Police spokesperson said: ""We are aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show a man urinating on a memorial outside the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. ""This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable and a full investigation has been launched into the incident. ""A 21-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and remains in police custody at this time. ""We recognise that incidents of this nature can cause anger and frustration within our communities. ""We would ask everyone to please respect the ongoing investigation and refrain from anything that could jeopardise these live enquiries.â A Sunderland spokesperson said on Monday: ""This matter has been referred to the police and we will not be making any further comment at this moment in time."" Born in 1930, Stokoe joined Newcastle as an apprentice in 1947 and would make his first-team debut for the club in 1950. He would go on to make 261 appearances for the Magpies, with the highlight of his playing career coming in the 3-1 win over Manchester City in the 1955 FA Cup final. He later joined Bury and managed the Greater Manchester club before taking charge of Charlton Athletic, Rochdale, Carlisle United and Blackpool. Stokoe later joined Sunderland in 1972, helping the Division Two side win the FA Cup the following season before guiding them back to the top tier of English football in 1976. He resigned from his role just months later after a poor start to their Division One campaign, later taking charge of the club on a caretaker basis in 1987 when they were relegated. Stokoe died in 2004 at the age of 73 after suffering with pneumonia, with Sunderland later unveiling the statue of him outside the Stadium of Light in 2006. Loadingâ¦ ",positive

Garcia's goal sent Liverpool through to the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, where they would come from three goals down to beat AC Milan on penalties in one of the greatest games in history. Liverpool could book their place in yet another Champions League final this evening if they beat Villarreal in the second leg of their semi-final tie, with Jurgen Klopp's side holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg at Anfield. Loadingâ¦ Back in 2005, it was Chelsea who were Liverpool's opponents in the last four of the competition. The first leg at Stamford Bridge had ended in a goalless draw to leave the tie delicately poised heading into the second leg at Anfield. And it burst into life just four minutes into the reverse fixture on Merseyside. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard played a chipped through-ball over the top of the Chelsea defence, which striker Milan Baros attempted to reach before Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech. Baros managed to get a touch on the ball before being brought down by Cech in front of the Kop. #OnThisDay in 2005, @luchogarcia14 sent us to Istanbul ð pic.twitter.com/eBNbIm4fPN As the home fans pleaded for a penalty and a red card, Garcia latched onto the loose ball and directed a shot towards goal which deflected off Chelsea captain John Terry. William Gallas raced back towards goal to make a desperate clearance on the line as Garcia wheeled away in celebration. After a few moments of confusion, the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel signalled that the goal had been given, sending Anfield into a state of euphoria. Rafael Benitez's side would go on to grind out a 1-0 aggregate win to book their place in the final in Istanbul. The goal remains hugely controversial to this day, with Chelsea and Liverpool fans in disagreement over whether the ball crossed the line. Chelsea's manager that day, Jose Mourinho, dubbed it the ""ghost goal"" after the match and insisted it should not have been given. ""It was a goal that came from the moon â from the Anfield stands,"" Mourinho said at the time. ""I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent. I felt it didn't interfere with my players but maybe it interfered with other people and maybe it interfered with the result."" A post shared by Luis Garcia (@luchogarcia14) Mourinho doubled down on those claims in 2019, telling beIN Sports: ""Anfield is a magic place to play, it is a beautiful place to play. ""They can even score goals that the players don't score, like it happened in 2005. ""It wasn't Garcia that scored the goal, it was the crowd that scored the goal, but now it isnât possible with VAR and goal-line technology."" Should the goal have been given?

""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports when asked about the forward's future. ""Heâs showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but itâs obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, itâs pretty obvious. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world.

Former Watford boss Mazzarri was dismissed by Cagliari on Monday with the club 17th in the table, two points outside the relegation zone with three games remaining in the season. A one sentence statement announcing his dismissal was released on the club's website, which read: ""Cagliari Calcio announces that it has relieved Walter Mazzarri from his post as first-team coach.ï»¿"" However, Mazzarri could technically remain employed by Cagliari until 2024 because of a bizarre clause that is rumoured to be in his contract. In September, Mazzarri signed a new deal with the club which reportedly included the clause that stated he would have his contract extended until 2024 if he was dismissed from his role while the club was outside the relegation zone. Despite losing 2-1 to Verona on Saturday, Cagliari remain outside the bottom three after 18th-place Salernitana were held to a 1-1 draw at Atalanta on Monday.

Keane, 50, captained United during the most successful period in the club's history, winning seven Premier League titles and the Champions League in 13 trophy-laden seasons at Old Trafford. Ahead of Monday's Premier League match between United and Brentford, Keane was asked to pick his best United XI from the modern era. Loadingâ¦ In goal, Keane selected Peter Schmeichel ahead of Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, despite claiming the fiery Dane ""wasn't as good"" as everyone thought. He then picked Dennis Irwin at left-back and Gary Neville at right-back, before naming Jaap Stam and Gary Pallister as his preferred centre-back pairing. Explaining his decision to pick Pallister over the likes of Ferdinand, Steve Bruce and Nemanja Vidic, Keane said on Sky Sports: ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister. Brucey was a brilliant player but you have to leave someone out. ""Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. ""Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" Keane modestly chose to leave himself out of the side, instead selecting former United captain Bryan Robson in central midfield. ""Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best,"" added Keane. Surprisingly, Keane then selected Paul Ince to pair Robson in central midfield, snubbing former teammate Paul Scholes. ""Incey was a very good player, maybe tarnished his United reputation with him playing for Liverpool or whatever,"" added Keane. ""There is a lot of talk about Incey being the 'Guv'nor' and that was held against him but that was just banter. There was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and I thought he was a very good player. ""It was tough leaving Scholesy out and [Nicky] Butt, brilliant players and brilliant characters. But I just thought Incey in that first season I was there, when we won the double, he was brilliant in midfield. ""He was a good team-mate to have next to you in the trenches."" Keane completed his midfield with Ryan Giggs on the left wing and David Beckham on the right. And up front, he named Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as his two strikers, leaving out the likes of Eric Cantona, Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

It looks increasingly likely that the 29-year-old midfielder will leave in the coming weeks after a frustrating few months at Old Trafford. After an impressive loan spell at West Ham last year, Lingard has made just 22 appearances in all competitions for the Premier League strugglers this season, but most of them have come from the bench. Lingard, who is out of contract at the end of the season, could feature for United in their final two Premier League away games against Brighton and Crystal Palace. But interim manager Ralf Rangnick decided against giving his first-team minutes on Monday night in their last game of the season at Old Trafford â a decision that didn't go down well with his brother, Louie Scott. After 20 years at the club, Scott believes his sibling should have been given a proper send off in front of over 70,000 fans. ""20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell,"" Scott wrote on his private Instagram story. ""No wonder it's Conference League next year.

Lingard is set to end his 20-year association with the club this summer, with Serie A giantsAC MilanandJuventus 'leading the chase' to land the England international on a free transfer. That being said, the Italian clubs face stiff competition from a number of Premier League outfits, with Newcastle thought to be keen on snapping up the 29-year-old, while former club West Ham may reignite their interest.

He's made a total of 283 appearances for United since being brought in by David Moyes for Â£37.1 million in 2014, but he has struggled for first-team minutes in recent years, despite showing glimpses of brilliance.

""People have been saying what a great gesture it is but to be honest it's just typical of the man - we are saying he has to be the nicest man in football.""

UEFA suspended Russia's national teams and club sides from competing in its competitions earlier this season following the invasion of Ukraine. European football's governing body has now confirmed that the measures have been extended to next season. Russian clubs will be banned from competing in the men's and women's Champions League, Europa League and UEFA Conference League in the 2022-23 campaign. The country's national sides also remain suspended, with Portugal set to replace Russia in the women's Euros in England this summer. The women's team will no longer compete in European qualification for the 2023 World Cup, while the men's team - who were kicked out of the European play-offs for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - will also be prevented from competing in next season's Nations League. Russia has also been banned from bidding to host the men's European championship in 2028 and 2032. The UEFA Executive Committee has today declared the bid submitted by the Football Union of Russia to host UEFA EURO 2028 or UEFA EURO 2032 as ineligible.This is one of several decisions relating to the on-going suspension of Russian teams and clubs from UEFA competitions. Russia had previously declared an interest in rivalling the UK and Ireland for the right to host Euro 2028, with Turkey also signalling an interest in hosting the tournament. Russia had also expressed an interest in hosting Euro 2032, as have Turkey and Italy. ""The UEFA Executive Committee has today declared the bid submitted by the Football Union of Russia to host UEFA EURO 2028 or UEFA EURO 2032 as ineligible,"" read a statement released by UEFA on Twitter. ""This is one of several decisions relating to the on-going suspension of Russian teams and clubs from UEFA competitions."" The decision to ban Russian clubs from European competition next season is set to benefit Scottish football, with the winner of the Scottish Premiership now set to automatically qualify for the group stage of the Champions League. Celtic are currently top of the table and will be crowned champions if they claim four points from their final three league games. Earlier this season, Russia lost the right to host the Champions League final. The Gazprom Arena in St Petersburg was due to host the event on May 28 before it was moved to the Stade de France in Paris following the invasion of Ukraine. Loadingâ¦ ",positive

UEFA donât care about fans and make football something for corporate partners to enjoy rather than the fans is the point of moaning This is disgusting. And you wonder why a superleague was trying to be formed. Giving more tickets to sponsors and uefa oligarchs is an abomination. This competition should be about the fans of the 2 teams in the final. 50% to them teams is not good enough.

However, because of the order of the draw, Liverpool and Villarreal could not play each other in the end. It was due to Inter Milan and Real Madrid competing in the same group, as well as Real not being able to play Villarreal courtesy of rules relating to teams from the same country.

Lindelof joined United from Benfica for Â£30 million months prior and has forged a decent career for himself at Old Trafford, given the club's struggles in recent years. The Sweden captain regularly started under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the latter settling on Lindelof as Harry Maguire's preferred partner for two seasons. Raphael Varane joined last summer and he's taken Lindelof's place next to captain Maguire. The former Real Madrid man has had his own injury issues however and Lindelof's managed to make 25 league appearances. United are sixth in the Premier League and have to win all three of their remaining games to ensure they don't finish with their worst ever points tally.

Loadingâ¦ Abramovich has been officially looking to sell the club, who he bought in 2003, for the past few weeks, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The billionaire has since been put under sanctions from the UK government, meaning their fans can't even buy tickets to games or merchandise, but the club is still for sale. Abramovich hired The Raine Group to help sell the club and, despite the sanctions, is set to have a say in who can buy the club, and that's where the issues could be. According to the Daily Mail, the 55-year-old could veto any bids that come from countries that have sanctioned Russia in the past few weeks. If he did that it would mean that he refused to sell to any British or American bids, or even from the EU, leaving minimal potential buyers left. If Abramovich can't find a seller soon then there is a chance of the club going into administration, with them not currently being able to make money, and the owner's accounts having been frozen, whilst players still need to be paid. The problems are added to by the fact that the UK government, and particularly Chancellor Rishi Sunak, are overseeing the sale of the Blues. That will be to make sure that Abramovich isn't actually benefiting from the sale, but it could also mean that certain other buyers are ruled out. Sunak could be reticent to sell to any bidders from Saudi Arabia, especially with the Premier League considering making human rights a part of their fit and proper persons test for new owners. They would have to be careful denying any Saudi bid, considering that Newcastle United were only recently bought by the country's Public Investment Fund and Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked to intervene to help with that sale, though his part is unknown. Considering the PM also visited the country earlier in the week, as part of a mission for the UK to rely less on oil and gas from Russia, it could be tough for the government to get involved. It was reported several weeks ago that Abramovich could also refuse to sell to potential buyers from 'politically controversial' countries, as he wants to leave the Blues in good hands following his successful 19 years at the helm. John Terry has joined one of the consortiums attempting to take over at Stamford Bridge, and he seems like one British person Abramovich wouldn't refuse to sell to. The club's future very much remains shrouded in mystery right now and it remains anyone's guess who will be the next owners. ",positive

The team's fans have thrown their support behind the billionaire who has bought all the success to West London in the past two decades, including some chanting his name on Saturday during the minute's applause in solidarity with Ukraine. Abramovich is obviously trying to repay the love the fans have for him by selling to the right person, or people, to take the team forward after he's left. According to the Mirror, amongst the criteria for any prospective buyer is that the new owner will continue the policy to invest in the playing squad. Abramovich has spent a huge amount on buying players since becoming owner, and it has been the driving force behind their five Premier League title and two Champions League wins in that time. Even in the past year he has spent around Â£106 million, although most of that was just on Romelu Lukaku, with the rest the loan price for Saul Niguez. He has occasionally pulled back on his spending but in recent years it has been back at its highest, as they attempt to keep pace with Manchester City and Liverpool. The 55-year-old was also originally going be building a new stadium for the Blues, but ended that project when his UK citizenship application was denied in 2018. Investment into a new stadium, or the development of Stamford Bridge, is also on the criteria for any new owner, with the Russian reportedly not in a rush to sell. Already it has been reported that the Saratov born owner was wary of selling to any one that would be considered 'politically controversial.' With the Premier League also looking into adding human rights record to their 'fit and proper persons test', it is thought to rule out any buyers from Saudi Arabia or China.

""This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible. ""We will also be seeking guidance from the UK Government on the impact of these measures on the Chelsea Foundation and its important work in our communities."" Abramovich had been in the middle of attempting to sell the club, with a number of potential bidders linked with a move for the two times Champions League winners. There had been interest from American Robert 'Woody' Johnson, the owner of NFL side New York Jets, and the current Blues' owner was said to have wanted to avoid owners from 'politically controversial' countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia. Right now all his plans to sell will have to be put on hold, unless sanctions are lifted or he can get special dispensation proving he won't benefit from the sale. The club will be desperate to get their licence amended, otherwise only those with season tickets will be able to go to games. ",negative

Burnley's back-to-back wins had left Everton five points from safety and looking like a first relegation since 1951, and with games running out it was becoming a major worry. Richarlison put his side 1-0 up just a minute after the second half begun, pouncing on Cesar Azpilicueta's mistake and slotting past Edouard Mendy, to rapturous scenes from the home supporters.

""We will look into the matter,"" the club said. ""As far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" The club and the FA will both investigate the issue, with the FA having previously written to Liverpool's Harvey Elliott earlier this season when he handled a flare. That came in the Carabao Cup final win on penalties, also against Chelsea, with the 19-year-old picking up the flare before putting it back down again. In 2009 Didier Drogba was cautioned by the police after throwing a coin back into the crowd, after a Burnley fan had thrown it in his direction whilst he was celebrating a goal against the Clarets. As well as Richarlison's goal, Lampard and Everton were grateful for Jordan Pickford's brilliant performance in goal, somehow saving from Azpilicueta's shot, after the initial chance had left the goalkeeper on the other side of the goal. The Merseyside team are now just two points below both Leeds and Burnley, with the former dropping below the Clarets after recent results.

Despite many thinking Keane is like that all the time, a recent chat with Neville on The Overlap will change your mind. The United legends broke down Keane's entire career on a walk with his dog Jet and every word in the hour chat was fascinating. Keane's 2005 departure from United was filled with turmoil and his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson never fully recovered, 16 years on however, the 50-year-old still feels he was 'wronged' in the entire situation. ""It was brilliant at first. The anger I have towards the end of my time at United is justified. I feel that I was wronged. We all do something and say 'I kind of played my part in that' but no not on that occasion. You might have a different opinion but I don't think so. ""We did that Q&A in Dublin and you said there was no way back, the damage was done six months before that. I knew it was coming. ""I wasn't daft. When you're working with brilliant managers and that respect is lost, which it was, it's already over."" He quickly stressed his time at United was the 'best of his life' and didn't want to dwell on the negativity. Keane explained that he's eager to make a return to management, with his last job being a decade ago at Ipswich Town. ""I am pretty content in what I am doing at the moment but I have my days where I get restless like everyone else"", Keane said. ""I ask myself do I want to get back into management but realistically where am I going to go back into? The Championship? The top of League One?'. ""It's not easy when I went into management but there is something in there that makes me think I could be a good manager. That's what's pulling me to make me go back in."" This past year has seen him join social media platform Instagram and in 2021 alone, he's earned 1.5 million followers. Some have questioned if his social media presence is entirely legit - but it is, with his youngest daughter being the only member of his 'team'.

After being asked who the player was by Neville, Keane replied: ""It was the sweeper, Sammer. He said, 'No' and I went, '****' ""He was polite, but if I really wanted to swap with somebody, it probably would have been Zidane. ""Zidane is a brilliant player and after the Madrid game we were walking up the tunnel together; he was looking at me, and I was thinking he'd probably ask me for my shirt . But no, I'm glad we didn't swap shirts, and that was the other time I thought, 'will I, won't I?' and I've gone, 'no, leave it.'"" This exchange was part of a fascinating interview between two men who have won just about everything in the club game. Keane also recounted his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson, the fall-out from leaving the Republic of Ireland World Cup squad, and summed up his hugely-successful 12 years at the club.

Loadingâ¦ If City's game in the quarter final was dull in terms of footballing quality then the first part of their semi final was everything opposite. The match in Manchester was entertaining from the first minute to the last, as Kevin de Bruyne scored the quickest goal in a Champions League semi final, heading home inside two minutes. Pep Guardiola got his starting XI spot on and Gabriel Jesus, fresh from scoring four against Watford at the weekend, made it 2-0 in the 11th minute. 94 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK! â¡ï¸Riyad Mahrez with an unbelievable delivery and Kevin De Bruyne with an expertly guided header ð¯An incredible start for Man City!#UCL pic.twitter.com/nuiF7OqsXb Real got back into the game before half time, thanks to Karim Benzema's stunning goal, which was his 13th of the tournament and eighth of the knockout stages so far. City started the second half in similar fashion to the first, somehow missing a couple of chances that looked certain to be goals, before Phil Foden did make it 3-1 in the 53rd minute. Vinicius Junior then halved the deficit once again, as he showed off a brilliant turn of pace to get past Fernandinho, drive into the box and score. IT HAD TO BE HIM! â½ï¸Karim Benzema halves Man City's lead with a lovely instinctive finish ð#UCL pic.twitter.com/JrFK1faTvN The pendulum swung again towards City as Bernardo Silva struck a beautiful shot from outside the area to make it 4-2, after the referee had played a perfect advantage. But Real refused to give up once again and Benzema scored the most brilliant of penalties, when he chose to Panenka the ball down the middle, after Aymeric Laporte had handled the ball from a cross. More chances came City's way, as Guardiola's side tried to take a two goal lead to the Bernabeu, but Carlo Ancelotti's side managed to hang on in one of the most pulsating of games anyone is likely to have seen in the Champions League.

This game is an absolute thriller! ð¥ð¥ð¥#UCL pic.twitter.com/K2f60EBgl6 Aside from scoring four times, and three times getting a two goal lead, the Premier League leaders had plenty of chances to kill the game. At 2-0 alone both Riyad Mahrez and Foden had great chances to score, with Mahrez deciding to shoot rather than cross for Foden for his chance. However their failure to score more, and ability to let Real back into the game on three occasions, makes for a really intriguing second leg next week. City were able to hold onto a 1-0 lead going to Madrid in the last round, when they took on Atletico Madrid, but Ancelotti's team will surely have more going forward than Diego Simeone's team did, although they themselves should have scored. The fact there is no away goals this season will also help City, but they must be aware of Los Blancos' ability to comeback after a first leg loss away from home. In the last 16, Ancelotti's side found themselves two goals down in the tie, during the second half of the second leg, against PSG and came back to win, thanks to Benzema's 17 minute hat-trick.

Loadingâ¦ City's Champions League semi final first leg with Real Madrid was an incredible match that went back and forth between the two huge sides. The English club flew out of the blocks, with the quickest goal ever in a semi final in the competition, and were two goals up inside 11 minutes. Karim Benzema continued his amazing record in the tournament this season to make it 2-1, before Phil Foden restored the hosts two goal lead. That's when Vinicius provided what would normally be the most magical moment of any game, but on this night was one of many, as he left Fernandinho in his dust with a wonderful dummy. The Brazilian forward then surged away to score and make it 3-2, something Guardiola clearly knew was about to happen, as he looked on in horror and fell to his knees as soon as Vinicius fooled the City player. Loadingâ¦ City did have issues ahead of kick off, with both Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo out of the game, and John Stones was also expected to be missing. The former Everton player was able to make kick off and played at right back, coming up against Vinicius, but he had to come off injured in the first half. That brought Fernandinho on, to play in a rather unfamiliar position, and come up against speedster Vinicius, who is also 15 years his country man's junior. With that mismatch in place, it didn't help that Aymeric Laporte wasn't quick enough in coming across to help his teammate and the Real forward halved the deficit. The momentum in the tie would swing both way again after Vinicius' goal, as Bernardo Silva's brilliant strike, and the referee's smart decision to play advantage, helped City grab a two goal lead for the third time. Karim Benzema then proved he has ice in his veins as he Panenka'd a penalty right down the middle of the goal, having missed three of his previous four goals. Guardiola can at least be happy knowing that he can't be on the end of the usual criticism he gets around this point of the Champions League, as he certainly didn't overthink things. His team will actually be annoyed that they didn't win by more but having defended a one goal lead in Madrid in the last round they will be optimistic about getting into their second Champions League final in-a-row.

City edged a seven-goal thriller at the Etihad on Tuesday night to take a 4-3 lead into the second leg at the Bernabeu next Wednesday. Kevin De Bruyne put City ahead after less than two minutes before Gabriel Jesus added a second for the hosts shortly afterwards. Loadingâ¦ Benzema pulled one back with an instinctive finish before the break, with Phil Foden and Vinicius Jr trading goals early in the second half. Bernardo Silva restored Cityâs two-goal lead before Madrid were handed a late penalty when the ball struck Aymeric Laporteâs arm inside the area. As Benzema prepared to take the crucial spot kick, a green laser was directed at his face from the home support. But the France international kept his composure to score an outrageous Panenka down the middle of Edersonâs goal. ""Yeah, I didn't have that.

The Brazilian and his colleagues trained at City's Etihad Stadium on Monday ahead of the massive Champions League semi-final first leg. Loadingâ¦ And the world's media were there to film the 13-time European champions going through their final preparations. But they also witnessed veteran left-back react as though he had committed an almighty mistake when he walked over the City badge. As you walk out the Etihad tunnel, there is a mosaic of City's crest and Marcelo, having been in mid-conversation, didn't realise it was there. But then when made aware by a couple of his teammates afterwards, Marcelo brought his hands to his head and looked distraught. In recent times, plenty of players have refused to walk on crests out of respect. In the previous round, Atleti players Rodrigo de Paul, Luis Suarez and Angel Correa opted to walk around - though Antoine Griezmann wasn't quite feeling as respectful and strolled as normal. Rodrigo de Paul, Luis SuÃ¡rez and Ãngel Correa all avoided stepping on Manchester Cityâs crest before entering the stadium for training.

Loadingâ¦ A miserable season at Old Trafford will come to end on Monday night, as United play their final home game, ahead of two away fixtures. Fans have only seen their team win nine times in the league in Manchester so far this season, which is actually an improvement on their away form, and the end of the campaign probably can't come soon enough. When the final whistle is blown following the game against Thomas Frank's team the players are set to take a lap of honour, or give a lap of appreciation to the fans, depending on how it's spun. A group of fans will miss the gesture however, as there is a planned walkout 17 minutes from the end of the match, to protest the 17 years the club has been under American ownership from the Glazer family. In recent games the 17 minutes of not being in their seats has come before kick off but the Brentford match protests are planned for the final part of the game. Whilst the club are aware that the players might not get the best reception during their lap, there are several players playing in front of the home fans for the last time. Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata's contracts are both expiring, so could play their last minutes at Old Trafford, whilst Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani are in the same situation but injured. Nemanja Matic has also revealed that he wants to leave in the summer, and others are expected to depart with the arrival of Erik ten Hag likely to lead to a clearout. Some players may get a warm reception but Pogba, whose future isn't sorted yet, was recently booed when coming off in the game against Norwich City. Monday's game comes a year after the club's fans had their most 'successful' protest against the owners, as they managed to get a game with Liverpool postponed. Thousands gathered outside of Old Trafford, whilst games were still being played behind closed doors due to Covid, and hundreds even got onto the pitch. There were also protests outside of the hotels the two sets of players were gathered at, stopping the clubs getting to the match, and it was played at a later date. The time Premier League winners need to win their remaining three games, with matches against Brighton and Crystal Palace to follow, just to level their worst points tally since the inception of the league in 1992.

Loadingâ¦ The Manchester United striker returned to Old Trafford last summer and is regarded as one of the greatest players ever, having won five Ballon d'Or awards. He's scored 15 goals in 29 appearances this season but at 37-years-old, Leboeuf thinks it's time for 'CR7' to start winding his career down. The World Cup winner told ESPN FC: ""Do you know what? I think there is a time where you have to think, âwhat do I do with my life and my career?â ""And maybe itâs time for Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of his career to wonder and have a discussion with himself, and maybe some of his family, to know what he has to do for the rest of his career, if there is a future in his career. ""I donât want to watch Ronaldo and have pity because heâs been on the top for so many years."" Ronaldo's goal record can't be disputed, but many believe his style of play is starting to hold United back. He's been substituted a number of times under interim manager Ralf Rangnick and regularly cuts a frustrated figure on the bench. Leboeuf continued: ""I donât want him to be a normal player. Heâs been an exceptional player for so long. ""Iâd prefer him to give up his career at the top instead of maybe trying and play for two or three more years and not being the player that he used to be."" Ronaldo started in Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League but failed to make an impact. It's all to play for in next month's return leg however as Anthony Elanga's late strike cancelled out Joao Felix's first-half header. Atletico were the better side throughout and hit the bar twice, once after Sime Vrsaljko's header hit Victor Lindelof and once through an Antoine Griezmann effort. But Rangnick made key changes late in the game and one of those was Elanga, who scored his fourth goal of the season. The teenager is quickly becoming a fan favourite and has seized the opportunity given by Rangnick. Elanga was keen to leave on loan in January, but Rangnick informed him he'd be a part of the first-team set-up. ",positive

It's not been a good season for anyone at the club really but Ronaldo has at least been able to show his incredible goal scoring ability, especially in recent weeks. Once again on Thursday night he saved Ralf Rangnick's side from defeat, with a brilliantly struck equaliser, just minutes after the team went behind.

United's top four hopes are now hanging by a thread after they were beaten 3-1 at the Emirates on Saturday. Ronaldo scored his 22nd of the season for United but goals from Nuno Tavares, Bukayo Saka and Granit Xhaka secured a crucial victory for Arsenal.

Arsenal fan Morgan has urged his club to make a move for Ronaldo in the summer window and says he has spoken with the five-time Ballon dâOr winner to try and convince him to join. Speaking on talkSPORT, Morgan said: âWhen it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, weâve got the richest of all of them. âStan Kroenke has got Â£10bn, heâs married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has Â£15bn.

Iâve had this conversation with him last week. I said 'come to Arsenal'. âThe Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting.

Loadingâ¦ Maguire has been criticised a lot for his form this season for United, despite the fact that the player has claimed he is playing well and that's why he continues to be picked. The defender's season was perhaps best summed up by the fact that he recently managed to accidentally kick Paul Pogba in the face whilst attacking a corner. So bad has he been, according to fans, that there's even been a petition to remove him as captain, which has been signed by over 40,000 fans. Now Rangnick, who has. been very honest in his assessment of the team in the past few weeks, has suggested that Maguire could be removed as captain. Speaking ahead of United's game with Chelsea on Thursday, the interim manager was asked if the former Leicester City defender would continue wearing the armband. ""I understand your question, but again I think it doesnât make sense because you donât know which kind of players will be here, what the group will look like,"" the interim boss said. ""I can only tell what I have done in the past when I was the head coach or the manager, because in Germany itâs called âmatch kapitanâ, so the captain of the team. ""I strongly believe that the captain should be elected by the team because heâs called the team manager, and we always did that. ""We always had a board of four or five players, we called it the âspielkapitanâ, elected by the players, the player with the highest amount of votes was the team captain at the end. ""Thatâs how I did it, I know that not a lot of head coaches do it that way."" Earlier in the season it was suggested that there was a power struggle between Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo over the captaincy. Even Bayern Munich player Alphonso Davies joined in the discourse, claiming he couldn't believe that the Â£80 million centre back was the main in the armband and not Ronaldo. Erik ten Hag may well look to remove Maguire as the captain, a position he took just six months after signing for the club, once Ashley Young left. ",positive

Loadingâ¦ Rangnick has not been holding back with his feelings about United in recent days, especially following the 4-0 shallacking by Liverpool on Tuesday. The interim boss, who will be replaced by Erik ten Hag in June, was honest in saying that the club were six years behind their rivals and that they probably needed 10 new players this summer. And it seems that he's not held back when it comes to talking to his coaches either, with former midfielder Fletcher ending up on his bad side. According to the Telegraph, Rangnick was left surprised with Fletcher shouting instructions during games and has asked the Scotsman to stop. Fletcher was brought in as a coach by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2021 and was then given the role of technical director just a few months later. Despite that he retained his position on the bench and within the coaching group and kept his role at the club even when Solskjaer, unlike Michael Carrick who chose to walk away. The 38-year-old has also been part of the meetings to decide who would take over from Rangnick, according to the report something that has also annoyed the German as he wanted the job permanently. Fletcher also has opted to participate in training sessions, when the first team have been short of a player through injury, something that has also surprised Rangnick. It seems unlikely that the five times Premier League winner will remain on the bench next season, when Ten Hag takes over at Old Trafford. The Ajax boss is likely to have more say on the coaching staff than Rangnick has had during his interim spell in the dugout and it has been claimed he's hoping to bring someone in who knows the club. Former assistant manager Steve McClaren, who sat alongside Sir Alex Ferguson during the club's Treble winning season of 1998/99, has been linked with a role. Ten Hag, and whoever he does bring with him, certainly have a hell of a job on their hands, with the team in disarray in recent months. ",positive

Rangnick went on to point out the players who Klopp didn't even call on to be in the squad for the game, compared to his own side, revealing the issue with recruitment United have had in recent years. ""I am not blaming anyone, not my players nor anyone else, but we just have to realise what kind of squad they had available. ""Look at their bench, look at the four players who weren't even in the squad: Roberto Firmino was the only one who was injured. ""Oxlade-Chamberlain wasn't in the squad, Minamino was not in the squad, Harvey Elliott was not in the squad. This shows what kind of quality and team they have built together working with Jurgen and his team for the last six years."" Rangnick's successor is expected to be Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, with the Dutchman reportedly impressing the Premier League club with his own honest assessment of the club's recruitment and scouting. And it will certainly have to improve, with the interim manager adding that the club could sign as many as 10 players in the summer transfer window. ""Any owner, if you analyse, the team needs a rebuild - contracts are expiring. It's clear for me there will be six, eight, 10 new players,"" Rangnick added. ""And before you sign them you need to be aware what football does the new manager want and then fit into that profile."" Paul Pogba, who went off injured on Tuesday after just four minutes, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic are all expected to leave the club at very least. United were already in need of a central midfielder without needing to replace those leaving, whilst a striker, right back and centre back have also been rumoured to be on their shopping list.

Lingard, 29, has been a peripheral figure at United this season and is yet to start a Premier League match in the 2021-22 campaign. He was close to leaving Old Trafford in the January window but United were unable to agree terms with Newcastle over a potential loan deal for the England international, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Loadingâ¦ Lingardâs lack of first-team football has not stopped him working hard off the pitch. He took to Instagram on Friday to post a series of images of himself in the gym, alongside the caption: âFeel good Fridayâ. United fans were stunned by Lingardâs bulked up physique, with one user commenting: â99 Physicalityâ. Another added: âLingard should start the next game he looks sharp and focused.â A third user speculated that Lingardâs transformation could be down to the influence of fitness mad Cristiano Ronaldo, commenting: âCR7 effect?â A post shared by JLingz (@jesselingard) Earlier this season, Ronaldo launched a damning attack on his team-mates - urging them to show more commitment and pride in their performances. It came after reports Ronaldo had complained that he was one of the only United players to go to the gym to do extra work before and after training at Carrington. âI say we have a long way to improve because, for me, the most important thing is the mentality. To look at yourself and say, âI can do betterâ,â said Ronaldo. âFor you to be professional, help the team, the right mentality, self-taught and positive. All these details depend on you, not the coaches, the fans or the press. âIf you are proud of yourself and you have dignity, you have to do it much more.â Lingard will be hoping to work his way into interim head coach Ralf Rangnickâs plans before the end of the season.

That is according to former Liverpool director of football Damien Comolli, who brought Henderson to Anfield in 2011 in a reported Â£20m move from Sunderland.

The 31-year-old midfielder was linked with a move to Fulham in 2012 as part of a swap deal for Clint Dempsey, but Henderson rejected a move away from Anfield. Henderson, who has made 429 appearances for Liverpool, defied his critics and went on to eventually replace Reds icon Steven Gerrard as club captain in 2015. The England international has remained a crucial first-team player under Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, with Henderson lifting both the Champions League title and Premier League trophy as captain. Read More: Comolli, who was Liverpool director of football from 2010 to 2012, has now claimed that he was convinced Henderson would overcome his initial woes at Anfield. Speaking toSo Footmagazine, he said: âI was even told that it was a huge mistake, but when you recruit a young player, you have to wait. âJordan was going to break through, that was for sure. [...] I can assure you that without him they wonât win the Champions League or the Premier League. I am 100 [per cent] convinced of it.â Henderson, who is under contract with Liverpool until 2025, was hit with multiple injuries last season and played only 28 matches across all competitions. However, the England midfielder has played a more prominent role for Liverpool this season and has managed 37 appearances across all competitions. Read More: Klopp has insisted that he is ârelaxedâ over the situation surrounding Hendersonâs Liverpool future and has urged fans not to worry about a new contract. âI know whatâs going on behind the scenes and am relaxed,â the Liverpool manager toldSky Sportslast October. âWe donât talk about these kinds of things and we cannot make exemptions for one specific case. âThe one thing I can say is nobody has to worry.

The Uruguayan actually beat Ibrahimovic's goalscoring record in Paris, finishing with 200 goals in 301 games.

Loadingâ¦ Ronaldo's return has been much trumpeted by fans, and many pundits alike, but the person it's all affected most is fellow United forward Cavani. The Uruguayan agreed to stay on at United this season, after speculation he would head back to South America, and would have expected to be the main man upfront, before Ronaldo was signed late in the transfer window. Cavani then gave up the number seven shirt and took the number 21, that had been vacated by Daniel James, in order for United's new signing to take his famed number back. Now the former PSG man wants the fans to do him a favour in return, and has asked them to revert to his original song now he's not the number seven. ""The fans have now come up with a second song, which is a lot more difficult to sing than the previous one,"" the 34-year-old said of the chants made up by fans to MUTV.

""This second one, which is also really cool and really good too, and right here let me take a moment to thank all the United fans for their warmth and affection, this second song is much more difficult to sing!"" The 34-year-old hasn't played in front of fans at Old Trafford much at all, although he did score a cracker against Fulham at the end of last season. At first they sang ""Give it, give it, give it to Edi Cavani, pass him the ball and watch him score all the goals,"" to the tune of Abba's Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie.

""El Matador, who could that be? His first nameâs Edinson, his secondâs Cavaniâ¦"" As well as the player saying it's a more complicated song, it's no longer relevant with him not wearing number seven any more and 21 wouldn't fit into the song as well.

Jonathan Shrager has since revealed Cavani will be keeping the number seven shirt he made his own last season. The Uruguay international arrived as a free agent on deadline day and many were unsure if he'd be up to scratch. His final few months at Paris Saint-Germain were spent on the bench and he didn't play a competitive game for seven months. Cavani immediately connected with United fans however and he scored 17 goals in 35 appearances. It means Ronaldo could now take the number 28 shirt, what he requested when he first arrived at Old Trafford in 2003. He was denied that however and given the number seven after David Beckham's move to Real Madrid. Ronaldo has since worn the number seven every season bar one, when he wore the number nine at Real Madrid. He then took the seven following club legend Raul's departure. United have kept tight-lipped regarding the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's number and didn't hint at it in their official statement.

The home side were three goals to the good less than twenty minutes in, before Ronaldinho bagged a double. Loadingâ¦ John Terry scored a late header to give the Blues a 5-4 aggregate win and send them into the quarter finals of the Champions League. But the game belonged to Ronaldinho purely based off his utterly outrageous second goal. When the ball dropped to him at the edge of the box, he controlled it and with no options on, pulled off a filthy strike that left Petr Cech routed to the spot. It was a ridiculous piece of technique. With no pace on the ball whatsoever, after a couple of fakes, he manages to find the corner courtesy of a toe-poke shot that blew our minds. It's one of many genius goals 'R10' has served up over the years and purely for that strike alone, Ronaldinho didn't deserve to be on the losing side that game. â¨ *That* Ronaldinho goal...An iconic Champions League moment at Stamford Bridge, #OnThisDay in 2005.#UCLpic.twitter.com/5nnNQGAqjs ðµ A Stamford Bridge classic, #OTD in 2005!â°â½ï¸0â£8â£ Gudjohnsen â°â½ï¸1â£7â£ Lampard â°â½ï¸1â£9â£ Duff â°â½ï¸2â£7â£ Ronaldinhoâ°â½ï¸3â£8â£ Ronaldinhoâ°â½ï¸7â£6â£ Terry @ChelseaFC | #UCL pic.twitter.com/MhNGmjqzLq The only goal that ever had me standing in front of the TV, absolutely confused about how he just scored this type of goal.

The 2005 League Cup Final Had It All","The first major domestic trophy of the season will be handed out on Sunday when Liverpool take on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley. It will be 17 years to the day since the two sides clashed at Cardiffâs Millennium Stadium in the final of what was then known as the Carling Cup. Chelsea won 3-2 that day after extra-time in one of the great finals of the Premier League era. The result would signal the start of Chelseaâs golden period under Jose Mourinho and spark a fierce rivalry with Liverpool that would reignite later that season. Both sides went into the 2004-05 campaign under new leadership having replaced their managers during the summer break. Liverpool had swapped Gerard Houllier for the imperturbable Rafael Benitez, who had won the La Liga and UEFA Cup double with Valencia the previous season. At Chelsea, Claudio Ranieri had made way for the self-professed âSpecial Oneâ Mourinho, who had recently led Porto to Champions League glory and the Portuguese league title. While Liverpool initially struggled for consistency under Benitez, Chelsea had no such problems adapting to Mourinhoâs style of football. They raced to the top of the Premier League and were nine points clear of nearest rivals Manchester United at the time of the Carling Cup final. Liverpool, on the other hand, were struggling down in fifth and would start the match as clear underdogs. But they took a shock lead inside the opening minute. Fernando Morientes setting up John Arne Riise to fire the Reds in front with an unstoppable volley after only 45 seconds, which remains to this day the fastest ever League Cup final goal. It would take until the 79th minute for Chelsea to equalise in bizarre circumstances. Paulo Ferreira floated a hopeful free-kick into the Liverpool box which should have easily been cleared. However, three Liverpool players would compete for the same ball, with captain Steven Gerrard somehow managing to direct it past Jerzy Dudek and into his own net. Mourinho would celebrate the goal in typically brash fashion, putting a finger to his lips in the direction of the Liverpool supporters. The provocative act would see him sent to the stands by referee Steve Bennett. Neither side was able to find a late winner, with normal time ended 1-1. Two minutes after the restart, Chelseaâs record signing Didier Drogba came agonisingly close to putting his side ahead but his header rebounded back off the post to the relief of Dudek. Drogba would eventually get his goal in the second half of extra-time. The Ivory Coast international turning the ball home from close range after Liverpool failed to deal with a long throw from future Reds defender Glen Johnson. Chelsea appeared to make the game safe five minutes later when Mateja Kezman bundled in another scrappy goal after Dudek had saved well from Eidur Gudjohnsen. But the drama wasnât yet over. A minute after Kezmanâs goal, Antonio Nunez headed in a Gerrard free kick to drag Liverpool back into the match. He still remains the only player in Liverpoolâs long history to score his only goal for the team in a major cup final. Benitezâs side pushed hard for a late equaliser but were unable to find it, as Chelsea were crowned League Cup champions for the third time in their history, securing Mourinho his first piece of silverware at the club. Following the match, the Portuguese claimed that the gesture he made had been intended for the media and not the Liverpool supporters. ""The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea,â said Mourinho. Liverpool would get their revenge later that season, beating Chelsea 1-0 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Champions League thanks to Luis Garciaâs controversial winner at Anfield. Liverpool would go on to win the competition for the fifth time in their history, beating AC Milan in Istanbul in arguably football's greatest ever final. Chelsea, meanwhile, would be crowed Premier League champions at the end of the season after finishing with a record 95 points - 12 clear of defending champions Arsenal. In total, Liverpool would play Chelsea a remarkable seven times in 2005 - cementing a fierce rivalry which continues to this day. The two teams will go head-to-head again on Sunday in a mouth-watering clash at Wembley. Let's hope that it provides even half as much drama as Cardiff. Loadingâ¦ ",positive

Mourinho has already raided his former club for one of their star players, with Abraham moving to Roma in a transfer worth Â£34 million. And if the ex-Premier League gaffer has his way, he'll draft in a second talent from the Blues this summer. That's according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport who claim Mourinho is eyeing Ruben Loftus-Cheek ahead of transfer deadline day. It's reported that Thomas Tuchel's side are willing to let him leave Stamford Bridge on an initial loan deal, with the option to buy permanently for Â£16 million. Mourinho gave the 25-year-old his debut at Chelsea in 2014 and knows him well from his second managerial stint at the club. The midfielder spent last season on loan at Fulham, making 30 appearances and scoring one goal in the league. Tuchel said Loftus-Cheek can 'decide his own future' when discussing his situation earlier this month: ""It's too early to judge Ruben. ""He has everything in his hands. He can decide his own future."" Loftus-Cheek hopes to 'hit the ground running' this campaign. He said: ""I had last season as a season where I can find my feet, and it definitely felt like that at the start. ""I was struggling mentally and needed to focus on just taking risks in training and get that feel back. ""But it eventually came and I was doing really well in games, so I've had my injury and I've had a season now to get fit and feel confident in my body and this season is where I hit the ground running. ""I feel really fit now and strong, and hopefully the injuries stay away. ""Last season was my first full injury-free season which is a massive positive for me, because I always used to get niggles. ""Even though I was fit I'd be out for a week or a couple of days, miss a couple of matches, but last season was good for my body to be fit every training session and available for every game.""

Liverpool whipped in a late freekick, searching for a winner against their perceived biggest Premier League title rivals. The ball ended up at the far post, and with City stopper Ederson stranded, Fabinho seemingly had an open goal in which to score in - and thus, win the game for Liverpool. However, the Brazilian took a touch which just allowed Rodri to sneak in and deny his opposite number. As you can see by the reactions below, the block had plenty of people talking on social media. Speaking on Sky Sports commentary right after the block, Gary Neville said: ""What a block that is. I think Fabinho takes a bit of time and thinks it's in."" ""it's an open goal but gives Rodri time to slide, fists clenched celebrating, he makes a right mess of it Ederson, he controls it, it's just a brilliant, brilliant recovery tackle,"" Neville added. Hundreds of City fans have also reacted to the block across social media. One said: ""How on earth did Rodri block that?"" Another suggested, ""Rodri just saved certain goal today against Liverpool."" ""Rodri deserves man of the match for that block alone,"" a different user added. City were in control for large parts of the game at Anfield, but fell behind twice courtesy of Sadio Mane and a wondergoal from Mohamed Salah. Phil Foden and Kevin de Buryne responded for City, as they continued to pile pressure on looking for a winner. But the best chance would fall to Fabinho, with Rodri saving the points for City. The point for Liverpool and City leaves the teams in second and third respectively in the Premier League table, with Chelsea staying top by a point.

Ronaldo missed Tuesday's defeat to Liverpool after the tragic death of his newborn son. The 37-year-old and partner Georgina Rodriguez confirmed the news on Monday while also confirming the birth of their daughter. When asked if Ronaldo's decision was impacted by that, Rangnick replied: ""I donât know. Youâll have to ask him. Theyâve both taken penalties and converted penalties, so itâs up to the two of them to decide."" Arsenal took the lead inside three minutes through Tavares, after David de Gea had tipped away a Bukayo Saka effort. Saka would get on the scoresheet from the penalty spot after being fouled by Alex Telles just after the half hour mark. Ronaldo got United back in it two minutes later and the away side did have their chances, but failed to convert. Fernandes' miss in the second half swung the game in Mikel Arteta's side favour and Granit Xhaka's long-range effort wrapped up all three points for Arsenal. United are now six points off fourth place with four games to go and Rangnick thinks their chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League are slim. The German admitted: ""Itâs mathematically not impossible, but itâs not very realistic. ""A win today, or at least a draw after being 2-0 down, wouldâve helped us."" Arsenal, meanwhile, are back up to fourth and have Champions League qualification in their own hands.

Parma were already 1-0 down after Salvatore Burrai converted a fifth minute penalty past Serie A's record appearance holder.

In that second campaign, he scored 19 goals and provided an astonishing 35 assists in all competitions. Came to Man Utd at 25 and still i canât explain what we did to him. Where did his career just go, he was meant to be a PL all timer. pic.twitter.com/GObIYkMjd0 Mata was their most valuable player ahead of Frank Lampard as well as that season's new recruits, Oscar and Eden Hazard. Roberto Di Matteo was sacked and replaced with Rafa Benitez on an interim basis but it didn't slow Mata down. What did, was the appointment of Jose Mourinho in the summer of 2013. Mourinho didn't fancy Mata and let him join Manchester United for a then club-record Â£37 million in January 2014. He's been at United ever since and despite being an experienced character in the dressing room, he's been on the fringes for a number of years. Mata's regularly been played on the right wing rather than an attacking midfielder at Old Trafford, which isn't the best use of his skillset. The 33-year-old will go down as a great player, but supporters believe he was destined for something legendary. One commented: ""Juan Mata is the only player post Fergie Iâll agree United truly wasted."" Another said: ""No way was he 25, are you being serious..."" A third put: ""United bought him as the best 10 in the league, played him nothing but RW and ruined his career. Low-key biggest football tragedy in years."" While someone tweeted: ""We failed the nicest guy in football."" It's expected Mata will leave United in the summer when his contract expires. He's made eight appearances in a bitterly disappointing year for the Red Devils and they'll likely finish outside the top four. Incredibly, Mata has only played for United 21 times in the Champions League after winning the competition with Chelsea.

Knowing how bad his strike was, he took to Instagram to say sorry to Mata, writing: ""The next one is yours. Your face says it all."" But Pereira undoubtedly made amends as in the second half he did his best Paul Scholes impression when he scored the most incredible 25 yard volley in front of the Stretford End The technique was quite sublime, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitting the club's Goal of the Season award might be done already. ""We might just hand it out, that hit from Andreas was out of this world,"" the Manchester United boss told MUTV. Pereira, despite never really been a regular in the United first-team, has scored a number of long-range stunners. But for him, this one is right up there as the best of his career. ""I think that's my best goal, yeah,"" Pereira stated in an interview with MUTV after the draw.

Loadingâ¦ The 52-year-old has won the league title twice in Netherlands and is currently attempting to win Eredivisie for the third time, with his team four points clear of rivals PSV with only five games of the season to go. Ajax did lose to PSV in the KNVB Cup final on the weekend, ending their chances of winning the double, but his time in Amsterdam has certainly been a success. On his new job, Ten Hag said, ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" United have not won a trophy since the Europa League in 2017, when Jose Mourinho's side beat Ajax in the final, and they won't be winning one this season. The 13 times Premier League winners have also not won the league since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and they have been a shambles since. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Mourinho and Solskjaer have all tried and failed to turn things around as permanent managers, whilst Rangnick hasn't been able to change much in his few months as interim. One player in particular who should be happy with the appointment of Ten Hag is Donny van de Beek, who joined the club in August 2020. The Dutch midfielder hasn't been given much chance at Old Trafford, and is currently on loan at Everton, but he was part of the new manager's team when Ajax reached the Champions League semi-final in 2019.

Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag was announced as new permanent manager at Old Trafford on Thursday, and will take over from Ralf Rangnick in the summer after the season is over. The Dutchman has a hell of a job on his hands to turn fortunes around for the 13 times Premier League champions, with Rangnick claiming they're six years behind Liverpool. Fans will be hoping that Ten Hag is allowed to make the changes he wants in order to get the best out of his players, and he was nearly dealt an early blow. According to the Telegraph, the 52-year-old wanted Ajax assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and former United number two Steve McClaren to join him at the club. Whilst United had no issue with Van der Gaag they reportedly wanted to push back on McClaren, whose last job was as technical director at Derby County. However, the report claims that the new manager has now won the 'battle' and the club will green light the move for the man who sat on the bench alongside Sir Alex Ferguson. McClaren originally joined the club part way through the 1998/99 season, in which the Red Devils won the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. He left in 2001, to become manager of Middlesbrough, and had built a reputation as an excellent coach during his time as Fergie's number two. Ten Hag has worked with the 60-year-old in the past and was actually his assistant at FC Twente, where the Englishman actually won the Eredivisie. It's no surprise that the new manager wants to make changes to the coaching team at United, especially considering how the results have been. Darren Fletcher has reportedly annoyed Rangnick by giving instructions to the players during matches, despite his role as technical director. Mike Phelan, who was also assistant to Fergie in the past, is another who continued in the wake of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking, whilst Rangnick brought in Chris Armas and the American is set to leave when the German does.

Ten Hag was confirmed as United's next permanent manager on Thursday morning after agreeing a three-year deal with an option of a further year. Willem Janssen, 35, played under Ten Hag during his time in charge of Dutch club Utrecht between 2015 and 2017. And the centre-back, who has since gone on to make 251 appearances for Utrecht, has warned United's players to expect a tough start when Ten Hag takes charge at Old Trafford at the end of the season. ""His first sessions at Utrecht took some getting used to,"" Janssen wrote in The Guardian. ""He immediately demanded an extra training pitch, which the youth department was not thrilled with... he constantly stopped the game, which was annoying at the beginning. ""You were enjoying the game and then the whistle was blown again and Erik would say you were positioned wrong. ""But he also explained why you had to stand elsewhere. And then you thought: 'Damn, heâs right'... Ten Hag's simply the best."" Ten Hag impressed throughout his time at Utrecht, guiding the club to fifth and fourth in the Dutch Eredivisie during his two full seasons in charge. Another of his former players, Sjoerd Overgoor - who played under Ten Hag at Go Ahead Eagles prior to his time at Utrecht, has also spoken about the Dutch coach's exceptionally high standards and meticulous approach to training. ""He wanted the drinks put out in straight lines,"" Overgoor told Sky Sports. ""Everything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that."" Overgoor added: ""We had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch. ""Every day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. ""That was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. ""Remember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. ""A lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better."" Loadingâ¦ ",positive

The 26-year-old midfielder, who has enjoyed a season-loan loan spell at Flamengo, was given the option to sign for the Brazilian side at the end of the 2021/22 campaign for a fee rising to Â£12 million based on appearances, according to ESPN. But the report from earlier this month claims Flamengo will 'abandon a deal' to sign Pereira, with the belief that he hasn't done enough to convince the club to make a deal permanent, despite making 37 appearances in competitions. Pereira, who was convinced by Sir Alex Ferguson to join the ranks at Old Trafford in 2011 after impressing at theManchester United Premier Cup, has failed to really make his mark at the Premier League club. That, however, could change in the coming months. According to ESPN, the midfielder has been told by United's football director John Murtough that new manager Erik ten Hag is 'keen' to have the midfielder back when he officially arrives in the summer. If his permanent move to Flamengo does indeed break down like reports suggest, Pereira's career with the Reds could be reignited by Ten Hag, who spent time with the Brazilian during his spell at Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. The 26-year-old, who has also spent time on loan at Granada, Valencia and Lazio while at United, currently has one year left on his deal at Old Trafford. Earlier this month, Pereira hinted in an interview with Globo Esporte that he is hopeful of securing a permanent move to Flamengo. âI have a contract until June and I will always do my best for Flamengo. Iâm focused and positive for whatever comes,â he said. âI just want to thank the fans, the teammates, and everything they are doing for me and have done. It was really difficult, very difficult after the final, but itâs something that inside me Iâve already overcome. ""Iâve already put it back and Iâm looking forward more calmly. Iâm sure I have enough quality to reverse this situation.â Pereira added: âI donât pay much attention to these things, but everyone knows that I prioritised Flamengo. Everyone in the club knows this. Itâs hard for me to talk about my own value, but a Manchester United player for 10 million eurosâ¦ Should I be cheaper? Iâm doing my best, but I canât say if itâs too expensive or cheap. âIâm calm and focused. I know thereâs this indecision. I also have to talk about it with the people close to me, and on the pitch Iâm calm. I know it can be resolved in a month, at the end before I leave, but Iâm calm and always thinking about the next game. âI came to Flamengo to show my football and I will show a lot more. Of course, the disappointment of not having won the titles remains, for sure, but I always tried to show my value on the pitch and the fans recognised it. ""I always told my friends and Flamengo that I always prioritised them, and that Flamengo is very important to me.â It was clear that former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also a big fan of Pereira. Back in October, the Norwegian hinted at a potential return for the player. He told TNT Sports: ""Yes, we follow. Of course. [Pereira] is a great player and a fantastic person. I'm so happy for him and knowing he's enjoying this moment. ""For us, the logic was: Andreas, go and show how good you are. I couldn't give him enough playing time, and we know the quality he has. When they believe in him, he's a top-quality player, so I'm happy for him."" Solskjaer added: ""At a certain point in a player's career, it's important to have enough playing time at the highest level. ""Last year Andreas was on loan and didn't play as much. Last season he played a lot of games with us, soon after we brought Bruno [Fernandes]. ""I'm happy for Andreas now, and we'll see him again soon.""

Brazilian magician Ronaldinho's Nike Tiempo ad back in 2005 became the first YouTube video ever to amass over one million views. Although the video - which featured Ronnie bouncing the ball off a crossbar and back to himself again - was widely believed to have been assisted by a bit of a camera trickery. But Algerian ace Mahrez needed no such help during Man City's 5-0 win over Everton as he recreated the effort (or at least part of it). With City already 2-0 to the good inside the first 15 minutes, Mahrez picked up the ball outside the Everton box and pinged a wonderful shot towards goal. It bounced off the crossbar rather than going in, but the ball arrived back at Mahrez's feet in a perfect arc - and he instantly controlled it in exactly the same spot he took his original shot (1:38 below). Remarkable stuff. Of course, he'd have to have bounced it off the crossbar and back to himself a few more times to really match Ronaldinho's effort. But - and we can't emphasise this enough - this was in an actual football match and without the aid of any retakes or special effects. So we still think it's pretty amazing.  Mahrez has been in sensational form during the late part of City's season, scoring three goals across the two legs of his side's Champions League semi-final victory over Paris Saint-Germain. I waited years for this moment... https://t.co/HwKYIKWksj ball don't lie, he's chosen https://t.co/rT3tUJ8z7L Yoooooo what a throwback The winger's main contribution after Sunday's crossbar theatrics was another crowd-pleaser: with Sergio Aguero waiting to come off the bench, Mahrez deliberately put the ball out of play as soon as he got it so the Argentine could get on the pitch ASAP. Aguero then arrived, a swap for Mahrez no less, and the Algerian got to watch Man City's record goalscorer add two more to his tally during his final home game at the club. All this while knowing he has a Champions League final to come on Saturday and also he's now basically the Algerian Ronaldinho. Not a bad afternoon's work, Riyad. ",positive

120,https://www.sportbible.com/football/premier-league-could-have-nine-clubs-in-europe-next-season-20220415,The Premier League Could Have NINE Clubs In European Competition Next Season,"England could have nine clubs competing in European football next season if a remarkable set of results occur at the end of the current campaign. All three European club competitions could still be won by English sides this season. Liverpool and Manchester City are safely through to the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they will come up against Villarreal and Real Madrid respectively. West Ham have reached the last four of the Europa League, where they will face Eintracht Frankfurt, while Leicester will take on Roma in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. If English clubs win all three competitions, there could be as many as nine Premier League clubs in Europe next season. ESPN editor Dale Johnson took to Twitter on Friday to explain how the unlikely scenario could come about. Common misconception is that the maximum is 7, but that's not the case. Places for European titleholders are standalone if said titleholders don't qualify domestically. However, it's very, very rare for a European titleholder to finish outside the domestic places that season. For example, last season Sevilla won the UEL, thus qualifying for the UCL as titleholders. Sevilla also finished in the UECL place in LaLiga. Therefore, that place was left vacant, meaning LaLiga had no representative in the inaugural UECL. He began: âWith Leicester and West Ham in the semifinals of the UEL and UECL, and on the back of questions last night, a thread to explain how their performance affects the number of Premier League teams in Europe. The maximum number of Premier League teams in Europe next season is 9. âCommon misconception is that the maximum is 7, but thatâs not the case. Places for European titleholders are standalone if said titleholders donât qualify domestically. However, itâs very, very rare for a European titleholder to finish outside the domestic places that season. âIf a European titleholder DOES qualify domestically, they play in the highest-ranked competition. So, if West Ham win UEL and finish in a UEL or UECL spot in the Premier League, they play in the UCL as the UEL titleholder. That PL place in the UEL or UECL is then vacant. âFor example, last season Sevilla [here Johnson means Villarreal] won the UEL, thus qualifying for the UCL as titleholders. Sevilla [Villarreal] also finished in the UECL place in LaLiga. Therefore, that place was left vacant, meaning LaLiga had no representative in the inaugural UECL. If Crystal Palace win the FA Cup, they will be in the UEL and 6th in the Premier League will be in the UECL.If Crystal Palace don't win the FA Cup, 6th in the Premier League will be in the UEL and 7th will be in the UECL. As Leicester are almost certain to finish outside the top 7 in the Premier League, if they win the UECL then England will have 8 teams in Europe next season. 4 in the UCL3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup)1 in UECL (6th or 7th) âSo, how will European qualification work in the Premier League this season? What we know with absolute certainty is the top 4 will play in the Champions League and 5th with be in the Europa League. What will happen to 6th and 7th depends on Crystal Palace. âIf Crystal Palace win the FA Cup, they will be in the UEL and 6th in the Premier League will be in the UECL. If Crystal Palace donât win the FA Cup, 6th in the Premier League will be in the UEL and 7th will be in the UECL. âNothing else can alter domestic qualifying positions. The performance of Leicester and West Ham cannot affect which competition another Premier League team has earned, either positively or negatively. It cannot create extra places, other than for themselves as titleholders. England will only have 9 teams in Europe if West Ham also win the UEL and finish 8th (or 7th/8th with Palace winning the FA Cup).So it could be: 5 in the UCL (West Ham, top 4)3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup)1 in UECL (6th or 7th) And to be clear, it is impossible for 8th to qualify for Europe by league position - in any season. That team must win a cup or a European competition to qualify. There is no ""drop-down effect"" from other teams' performances. âAs Leicester are almost certain to finish outside the top 7 in the Premier League, if they win the UECL then England will have 8 teams in Europe next season. 4 in the UCL 3 in the UEL (Leicester, 5th, FA Cup) 1 in UECL (6th or 7th). âEngland will only have 9 teams in Europe if West Ham also win the UEL and finish 8th (or 7th/8th with Palace winning the FA Cup).

Dyche was one of the longest-serving managers in English football, having taken charge of Burnley in 2012. He led the club to two promotions to the Premier League during his time at Turf Moor and was the longest-reigning manager in the top flight. But he has now been sacked in the wake of Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Norwich, which left Burnley 18th in the league - four points behind 17th-place Everton with eight games remaining in the season. Burnley confirmed Dycheâs departure with a statement on Friday, which read: âBurnley Football Club can confirm the Club has parted company with manager Sean Dyche, assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer.â Burnley chairman Alan Pace added: âFirstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the Club over the last decade. âDuring his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. âHowever, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. âThe process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.â Some fans have questioned the decision to sack Dyche, who achieved two top-half Premier League finishes with Burnley and also qualified the team for Europe for the first time in 51 years.

The Whites will be looking to put their 5-1 thrashing by the hands of Manchester United behind them, with Marcelo Bielsa visibly furious with his players after the game. The Toffees, meanwhile, started life under Rafael Benitez with an impressive 3-1 victory over Southampton at Goodison Park. It will be the first time that Bielsa and Benitez - two of the finest coaches of their generation - cross swords in English football for the first time, but who will come out on top? ð¬ ""#LUFC fans are not the same as the majority of fans in the Premier League"" pic.twitter.com/LAYiD1l5li Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Leeds United vs Everton to get your teeth stuck into. Leeds United are 6/5 to win, with Everton priced at 2/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 13/5. Prediction: 1-2 (9/1) Match result: Everton (2/1) Following their abysmal display away at Old Trafford, Leeds will hope that they can convert their home advantage into a vital three points. Everton played some exciting football in the second half of their season opener against Southampton and, although this may be a cagey affair, we're backing the Toffees to come out on top like they did last season. Under/Over Goals: Under 2.5 (6/5) Fixtures between these two sides in the Premier League are often low-scoring games, with five of the last seven matches between them seeing under 2.5 goals scored. Despite Leeds looking vulnerable defensively against the Red Devils, Bielsa's men are a different breed at home and should have a much tighter back line going into this afternoon's game. First Goalscorer: Patrick Bamford (4/1) Patrick Bamford had a rough time in terms of chances last weekend, however, after signing a new five-year contract on Friday, it may just give him a new lease of life in front of goal. The 27-year-old was the Premier League's fourth highest goalscorer last term - 17 goals in total - and we're backing him to get off the mark here at attractive odds of 4/1.

Prediction: 2-1 (7/1) First Goalscorer: Demarai Gray (6/1) Having scored in just two of his previous 32 appearances, Demarai Gray has founded the back of the net twice in his three appearances for Everton. His creativity and flair could offer one or two issues for Sean Dyche's Burnley and we're backing the 25-year-old to draw first blood tonight. To Score 2+ Goals: Everton (10/11) Everton have scored at least twice in each league match so far this campaign and there are signs that Benitez is instilling the consistency that the Merseyside outfit need. As a result of their recent form, we're backing the Toffees to score at least twice again here tonight, especially with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison both in hot form. Headed Shot On Target: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (5/6) Calvert-Lewin has been in excellent form for Everton over the past year and has proven himself to be almost unstoppable in the air.

It looks increasingly likely that Ten Hag will be named as Manchester United's permanent manager in the coming days. The 52-year-old, who has been in charge of Eredivisie side Ajax since 2017, will sign a three or four year deal at the Premier League strugglers, say The Guardian. Loadingâ¦ That report also suggests Ten Hag has been granted the final say on any transfer business and with the team underperforming, rumours are already swirling around potential additions to the squad. Now, a list of arrivals and departures has emerged. The Mirror report that six players â Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Nemanja Matic, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Lee Grant â are all out of contract this summer and will therefore depart. In addition to the above, Ten Hag could also allow the likes of Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Phil Jones, Alex Telles, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Eric Bailly to leave in an overhaul that we haven't seen at Old Trafford for years, if ever. So who will Ten Hag look to bring in to strengthen his United squad? According to the same report, United are said to be interested in England internationals Harry Kane and Declan Rice, although those transfers could wipe out the Â£200 million transfer budget with ease. More realistic, and cheaper, options include Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, who has been in fine form for the Portuguese side this season, scoring 31 goals in 37 games in all competitions. Wolvesmidfielder Ruben Neves, another name that has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in the past, is also mentioned in the report as Ten Hag looks to strengthen key areas of the squad.

On Tuesday night, following the club's embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Liverpool in the league, interim boss Ralf Rangnick admitted United were six years behind Jurgen Klopp's men. ""Jurgen came six years ago and if you compare the squad he inherited, he came after eight or nine games and finished eighth, this is roundabout where we are currently,"" the former RB Leipzig boss said after full time.

Lingard has made just one start in all competitions so far this season, which came in a 1-0 Carabao Cup defeat at home to West Ham United. He has made an impact off the bench though, after coming on as a substitute and scoring in the 4-1 and 2-1 wins over Newcastle United and West Ham. But the 28-year-old has fuelled speculation of an imminent departure from Old Trafford after rejecting a new contract offer from the Red Devils last month. He is now able to leave the club as a free agent next summer, with The Daily Mail reporting that both Milan and BarÃ§a are keen on a deal. Lingard enjoyed a renaissance in his career during a loan spell with West Ham last season, scoring 9 goals in 16 appearances. Former Hammers midfielder Trevor Sinclair questioned why he did not join the east London club on a permanent basis in an interview with talkSPORT. ""If he doesn't get given them assurances and sign a new deal, then that says he's not ambitious as a player, he said. ""I'm slightly confused that he didn't want to sign for West Ham permanently. ""He was loved there and was the main man. He played one time for Manchester United in 2021, but played 16 times for West Ham and got into double figures for goals and back in the England squad. ""Why would you not want to be in that environment?"" That form with West Ham propelled Lingard back towards the fringes of the England squad, but he ultimately missed out on a place in the final 26. If Lingard does leave Old Trafford, it would end a 20-year spell with his boyhood club that includes four major trophies: the FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League and Community Shield. Among his highlights at United include a memorable extra-time winner to beat Crystal Palace in the 2016 FA Cup Final, and another strike in 3-2 victory over Southampton in the League Cup Final a year later.

Carvalho, 19, was born in Portugal but has represented England at U16, U17 and U18 level after his family moved from Lisbon to London. The teenager, who has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Fulham this season, is not able to make his debut for Englandâs U21 side as he has not yet passed a British citizenship test and does not have a British passport, according to Sky Sports via The Star. Loadingâ¦ The country of his birth have now made a move for the midfielder, naming him in their latest U21 squad for their upcoming Euro 2023 qualifiers against Iceland and Greece. Wolves striker Fabio Silva and Arsenal left-back Nuno Tavares have also been called up by Portugal, who finished as runners-up in the 2021 European U21 Championships. Carvalho burst onto the scene last season and has continued to impress in the current campaign, attracting the interest of Liverpool. The Premier League club attempted to sign him in the January transfer window with the intention of loaning him back to Fulham for the remainder of the season. Liverpool were unable to get the deal over the line but may now look to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with Carvalho, whose current deal with Fulham expires at the end of the season. In terms of international football, Carvalho could still play for Englandâs senior team even if he makes his debut for Portugalâs U21 side this month.

Hannibal was brought on as a second-half substitute in United's 4-0 defeat at Anfield on Tuesday, with the 19-year-old replacing Anthony Elanga in the 84th minute of the match. After seeing his side concede a fourth goal, Hannibal took out Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson with a late challenge a minute later â earning himself a yellow card in the process. Loadingâ¦ He then risked a second booking just moments later with another full-blooded tackle, this time on Naby Keita. While commentating on the match for Sky Sports, Neville said he was ""proud"" of Hannibal. ""To be fair, at least the kid's showing a bit of something,"" said Neville. ""Honestly, it takes a young kid to come on and show the rest of them how to sprint to the ball and put a challenge in.â ""Iâm actually proud of him. Maybe he doesnât like the idea of Liverpool players passing round him. I wish the rest of them were the same."" Neville admitted after the match that his commentary had slightly overstepped the mark. Hannibal Mejbri, What a cameo. pic.twitter.com/Tjp2KzKiHN ""That is why I aired on to the slightly unprofessional side of commentary tonight,â Neville said. ""When I said that the kid [Mejbri] to be fair I was proud of him because he was going round trying to top people and trying to kick people. ""But he demonstrated something, he showed something. He didnât like the idea of Liverpool, at Anfield, passing it around him and the idea of Liverpool taking the mick out of him and his teammates."" United fans have also praised Hannibal for at least showing some energy and passion in the defeat at Anfield. ""Hannibal Mejbri a 19 year old kid came on and showed more passion and desire in 5 minutes than the rest of the team combined for the full 90,"" wrote one supporter on Twitter.

Loadingâ¦ Another weekend and another round of dismay and turmoil at Old Trafford, as the team were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal to put a major dent in their remaining hopes of finishing in the top four. It came just days after getting hammered by rivals Liverpool, with the announcement of Erik ten Hag taking over as manager in the summer the only slight bit of light in a bleak week for the team's fans. The loss to Arsenal came with Paul Scholes claiming that he'd heard from Jesse Lingard that things inside the team weren't very good. And McTominay was even more open with his criticism, saying, ""There are a whole lot of problems in terms of players, staff, everything higher up."" The midfielder's honestly interested club legend Neville, who said the fact McTominay was willing to give his admission live on air was further proof at how bad things are. The McTominay comments yesterday â problems with players , staff , higher up and everything â whilst not something we didnât know tells you how bad it must be for a player to say it on air. Honesty has certainly been a big topic for United recently, seeing as it's now basically impossible to ignore how bad things are right now. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick is in the best position to talk about all the problems, especially as he won't be in charge next season. The German was very open earlier this week on his assessment of the team, saying, ""You donât even need glasses to see and analyse where the problems are. ""Now itâs about how do we solve them? Itâs not enough to do some minor amendments. In medicine you would say that this is an operation of the open heart."" Following the loss to Liverpool in midweek, the former RB Leipzig director of football also said that his side were six years behind Jurgen Klopp's team. It's not just the current manager who has been honest about what is wrong at United, with Ten Hag reportedly impressing the 13 times Premier League champions due to his assessment of the club's scouting and recruitment in recent years. The 52-year-old has a long to do list when he arrives at the Carrington training ground in the summer, especially with several players set to leave before the next campaign. He has already decided which current players he's ready to rely on for his team, including three young players who are ready to break into the first team. ",positive

Loadingâ¦ Two goals from Diogo Jota earned Liverpool a 2-0 win at Anfield, but it was January signing Diaz who arguably impressed most. The 25-year-old was given his start after coming off the bench last weekend against Cardiff and caused all sorts of trouble for full-back James Justin. Klopp was delighted with Diaz's efforts and was asked about 'looking like a Liverpool player' by reporters. ""Thatâs a surprise for me as well,"" the German coach admitted. ""Thatâs exactly how he looked in the training session so we thought okay why shouldnât we try it then? ""We just let him play and he watched us obviously and we showed him a lot of situations but it looks natural in a lot of moments I have to say. ""Thatâs really quick, it was an outstanding first half, really impressive and he was involved in so many good football moments, a really, really good performance."" Diaz looked to be joining Tottenham Hotspur in the transfer window before the Reds snuck in at the last minute. It's believed Diaz will offer competition to Sadio Mane on the left wing. Liverpool are now nine points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City and have a game in hand on their rivals. Jota has carried the load while Mohamed Salah and Mane have been away for the Africa Cup of Nations. The Portugal international has scored 12 goals in the league and he finished convincingly on Thursday evening. Klopp made special mention of Jota's efforts for both goals and his sensational form this season. ""The second goal is a brilliant goal. A counter-press. I love it. Jota with a little genius moment to put it into the right spot,"" Klopp continued. ""The first goal is really when you are in a goal-scoring moment then you are there. He is in that. Really happy for him and for us. ""We had a sense it could happen. He is not a bargain or whatever and we did not get him for free! But we hoped. He is still a young lad. ""We create more chances than Wolves did in all respect. We really thought he would be an outstanding player. He was already but he has improved for sure."" Klopp also insisted that Liverpool will continue to fight for the title despite City's sensational form. Pep Guardiola's men haven't lost a game since October and defeated Brentford 2-0 on Wednesday.

Since the European Cup was introduced way back in the 1955/56 season, when Real Madrid won the first of 13 titles, its format has included semi-finals played over two legs. Loadingâ¦ Ten years later and UEFA brought in the away goals ruling, which has since been abolished this term. But going forward, according to Martin Ziegler from The Times, Champions League semi-finals will be a one-off fixture. No official stance from UEFA has been made as of yet but president Aleksander Ceferin has endorsed the idea in the past and the European Club Association (ECA) are said to be leaning towards giving their seal of approval. The European Leagues organisation would need to give the green light to the change, which would include a âweek of footballâ whereby semi-finals and the final are played in one city in the same week. The feeling is that extra excitement and drama would be added with the one-legged affairs, before the final takes place shortly after. The Nations League international tournament has seen semi-finals and finals played in the same country over a five-day period. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quarter finals onwards were played in Lisbon in August and Nasser Al-Khelaifi, PSG's president and the chairman of the ECA, went on record to say players from his club enjoyed the set-up. The proposal for a single city to host the three fixtures would be challenging because of the amount of fans descending and is likely only be achievable with leading locations like London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Istanbul and Rome to name a few. The axing of two-legged semis would come into play for the 2024/25 season, by which point there will be an all-new format. Instead of the traditional eight groups, there will be one 36-team league - with the top eight teams reaching the next round. A new round of play-offs will decide the other teams, with clubs placed from ninth to 16th facing a side placed from 17th to 24th in a two-legged tie. Every team will play a minimum of 10 games, half home and half away in the league format. ",negative

Loadingâ¦ The two sides played out one of the best games in recent history in a back and forth thriller, in which momentum swung between both teams on multiple occasions. City would have gone away from the 4-3 win disappointed with themselves, having led by two goals on three occasions, only to head into the second leg with only a one goal lead. There was plenty for the crowd to be excited by during the game, with a match of ridiculous quality, however the fans have actually been criticised by rival fans. Footage of City supporters celebrating Kevin de Bruyne's opening goal, the fastest ever in a Champions League semi final, didn't go down well due to the lack of 'limbs,' and the fans recording instead of celebrating.

Genuine hardcore fans are priced out, and they are usually the most passionate. In 20 years time, going to the football will be like going to the opera. Pep Guardiola certainly gave an entertaining reaction to one of Real's goal, as he fell to his knees once Vinicius Junior had skinned Fernandinho. The City boss clearly knew what was coming as the forward left his fellow countryman in the dust before slotting home to make it 3-2. However the reactions of the City fans to another Real goal didn't go down well at all with criticism this time being that they were taking pictures of Karim Benzema celebrating.

Interim manager Ralf Rangnick recently said as many as 10 new players could be needed in the next transfer window, with United now going five years without a trophy and increasingly unlikely to play in the Champions League next season after back-to-back defeats against Liverpool and Arsenal on the road. Loadingâ¦ Erik Ten Hag has been appointed as the club's new manager on a deal until 2025 and the Ajax boss will look to immediately put his imprint on the team. His arrival could spark the end for many at Old Trafford and United fans have been voting on who should get the chop in a new Sky Sports poll that garnered 1.7 million votes. Of the 30 first-teamers included, Paul Pogba was the most high-profile player who fans want out. The World Cup winner looks to have played his final game, after limping off 10 minutes into the 4-0 hammering at the hands of Liverpool. Rangnick admitted, ""I don't think it is very likely he will play again"" and although he meant in the current campaign, Pogba's contract is up in the summer. Recently jeered by fans in the 3-2 win over Norwich, Â£89 million man Pogba is wanted out by 91 per cent of supporters. 75 per cent want club captain Harry Maguire to leave after a string of poor defensive displays, while fellow defenders Eric Bailly (72.7 per cent) Aaron Wan-Bissaka(65 per cent), Phil Jones (90 per cent)Victor Lindelof(52 per cent) are also not wanted. Nemanja Matic has already announced his exit - which will please 94 per cent of supporters. Juan Mata (89.3 per cent), Edinson Cavani (86 per cent) and Jesse Lingard (82.4 per cent) are both out of contract and the consensus is that it's time for the trio to move on. In terms of loanees, both Andreas Pereira(87 per cent) and Anthony Martial(86 per cent) are not wanted anymore - while there's a bit less demand for academy product Brandon Williams (47.6 per cent) to leave. Another striking but not exactly surprising outcome of the poll is that 85 per cent want the much-maligned Glazer family to walk away from the club after 17 years as owners. On the opposite side of things in terms of fan support, Jadon Sancho (93.6 per cent), Bruno Fernandes (90.9 per cent), Anthony Elanga (89.9 per cent), David De Gea (88.3 per cent), Raphael Varane (85.3 per cent), Hannibal Mejbri (79.5 per cent) and Scott McTominay (75 per cent) are the main players supporters hope stay put under Ten Hag's tutelage.

Loadingâ¦ The Catalan giants are eager to reduce their huge wage bill and see offloading Griezmann as an easy way to do that. He had been linked with a return to Atletico Madrid, who he left in 2019, in a swap deal involving Saul Niguez. But Gol Digitol have reported that doesn't look likely and Barcelona have turned their attentions to United and Lindelof. United have tied down Edinson Cavani for another year, but it is believed they'd like another forward. Lindelof regularly started at the back with captain Harry Maguire last season as United finished second in the Premier League. The Sweden international has been a regular since arriving at Old Trafford from Benfica in 2017. But Tuesday saw the club announce a deal in principle for Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane, likely meaning Lindelof will fall down the pecking order. Griezmann's departure would allow Barcelona to register club legend Lionel Messi, who is technically a free agent right now. The World Cup winner scored 20 goals in all competitions so far but hasn't fully settled since his Â£100 million move. He isn't the only one Ronald Koeman is willing to part ways with however. Marca say Samuel Umtiti, Miralem Pjanic, Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele are also being shown off to European clubs. Club president Joan Laporta hasn't been shy in admitting there is interest in Griezmann. He said earlier this week: ""[Griezmann] is a Barcelona player, he has a contract in force, and unless there are different circumstances then we have him [here]. ""There have been movements in the market, but it is normal in the transfer market. ""We can't deny that there has been interest in the player and that shows his quality.""

Loadingâ¦ The Premier League was shaken by the news that Abramovich's assets, including Chelsea FC, were being frozen, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's something that MP Chris Bryant had been calling on the government to do for weeks and it came after the Blues' billionaire owner had decided to sell. The sanctions, as well as meaning no transfers in or out of Stamford Bridge, will put a temporary halt on the Russian's plans to sell the club. He had hoped to sell for around Â£4 billion, which included the Â£1.5 billion in debt the club owed him and, according to one expert, that owed amount could end in administration. ""The Chelsea FC Holding Co owes Abramovich cÂ£1.5bn. That's now frozen and I don't believe he can't write it off at this time even if he wants to,"" Financial Fair Play and football finance expert Ed Thompson wrote on Twitter. ""So no-one will buy the club with that hanging over it. Club loss-mqking, so for what it's worth I expect club to go into Administration."" The #ChelseaFC Holding Co owes RA cÂ£1.5bn. That's now frozen and I don't believe he can't write it off at this time even if he wants to. So no-one will buy the club with that hanging over it. Club loss-mqking, so FWIW, I expect club to go into Administration. Worth remembering that when Saints Holding Co went onto Administration, the club had a points deduction. Barring some bizarre arrangement between Abramovich and Govt, hard to see that frozen Â£1.5bn debt to RA in Fordstam ltd ending well Portsmouth are the last club to go into administration whilst being a Premier League side, when they were given a points deduction during the 2009/10 season. Many clubs in the Football League have also been deducted points over the years for going into administration but it's not expected from the top tier sides. Of course, Thompson's prediction is far from guaranteed, and Abramovich did say that he was going to write off the debt owed to him. Before today's news, he was reportedly looking for around Â£4 billion to sell the club, which is essentially how he was going to get that money back, with one NFL team owner linked with potentially buying them. There is still a chance that the club could be sold, despite the sanctions, although the billionaire would have to prove that he would not benefit from doing so. Since buying the club in 2003, the 55-year-old has overseen five Premier League titles for his team, as well as two Champions League wins. ",positive

The billionaire is said to be looking for a buyer as the risk of sanctions from UK parliament rise. Chelsea kept themselves on course for a top four finish with an emphatic victory over the Clarets. It took them a while to get going and the scores were 0-0 after a rather uneventful first half. Reece James scored two minutes into the second half however and Chelsea didn't look back. Kai Havertz, who returned to the starting XI in place of Romelu Lukaku, scored twice before Christian Pulisic netted a fourth with 21 minutes to go.

Loadingâ¦ Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calls for the Premier League owner to be put under sanctions came from MPs and the public alike. With the threat of that happening, and the club being seized from Abramovic, the 55-year-old announced this week that the club was up for sale. The sale has led to fans and former Blues players, including John Terry, backing the owner, something that has been slammed by club legend Pat Nevin. However, that sale isn't likely to happen quickly. According to Joe Ravitch, the banker helping Abramovich find a seller, the billionaire won't be rushing. ""We are not going to rush anything. It is very important that Chelsea have the right owner to guide the club forward,"" Ravitch told Reuters. A source also told the news agency that the club do not want to find themselves with owners that will be 'politically controversial,' considering the ending of the current owner's time in charge. That means that Abramovich won't be selling to owners from China and Saudi Arabia, and it could also include other countries with poor human rights records. Newcastle United's recent change of ownership was delayed due to the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, over an argument over Premier League television rights. However there was a greater backlash from football fans for the new Saudi ownership, due to the close connection with the country's own governance. Whoever does buy the five times Premier League winners, whose success in the league all came under the Abramovich era since 2003, will have to spend big. It is reported that the Russian billionaire is looking for Â£3 billion in order to sell, with Â£1.5 billion of that thought to be the debt the club owe him. Britain's richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, was linked with a potential move to buy the club, but sources close to the Nice owner have since denied them. A Swiss billionaire claimed to have been approached by the club but said he needed several 'investors,' but if all else fails they can always sell to Conor McGregor, although the Irishman also certainly counts as 'politically controversial.'

Jordan went on to discuss Manchester City and Newcastle United's current ownership and claims the biggest winners are players and agents. He continued: ""Abramovich's legacy is what? For Chelsea, fabulous. For football in this country, I think it's awful."" Chelsea legend John Terry thanked Abramovich in a tribute tweet last week and was heavily criticised. Labour MP Chris Bryant, one of the first MPs to ask about sanctions on Abramovich, slammed Terry which saw the former England captain hit out at his political history. Last weekend saw Chelsea travel to Burnley and come away with a 4-0 win in their first league game since Abramovich's announcement.

Loadingâ¦ The Chelsea owner was looking to sell the Premier League club, in the wake of Russia's invasion on Ukraine, however on Thursday that changed. Abramovich has now been placed under sanctions by the UK, meaning he can't sell, and, whilst the team can continue to play, it will affect the squad. No players can be bought, or even sign a new contract, and they can't be sold either, meaning that Thomas Tuchel will have to make do with his current squad. That will also mean that players who are currently on loan will be back at Stamford Bridge next year. Whilst the likes of Connor Gallagher, Billy Gilmour and Armando Broja might actually be welcomed with open arms, there is some names fans wouldn't have necessarily been expecting back. In defence, Ethan Ampadu, Emerson Palmieri, Matt Miazga and Baba Rahman could all feature after being on loan, which might actually help the Blues massively. Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Anders Christiansen are all out of contract in the summer and under the current sanctions the Blues can't keep them or replace them. In midfield, Gallagher and Gilmour could certainly be of use, especially considering the former's form whilst on loan at Crystal Palace this season. Danny Drinkwater and Tiemoue Bakayoko might also have returned to the squad, but Drinkwater's contract is one of those expiring and Bakayoko's loan at AC Milan is until 2023. Broja has been in impressive form for Southampton on loan this season, with the Albanian forward having scored six times in the league, and the Saints might have wanted to keep him for another year or sign him permanently, if they could. The 20-year-old isn't the only forward who could come back to west London though, with Michy Batshuayi also set to return, after signing a new contract until 2023 before joining Besiktas on loan for this season. Tuchel's side were expected to challenge for the title this season, but, after initially making it look like a three horse race, their form fell off. He would no doubt have needed and wanted reinforcements in the summer, however now he'll have to make do with a horde of returning loanees.

Chelsea fans could soon become the latest English team who are linked to an American Football team, with one owner eyeing a move for the Blues. According to ESPN, New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson is 'readying' a bid for the Premier League team, and he is very knowledgeable about the club, having previously lived in London. Abramovich is looking to sell the club in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, having initially just handed over the 'stewardship' over to the trustees. However he then changed his mind and officially put the club up for sale, with an official statement, although he's not said to be in a rush. As well as not selling to anyone from a 'politically controversial' country, the 55-year-old also wants to make sure that whoever comes in next is willing to invest in the playing side of things, and a new stadium. The billionaire is also reportedly after around Â£3 billion, which is said to include the Â£1.5 billion that is owed to him from the club, with Johnson's net worth said to be around $3.5 billion. Last year the NFL announced UK home marketing access for six teams, with the Jets one of those six, meaning more access commercially for the teams in the UK. That makes a crossover between the Jets and Chelsea an attractive prospect for the NFL side's owner, with the Jaguars and San Francisco 49ers, whose owner has a part ownership of Leeds United, also amongst the six.

Loadingâ¦ Carlo Ancelotti left the Toffees to rejoin Madrid earlier this month and he's interested in reshaping their attack. Calvert-Lewin flourished with Ancelotti at Goodison Park and he scored 21 goals under his management last season. The Sun claim Everton owner Farhad Moshiri could be forced to accept a lower fee for the 24-year-old due to financial issues. Everton have lost around Â£240 million in the last two seasons due to the coronavirus pandemic and Ancelotti is aware of that. Karim Benzema is still leading the line for Los Blancos but their other notable attackers are wide players, such as Eden Hazard. Brazilian youngsters Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr are also wide players, as is Marco Asensio. Luka Jovic signed from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2019 but failed to hit the ground running, with the Serbia international returning to Frankfurt on loan. Chelsea's Timo Werner has been linked with a transfer but Thomas Tuchel is keen to keep his fellow countryman. Ancelotti's departure comes after Everton finished 10th in the Premier League despite being tipped for a European place all season. The Italian isn't walking into an easy job with Madrid either. It was announced on Wednesday that captain and club legend Sergio Ramos would be departing after 16 years. The 35-year-old held a press conference alongside president Florentino Perez and was overcome with emotion as he said goodbye. :microphone2: @SergioRamos toma la palabra por primera vez desde el anuncio de su marcha... y no puede evitar emocionarse Sigue EN DIRECTO la rueda de prensa de despedida del capitÃ¡n del Real Madrid: https://t.co/VWQarCNQdj pic.twitter.com/IXNA7Mrqhq Ramos will embark on a new challenge but the 35-year-old expects to return to Real in a different capacity in the future. ""This is not a goodbye, it's a see you later,"" Ramos said. ""Because I will be back."" Ramos was reported to have rejected a pay cut but he claims the reason for his departure is that there was an expiration date by which his contract needed to be renewed. ""In the last months Real Madrid offered me an offer of one year with 10% less salary,"" Ramos explained, per Fabrizio Romano. ""The money was never the problem. I wanted two years, then I accepted the proposal... but the contract renewal offer had an expiration date, and I didn't know about it."" Raphael Varane is said to be weighing up a transfer as well, meaning Ancelotti could lose both starting central defenders in one summer. ",negative

There are many issues surrounding the hosting of the tournament in the middle east country, from the problems with human rights, homosexual relationships being illegal and even moving the tournament to the winter and still needing air conditioning. With just months left until it all begins, although it would be less if it was actually in the summer, work should be all be done on the eight stadiums. However a picture from journalist Tariq Panja has caused a stir on social media, as it shows how lifeless the surroundings outside one stadium currently is.

Tickets to games do start as little as Â£52 for some Group Stage games, in category three tickets, category four are only available for Qatari residents, but go up to as much as Â£1224 for the final. Fans will also have to be wary about taking rainbow flags to the stadium, in support of LGBTQ+ rights, with homosexual relationships between men illegal in the country. Though fans have been welcomed, they've been told that flags could be taken off them to 'protect them' from attacks. Overall it's not feeling like a fully welcoming environment. ",negative

Loadingâ¦ Mexican Paola Schietekat, who was part of the World Cup organising committee, has written about the ordeal that saw her flee the Middle East. Writing in Mexican outlet Julio Astillero, the 28-year-old explained how a neighbour had got into her apartment as she slept, in June last year, and raped her. When she went to the police to report the incident, Schietekat ended up being the one questioned about extramarital sex, with her attacked claiming the pair were in a relationship. The Mexican wrote, ""That night, an acquaintance, whom I considered a friend, got into to my apartment at night, while I was sleeping. ""I clarify that, in Doha, being one of the safest cities in the world, many people leave their door unlocked and fall on the security of the building. ""After a brief struggle, as his strength exceeded mine, I ended up on the floor."" She recounted how she had taken pictures of her bruises for proof of what had happened to her, before going to a hotel in fear of her attacker returning. Schietekat then went to get a medical certificate and went to Qatari police to report the incident the previous night. There police asked if she wanted to take out a restraining order on the man, do nothing, or press charges. ""I signed the statement in Arabic and gave the details of the aggressor,"" she said she did after deciding to press charges. ""Hours later, at nine o'clock at night, they called me on the phone to urgently go to the police station. ""Puzzled, I asked if it was necessary for a woman who had just been assaulted to go to the police station alone at that hour.His response was that if I didn't go, my complaint would be dismissed. ""When I arrived at the station, the police officers put my assailant in front of me."" The attacker claimed that the pair were in a relationship and the police demanded that the World Cup official hand over her phone to prove otherwise, Schietekat added that from there the whole investigation 'centered around the extramarital affair.' In Qatar that charge can come with up to seven years in prison and also up to 100 lashes. Whilst she is expected to be sentenced next month, in absentia having returned to Mexico, her attacker was acquitted because, ""there were no cameras pointing directly at the door of the apartment, so there was no way to verify that the assault happened.""

Loadingâ¦ Homosexual relationships between men are illegal in Qatar which can lead to prison sentences, and there is even the possibility of a death penalty for Muslim men. That has led to many fans questioning whether they would attend the World Cup in November and December, with Australian Josh Cavallo, the only active openly gay footballer, saying he would be 'scared' to go. Qatar have said that they would welcome LGBTQ+ couples to the country for the tournament, and FIFA previously claimed rainbow flags would be allowed inside stadiums. However, that has now been brought into question, with Major General Abdulaziz Abdullah Al Ansariclaiming that they could be removed to 'protect fans.' ""If he [a fan] raised the rainbow flag and I took it from him, itâs not because I really want to, really, take it, to really insult him, but to protect him,"" Al Ansari is quoted as saying by AP. ""Because if itâs not me, somebody else around him might attack [him]... ""I cannot guarantee the behavior of the whole people. And I will tell him,'Please, no need to really raise that flag at this point.'"" Al Ansari continued to tell fans not to 'insult the whole society' when they're in Qatar, adding, ""You want to demonstrate your view about the [LGBTQ] situation, demonstrate it in a society where it will be accepted. ""We realise that this man got the ticket, comes here to watch the game, not to demonstrate, a political [act] or something which is in his mind. ""Watch the game. That's good. But don't really come in and insult the whole society because of this."" On fans coming to the World Cup, Al Ansari said, ""Reserve the room together, sleep together - this is something that's not in our concern. ""We are here to manage the tournament. Let's not go beyond, the individual personal things which might be happening between these people... this is actually the concept. ""Here we cannot change the laws. You cannot change the religion for 28 days of World Cup."" Last summer UEFA banned Germany from lighting the Allianz Arena in the rainbow colours for their Euro 2020 match with Hungary, in the group stages.

The pair almost came to blows during a heated on-pitch confrontation 20 years ago, when Manchester United visited St James' Park. Keane was shown a red card late in Newcastle's 4-3 win and went for Shearer - who coldly eyeballed the United midfielder as other players rushed in to prevent a fight. Now, Shearer has opened up on the infamous flashpoint - claiming that the hot-tempered Irish midfielder's bark is worse than his bite. ""Scared of him? Why would you be scared of Roy Keane?"" said Shearer in an interview with UMM. ""His bark is worse than his bite. ""I wouldn't back off with Roy Keane then and I wouldn't back off with him now."" Shearer has also revealed that their 2001 confrontation carried on after that fiery on-pitch showdown, as Keane was waiting for him at the top of the stadium stairs, blocking his path to the dressing rooms. However despite that dispute - and Shearer laughing off Keane's head-man image - the former Blackburn striker insists that the pair now share a good relationship off the pitch. Looking back on the incident for The Athletic earlier this year, Shearer recalled: ""Towards the end of Newcastle's dramatic 4-3 victory over Manchester United and in a moment of frustration, Roy threw the ball at me, there was a delicate, polite conversation (OK, it wasn't either of those things), he took a swing and missed and was then shown the red card. ""When you went from the pitch into the tunnel at St James', there were a set of steps and then you split towards the home or away dressing rooms. ""When the final whistle went, Roy was standing at the top of the stairs waiting for me. ""I'm pretty sure a few more choice words exchanged, there was some bustling and scrambling, but there were way too many people between us for anything physical to actually happen. That's usually how it pans out in football."" ""Roy was never an enemy, that's definitely not the right word but when you want to win as much as we did, things would occasionally spill over. ""We've worked together on television over the years and there's never been any problem. We've got on well. And what a competitor and player he was."" So no backing down but also some mutual respect between Keane and Shearer. All the same, it's still a pay-per-view fight we'd love to see if ITV and BBC get tired of just showing live international football in the coming weeks.  Imagery: PA Images/YouTube ",positive

It was after the game, and we beat them to be fair. ""He was walking off and I was only being polite. It was the sweeper, [Matthias] Sammer, and he said no. I went 'ya fucking prick' anyway.

Keane also revealed he was tempted to try and swap shirts with Real Madrid and France icon Zinedine Zidane, who the former Manchester United captain named as his toughest opponent. Still, he ultimately decided against it. ""If I really wanted to swap with someone it probably would have been [Zinedine] Zidane or somebody,"" Keane added. ""After that I thought it was stupid swapping jerseys really. With Zidane, I remember we played him with United and obviously he's a brilliant player. After the Madrid game we were walking up, I was looking at him and he was looking at me. ""I was thinking 'he might ask me', he didn't and I'm glad.

It was also his 40th goal in 41 appearances for the season, coming in his 600th game for the club, and meant he was the first player to score 40 goals in a season for the club since Cristiano Ronaldo. The football idiom 'who else' was pretty much made for the goal, considering the Frenchman has been so instrumental in getting Real into the final four of the Champions League. His hat-trick in 17 minutes in the second half of the second leg of the last 16 completed a comeback against PSG from 2-0 down in the tie, when all looked lost. In the quarter finals he scored another hat-trick in the first leg against Chelsea, at Stamford Bridge, but his goal in Madrid was even more instrumental.

Guardiola was forced into starting John Stones at right back, with Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo both unavailable for the game. Stones himself had been a doubt to start the game and he had to be replaced by Fernandinho in the first half due to an injury, leaving the 36-year-old up against the 21-year-old Vinicius for the goal. At that point in the game it was already turning into an instant classic, but there were still more twists to come, as the two teams were involved in one of the best matches of the season. Vinicius' goal had cut a two goal City lead for the second time in the tie, and Guardiola's side once again stretched their lead to two goals for the third time. The referee smartly played advantage, after Oleksandr Zinchenko was tripped just outside the area, with Bernardo Silva striking the ball past Thibaut Courtois with aplomb. The Premier League leaders then shot themselves in the foot when Aymeric Laporte handled in the area and Benzema Panenka'd the resulting penalty to make it 4-3.

Ralf Rangnick's side struggled in large parts during the round of 16 clash at the Wanda Metropolitano but after coming on as a second-half substitute, academy graduate Elanga slotted past Jan Oblak to bag a crucial equaliser. It was a cool, calm and collected finish from the youngster, who has impressed in recent weeks with several excellent performances.

""The first training session the night before the Crystal Palace game, he was the player with the best training performance.

Loadingâ¦ The Manchester United forward scored a hat-trick in Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich City and it was the 50th of his club career. Ronaldo turned 37 in February but sits on an impressive tally of 21 goals since returning to England. Crooks believes now is the time to step away before he becomes a shadow of his former self. He wrote in his column for BBC Sport: ""Scoring three or four hat-tricks in your professional career must be enormously gratifying, but to score your 50th club hat-trick is just off the scale. ""Ronaldo's second goal against Norwich was a glimpse of the player we saw 10 years ago, playing for Real Madrid. ""The movement and timing of his header was sheer brilliance. I made the point last week, in the Crooks of the Matter, that Ronaldo had been given a wonderful opportunity to retire from European league football this season at the top. ""Manchester Unitedhave provided him with that opportunity and I hope he takes it."" The five-time Ballon d'Or winner capitalised on a mistake in the Canaries backline to tap home his first, before powering in a header to make it 2-0. Kieran Dowell handed Norwich a lifeline just before halftime and Teemu Pukki brought Dean Smith's men level shortly after the break. Ronaldo stepped up to score his first free-kick since July 2020 to give United a vital win as they search for a place in this season's top four. United have struggled for numbers up front this season, with Edinson Cavani injured and Mason Greenwood unavailable for selection. It's seen Ronaldo carry the load up front and no other players has hit double figures. Bruno Fernandes is the closest player to Ronaldo with nine goals this campaign. Rumours suggested Ronaldo could look to leave Old Trafford for a second time if United failed to qualify for the Champions League. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick was asked about Ronaldo's future post-match and he stressed it'll likely be down to the new manager. Current Ajax coach Erik ten Hag is expected to become the Red Devils' new manager at the end of this season and Fabrizio Romano has claimed negotiations are ongoing. ",positive

One instance which caught the eye saw Ronaldo give Rashford positional instructions when the 24-year-old looked to be occupying the wrong space in the first half.

Happened all night pal. Terrible performance Ronaldo then started tracking back on the left wing himself, seeing as Rashford wasn't interested in listening. Rashford genuinely looks like he has given up it's perhaps worth noting if he doesn't do it under Ten Hag next season that he needs to look elsewhere. I was at the game mate let me tell you rashford didn't even try or even bother it was horrendous. Cr7 was all over that pitch he was the leader without him we'll be doomed & supposedly he was suppose to be the problem ayy. Its going to be really hard for Marcus to come back from this. His form over the last 18months has been atrocious which has just damaged his reputation amongst fans. I hope he can humble himself enough to start developing his game again but I just dont see it happening tbh When even Ronaldo has to tell you how to defend, it shows how little effort youâre putting in. Marcus needs to spend less time blaming fans & more time putting a proper shift in. If fans say Maguire isnt cpt material, then Rashford isnt number 10 material. Heâs got one more szn. We should bin himHe is not even botheredRonaldo was covering for him during the game most of the time Rashford got a rinsing from former United captain Roy Keane prior to the game for smiling in the warm-up, while plenty of United supporters also took issue with the England international rushing to give Thomas Tuchel a hug at the final whistle.

Ronaldo's return to Old Trafford last summer was extremely dramatic, with the club 'stealing' him from the clutches of rivals Manchester City at the 11th hour. Loadingâ¦ His arrival back was initially heralded but it's not according to plan for the player or the club, despite the fact he remains their top scorer this season. The 37-year-old hasn't exactly been Ralf Rangnick's favoured player in his system, since taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in December, and the goals have dried up, apart from a recent hat-trick against Tottenham Hotspur. There has been questions about his future, especially if United don't secure a place in next season's Champions League, and it sounds like Rooney might be on board with him leaving. ""Youâd have to say no at the minute,"" Ronaldo's former teammate said on Monday Night Football when asked if the signing had worked out. ""I think heâs scored goals, heâs scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season, he scored the hat-trick against Tottenham, but I think if youâre looking to the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best and lift Manchester United over these next two or three years. ""Obviously Cristiano is getting on a bit, he certainly isnât the player he was when he was in his 20s, and that happens, thatâs football.

However, there has been a lack of options for the former RB Leipzig manager, especially with the continued absence of Edinson Cavani due to injuries and fitness problems. The club also loaned out Anthony Martial in January and Mason Greenwood continues to not be available for selection, whilst Marcus Rashford has lost form in recent months, leading to him not being an option for Rangnick. Rooney did name the four players who the next manager should build his team around, and Ronaldo missed out on that list as well, with Jadon Sancho and Rashford amongst them. Another man who the Derby County manager didn't mention was Paul Pogba, with the Frenchman's future beyond the summer still unknown, no doubt not helped by the lack of a permanent manager. Pogba's contract expires at the end of the season, and Rooney believes it's time the former Juventus man moved on, again, ""Itâs got to a point now that itâs better to move on,"" the former club captain said. ""If Paul is honest with himself, he probably hasn't had the impact he would have liked since he returned to Manchester United.""

And one supporter has seemingly had enough of Maguire. The fan went over to Change.Org to demand the Â£80 million man be stripped of the captaincy.

Loadingâ¦ United suffered yet another defeat at the weekend, this time to Arsenal, as their chances of a top four finish all but disappeared amidst some comedy defending. The team's poor results against the Gunners and Liverpool last week sandwiched the announcement that Ten Hag will take over as manager in the summer, and shone a light on how much he needs to do to turn things around at Old Trafford. There has been a lot of talk about the attitude of the players and, according to the Mirror, Rangnick has been asked by Director of Football John Murtough and CEO Richard Arnold to create a dossier for Ten Hag on the current squad. Rangnick's run down is set to be 'no holds barred' and he will detail how he's been let down by certain players after being reportedly 'staggered' by their lack of professionalism. A long with that, the interim manager is set to tell the new man that players have actually ignored his instructions in games, refusing to play patterns he's asked for. He has already told Murtough that certain players are 'not fit for purpose' and are unable to keep up with other teams, which might explain why he quickly abandoned his original plan for his side to adopt gegenpressing. The 64-year-old former RB Leipzig manager was brought in by the club until the end of the season back in December and is supposed to be taking up a two year consultancy role after Ten Hag takes over. He has been very honest in his assessment in recent weeks, saying that United are six years behind Liverpool and compared the fix to their problems to open heart surgery. Ten Hag's honesty is also said to have already impressed at Old Trafford, with the 52-year-old's open discussion about the club's recruitment and scouting during his interview said to have helped him get the job. He is likely to arrive at United with a clear out already part way through being complete, as Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic all set to depart in the summer. More players could join them on the way out, as the Dutchman also looks to recruit players to play in his system, and potentially welcome back Donny van de Beek. The former Bayern Munich II boss is said to already be eyeing up eight current stars to form the basis of his squad, which includes three young players. ",positive

If this happens and everyone has realised that this has to happen and if people want to work together then it makes sense and I believe it doesnât take two or three years to change those things. This can happen within one year."" Ralf Rangnick's clinical examination of Manchester United and everyone involved at the club. pic.twitter.com/5SvTrluvWM Rangnick added: âFor sure [strong leadership is needed]. This is something that not just one single person as a manager can do. With all respect to Jurgen and Pep, Iâm sure that they didnât do all the things themselves [at Liverpool and Manchester City]. There were also other people involved in those two clubs, people in certain positions, no matter what area it was, in order to rebuild and build something we want to build here. In all areas you have to have top people and they have to work together in a very close, reliable way.â In the press conference, Rangnick went on to back incoming manager Ten Hag, who has impressed at Ajax since taking over in 2017. âAll I heard from people who work with him is that he is a very good character, communicative, and does things himself,â he said. âObviously he needs the assistance of all the people inside the club and he will get that and have the chance to mould a new team together with the scouting department and the board, which is necessary. The most vital part is that the club manages to get in the best possible players, and we have the attitude, the energy. We need positive energy for the new team and this is also important for the new manager.â The future of Paul Pogba has been a big talking of late and Rangnick admitted the French midfielder probably won't play for the club again after picking up a knock against Liverpool. âHe wonât be available [at Arsenal] and most likely not for the rest of the games. It seems right now he will not renew his contract [so] itâs most likely he wonât be here any more next season.â Thoughts on Rangnick's press conference? Let us know in the comments. ",positive

Loadingâ¦ United are set for a huge summer with Erik ten Hag set to arrive at the club as their permanent manager and no doubt wanting to bring in some players, whilst a whole host are set to leave. Ten Hag could have Ralf Rangnick as a consultant at Old Trafford, even with the German set to become manager of the Austria national team. The club's recruitment policy has been criticised by both Ten Hag and Rangnick and things have already begun changing behind the scenes, with two scouts leaving the club recently. Now Judge is set to join him out of the club, with the Athletic confirming that the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts handing in his resignation notice. The director of football has been in his position since 2014 and was previously considered to be working closely with Ed Woodward, before he left the club at the end of last year. Judge is still working his notice period, and isn't on gardening leave, but will not be part of the club's strategy for transfers in the upcoming window. He is said to have considered his future at the club due to a reshuffle in the the structure behind the scenes at United, as the club desperately try to get closer to rivals Manchester City and Liverpool. John Murtough, the club's first ever director of football, will now have full control of the transfer policy, alongside technical director Darren Fletcher. There has been talk of the club looking to appoint Paul Mitchell, who is currently Monaco's director of football, and has previously worked at RB Leipzig, where Rangnick also worked. The club have been constantly criticised for their scouting and recruitment, with claims that they've gone for big name signings rather than players who they needed. The change in structure at Old Trafford could certainly be seen as a good thing, especially in the wake of Woodward leaving, who was at the heart of much negative press over their transfers. However Judge did help negotiate Ten Hag coming in as the new manager and him leaving so abruptly might not be such a good thing. Only time will tell but it's likely to be very busy summer with the likes of Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata all expected to leave. ",positive

According to The Guardian, McClaren is being considered for the assistant manager role at Old Trafford, having previously acted as Sir Alex Fergusonâs No 2 between 1999 and 2001. United are still searching for their next permanent manager, with interim boss Ralf Rangnick set to move into a consultancy role at the end of the season. Loadingâ¦ Ajax head coach Ten Hag is one of the favourites to land the job and has already held talks with United. Ten Hag has never managed in the Premier League and so it would be beneficial for his assistant to have experience of English football. Former England boss McClaren could fulfil this role, having also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Newcastle United. McClaren's last managerial appointment was at Queens Park Rangers, where he sacked in 2019. Should McClaren be appointed as Ten Hagâs assistant, it would be a reversal of roles from their time together in Dutch football. Ten Hag acted as assistant to McClaren during his first spell at Twente, where he guided the Dutch club to the Eredivisie title for the first time in their history. According to the report, Ten Hag has 'particularly impressed' the United hierarchy, although the club are still considering other managerial candidates including Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, McClaren compared Ten Hag to Ferguson as well as current Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. âTactically heâs outstanding,â said McClaren. âHe worked with Pep at Bayern Munich and took in his philosophy too. They called him 'Mini Pep' out there. Heâs ready. âA lot of top clubs in Germany and England will be out to get him.â âI thought I worked hard until I met Erik,â added McClaren, who praised Ten Hagâs ability to analyse games in real time and suggest changes that would consistently affect the outcome of games. âThe only other one I would have seen do thatâ¦ that would have been the gaffer [Ferguson].â Loadingâ¦ ",positive

Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag looks set to become the new United manager at the end of the season, after it was reported this week that he'd agreed to take the job. The Ajax manager was the first interviewed by United last month, after he'd been placed on their shortlist along with Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique. That interview clearly went well, as he's on the verge of getting the job, and it seems that's after he was honest in his criticism of the club. According to the Sun, the Dutchman spoke to technical director Darren Fletcher and football director John Murtough and he didn't hold back when telling them what is wrong with the club currently. Ten Hag is said to have opened up on the problems with recruitment and scouting at the club, something that has clearly been very good at his current club. The pair of United chiefs then flew back from Amsterdam in 'shock' at what they'd heard but were also impressed with what the 52-year-old had to say. ""It was like United were being interviewed by Ten Hag rather than the other way round,"" an Old Trafford source told the Sun of the meeting. The former Bayern Munich II manager is said to not want full control of things with the Premier League side but did outline that things behind the scenes need a 'shake-up.' It's no surprise that the incoming boss had such frank thoughts on what's been happening in the red half of Manchester, as he's known to be a bit of a perfectionist. Ten Hag reportedly likes the grass on the pitch to be two millimeters, 'or something like that,' and that 'everything had to be perfect in his eyes.' Plans are already afoot for the next campaign and the transfer market, and has already identified one man to carry out his 'masterplan.' The report claims that French midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is the man who he wants, with the Monaco player said to want a move out of Ligue 1. ",positive

That doesn't mean the 27-year-old was safe from captain Henderson however, who was shocked at Minamino playing the ball backwards. Henderson had darted into space and after seeing it go back to his own half, the England international shouted: ""TAKI, TAKI!"" Unfortunately for Henderson, it devolved into a squeak more than a shout and someone in the home end captured every moment. Fans close to the touchline couldn't help but laugh as Minamino gave Henderson a look across the pitch. Minamino joined Liverpool from RB Salzburg in January 2020 and has been a squad player during his time in England. The Japan international didn't manage to dislodge starting trio Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane while Diogo Jota has also moved ahead of him in the pecking order. Henderson and Minamino are good friends off the pitch and Henderson is always keen to get him involved in group celebrations. Manager Jurgen Klopp believes Wednesday was Minamino's best game in a Liverpool shirt. He explained per the Daily Mail: ""His impression was obvious with scoring two goals and not only that â he had a lot more top, top football moments. ""He was a constant threat tonight, he was mobile, he was quick. ""He was technically on an incredibly high level; it was really windy tonight and when you then saw how he controlled the balls when he had to bring down the high balls, that was all really, really, really good. ""Iâm not surprised, I know how good he is and tonight he showed it to the public again, which is absolutely great.""

The Reds have been sponsored by banking and financial services company Standard Chartered since the start of the 2010-11 season. But that Â£40m-a-season deal is set to expire at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. Loadingâ¦ Negotiations are currently taking place over a potential extension but Liverpool are also holding talks with companies from a number of other sectors including cryptocurrency firms, according to The Athletic. David Ornstein has reported that Liverpool are in talks with âa crypto exchange firm - a platform to buy and sell digital currency - and a blockchain platform (a decentralised computer network that underpins cryptocurrencies).â The potential sponsorship deal could earn Liverpool more than Â£70m in two seasons but is likely to be controversial, given the environmental concerns and lack of regulation surrounding cryptocurrencies. Other Premier League clubs already have sponsorship deals with cryptocurrency firms but none of them have one as their main shirt sponsor. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Everton, Leeds United and Manchester City all have deals in place with crypto sponsor Socios, which sells 'fan engagement tokens'. Palace fans have previously protested against their club's deal with the company, holding up a banner describing Socios as ""parasites"" during a match against Everton earlier this season. Liverpool are hoping to finalise their main sponsorship deal in the next eight weeks, as Jurgen Klopp's side continue their pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple this season. Liverpool's negotiations with crypto firms come after the club controversially launched its own range of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in March. The NFTs, digital artworks of players and coaching staff at Anfield, were put on sale at auctioneer Sotheby's for $75 (Â£57) each - around $12.8m (Â£9.8m) in total. But they failed to attract significant interest, with the club selling less than 10,000 of the 171,000 available NFTs, according to The Daily Mail. Despite the disappointing response from fans, Liverpool still raised Â£1.1m from selling the NFTs, with Â£281,374 of that figure going to the club's charity, the LFC Foundation. ",negative

Xavi has brought in Ferran Torres this month, with Dani Alves joining at the end of last year, whilst Philippe Coutinho left the club in order for Torres to be registered. The club are also trying to get rid of Ousmane Dembele, as they continue to need to reduce their wage bill and hope to bring in more transfer funds. Whilst the Catalan side have been linked with moves for two Chelsea defenders in the summer, they could look to add another defender this month. According to journalist Gerrard Romero, Barca are eyeing up a move for Borussia Dortmund right back Thomas Meunier, and Sergino Dest has been talked about in a possible swap deal. Whilst the swap deal is a possibility, and details of any possible move are yet to be fully hashed out, there is doubt that Dest will leave this month, according to SPORT. The American full back only moved from Ajax to Barcelona in October 2020, after the club beat Bayern Munich to the 21-year-old's signature. However there has been talk of him leaving the Nou Camp for some time already, despite the fact that he played 30 times in La Liga in his first season. Dest has started 12 games in the league this season, although Xavi isn't a particularly big fan of the US international, and his future once again is questionable. 30-year-old Meunier is also in his second season at his current club, having moved to Dortmund from PSG in summer 2020 as a free agent. He has started 16 games this season in Bundesliga under Marco Rose and has become an important part of the team who are once again chasing Bayern in the race to be German champions.

Incredible Back Story Of Euro 2020 Sensation,"Alexander Isak is a name we will be hearing a lot more of in the future - and it comes as no surprise, too, especially given his stellar performances for Sweden during this summer's European Championships. Sweden are without their legendary forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic at this summer's Euro 2020 - but Isak is the new kid on the block that is captivating the Swedes every single time he plays. Isak is, essentially, Sweden's new Ibrahimovic - at least that's what many fans and pundits are saying - and he has already found the back of the net five times in 22 caps for the Scandinavians. The Swede was somewhat of a revelation in La Liga last season, scoring 17 times in total for Real Sociedad, while attracting interest from some of the biggest clubs around Europe. That same season, he also became the youngest player since Ronaldo Nazario to score in seven successive games in the competition. Talk about impressive. The 21-year-old has shone brightly during this summer's showpiece and has been Sweden's talisman - and even put in a sizzling man of the match display against Slovakia recently. Among those interested in the prospect is Chelsea - with head coach Thomas Tuchel knowing the young striker well during his time at Borussia Dortmund. Sociedad, however, are adamant that he will not be sold for less than his Â£60m buyout clause, but the Blues are insistent on bringing a striker to Stamford Bridge this summer. Arsenal are another Premier League club that are said to be interested in launching a move for the highly-rated youngster, according to The Athletic. It is claimed that the Gunners will have Isak towards the top of a list of targets if they offload a striker this summer. Alexander Isak is a 21-year-old striker, born in Stockholm, who currently plays for Spanish side Real Sociedad in the La Liga. The striker is also a Swedish international and has been named in Olof Andersson's 26-man squad for this summer's rearranged European Championship. Raised in Stockholm by Eritrean parents, Isak was just six-year-old when he began his footballing career, joining his boyhood club AIK. After working his way through the youth ranks at the Swedish outfit, Isak made his senior debut for the first-team in February 2016, stepping off the substitutes bench for the final 15 minutes of a 6-0 win and, of course, marked the occasion with a goal. He soon cemented himself as a regular, despite only being 16 at the time, and finished his first campaign in the team with 11 goals in 26 appearances. The following season, Isak secured a big move to German giants Borussia Dortmund, signing for the Bundesliga club in January 2017 for a fee believed to be around the â¬9m mark. Despite being considered as one of the hottest properties in Europe, he failed to make an impact at the German outfit. With the 2018/19 campaign threatening to be another one of disappointment in Germany, the Swede joined Dutch outfit Willem II on loan in January 2019 for the remainder of the season. Proving to be a wise decision in his young career, he scored 14 goals in 18 games, as well as claiming seven assists. Those performances caught the attention of Real Sociedad, who brought him on a five-year deal in June 2019. His first season in Spain saw him score 16 goals in all competitions, but only nine in 37 La Liga outings. Last season, however, in the 2020/21 campaign, the youngster - believed to have a Â£60million release clause in his contract - scored an impressive 17 times inside 34 La Liga appearances. As well as proving himself at club level, Isak has also been producing the goods on the international stage - and has caught the eye of many at this summer's Euros. ",positive

The 21-year-old was named as Man of the Match in the 1-0 victory in Saint Petersburg, capturing the eye for the second game on the trot after producing a quite breathtaking dribble from his own half. Impressed by what he saw from the Real Sociedad man, former Spurs and Barcelona striker Lineker took to Twitter to wax lyrical about Isak. ""Don't think there's much doubt that Alexander Isak will attract a lot of attention from clubs across Europe,"" Lineker wrote. ""Exceptional talent."" Isak was asked about Lineker's comments in a post-match press conference and quite clearly had no knowledge of who the Match of the Day presenter was. ""I am not that aware of him. It's an old player working in the studio?"" Isak said. ""I wasn't born then but I have a little bit of knowledge about him."" Lineker is indeed a bit before the former Borussia Dortmund man's time but he did score 330 career goals and was the Golden Boot winner at the 1986 World Cup. Isak has been the main man for Sweden so far in Euro 2020 and looks set to have a slew of clubs queueing up for his signature in the summer. Fresh reports say Sociedad and Dortmund are in talks to remove his Â£26 million buy-back clause, with the Spanish side poised to pay a fee of Â£5 million. In 2020/21, he hit 17 goals in La Liga and won the competition's Young Player of the Year award. ",positive

Isak has been one of the most exciting talents at Euro 2020 so far, putting in impressive performances against Spain and Slovakia - earning UEFA's 'Star of the Match' in his most recent outing. The Real Sociedad striker has received plenty of praise for his displays, with Lineker thoroughly impressed and backing him to get a big move this summer. Don't think there's much doubt that Alexander Isak will attract a lot of attention from clubs across Europe. Exceptional talent. Isak was then asked about Lineker's comments in a post-match press conference but looked incredibly bemused and evidently had little knowledge about the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner. ""I am not that aware of him. It's an old player working in the studio?"" Isak said. ""I wasn't born then but I have a little bit of knowledge about him."" We were all waiting for Lineker's reaction and it was Richards who forced a response form the Match of the Day present during BBC's coverage of Spain vs Poland on Saturday night. Sorry @GaryLineker, we couldn't resist! :wink: #bbceuro2020 #ESP #POL pic.twitter.com/GpKb1YLHIN The former Manchester City defender requested the footage be shown and set it up beautifully. Lineker responded: ""I said really nice things about him! An 'old player in the studio?'"" Of course Richards quickly erupted into his trademark cackle and added: ""How does it feel when no-one knows you? Now you know how I feel!"" Lineker is indeed a bit before Isak's time but he did score 330 career goals in his career - as well famously never receiving a red or yellow card. Loadingâ¦ Sweden will be looking for Isak to do the business in their final group game against Poland on Wednesday, as they hope to advance to the knockout stages. In 2020/21, Isak was named as the Young Player of the Year in La Liga after scoring 17 goals. ",positive

However, one extremely rare occasion in which the Swede was left speechless has been remembered this week. Back in 2015, when the 39 year old was in the colours of French giants PSG, referee Tony Chapron did not hand the striker the match ball after netting a hattrick against Lorient. This led to some crazy scenes as the players and officials left the pitch, with IbrahimoviÄ pleading for Chapron to offload the ball. ""Ref, the ball!"" he exclaimed in footage released from the tunnel. ""Wait,"" Chapron replied. ""I decide."" This did not go down well with the hattrick hero. ""Ah you want to be the boss now,"" IbrahimoviÄ snapped. ""Okay, good. You're the boss. Good for the camera!"" This was not the first time Chapron was involved in a controversial incident during his 12 years as a referee in Ligue 1. In 2018, the Frenchman kicked out at former FC Nantes defender Diego Carlos who had inadvertently tripped him up as he tried to catch up with play.  This saw Chapron suspended by The French Football Federation for 6 months, after which the 49 year old retired from officiating to work for the nation's football media. When asked as to why he dismissed IbrahimoviÄ's request back in 2015, Chapron said it was due to the latter's lack of manners. ""He arrived close to me- he just clicked his fingers and said 'the ball!"" he told BBC Sport in 2018. ""I have four daughters and when we're together and they ask something, if we don't have the word 'please' at the end of the sentence, there is no reaction. So, it's the same. It's a kind of education. I think it was a kind of disrespect. There is something wrong with society if we forget the simple things such as 'please' and 'thank you'. It was the beginning of the IbrahimoviÄ show because nobody says no to Zlatan. I was probably the only one."" Chapron did not hold back when he was asked what he thought about the four-time Ligue 1 champion, who scored a staggering 113 goals in 122 games for The Parisians. ""He is a very annoying guy,"" Chapron continued. ""Not only with referees. He was always blaming his teammates, always trying to cause trouble with the opponents. He was a crazy guy. I think he's a fantastic player but on the pitch he's someone else. And it was very difficult as a referee. I hope for him that he's a kind of actor, because he says so many things, crazy things, I hope he doesn't think what he says."" ",positive

The Swedish superstar offered high praise for Mbappe in particular, comparing the Frenchman to a certain former Brazilian striker. ""Mbappe is a reminder of Ronaldo the FenÃ´meno. ...

When you're a football player, you can see other players, the way they think, the way they move. I like those players that predict things before they happen. ""I think Mbappe is a reminder of Ronaldo the FenÃ´meno - he's very elegant in his game. When you talk about young players, you talk about Haaland. ""Haaland is good because I think he is obsessed with goals, and he's not doing more than he needs to do. He's only focusing on goals, and sometimes you have players that think they can do more than they're able to - that is not intelligence. ""In Haaland, I see this intelligence, as he just wants to score goals and he knows he can score goals. He's only trying to do that."" Mbappe is enjoying another fine season after netting 13 goals in 23 appearances across all competitions for Paris Saint Germain, most recently scoring a brace in a 2-0 win over Monaco on Sunday. Those 13 goals also include four strikes in the Champions League, after netting another brace in a 4-1 win over Club Brugge and a goal each against Manchester City and RB Leipzig. Meanwhile, Ibrahimovic is right when he says Haaland is obsessed with goals, as the Norwegian has managed an astonishing 19 goals in 15 appearances across all competitions for Borussia Dortmund so far this campaign. The record is all the more remarkable considering how the 21-year-old has struggled with injuries this season, as a hip problem kept him on the sidelines for over a month. Let's hope that Haaland and Mbappe take us into a golden new age of goalscoring for many years to come. ",positive

Messi has supplied four assists for Messi in the league this term but his decision-making was a little suspect in the aforementioned moments. Mbappe's contract with PSG is up in the summer and the club are still desperately trying to tie him down - even offering a staggering Â£83 million signing-on bonus.

The 36 year old looked set to wear a different shirt number this season after striker Edison Cavani came off the bench during United's 1-0 win at Wolves on Sunday. But following Dan James' imminent departure to Leeds United, Cavani would be able to take James' number 21, leaving Ronaldo with his famous, favourite number 7 again. The swap does need to be ratified by the Premier League, as squad numbers for the campaign have already been submitted. That said, there is a history of players swapping numbers before the summer transfer window shuts. In the 2012/2013 season, Tottenham's Rafael van der Vaart returned to Hamburg after two seasons at White Hart Lane. This saw the Dutchman give his number 10 shirt to striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who in turn offloaded the number 25 to new signing Hugo Lloris, who held the jersey for his first two years in North London. There was talk that Ronaldo may follow in the footsteps of former United player Wes Brown and wear two shirt numbers this season, in the Premier and Champions League respectively. But with James set to move to Elland Road at some point today, it feels highly likely that the Portuguese superstar will re-join the likes of David Beckham and George Best in United's 'No. 7' club this season. James, 23, has been admired by Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa for several years, with the Argentinian close to signing the winger on loan in January 2019. During his time at Old Trafford, James scored six goals, including one against The Whites at Old Trafford back in December 2020. The transfer is expected to be in the region of Â£24 million. Meanwhile United have confirmed the â¬23 million signing of Ronaldo this morning after he passed his medical in Lisbon yesterday afternoon.

Johnson's sister, Faye, reportedly told a friend: ""He was going to write an open letter to all the clubs explaining why he can benefit them if they give him another chance. ""Genuinely thought he was joking when he told me but he was deadly serious.""

""He definitely wants to play again -- but it is just a question of where and if anyone will pick him up,"" a source told the Daily Star. ""He's clearly a talented player and would get into many a team, even with a lengthy spell behind bars.

He's also enjoyed spells at Middlesbrough, where he graduated from the youth academy, as well as Manchester City - winning the Premier League and FA Cup. He's been capped by England 12 times, too, making his senior debut in 2010 against Mexico. Further claims suggest Johnson is plotting to resurrect his footballing career away from Britain.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted to use a 3-5-2 formation against the defending Premier League champions at Old Trafford. Loadingâ¦ Wan-Bissaka was deployed as a right wing-back in Unitedâs 2-2 comeback draw against Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday night. However, the 23-year-old right-back struggled against a dominant City performance across the 90 minutes. Joao Cancelo caused serious difficulties for Wan-Bissaka, with the City star picking up both assists in his sideâs 2-0 win at Old Trafford. Scholes insisted that United donât suit a 3-5-2 formation with the players at Solskjaerâs disposal. Read More: The former United midfielder called Wan-Bissaka a âbrilliant defender,â but he was far from convinced over his ability on the ball. âI said before the 3-5-2 doesn't suit the players in the team,â Scholes told Premier League Productions. âWan-Bissaka is useless on the ball -- brilliant defender but useless on the ball at right-back. âThree centre-halves today, none of them that good on the ball. Ole has got to find a wayâ¦ There's a squad of players there that could be okay.â Wan-Bissaka arrived at Old Trafford in 2019 from Crystal Palace in a Â£45m deal, which could rise by Â£5m through add-ons. The United defender has started in all of his sideâs 11 Premier League matches this season, as well as featuring in three of their four Champions League fixtures. Wan-Bissaka, who hasnât scored or assisted this season, made 34 league appearances last season and scored twice and registered four assists. Scholes also targeted Solskjaer with criticism after suggesting his former United teammate needs to have âconvictionâ with his management style and tactics. âThe conviction has to come from the coach of the way you're going to play football,â he said. âOle has been here three years now and we've come here today not really knowing what he's going to do. âThat makes the recruitment almost impossible because you're not buying players for a system.

His goal was met with one fan helicoptering his 'chap,' pulling it out and swinging it around quickly, with the video going viral.

That's messed up since we didn't see anything because of the cold night (hopefully :sweat_smile:) #WeWillRememberYouPenicopter https://t.co/QDhO2Gzsly 'We Will Remember You Penicopter' might be the single greatest hashtag a footballer has ever used and it just adds to Saint-Maximin's growing reputation in the Premier League as everyone's favourite player. The Frenchman reacted in gif form to the original video of the fan over zealously celebrating, when many players probably would have ignored the story that followed their goal. Newcastle really needed the forward's goal as they'd thrown away a two goal lead in the replay and were under pressure from their League One opponents with penalties just four minutes away.

After ending his 21-year association with his beloved Barcelona, the six-time Ballon d'Or winner joined PSG in one of the most high-profile player moves of the summer transfer window. Incredibly, the 34-year-old's contract has since been leaked by French publication L'Equipe, with their report claiming that the Argentine will see him earn as much - if not more - than team-mates Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. It has been revealed that Messi will earn an eye watering net salary of â¬110m (Â£94m) over the next three seasons should he stay at the club. Messi will pocket â¬30m (Â£25.6m) this season andâ¬40m (Â£34.1m) over the following two campaigns before his contract expires in 2024. Not too shabby that, eh? The former Barcelona man was willing to cut his salary by 50 per cent which would have seen him earn a net â¬30m per season at the Catalan giants. Those wages, though, would still have been too high under La Liga's financial fair play regulations which is what led to his departure from the club at the end of his last contract. Voici la une du journal @lequipe du samedi 18 septembre 2021.En kiosque : https://t.co/Oe3pdODgOG pic.twitter.com/qLaBX9P2er Messi did not receive any transfer bonus when he made the move to PSG, however, it is believed that he will receive a loyalty bonus that would equate toâ¬15m (Â£12.8m) per year. Since completing his move to the Ligue 1 side, he has also linked up with a cryptocurrency websitewhich will see him earn an additional sum of up toâ¬30m over the duration of his contract. This partnership is the most lucrative sponsorship for the club apart from those that appear on their match and training shirts.

The former Santos youth product has scored 98 times in 141 games for the club, helping PSG to four Ligue One titles as well as three Coupe de France and two Coupe de la Ligue trophies. But Neymar, having won the Champions League with Barcelona, has been unable to help bring the club the coveted European trophy during his tenure. The club came closest when they lost the 2020 final to Bayern Munich and were knocked out in disappointing fashion by Real Madrid in the round of 16 this term.

Loadingâ¦ Feyenoord beat Marseille 3-2 in the Europa Conference League semi-final first leg at De Kuip, with the second strike from Cyriel Dessers ensuring the Dutch side take a lead to France for the second fixture on 5 May. Luis Sinestra was the other goalscorer for Arne Slot's side and put the Rotterdam outfit 2-0 up in the 20th minute. And the goal helped bring about a viral clip on social media as a supporter in the Feyenoord section goaded Marseille fans with such disrespect. Separated by glass panelling, the fan got as close as he could and showed off a PSG tracksuit top. PSG are Marseille's main rivals in Ligue One and the two sides play out the 'Le Classique', which always seems to get seriously tasty on and off the pitch. It's unclear whether the fan is a PSG fan or a Feyenoord follower but he repeatedly patted the badge on his chest and riled up the opposition supporters. They were going absolutely mental on the other side of the glass, banging on it and dishing out middle fingers galore. A steward did his best to restrain the fan, who eventually stepped away back to his seat and continued to rub it in from there. A Feyenoord fan wearing a psg jersey to troll Marseille are things you love to see ðð https://t.co/5izNwpPOlL Marseille pulled level in the second half courtesy of goals from Bamba Dieng and Gerson but then Dessers bagged his brace straight after half-time. The two sides will meet again next week at the Stade de Velodrome and we just hope that the fan in question - if he's in attendance - is armed with a disguise. The other semi-final between Leicester and Roma was 1-1 and is nicely poised for the second leg at the Stadio Olimpico. ",positive

Both City and PSG have owners from the Middle East, with the former owned by Sheikh Mansour from the UAE, while the latter are under a Qatari-based ownership. These models are in sharp contrast to the 50+1 German method, which requires all of the clubs to own 50% plus one additional share of the football company. This is aimed at stopping external investors from claiming a majority percentage for themselves. PSG and City have reached each of the last two Champions League finals, with Bayern Munich triumphing over the French side in 2020, while Pep Guardiola's men were beaten by Chelsea in May. Those defeats delighted Hoeness and he delivered a brutal shot towards PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. ""So far they haven't won anything. Nothing at all. The two associations don't have a single Champions League title,"" he told 11 Leben podcast, in quotes published by the Manchester Evening News. ""They will continue to lose against us. Not always, but sometimes. That has to be the goal, and if we win against them, I'm really happy. ""This is what stimulates me to show them, 'your s****y money, that's not enough!' ""The difference between him [Al-Khelaifi] and me is: I worked hard for the money and he got it as a gift. We put it at his disposal and he doesn't need to work for that. When he wants a player, he will find his emir. "" So, if Bayern do end up facing PSG this season, you could say that the atmosphere may be a bit tense in the directors' box! Bayern are back in Bundesliga action after the international break on 19th November, when they travel to Augsburg. ",positive

Solskjaer was relieved of his duties on Sunday, a day removed from a humiliating 4-1 defeat at the hands of Watford, and gave an emotional final interview to MUTV. Michael Carrick, part of the coaching team at United since his retirement in 2018, is to take charge of the next batch of games as caretaker boss. Rumours have been swirling as to who United want to replace Solskjaer and according to multiple outlets, Pochettino is the top target for the Red Devils. And the Daily Mail say that he would be willing to return to English football with United during the middle of the campaign. Mauricio Pochettino is ready to quit PSG and become Manchester United manager NOW. He is unhappy in Paris as his family are still based in London. #MUFC [@ChrisWheelerDM, @SamiMokbel81_DM] Pochettino took the reins at PSG earlier this year and signed a new contract until 2023 in July. However, he is said to be prepared to leave the Parc des Princes before that deal expires - having not quite settled in the French capital. The 49-year-old's family are still based in London after his stint at Spurs and he is residing in a Paris hotel. PSG are currently nine points clear at the top of Ligue One but Pochettino has reportedly grown frustrated with the big egos amongst his squad. He was one of the names in the frame to take the job at United back in December 2018 when Jose Mourinho was sacked. United appointed Solskjaer as interim boss and then gave him the role full-time following a strong start. Sir Alex Ferguson is believed to view the Argentine as the preferred candidate ahead of the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Brendan Rodgers, Erik ten Hag and Ralf Rangnick. ",positive

When the ball dropped to him at the edge of the box, he controlled it and with no options on, pulled off a filthy strike that left Petr Cech routed to the spot.   It was a ridiculous piece of technique. With no pace on the ball whatsoever, after a couple of fakes, he manages to find the corner courtesy of a toe-poke shot that blew our minds.

A 1-0 win in the first leg meant Chelsea only had to avoid defeat at the Camp Nou to reach only their second Champions League final. Loadingâ¦ Disaster struck when goals from Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta gave Barca a 2-0 lead on the night and 2-1 lead on aggregate while Blues captain John Terry was also sent off. On the stroke of half-time however, Ramires produced a moment of magic to swing the tie back ten-man Chelsea's favour. The Brazilian started the move in his own half by laying the ball off to Frank Lampard. Lampard then slid the ball through for Ramires, who had continued his lung-busting run into the box, for him to delicately chip over Victor Valdes. Roberto Di Matteo's side spent the second half camped in their own half as Barcelona relentlessly attacked. Fernando Torres managed to run through in the 92nd minute and score on the counter attack to make it 2-2 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate. Despite all the fanfare and yes, THAT Gary Neville noise, Chelsea had already sealed their spot in the final without Torres' goal. Many believe this is a disservice to Ramires, who produced a heroic performance across both legs.      Ramires was known for being an energetic presence in midfield which allowed Chelsea's attackers to strut their stuff without worry. But he could produce lovely skill himself and is one of the most underrated midfielders of his era. He'd stay at Chelsea for another four years, winning the Europa League and Premier League before joining Chinese outfit Jiangsu Suning. ",positive

Dalot, 22, was loaned out to AC Milan last season and enjoyed a successful spell at the San Siro. Loadingâ¦ United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer kept hold of the Portuguese right-back in the summer after failing to land Atletico Madrid star Kieran Trippier. Dalot, who is under United contract until 2023, made 33 appearances for Milan across all competitions and scored twice and picked up three assists. The Portugal international is playing second fiddle to Aaron Wan-Bissaka at United, but Mourinho is eager for a reunion with his fellow countryman. According to CalcioMercato, Mourinho still âreally likesâ the United right-back and feels like he could add value to his squad. Read More: The publication added that the Roma board are âstudying the strategyâ as they plot a potential loan move in January, with the option to buy Dalot in the deal. It is reported that Dalot would ârepresent more than an alternativeâ to Roma right-back Rick Karsdorp and has âcharacteristics that Mourinho is looking for.â Dalot, who was linked with Real Madrid in the summer, came off the bench for a brief cameo in Unitedâs 1-0 win over Wolves at the Molineux last month. The former Porto defenderâs only substantial playing time this season came in Unitedâs shock 2-1 defeat to Young Boys in the Champions League. Mourinho was responsible for bringing Dalot to Old Trafford in a Â£19m deal from Porto in 2018. The former United manager called Dalot an âextremely talented young defenderâ and the best young full-back in Europe at the time. Mourinho claimed that Dalot could be a mainstay at United for a decade after he impressed on his debut against Young Boys in 2018. Speaking after Unitedâs 3-0 Champions League win, the Special One said: âEveryone could see he's a 19-year-old player that has more than 10 years to play for Manchester United. âBut I also want to be nice to Luke Shaw because I think Diogo and Luke played very, very well and our danger came from both of them. âThey had fantastic movement, depth, crosses, assists, were involved in the most dangerous actions and they defended well.â ",positive

PUMA and City are reverting back to one of the club's most iconic colour combinations for the 2022/23 season. Loadingâ¦ City are of course renowned for sky blue home shirts but when it comes to away kits, there is a strong association with the colours red and black that dates back many years. And pictures posted online by Manchester Confidential on Twitter, taken from a shoot at Central Library in Manchester City centre show that City will be back wearing the classic colours. One of the new Manchester City kits confirmed! Caught shooting at Central Library â½ï¸ #ManCity pic.twitter.com/PUGqcFoHbm The last time City had red and black on an Umbro away kit was for the striped design in 2011/12, when they won their first league title for 44 years under Roberto Mancini. They also won the 1969 FA Cup final against Leicester City wearing red and black. This time around, the design has diagonal stripes, with the crest and PUMA and Etihad Airways logos in yellow. The sleeves are plain black, as is the collar, which is a v-neck design. There aren't too many details on the kit and more leaked images will almost definitely in the coming weeks heading into next season. But it does appear as though the strip will be a popular choice with City supporters, if social media reaction is anything to go by: Strong rumours for months that it would be diagonal stripes.

Reigning champions City beat Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park courtesy of a strike from Phil Foden in the 81st minute. But just minutes later Pep Guardiola's side appeared to get away with one as the ball bounced up against the hand of Rodri Hernandez inside the area. Loadingâ¦ There was a VAR check but referee Paul Tierney, without feeling he needed to go to the monitor, elected against awarding a penalty. In response, the Premier League said there was ""not clear enough evidence to show conclusively that it was handball"". Frank Lampard and Everton were seething with the call, but so too were Liverpool fans given they have closed the gap to City in recent weeks. Liverpool fan account @TheAnfieldAlert was clearly furious and shared a TikTok titled, ""How Man City are winning some of their games"". How are we even within 3 points of these cheatersâ¦ pic.twitter.com/aBnlRUOaZE The Rodri incident is the first clip in the video, before a similar handball from Joao Moutinho of Wolves that was penalised by VAR in December. Then there's two instances of City goalkeeper Ederson making contact with attackers but going unpunished, as well as City's penalty given for a foul from Granit Xhaka on Bernardo Silva in Arsenal's 2-1 loss in January. The video, which has accrued over 100,000 views on Twitter, finishes with fourth official Craig Pawson's bizarre reaction to Harry Kane's late winner at the Etihad Stadium. Asked about the Rodri penalty shout in his post-match interview on Saturday night, Lampard was brutally honest and said he has ""a three-year-old daughter at home who could tell you that was a penalty"". ""I wanted to know if offside in the build up but I have been told it wasnât in the build up. ""Go to VAR, they have two minutes to look at it and to think that Chris Kavanagh [VAR official for the game] has not given that as a penalty when it strikes him on the arm, in an unnatural position. I have a three-year-old daughter at home who could tell you that was a penalty. ""We are fighting at the bottom of the table and they are fighting at the top and an easy decision to give on a penalty. ""I don't know what has to happen as a reflection of that. A mistake is when you have done something wrong and donât have time to think about it, they had two minutes to digest the handball. ""Even if the VAR says not sure, then go have a look. It is incompetence at best, if not that then someone needs to explain what it is. ""It's a clear, clear handball."" City are six points clear at the top of the table after the narrow win.

The Manchester United striker and Rodriguez confirmed they were expecting twins back in October. However, Ronaldo posted a message of Instagram on Monday evening confirming their baby boy had passed away. He confirmed their baby girl had been safely delivered. Their statement reads: ""It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away. A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) ""It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel. Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. ""We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support.

United released a statement of support which reads: ""Your pain is our pain, @Cristiano. Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time."" Ronaldo's oldest son, Cristiano Jr, was born via surrogate in 2010 and he's currently in the United academy. He then became father to twins, daughter Eva and son Mateo, via surrogacy in 2017. Rodriguez gave birth to their daughter, Alana Martina, later that year. Ronaldo rejoined United from Juventus in the summer and Rodriguez moved to Manchester with their family. The couple first met during Ronaldo's time at Real Madrid and Rodriguez worked in a Gucci store. Ronaldo discussed that moment in a recent Netflix documentary and said: ""From that moment [when they passed each other outside the clothing company where she worked] it stuck in my head and it was a 'click' moment.""

Loadingâ¦ Previously Fernandes has been at the heart of everything good for United, since joining the team in January 2020 when they were struggling for form. His ability to hit the ground running in spectacular style meant that his new team qualified for the Champions League, when that goal had previously looked loss, and then last season he was integral again, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team finished second. However this season he has been accused of not living up to those standards and his new contract was even criticised by one pundit. Others have claimed he hasn't worked hard enough and that he spends lots of time moaning and complaining, however it looks like he does more than that. A compilation video of his best work this season shows he should have many more assists than the 12 he's provided, which is already more than anyone else in the squad, with the amount of chances he's created. Bruno Fernandes - THE Problem. pic.twitter.com/xI645qnNfS Of course, it's not as simple as just looking at that video and suggesting that the criticism is completely unfounded, but equally it's also not as simple to dismiss it. Like much of the narrative around United this season, it's too simple to claim one man is the problem at the club, as much as it is to deny they have nothing to do with it. Fernandes has also not been as good in front of goal this season as previously, and even missed a crucial penalty against Arsenal at the weekend. He has also lost the ball on multiple occasions in games, something that Ralf Rangnick's side have struggled to deal with considering the paucity of their midfield. The same arguments can be made of both Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea about how they have both positively and negatively impacted the team. Ronaldo's goals, especially at certain moments, have really saved the team this season but he has also been part of the problem, failing to find the goal against the likes of Wolves, Southampton, Watford and Everton in games United haven't won. His inability to press teams from the front also stopped Ralf Rangnick from picking the 37-year-old early in his tenure, before the German ditched his gegenpressing plan. Equally De Gea has been brilliant with his saves at the back but his lack of passing ability has meant the team can't as effectively build from the back. ",positive

Loadingâ¦ Hakan Calhanoglu scored the only goal of the game, a penalty at the end of the first half. Vlahovic led the line for Juve and had scored five goals in 11 games since joining the club from Fiorentina in a Â£66 million move, going into this game. But he couldn't find the net in this one and instead ended up hitting headlines courtesy of some horrendous play-acting. Danilo DâAmbrosio accidentally brushed Vlahovic's face with his hand and apologised to the No.7 for catching him. La storia della Juventus in un video: pic.twitter.com/gnRPdKkLFe There was a delay from the Serbian striker and he the decided to throw himself to the turf holding his face.

The loss in the FA Cup to Cambridge United further shone a light on how much Eddie Howe's team have to do to stay away from the Championship. Ahead of the loss to the Us, Newcastle added Kieran Trippier to their team and they've now signed Chris Wood to the squad, which also serves as a blow to relegation rivals Burnley. Now the north east side have reportedly been offered the chance to take Manchester United's struggling Donny van de Beek on loan for the rest of the season, according to the Manchester Evening News. Van de Beek has not been able to work his way into the first team at Old Trafford under either Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Ralf Rangnick, since joining the club in September 2020. The 24-year-old has still astonishingly only started four Premier League games since he moved to United from Ajax, despite the team's struggles in recent months. His lack of game time has seen him drop out of Louis van Gaal's thoughts for the Netherlands national team, with the World Cup taking place at the end of this year. Van de Beek was linked with a move away from the club last summer, but it failed to materialise, and he would have hoped to get more time to prove himself. However that hasn't happened and, as well as being offered to Newcastle, the report claims that Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund have also been given the chance to sign him. The offers are likely to have come from the midfielder's agent as, despite his lack of gametime, it's unlikely Rangnick would want to see him leave this January. United's interim boss has few midfield options and any return of a Covid outbreak at the club could leave them without back up if Van de Beek left.

The best stoppers possess a range of different qualities, including toughness, leadership, anticipation and, when necessary, intimidation. The players on the list below have faced all-comers in the worldâs most competitive league and emerged on the other side. Here we pick our top 10 Premier League defenders of all time. We've used a number of stats from last season to quantify our rankings, as well as a player's overall contribution to the game in history. So who makes it into our top 10? All stats come from premierleague.com and are correct as of the publish date. More articles in this series: Premier League clubs: Manchester United Manchester Unitedâs Nemanja Vidic won Premier League titles in five of his nine seasons in England, but that was by no means a foregone conclusion when he arrived at Old Trafford in 2005 from Spartak Moscow. âHe was skinny and relatively easy to push off the ball,â said former teammate Paul Scholes. âHe took a battering in his first few weeks at the club â in training as well as matches. He turned himself into a big, strong centre-half who was capable of knocking strikers out of the way. He always had a great ability to head the ball but allied with his strength he became unbeatable in the air.â Premier League clubs: Arsenal Lee Dixon was part of a back four that excelled when managed by George Graham and as part of Arsene Wengerâs Premier League revolution. In 10 seasons with Lee Dixon on the right of defence, the Gunners conceded more than 38 goals only twice. During the 1998/99 season, Dixon, Tony Adams Martin Keown, Nigel Winterburn, and David Seaman between the posts, let in a record-low 17 goals. That mark has only been surpassed once since, by Jose Mourinhoâs Chelsea in 2004/05 (15 goals). Premier League clubs: Manchester United Right-back Gary Neville kept 148 clean sheets during his Premier League career, winning eight Premiership titles. âGary was the best English right-back of his generation,â said his former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. âHe is an example to any young professional; hard-working, loyal and intelligent.â According to opposing striker and England teammate, Alan Shearer: âHe didnât mind getting forward but he enjoyed defending and was very good at it. He was a very good defender and an organiser.â Premier League clubs: Manchester City A colossal influence and leader during his career at Manchester City, which yielded four Premier League titles under three managers, Vincent Kompany is among the finest investments the Sky Blues have made. Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards, who played alongside the Belgian for seven seasons, calls Kompany âone of Cityâs best ever defendersâ. Premier League clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea The sixth-highest capped England player, Ashley Cole (107) ended his career one behind England legend Bobby Moore and one ahead of England legend Bobby Charlton but also won Premier League titles with two teams. Said Frank Lampard, his international and club teammate at Chelsea: âTwo games stick out for me: one was against Ronaldo for England â Ash didnât give him a kick â and against Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League when we got to the final. In the first leg particularly, no-one could get past Ash.â Premier League clubs: Southampton, Liverpool The rock upon which Liverpoolâs resurgence was built, after Virgil van Dijkâs arrival, the Reds reached consecutive Champions League finals, winning one, and lifted their first top-division title for 30 years. Former Anfield defender and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said: âI think van Dijk has got the potential to go down alongside Alan Hansen if youâre talking about Liverpoolâs best ever teams, thatâs how big a difference that player has made.â Premier League clubs: Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Portsmouth, Newcastle United Six feet and two inches of solid granite, Sol Campbell was a brick wall for four Premier League clubs and England. ""Sol had an absolute physical presence,â said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger of the player who was part of the Frenchmanâs 2003/04 Invincibles. âHe is monstrous."" Campbell captained his country three times and played in more Premiership matches than all defenders but Jamie Carragher (508) and Rio Ferdinand (504). Premier League clubs: Arsenal âIf a young Tony Adams were to come on the scene now, any club in the Premier League would be happy to pay tens of millions for him,â said the late Jimmy Greaves, a few years ago, of the long-time Arsenal captain. âAdams was the best purely defensive defender England have ever produced â an absolute rock for the Gunners and the only player to captain a title-winning team across three different decades.â Premier League clubs: West Ham United, Leeds United, Manchester United, Queens Park Rangers A much-loved servant of club (wherever he played) and country, Rio Ferdinand has appeared in more Premier League games than any defender other than Jamie Carragher and more England matches than Stuart Pearce, John Terry and Terry Butcher. The winner of six Premier League titles with Manchester United was, according to his Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson âthe best defender in the country if not Europe for a couple of years. His maturity and leadership have been key factors in the teamâs successâ. Premier League clubs: Chelsea With five Premier League titles to his name and 34 of his 78 England caps as captain, John Terry ranks as one of the great defenders of his generation. Named to the UEFA Team of the Year on four occasions, he draws comparisons to the very best from one of the very best: âThe toughest opponents for me are the defenders who are tough in the way they play, where you canât see a way through,â said Brazil great Ronaldinho. âPaolo Maldini and John Terry are two of the toughest men I have met on the field.â ",positive

As soon as Pogba was substituted for Jesse Lingard, Gary Neville, on co-commentary, said, ""That could be Paul Pogba's last minutes in a Manchester United shirt, if that injury lasts for a few weeks."" It was recently reported that Pogba is extremely unlikely to put pen to paper on a new deal. The treatment he received from his own fans in the 3-2 win of Norwich, where he was jeered by sections of the United faithful at Old Trafford, is said to be the final straw for Pogba. As well as the booing when he was taken off, the World Cup winner was also subjected to chants of ""f*** off"" from United supporters. He responded by cupping his ears to them at full-time as he headed back down the tunnel in what looks to be his final gesture at the Theatre of Dreams. Pogba has played 229 times and scoring 39 goals for United in his second spell following on from his Â£89 million switch from Juventus in 2016. He won the Carabao Cup and Europa League in his first season. ",negative

Loadingâ¦ Spanish publication El Confidencial have leaked the audio of conversations Perez has had during his tenure with 'Los Blancos'. The latest leak has Perez going in on Michel, who spent 14 years at the Santiago Bernabeu. He was Real Madrid B manager for a year in the mid-2000's and has been accused of forcing Mata out. Perez vented per the Mirror: ""I think Michel is the one who made the hole for Mata [to leave], he is the one who threw him out of Real Madrid Castilla to put his son in the team. ""He is a fraud!"" A tape from three years prior also sees Perez unload on Michel by claiming: ""He is a very bad coach, a guy who has done nothing. He is not a coach."" Mata left Madrid and signed for Valencia, establishing himself as a Spain international and being part of their World Cup winning squad in 2010. He signed for Chelsea in 2011 and helped the club win their first Champions League title a year later, while also winning Euro 2012 with Spain. A Europa League triumph followed in 2013 before joining Manchester United as their then-record signing in 2014. Seven years at Old Trafford has seen Mata win the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League. Perez hasn't limited his criticisms to just one Real Madrid legend. The 74-year-old went on the offensive with Cristiano Ronaldo and even called the five-time Ballon d'Or winner a 'sick man.' ""He's crazy,"" Perez was quoted saying about Ronaldo. ""This guy is an idiot, a sick man. You think this guy is normal, but he's not normal, otherwise, he wouldn't do all the things he does."" Perez hit back with a statement which read: ""Given the news broadcast in El Confidencial, in which phrases attributed to me are reported, I think it is necessary to clarify. ""The reproduced phrases are pronounced in conversations clandestinely recorded by Mr. Jose Antonio Abellan, who has been trying to sell them for many years without success. ""It is surprising now that, despite the time that has elapsed, the newspaper El Confidencial reports them today. ""They are single phrases of conversations taken from the broad context in which they occur. ""For them to be reproduced now, after so many years have passed since those conversations took place, is I understand due to my participation as one of the promoters of the Super League.

Even when he's reached the top of the mountain, the 59-year-old can't help himself and will gladly throw shade until the cows come home. One evening back in 2015, after Chelsea had won the Premier League and Carabao Cup, he unleashed a verbal assault so captivating, so entertaining, it had the entire audience laughing along. JosÃ© Mourinho roasting Man City, Liverpool, Man United and Arsenal after Chelsea were crowned Premier League Champions back in 2015.This is pure shithouseryðððpic.twitter.com/v07wMYXo86 Mourinho took to the stage with mic in hand and said: ""I want you to remember that one year ago we were here, we finished third and we were not happy. We respect the winners. In spite of us beating them [Manchester City] twice, we thought they deserved to be champions. In spite of beating second position [Liverpool] twice, we told them they deserved to be there."" He then decided to tell a few 'fiction' stories about the way teams played football. It's quite obvious who he's discussing, but stresses it's all 'fiction'. Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side are brought up for the way they passed the ball without much conviction. Mourinho joked they played football 'without nets' and were happy to go among themselves. pic.twitter.com/Nil8Rzx41g Next up was Manchester City and he joked they played with 'one net', talking about how they only scored goals rather than focusing on defending too. Mourinho couldn't enjoy a diss session without going for bitter rival Arsene Wenger and his Arsenal side. Similar to United, the Gunners enjoyed playing with the ball on the deck but Mourinho didn't see it as winning football. Then came the kicker. ""They asked the international board to only play between January and April."" pic.twitter.com/g5PAuhRz9R Arsenal were eighth heading into December and it took an almighty effort to recover their form, going on an eight-game winning run between February and April. It was obvious who Mourinho was mocking here. The ultimate finale was 'The Special One' discussing his very own team. That summer had seen Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa arrive to completely transform the Blues. ""They play from August to May and sometimes... they brought the bus!"" Mourinho ended his speech by telling his players the following season would be much more difficult with their opponents improving. It wasn't an understatement and something went dramatically wrong, with Mourinho sacked in December and Chelsea 16th in the table. Mourinho's second and up to now final spell at Stamford Bridge ended in disaster, but his one last hurrah could've been the greatest of all. ",positive

United recently handed Bruno Fernandes a new four-year deal worth Â£15m-a-year a week but are set to recoup some of that cost by clearing out their squad at the end of the season. Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are all expected to leave Old Trafford this summer when their respective contracts come to an end. Loadingâ¦ According to The Athletic, the four players command a collective weekly wage of Â£750,000, with Pogba accounting for the bulk of that figure. Pogba, 29, cost United a then world record Â£89.3m fee when he rejoined the club from Juventus in 2016. However, after a largely underwhelming second spell at Old Trafford, Pogba is now set to leave on a free transfer. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus have all been linked with the France international, who is yet to make a final decision over his future. Cavani, 35, is also expected to depart the club after struggling with injuries during his second season with the Red Devils. Cavani joined United on a free transfer in 2020 and impressed in his debut season at the club, scoring 17 goals in all competitions. But the Uruguay international has been restricted to just six league starts this term and is now set to leave the club, with a return to South America viewed as one potential destination for the striker. Mata, 33, is one of Unitedâs longest-serving players but will be allowed to leave this summer after making just five appearances this season. Meanwhile, Lingard, 29, is also expected to leave the club after finding his first-team opportunities limited following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. Lingard was strongly linked with a move to Newcastle in the January transfer window before talks broke down over a potential loan deal until the end of the season. West Ham were also linked with a move for Lingard, who scored nine goals in 16 games in a hugely successful loan spell at the London Stadium last season. Loadingâ¦ ",positive

Anthony Elanga opened the scoring for the Red Devils in the first half at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Loadingâ¦ However, Brentford bounced back only minutes later as Shandon Baptiste pulled back an equaliser. Pereira, who spent last season out on loan in Serie A with Lazio, sent United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a clear message with his time on the pitch against Brentford. Jesse Lingard fired a shot from outside of the box directly at David Raya, who managed to parry his effort away. Ethan Pinnock then headed the ball out of the Brentford box, only for it to fall directly into the path of Pereira. Pereira took the shot first time and fired a rocket of a volley into the back of the Brentford net, with Raya standing little chance of stopping the Scholes-esque strike. Unsurprisingly, the 25-year-old Brazilian midfielder's screamer has evoked memories from United fans of Scholes' sensational volley against Aston Villa in 2006. ""Every pre-season Andreas Pereira turns into prime Scholes! That was something special,"" one fan tweeted. Someone else wrote: ""Andreas Pereira channelling his inner Paul Scholes."" A third said: ""Andreas Pereira remembered that it's pre-season so decided to turn into Paul Scholes again. Hell of a strike."" And a fourth added: ""Can't believe I've just witnessed Andreas Pereira score the type of screamer we'd expect from the likes of [Wayne] Rooney or Scholes."" Despite Pereira's wonderful strike restoring United's lead, Brentford once again pulled level late in the second half thanks to Bryan Mbeumo. United, who suffered a 4-2 defeat to Queens Park Rangers on Saturday, were held to a 2-2 draw against Brentford at Old Trafford.

The 25-year-old midfielder, who is currently on a season-long loan at Brazilian side Flamengo after struggling to find first-team minutes at Old Trafford, has had somewhat of a resurgence in his native country. So far, the United academy graduate has scored three goals for his new club, including a magnificent 30-yard free-kick in their Serie A clash against Juventude last night. You can check out that ridiculous finish below. Here is another angle of his effort. Magnificent. Pereira, who has previously spent three seasons away from United during loan spells at Granada, Valencia and Lazio, is certainly making an impression in Brazil as Flamengo try and close the 11 point gap at the top of Serie A. The Rio de Janeiro club lifted the league trophy in 2019 and 2020 and, with the help of Manchester United's loanee, they are bidding to win a second Copa Libertadores title in three years against Palmeiras next month. If he carries on scoring goals like this, then Flamengo will have a great chance of making history this season. Those involved in the Brazilian are certainly impressed by Pereira's impact since arriving from Old Trafford in the summer. ""He plays more or less like Gerson, but he is much faster. He's also more dynamic than Gerson was,"" Flamengo legend Junior told Globo. ""He fights very hard, he comes from a school of play, the English game, in which you need to battle, and that might have been what was missing in this Flamengo team."" Pereira has, of course, shown glimpses of his talent in the famous red.

Loadingâ¦ It caps a remarkable turnaround for the 25-year-old, who looked to be under threat following the summer arrival of Alex Telles. @UtdArena on Twitter has taken a deep dive into what makes Shaw one of the Premier League's top defenders. The thread is titled ""Luke Shaw: Excellence,"" and focuses on his contributions while attacking down the left-hand side. You can check it out in full here.   His current season (bottom right) - I've added post-lockdown to increase the sample - is emphatic in terms of how offensively-minded he has become. This is the same Luke we saw half a decade ago (~2015) except he's significantly better now as a total package. pic.twitter.com/JReGwFfK4J  Shaw's attacking output is something he struggled with under previous managers, including Jose Mourinho who one said the England international was ""playing with his brain."" Getting further up the pitch allows Shaw to get more crosses into the box, whether that be a looping ball over or his much preferred cutbacks. Here, I clustered four of his most common on-ball actions. This is mightily impressive as splitting zones and beating the last line are effectively midfielder-based actions whilst his crosses match up to top full backs.This highlights how offensively dynamic he's become. pic.twitter.com/SG4mYNdo8n  This, again, is all good but the question now becomes: ""Is he truly more proactive and progressive or is it just that he's proactive at times and the above are just those specific times?""Well... pic.twitter.com/muEFLcdDyO  Marcus Rashford is United's regular left winger and he shares a relationship with Shaw that allows for more efficiency when making overlapping and underlapping runs. Overlapping:Despite his underlaps being more predominant, he's also developed a recent overlap this season which he's added to the list. These are things he didn't do much of before. Here, he makes a ~40m run right to the byline and was able to beat his man with the cross. pic.twitter.com/RBau9Ipz4H  High Combinations:Yes, they actually have this combination higher up, too! This one occurred in the same game less than 30 minutes later. He plays the ball off to Rashy and then underlaps him to receive it back in a high-value zone. He's starting to do this much more now. pic.twitter.com/U23dhaTENo Luke's Premier League (20/21) rank (full backs):1st - expected assists1st - shot assists (a.k.a.

Former United defender Denis Irwin recently claimed Shaw is the best full-back in the Premier League. When asked,the Red Devils legend replied: ""Absolutely. ""Alex Telles coming in has probably pushed him and he's been really top class in the last couple of months. ""His overlapping is there to see, his defending is there to see. It's good that he's got competition. He had Brandon Williams last year, and raised his game, and he's got Alex Telles this year and that has helped him to raise his game.

'Our Relationship Wasnât The Best',"In an exclusive interview with SPORTbible, Manchester United full-back Luke Shaw has admitted that his ""mixed relationship"" with former manager Jose Mourinho ""wasn't the best"" over a two-year spell at Old Trafford. The 25-year-old England international was publicly singled out on a number of occasions by a ruthless Mourinho. For example, back in 2017, after omitting him from the Manchester United squad to face West Brom, Mourinho questioned Shaw's professionalism and attitude. ""I cannot compare the way he trains [with other contenders for the position], the way he commits, the focus, the ambition. He is a long way behind."" Then two days later, after a clash against Everton, Mourinho took another dig at Shaw by saying he had to change his football brain. ""He had a good performance but it was his body with my brain,"" he said. ""He was in front of me and I was making every decision for him."" Those underhanded comments continued throughout his spell as Manchester United manager, and rumours swirled in every transfer window as to whether the left-back would remain at Old Trafford. But the former Southampton man has proved his doubters wrong since. A revitalised Shaw, who recently lifted the club's Players' Player of the Year award, enjoyed arguably his best season to date during the 2020/21 campaign under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - a manager he has credited as being the primary reason behind his form. So looking back, how does Shaw assess his relationship with Jose Mourinho? ""It was a mixed relationship,"" he tells SPORTbible. ""A lot of the things that happened between us two, sometimes he went about it in the right way. I think a lot of people will agree with that at the club. ""Our relationship wasn't the best. It was probably quite easy to see that from the outside. But one thing Jose did do was make me mentally much stronger. I think mental strength is what I would describe that period under Jose Mourinho. ""I think I felt part of the team under Ole, whereas under Jose sometimes I didn't. Ole showed his belief and confidence in me. I always believed good times were coming. I stuck in and dug deep; went through a lot but come out better on the other side."" As a result of his impressive form for Manchester United, the left-back was included in Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad for the European Championship. He has thanked the England boss for showing faith in him when times were tough. ""One of my main goals was to get back in the England fold,"" Shaw added. ""I really loved it and wanted to be a part of it. I kept my head down and worked hard and let my football do the talking. ""At the club under Jose, things weren't going well and mentally things weren't going well. I was struggling to get game time, picking up niggly injuries and at the times when I was getting called up and Gareth was showing faith in me, sometimes I pulled out of camps. ""When I think back, I have massive regrets and have thought about it a lot. It is in the past now and I'm focused on showing Gareth the person I am now and what I can bring to his team."" Shaw did not feature in England's European Championship opener against Croatia on Sunday afternoon, with Gareth Southgate instead opting for Kieran Trippier at left-back. But he will be expecting to make an impact in the coming weeks as the Three Lions try and reach the latter stages of the competition.

Mourinho managed Shaw at Manchester United for two and a half seasons and the pair had a frosty relationship. Despite being impressed with the Three Lions performance as a whole, Mourinho wasn't thrilled with their quality from set-pieces. He told talkSPORT per TEAMtalk: ""The negative thing I would say is once more they were very poor on attacking corners. ""The service was dramatically bad. They have so many good players to attack corners. The crosses are not passing the first man. ""Luke Shaw, in my opinion, very good tonight but very poor on the corner. [Kalvin] Phillips, the same. ""England has great power at this level and going to knockouts, one corner can decide a game."" Mourinho thinks England are in a strong position, with players such as Harry Maguire and Jordan Henderson to return to full fitness. ""I keep saying when you have an option to take 26 players, you have to risk, gamble and take an injured player if the player deserves that. Maguire is one of those players,"" Mourinho continued. ""He was confident, he was stable, he was intelligent, read the game well, and has a good partnership with [John] Stones. ""[Tyrone] Mings is doing a fantastic job, you could feel he was happy to come in for 10 or 15 minutes, he is a team player. ""I wouldn't be surprised if the next game is against Germany, the way they play with three at the back - I wouldn't be surprised if England went with Stones, Maguire and Mings at the back."" Gareth Southgate's side have qualified without conceding a single goal in three games, but some fans are concerned by the lack of attacking threat. Mourinho has countered that by complimenting the 'very good' mentality in their camp. ""It looks good, the players are in good form, [Jadon] Sancho was ready for every second he was on the pitch. The mentality inside is very good,"" the 58-year-old continued. ""Today they showed two different versions. Great mobility in attack and great creativity. Second half they were a team of position, great positional play and control, you need that in the knockout stage. ""People are not over the moon because people are always asking for more and different kind of football, but inside the camp - they will be happy. They will feel they did the job well and they're ready. ""The next one is the one because it will be against a top team. Yes, an advantage because of Wembley, but pressure because it will be a big opponent. ""If they go to the quarter-finals, this match could be the one which pushes them all the way."" ",positive

""I don't really understand it, to be honest,"" he said via The Guardian. ""I don't know why he is still going on and wanting to point at me. I don't feel like the set-pieces were as bad as he was saying. ""I might have done one in the second half, a corner, that didn't get over the first man. But that was one out of three. The other two or three, I don't think, were as 'dramatically bad' as he says. ""Look, he has got to do his job. He has got his opinion. I am used to him saying negative stuff about me now, so I just pass it by. I leave it be, I ignore it. I just focus on what the coaching staff say here, what Gareth says and that's that, really. ""His voice is obviously very big. He likes to talk a lot about me, as everyone has seen recently. But his voice is his own. He can say what he wants. ""I will focus on myself. I take set-pieces at United, so it wasn't as if it was something I wasn't ready for."" Shaw did label Mourinho a ""brilliant manager"" during the interview but admitted to finding it ""quite strange"" that he continues to talk about him. ""There is no hiding that we didn't get on,"" he added. ""I think he was a brilliant manager but, you know, the past is the past. It is time to move on. I am trying to move on but, obviously, he can't. ""He continuously talks about me, which I find quite strange. Even some of the lads have said 'what's his problem?' and 'why does he keep talking?' ""He just needs to move on. Hopefully, he can find his peace with that and finally move on and stop worrying about me. Clearly, I am in his head a lot and he clearly thinks about me a lot."" The left-back was then asked if he can laugh off the criticism. ""Yes, because I don't think any of you realise the two or three years I had with him and how bad it was then, what it was like then,"" he said. ""What he says now is nothing compared to how it used to be. I am being totally honest. I am so past it now. I have grown up a lot. ""The three years I had with him, I learnt a lot.

Loadingâ¦ Shaw would not have been in the England squad for the Euros had the tournament taken place like summer but his form for Manchester United meant that he had to be in the squad. The left back has become Gareth Southgate's first choice player in the role, after Kieran Trippier started the first game, and he was involved in both goals. On Saturday night the 25-year-old was integral once again as Gareth Southgate's team made it to the semi-final, with a 4-0 win over Ukraine. Shaw first set up club teammate Harry Maguire in the first minute of the second half, swinging in a free kick which the centre back headed home. Next up was another cross from the left, this time from open play, which Harry Kane nodded home, to make it 3-0. England's best work came down the left and Shaw was also part of yet another solid defensively display for the Three Lions, as they kept their fifth clean sheet in-a-row at the Euros, and his personal highlights video shows how good he was. The full back's performances in the past two games actually means he's over taken Zinedine Zidane in number of assists at Euros. He actually needed just 3 minutes and 51 seconds of the game to have more than the 1998 World Cup winner had in 14 games. Asked about it after the game, the United defender said, ""A really weird statistic, you can't compare me to him. He's one of the greatest footballers."" Shaw's form for United in the past season earned him the Player's Player of the Year award, as voted by for his colleagues, and it was tough to argue with. It's a complete turnaround from the form he showed whilst the team was managed by Jose Mourinho, who seemed to target the former Southampton full back. Mourinho once again criticised his former defender ahead of the Germany game, hitting out specifically at Shaw's set pieces. Answering a question about the criticism, Shaw said, ""I don't know why he is still going on and wanting to point at me. I don't feel like the set-pieces were as bad as he was saying.""

Thomas Muller opened the scoring in the 83rd minute at the Allianz Arena and Drogba admitted that he was ""so discouraged.""

Drogba tweeted: ""Three months later, we were in Munich, in the final, in their stadium, submerged with a red wave. ""The hosts took the lead with 8 minutes to go and on my way to kick the ball for the last 8 minutes I was so discouraged, the young man said to me 'believe Didi, you have to believe', almost in tears I answered after looking at the time score 'believe in what?

The best Premier League player... I mean, I used to love to play with, and against, Eden Hazard,"" Mata told ManUtd.com. ""For me, for many years, he was the best in the league. He could win games by himself. I used to train with him and I know how good he can be.

Hazard left Chelsea to join 'Los Blancos' for â¬100 million last summer but his time in the Spanish capital has been ravaged by injuries. The 29-year-old has admitted himself that it's been a 'bad' season but he's keen to make his mark in La Liga. He's also recently discussed his struggles with keeping up to speed with his quarantine diet plan. ""It's complicated for me,"" Hazard told RTBF, via Marca. ""I'm trying not to eat a lot.

Chelsea signed Mata from Valencia for a reported fee of Â£23.5m in 2011, with the Spaniard winning both the Champions League and FA Cup in his debut season. Loadingâ¦ Roberto Di Matteo had replaced Andre Villas-Boas as Chelsea manager in the 2011-12 season and deployed Mata as an attacking midfielder rather than a winger. Mata delivered a phenomenal return for Chelsea in the 2012-13 season, with the former Blues star turning his performances up a notch. The 33-year-old attacking midfielder made 64 appearances for Chelsea in the aforementioned campaign and scored an impressive 19 times alongside his incredible assist tally of 35. Chelsea finished the season in third place in the Premier League and secured the Europa League title, but it was far from smooth sailing for the Blues. Read More: Di Matteo was initially appointed as a caretaker manager in 2012 before becoming the permanent Chelsea head coach ahead of the 2012-13 season. However, the former Chelsea manager was unable to build on his FA Cup and Champions League triumphs and was axed in November 2012. Rafa Benitez was brought in as interim manager and steered the club until the end of the season, but a prime Mata remains a standout memory for Chelsea fans.

Loadingâ¦ Saka scored his second penalty in a few days on Saturday, when he scored against United, after Alex Telles had fouled the English forward in the box. The 20-year-old had scored from the 12 yard spot just days before, as the Gunners earned a surprise win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Those two goals suggested that there was no hangover for Saka from his penalty miss in the final of Euro 2020 last summer, and there was further proof of his mental strength before his goal against United. Previously unseen footage ahead of the spot kick showed McTominay trying to play mind games with his opponent by knocking the ball out of his hands before taking it, but it obviously didn't work at all. I really wish Saka done a knee slide right in front of Mctominay after scoring his pen pic.twitter.com/vs3nctvLX4 Saka doesnât even look at him.

Comical defending allowed Nuno Tavares to score after just three minutes, and it looked like Eddie Nketiah had doubled the lead just past the half hour mark. That goal was ruled out for offside but VAR then picked up on the foul by Telles on Saka, which led to the forward scoring his penalty. Cristiano Ronaldo's goal two minutes later got United back in the game and when Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take a penalty in the second half it looked like the game would be level.

Loadingâ¦ McTominay is a fixture in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's midfield, usually playing alongside Fred, and has had a good season, most notably for his brace against Leeds United last December. However the Scotland international was recently criticised by Keane, along with his partner, for their performance in the 4-2 loss to Liverpool, with the former club captain claiming the team wouldn't win silverware with the pair in midfield. The 24-year-old though seems unfazed by the comments, even with them coming from an Old Trafford legend. ""What did he say?"" the midfielder asked, via the Mirror, whilst looking ahead to the Europa League final on Wednesday. ""I didn't see it, but it doesn't Â­matter. People talk. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and you have to respect that. ""But I'm not going to spit my dummy out and cry over Â­something Roy Keane says. ""If that's what he thinks, then that's what he thinks. ""For me, it isn't a drama. I'd be a fool if I went home worrying about what people think about me."" Whilst Keane isn't too keen on the midfielder, Sir Alex Ferguson recently referred to McTominay as the 'latest great Scot in a long line' at the club, talking about his nationality rather than his name. The player is very touched by that, but won't let praise affect him anymore than he lets criticism, ""Just to hear a man like Sir Alex mention your name is a privilege, never mind when he's saying nice things about you,"" he said. ""But I can never think to myself, 'I've got his approval, he thinks I'm a good player'. I can't ever be satisfied, even if I've got Ole's Â­approval, because it's always about driving myself further to become a better player. ""I don't want to feel settled. If I do that then I won't push myself to the limits that I've got. ""I know where I'm at. And I know that I have got a lot more left in the tank to push myself more."" ",positive

The midfielder was clearly on the defensive in this awkward exchange of words, as McTominay was quizzed about Ralf Rangnick's desire for his players to supposedly be 'braver' on the ball. He asked: ""After the Palace game, he [Rangnick] said that if he had one criticism of you and Fred, it would be that there were too many square passes."" McTominay replied: ""He said 'one' not 'too many'."" The reporter, clearly taken aback by McTominay's response, then said: ""One from him, one from you, too many as a team. On that, is he asking you to be a bit braver on the ball? Is that the message he's trying to get out of you two as a pair? McTominay then added: ""Well, pretty much every team in the Premier League presses the middle of the pitch with the biggest intensity. You look at Liverpool, they close the middle of the pitch because they don't want you to play in the middle."" The 25-year-old's stone-faced expression made the dialogue even more uncomfortable to watch, but a number of fans were quick to criticise the Scotland international for his salty answers.    One said: ""The sideways passing merchant is rattled,"" while another added: Look at how defensive he's getting, you can tell he don't take criticism well. Finished player."" It would be fair to say that the Scotland international did not come out well from the interview, and many fans expressed the belief that he is not good enough to don the famous red shirt.

Goal claims that the European champions are interested in the 20-year-old, who has impressed since joining Leicester from St-Etienne in 2020. A number of Chelsea defenders are out of contract at the end of the season, including centre-backs Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Thiago Silva. Rudiger and Christensen have both stalled on signing new deals at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea are now identifying potential replacements should they leave the club. Fofana is currently out injured after suffering a broken leg in a pre-season friendly against Villarreal. Chelsea are therefore not expected to make a move in the January transfer window and will instead weigh-up a summer bid for the French defender.

Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all been linked with Rudiger, who is thought to be on a Â£100,000-a-week contract at Stamford Bridge.

Since Thomas Tuchelâs arrival at Stamford Bridge, Rudiger has been given a new lease of life - affirming himself as one of the best defenders in world football right now. On the face of it, the German has no reason to leave the club, but with his contract due to expire next summer, the 28-year-old is well within his rights to consider his options. Interestingly, according to a report by Todo Fichajes, Rudiger has done exactly that, coming to the decision to take the next step in his career. The report claims that Chelsea tabled a contract offer for Rudiger to consider, but has since rejected it - stating his intentions to move on from west London. Earlier this week, the defensive stalwart hilariously called out EA Sports for his ridiculously low pace rating in FIFA 22. Thestar has an overall rating of 83, boasting an 84-rated physical and defence statistics, but EA have given him a pace of 75 in the latest instalment - despite Rudiger showcasing his electric pace already this season.

As was reported by theGuardianat the end of last month, Chelsea attempted to get the Frenchmen through the door over the summer, but failed in their pursuit.

Loadingâ¦ Rudiger's contract expires at the end of the season and it had long been expected the German would leave the club, considering he hadn't accepted any new contracts. Thomas Tuchel confirmed the news that Rudiger would be leaving, after the Blues win over West Ham on Sunday, and on Monday it was claimed that it will be to join Real Madrid. Tuchel could end up being in the market for three defenders this summer as the threat looms large over the squad that Andreas Christiansen and Cesar Azpilicueta could also leave. The pair have strongly been linked with moves to Barcelona, and Christiansen in particular isn't expected to sign a new deal at Stamford Bridge. With the trio departing the club it would be helpful if they had some defenders to replace them, but the European champions also sold three good defenders last summer. Fikayo Tomori, Marc Guehi and Kurt Zouma were all allowed to leave Chelsea in the transfer window, and it now looks like a poor decision in hindsight. In the space of one year.No defence. pic.twitter.com/LmwWmK3AGw Any fans of the west London club hoping that it will be easy to get Tomori and Guehi back are sadly mistaken with the pair not having buy back clauses in their transfers. Tomori was on loan at AC Milan this time last season and the Italian club made it a permanent deal in the summer, signing him for around Â£25 million. The centre back and his teammates are in a battle with rivals Inter Milan for the Serie A title and there has been lots of calls for him to be included in Gareth Southgate's England side. Guehi has already had that honour, after being called up for the first time last month, after impressing with Crystal Palace in his first season in the Premier League. After playing well on loan for Championship Swansea in the previous campaign, Palace paid Â£18 million for the 21-year-old and Chelsea only have a first refusal on the player, not a buy back amount. Zouma may have had negative headlines, following his reported abuse of his cat, but the Frenchman has impressed no end for West Ham United. The club could yet make the Champions League next season, even though their defeat to Chelsea all but ended their top four aspirations, as they remain in the Europa League. On top of those three, the Blues also sold Tino Livramento to Southampton last summer, having never featured for the Blues first team, although the right back does have a buy back clause. Any of the three centre backs would have made excellent replacements for the potentially three departing defenders in the team's usual back three. Instead whoever the new owners are will have to fork out big money and hope the incoming players can adapt to Tuchel's way of playing and the Premier League. ",positive

In comparison, Ronaldo managed to reach 2.54m (roughly 8.3 feet) to score vs Sampdoria back in 2019.  Tomori has become the first Englishman to score for Milan since David Beckham over a decade ago and he's enjoying himself in Italy. Despite being used regularly by Frank Lampard last season, the 23-year-old fell down the pecking order after Thiago Silva's arrival in the summer. Limited game time saw him jump to the Rossoneri, for who he has made 14 Serie A appearances. A clause in his loan deal means the Italian outfit can sign him for around Â£23 million this summer, with manager Stefano Pioli keen. He told reporters per Daily Mail: ""We want to buy Tomori on a permanent deal from Chelsea. Our intention is clear and also Fikayo's decision (staying at Milan). ""We'll see what happens at the end of the season."" Meanwhile, legendary defender Franco Baresi said back in March: ""We will do everything possible to sign him on a permanent deal.

How does a young centre-back look making his debut with gloves? ""For sure he's not going to scare the striker."" Despite seeming harsh, Ibrahimovic's instructions seem to have worked. Milan kept a clean sheet and went on to win the game 1-0. Kalulu has since made seven more appearances for the Rossoneri, who are currently top of Serie A. Ibrahimovic is key player in the club's revival and has scored 10 goals this campaign, while only playing seven games. The 39-year-old continued: ""I'll decide my future at the end of the season with AC Milan. As long as I feel good on the pitch, I keep playing."" Milan advanced to the Coppa Italia quarter-finals on Tuesday evening after defeating Torino 5-4 on penalties. Ironically, Kalulu was named man of the match by Milan's official website. Manager Stefano Pioli told Rai Sport: ""I can only be satisfied with the performance of the boys. It was the fourth game in 9 days and there was no lack of spirit and intensity. ""It is a pity we did not win the game in the 90 minutes. We still showed quality because even scoring 5 penalties is not random. Milan signed 20-year-old RB Pierre Kalulu from Lyon B on a free transfer last summer. Kalulu has since been extremely impressing at both RB and CB. That move really sums up Milan's new management; might not sign the biggest names, but the recruitments are very intelligent. ""We believe in our qualities. We always think positively during matches. Staying in the game means being focused and believing in our abilities. This is proving us right because the matches are difficult and complicated. ""Our youth sector has quality and it must be like this because we are Milan. It is a sector of perspective. It is good that when there is the possibility our young people will be ready.""

Reports have claimed the Sweden international may have been called a 'gypsy', the same insult used when the two sides met back in October.

As an organization, we continue to do everything we can to change the behaviour of some fans in a positive way.""

Junior Messias doubled Milan's lead less than 10 minutes later after turning home a Giroud shot which bounced back off the post. Abraham did give Roma hope just before half-time after a clever finish, which caught out Mike Maignan.

The two strikers, teammates at Manchester United, had a heated on-pitch confrontation when Inter Milan took on AC Milan in January, trading insults and butting heads. They both received fines and one-match bans in the aftermath. Lukaku's Inter side came from behind to win that match 2-1 and have since romped to the Serie A title - after which Lukaku took another dig at Zlatan, as he crowned himself the ""King of Milan"". Zlatan and Lukaku are going at it :flushed: pic.twitter.com/yMLFI72tiz In a new interview, Lukaku has finally opened up on their original bust-up, admitting he was angry with Zlatan's taunts and claimed the AC Milan forward ""plays for himself"" - unlike Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus. 'We were 1-0 down, I had missed a goal and I was a little angry,"" Lukaku told Il Corriere della Sera per Football Italia. ""His words hit me. I am not happy about my reaction, but I don't let myself get pushed around. ""Ibrahimovic is a great footballer, he's won everywhere he's been, scoring more than 500 goals. I had a good relationship with him until I was at Manchester United, but we need these kind of footballers in Serie A. ""He wants to win for himself, I want to win for Inter and Ronaldo for Juventus.

But the dynamic between the duo forwards somehow deteriorated during the year they shared at Old Trafford. However the 27-year-old Belgian - whose 21 goals and 10 assists this season have been crucial to Inter's charge to the title - clearly doesn't regret leaving United after only two years. The main reason being his relationship with Antonio Conte, who he calls the best coach he's worked with. ""To me, Conte is the best coach and he immediately convinced me,"" said Lukaku on his decision to go to Inter. ""When I signed with Inter, I texted him, saying: 'I am arriving',"" the striker revealed. ""It's always been a dream to play in Serie A. When I was at Manchester United, I used to tell [Matteo] Darmian: 'I'll go to Inter, talk to me in Italian, and reply in English.' ""When I arrived, I already knew the language and Italy has given me so much. We finished as runner-up in Serie A and the Europa League last season, and Conte and I lived that as a defeat. We have been able to transform that into motivation."" So Lukaku clearly feels a debt of thanks to Conte for his sparkling form at Inter, as well as to full-back Darmian for his language skills.

Loadingâ¦ It looks pretty likely at this point that Ajax boss Ten Hag will be the latest manager to try and get the club back into the title picture, after nine years of failures. The 52-year-old impressed the club's chiefs into silence during his interview as he shocked them with an honest assessment of where they've made mistakes in recruitment and scouting. However, as it stands nothing has been made official and he has some big games ahead for Ajax before the end of the season, so it was a bit of a surprise when De Telegraaf writer Mike Verweij congratulated the Dutchman on the new role, during his press conference on Friday, and asked him why he'd remained quiet, with Ten Hag giving the perfect response. ""Because I serve Ajax, we need to win the two remaining trophies."" Ten Hag certainly has a lot on his plate with the Eredivisie champions before he potentially moves to England, and they're locked in two battles with rivals PSV. First up for the two sides is the KNVB Cup final on Sunday evening and then thoughts will move back to the league title race between them. Ajax currently lead PSV by four points, after the challengers recent 3-3 draw with Twente, rescuing a point in injury time having been 3-0 down. Each team has just five games left of the league season, so Ten Hag is in pole position to bring home a third league title during his time at the Johan Cruijff ArenA. There's a certain irony that it was a Dutch journalist who asked the question about Ten Hag's reported upcoming job, with Ajax having previously banned British press to avoid the subject. He may be concentrating on the job at hand, but according to reports, the man in the frame to replace Ralf Rangnick has already eyed up his first transfer target. Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is said to be part of the manager's 'master plan' as he compiling his shortlist to help improve the team. It's handy that he has his eyes on a midfielder, with Nemanja Matic already confirming that he wants to leave the club in the summer. ",positive

It was confirmed on Thursday that Ten Hag has signed an initial three-year contract, with the option to extend for another year. Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag, who becomes the ninth Dutchman to coach in the English top flight, will earn a record-breaking salary that trumps the Â£3.3 million a year package compatriot Louis van Gaal earned during his tenure at Old Trafford. It will be a handsome wage for the current Ajax boss, but it has emerged that Ten Hag is actually very wealthy outside of football. Ten Hag's multi-millionaire family are one of the richest in the Netherlands, having made their money in real estate - as per the Daily Star. His father Hennie founded the company in 1967 and these days Ten Hag's brothers Rico and Michel are manning the fort, with the latter the chairman of the board. The eldest brother assumed more responsibility when his dad took a step back after spending half a century of running the business. Hennie had wanted Erik to be involved in the business and other financial firms but the middle son was not interested and created his own path in football. He had three playing stints with FC Twente, as well as turning out for De Graafschap, RKC Waalwijk and FC Utrecht - before eventually going on to manage the Eredivisie side, having retired at the age of 32. Ten Hag's first job in management was at Go Ahead Eagles and he also worked as Bayern Munich's reserse coach while Pep Guardiola was at the helm. But it was at Ajax where Ten Hag has flourished, winning two Eredivisie titles and two KNVB cups. He also guided the Amsterdam outfit to the Champions League semi-finals during a memorable run where they knocked out both Real Madrid and Juventus in 2018/19. He's now tasked with bringing back the good times at United, where there's set to be wholesale changes. ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead,"" Ten Hag told United's official website after being announced. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.""

The 20-year-old left Ajax for RB Leipzig last summer but found life difficult in Germany, making only nine appearances in the Bundesliga. He returned to Ajax on a six-month loan deal in January and a permanent move back to Amsterdam could be on the cards. Ten Hag is said to be interested in signing a few of his current players, however. Brazil winger Antony and central defender Jurrien Timber have been named as targets but it remains to be seen if they also make the jump to Old Trafford. It's expected the 52-year-old will want to completely reshape United's squad after a disappointing campaign. The Red Devils are currently sixth in the Premier League and six points off the top four with four games to go. A 3-1 defeat to Arsenal on Saturday all but ended their slim hopes of making next season's Champions League. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has been vocal in his criticism of the current United squad and its hierarchy. He warned there is no quick fix on the horizon and likened reshaping the club's structure to open heart surgery in Friday's press conference. ""You donât even need glasses to see and analyse where the problems are,"" Rangnick declared. ""Now itâs about how do we solve them? Itâs not enough to do some minor amendments. In medicine you would say that this is an operation of the open heart.

It's not just United's form on the pitch that's been questioned for sometime, with the players' attitudes and passion for getting the team out of their problems, with Paul Scholes confirming dressing room issues via Jesse Lingard. However, with Ten Hag coming into the team, it looks like the new manager won't be accepting any bad attitudes as a video of him giving team instructions prove.

The Dutch manager is expected to take over at United at the end of the season, bringing to an end the clubâs long search for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâs permanent replacement. Former midfielder Sjoerd Overgoor was managed by Ten Hag during his time in charge of Eredisvie side Go Ahead Eagles and he has now opened up on the Dutch coachâs exceptionally high standards. âHe wanted the drinks put out in straight lines,â Overgoor told Sky Sports. âEverything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that.â Overgoor added: âWe had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch. âEvery day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. âThat was a big difference for everyone at the club.

Instead, he made it better and better.â Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes the majority of the clubâs fans are excited by the expected appointment of Ten Hag, who has seemingly beat off competition from Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino for the role. âIt's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree,â Neville told Sky Sports. âHe's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh.

""He could say 'very good, but there are always things to improve,"" the 34-year-old told the Daily Star when explaining the new United boss' methods. ""His mantra was always that 'good is not good enough. It can always be better.' If we won 4-0, it could be 5-0, but in general, he just lived and breathed football.

City are inching closer to securing the Premier League title this season before they turn their attention to the Champions League final in May against Chelsea. Durham's bold statement on Mahrez was dismissed by fellow talkSPORT co-host Darren Gough, who claimed three other City players were better than the Algeria captain. ""His form is fantastic but I'd be a little bit calmer in my appraisal in that position,"" he said. ""In his position, you could argue he's the best in that position, but is he one of the best now?

The Algerian international makes a gesture towards Stones and then grabs him, appearing to tell him to 'get tight' on Chelsea's attackers. Both men continue their conversation going down the tunnel before taking up their positions on the pitch. Mahrez and Stones have had great seasons in sky blue, with Mahrez being a key player in attack. The 30-year-old scored 14 goals in all competitions while also providing nine assists. Stones, meanwhile, has been a regular next to Ruben Dias in defence and has even earned a recall to the England squad.

Haaland's release clause has been public knowledge for over a year and Europe's elite have circled for his signature. City are now favourites to end their search for a centre forward after seeing club legend Sergio Aguero depart last summer. Pep Guardiola was keen to sign Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur, but a Â£100 million outlay on Jack Grealish earlier in the transfer window meant they couldn't give in to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's demands. Jordan continued: ""No one should really want this, we throw these figures around in a country thatâs got food banks up the ying yang, as if 500 grand a week on a footballer is just something we should all accept.

""And it seems to me now in football, you can be quite average and become a multi-multi-millionaire.""

At full-time, following his herculean effort, unused substitute Kurt Zouma picked Kante up and carried him across the pitch like a giant baby. Appropriate after the French star had carried the Blues to victory. He was later carried aloft by his teammates. Clearly after Kante covered every blade of grass during 90 minutes (plus injury time) his colleagues felt he deserved a rest. In a game where Pep Guardiola did not pick a defensive midfielder, Kante gave a masterclass in the arts of a box-to-box man as he closed down, won possession and was always available when the Blues had the ball. Kante was tireless. His highlight moment of many was an incredible, perfectly clean tackle from behind on Kevin De Bruyne as the City player headed towards goal just after half-time. Kai Havertz scored the goal that gave Chelsea victory, latching on to Mason Mount's through ball and taking advantage of City's lax defending to round Ederson and calmly finish. However it was Kante who was the man of the match as the humble midfielder was all over the park, while Chelsea defenders Antonio Rudiger and Reece James also had games to remember. N'Golo Kante, take a bow (presumably when Zouma and has finally put you down). ",positive

Runners up Manchester United will be hoping to get closer to their rivals after going eight years without winning the title already, and they face long time rivals Leeds United on the opening weekend. Now that the #PLFixtures have been released, here's a look at the current outright winner odds :eyes: pic.twitter.com/c0lvRt88yl After struggling to defend the title last season, Jurgen Klopp will be hoping to get off to a good start when Liverpool visit newly promoted Norwich City in mid August. Chelsea are also expected to challenge for the title in the upcoming year, after Thomas Tuchel turned their fortunes around following his appointment in January, and look to have City's number, having beaten them three times in recent month, including the Champions League final. The Blues will come up against Crystal Palace on the opening day of the season. Whilst Norwich have the toughest task of the three sides who have come up from the Championship, runners up Watford host Aston Villa and Brentford kick off their first season in the top tier since 1947 with a London derby against Arsenal. :calendar_spiral: Happy #PLFixtures day :calendar_spiral:All 380 matches for the 2021/22 season are out now :heart_eyes: In the other opening weekend fixtures, Leicester City take on Wolves, Newcastle United host West Ham, Brighton travel to Burnley and managerless Everton face Southampton at Goodison Park. The exact dates of the games are yet to be decided as Sky Sports and BT Sport don't know which games they will be showing. Of course the reintroduction of fans in the Premier League, which started with the penultimate game of the last campaign, will mean a return of more 3pm Saturday kick offs and they won't be shown live on tv. As well as the opening day, fans are always keen to see who their team will face in traditional Boxing Day game. The day after Christmas Day sees Aston Villa host Chelsea, Brighton take on Brentford, Everton take a shortish trip to Burnley, Liverpool facing Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds, champions City will meet Leicester at the Etihad, the two Uniteds of Newcastle and Manchester also meet, Norwich host Arsenal, Palace travel north to take on Spurs, West Ham welcome Southampton and Wolves face Watford.

Loadingâ¦ Last month, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal all signed up for the Super League, causing huge contempt amongst fans of other clubs, and their own fans. The plans fell apart quickly due to pressure from supporters and the English clubs were the first to back out, leaving sides from La Liga and Serie A on their own. Whilst the clubs have been embarrassed by the situation they are yet to find out their punishment, but that looks set to change. According to Sky, the six sides are set to meet with the Premier League next week with their punishment to be discussed. The report says that fines 'totalling tens of millions of pounds,' are likely to be decided, with either a single one off payment or an immediate fine plus a percentage of broadcast income to be chosen. Things could be even worse for the Super League six though as it is also claimed that earlier this month the league proposed a potential points deduction. That would be a suspended punishment, with a fine alongside it, and whilst it isn't off the table the clubs will be very against the idea. Along with Atletico Madrid, Inter and AC Milan, the other clubs to have pulled out of the ESL, the six English teams have agreed to a combined Â£12.9 million fee to children's and grassroots football across Europe. That is part of their agreement with UEFA for the potential pulling out of the Champions League, and they'll also have five percent of UEFA competition revenues withheld for one season. That could be the same punishment that is handed down by the Premier League following their meeting next week, which would mean between Â£6 million and Â£7.5 million. When it comes to Europe, the clubs also agreed a far more significant fine if they attempt a similar breakaway in the future. Only Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona remain committed to some form of Super League and are yet to officially back out of the competition. The Old Lady have been warned that they could be thrown out of Serie A if they don't agree to formally end their involvement. They could very much prove that they don't even belong amongst Europe's elite on Sunday if they fail to qualify for next season's Champions League. ",positive

The table is managed by fivethirtyeight.com and sees Manchester City retain the title with 82 points, while Liverpool finish second on goal difference with the same number of points as City, and Chelsea sit third on 81 points. Manchester United take the fourth and final Champions League spot with an underwhelming tally of 64 points - 18 points adrift of top spot. The table was updated on 31st October and makes for some scary viewing for Newcastle United fans down the other end of the scale. Newcastle are still waiting for their first win of the season after 10 games and the Magpies are forecast to finish with a measly tally of 31 points, leaving them facing the prospect of Championship football next season. West Ham United are one of the big winners from the predictions, and they are set for a fifth-place finish - one place higher than what they managed last season. David Moyes' side secured a third consecutive Premier League victory with an emphatic 4-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday, and could enjoy another season of Europa League football at the London Stadium. Brighton & Hove Albion may also make it into the Europa Conference League should this prediction come true, with Graham Potter's side currently place in seventh with 55 points. It would comfortably be their highest-ever Premier League finish, after previously finishing 15th in the 2019/20 season with 41 points. Tottenham Hotspur are set to finish eighth, but this could change if Spurs improve their results following Nuno Espirito Santo's departure. There are no surprises to see Norwich City bottom of the table with 25 points, while Claudio Ranieri's appointment as Watford boss is not enough to prevent them succumbing to the drop in 18th place on 35 points. The table in full can be viewed below. It will be interesting to see how close this prediction turns out to be come May. ",positive

Burnley came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Turf Moor, to cut the gap to their relegation rivals to just a single point. Maxwel Cornet scored the winning goal five minutes from time to seal a dramatic comeback for the home side, who were trailing 2-1 at the break. Loadingâ¦ Speaking after the match, Dyche says he used his half-time team talk to remind his players of Evertonâs fragility this season. âSometimes the mentality is hard. Iâve been down there, I know what itâs like. Every season there have been tough patches for us,â Dyche told Sky Sports after the match. âItâs hard to explain but sometimes you can of sense that a team might have lost how to win a game. âI said to them at half-time âIâm not sure these lot know how to win a game ladsâ, away from home particularly. âI said âWeâve got to play on that mentality, we do it by playing forward with better quality.â ""I said at half-time, I'm not sure [Everton] know how to win a game lads"" ð Brutal from Burnley boss Sean Dyche boss following their 3-2 win over #EFC! pic.twitter.com/IGq8zcG2HK âIt wasnât glorious but there were enough patches where we found three goals.

The Brazilian then scored a second penalty four minutes before the break after a VAR review judged that Vitality Mykolenko had been fouled by former Everton winger Aaron Lennon. Burnley equalised in the second half through Jay Rodriguez before Cornet capitalised on a mistake from Ben Godfrey to secure all three points for the hosts. The Clarets remain 18th in the Premier League after the win but are now just a point behind Everton, who have to face Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea in the coming weeks. Everton have won just two of their nine Premier League games under Frank Lampard, who was disappointed his side could not hold on to their lead. âAt 2-1 we should win the game by more goals,â he told Sky Sports. âWe were not clinical enough with our chances.

Pogba produced one of his best performances in a United shirt as he exhibited his huge range of passing and vision in his free role from the left side of the midfield. United fans have been reacting on social media to the new footage that shows how remarkable Pogba's assist was which crucially helped put United back in front after Luke Ayling's wonderful equaliser.

After a high-scoring Gameweek 1, managers will be keen to enhance their chances of FPL glory heading into this weekendâs games. Last Saturday, we saw some mesmerising performances from Manchester United duo Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes after they single-handedly punished the Leeds United defence during a thumping 5-1 victory. Meanwhile, Watfordâs bargain striker Emmanuel Dennis made his mark in the Premier League, though there were lots of other performances that drew the eyes of FPL managers. ð¨ Gameweek 2ï¸â£ is fast approaching ð¨#FPL Daily looks at the big movers in ownership ð pic.twitter.com/ZKnOLM4Rr5 So, with Gameweek 2 upon us, itâs time for managers to use their first free transfer of the season and make that difficult decision of who to bring in next. Ricardo Pereira was a standout performer during Leicester Cityâs opening day win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. While hugging the touchline, he was able to bomb forward down the right with ease, while also maintaining his defensive duties. He was rewarded with an assist for the decisive goal scored by Jamie Vardy and, considering the upcoming schedule for the Foxes, looks like a must-have in any FPL team. Price: Â£5.5m Ismaila Sarrâs electric pace caused Aston Villa some serious problems last weekend, ticking lots of boxes for managers looking for that extra something.

Leeds returned to the top tier for the first time in 16 years on Saturday night, in a very entertaining, and ultimately frustrating, 4-3 loss against champions Liverpool. Loadingâ¦ For those who haven't seen Bielsa manage before they might have been surprised to see him sit on a bucket to enjoy the match, rather than in the dugout, but the tradition has only made him more popular in Yorkshire. Speaking on a BBC documentary last year, journalist Guillem Balague revealed why 'El Loco' sits on the bucket, saying, ""He [Bielsa] walks the four miles from his home to the training ground. ""His intense walking during games and his moments of crouching down on what looks like a plastic bucket is his way of dealing with constant back pain that has not left him since his time as a player."" Bielsa has previously sat on a cooler box when he was manager of Marseille, before Leeds supplied him with a bucket that comes complete with a seat to make it comfy and even a sponsor's logo. It is thought that the 65-year-old also sits on the bucket because it gives him a better view than the sunken dugouts at Elland Road. Asked about his seating arrangement early in his Leeds career, Bielsa said, ""You want me to tell you more than what it is? It's just a bucket. ""I have nothing to add. It's a comfortable bucket."" Leeds' start back into the top tier couldn't have been harder on paper, against defending champions Liverpool, but they gave an excellent account of themselves. Jurgen Klopp's side took an early lead after just four minutes, with Mohamed Salah scoring from a penalty following Robin Koch's handball, Bielsa's side were level just eight minutes later through Jack Harrison. Liverpool went back ahead on 20 minutes from Virgil van Dijk's headed goal, Patrick Bamford then equalised 10 minutes later before the Reds' took the lead for the third time just three minute after that, through Salah's second. Mateusz Klich made it 3-3 after 66 minutes before Salah's second penalty secured his hat-trick and all three points with just two minutes of normal time left. ",positive

Manchester United have needed defensive stability for several seasons, so no surprise that Rio recommended a centre-back. Namely, Ben Godfrey, the 23-year-old who's made a sensational start to life at Everton after a Â£25 million summer move. Ferdinand explained that he told higher-ups at Old Trafford that Godfrey would be a future star in 2019, while he was breaking through at Norwich. Now, Godrey is being tipped for England honours. ""Anyone had a chance to sign him because Norwich were going to let him go,"" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel, per TEAMtalk. ""Listen, I told you before I'd spoken to various people at different clubs, [Manchester] United being one of them as well. ""They could've had Ben when he was about Â£12 million or Â£15 million, when he just went to Norwich. He'd been there about half a season or a season."" Godfrey is a centre-back who's earning acclaim for his accomplished skills on the ball, just as Ferdinand did during his early days at West Ham. So no surprise that Rio would be raving about Godfrey's potential several years ago. However the 42-year-old explained that he understands that possible signings slipping through the net is just part and parcel of football. ""Listen, there's so many players we could look at and say: they were missed at that point and they had to pay more,"" he said. ""That's just life, that's part of it, and there's different judges. Ninety-nine people can judge a player and not like him and one just says: 'Bang, he's for me.' ""It's just that I've seen these boys grow so I know what's under their bonnet. I know what they're carrying in their toolbox."" Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may want to add a new centre-back to his own toolbox very soon, but it's unlikely to be Godfrey. As it would take a serious amount of money to prise him away from Goodison Park given the start he's made with Everton. All imagery: PA Images ",positive

And Gomes took another leap forward at the weekend when he lasted 82 minutes in the 1-1 draw with United. His manager Carlo Ancelotti embraced the Portugal international after he was replaced by Moise Kean but so too did Solskjaer, who went out of his way to hug Gomes and have a brief chat with him. It's an incredible feat to see Gomes back playing so soon after a brutal injury and Solskjaer, despite managing the opposition on Sunday, was thrilled to see him back. Solskjaer said: ""He's a fantastic player, first of all and the way that he's come back, less than four months after that bad injury, looking the way he does now, is fantastic. ""[It's] great to see.

The pressure will be on United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to make a strong start and mount a serious title challenge to noisy neighbours Manchester City - and up first are Leeds. Incredibly, it will be the first time in 17 years that the two sides have faced each other in the Premier League in front of supporters, due to strict coronavirus guidelines in place last season. The Red Devils have strengthened their squad with the arrivals of Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, while Leeds have brought in former Barcelona full-back Junior Firpo to bolster their defensive line. Marcelo Bielsa, who has just signed a new contract to remain in charge at Leeds, saw his side finish ninth last season as they offered fans and neutrals alike a brand of attractive, high-tempo football. What a way to start the new season! :heart_eyes:Manchester United host Leeds United in front of a packed Old Trafford :raised_hands:You DO NOT want to miss it! :fire::boom::tv: Saturday, 11.30am ' BT Sport 1 HD and Ultimate#NewHope pic.twitter.com/8G0F7IYhao Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Manchester United vs Leeds United to get your teeth stuck into. Manchester United are 1/2 to win, with Leeds United priced at 5/1 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 7/2. Prediction: 3-1 (10/1) To win and both teams to score: Manchester United (15/8) Last season, only six teams conceded more than Leeds and defensive issues were often forgiven because of their ability to score goals. However, in this fixture, Manchester United should prove too strong and players such as Paul Pogba may be given licence to create throughout the game. First Goalscorer: Bruno Fernandes (7/2) Bruno Fernandes is, arguably, Manchester United's most important player, having scored 18 times in the Premier League last season. Fernandes takes free-kicks and penalties for United - boosting his chances to score in this match - and we're backing him to draw first blood this afternoon in United's colours. Request A Bet: Harry Maguire to have 1+ shots on target (12/5) Last season, Harry Maguire averaged 1.1 shots per game, and he will be keen on his chances of having chances against a Leeds side who are vulnerable from set-pieces. The Whites conceded 15 goals from set-pieces last season - the most out of any side - and we're backing the big-headed centre-half to fire the ball home at least once on target.

While United have signed Sancho, he only recently started training and is not up to full match fitness, that's according to Solskjaer, anyway.

Last season, the Reds gave up their Premier League crown without much resistance - finishing 19 points behind current champions Manchester City - but injuries to their defensive stalwarts undermined their chances. Turning a new leaf, Jurgen Klopp's side have made an unbeaten start, easing past Norwich City and Burnley before drawing 1-1 with Chelsea before the international break. Leeds, meanwhile, have made a slow start, collecting just two points from three games, but remain one of the most exciting teams in the league on their day.

Leeds United are 10/3 to win, with Liverpool priced at 8/11 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 3/1. Prediction: 0-2 (9/1) First Corner: Leeds United (5/4) Last season's end-to-end Elland Road fixture resulted in 18 corners in total and we're backing for more of the same on Sunday afternoon. On the face of it, especially with a passionate home crowd behind them, Leeds should start on the front foot and we reckon the Whites to win the first corner looks like a solid option. Match Result and Both Team To Score: Liverpool and Yes (2/1) Liverpool are unbeaten in their last ten games against Leeds, but Marcelo Bielsa's side certainly made the Reds sweat last season. The two sides battled out a 4-3 thriller at Anfield on the opening day of the 2020/21 season and we're backing for this one to rain goals as well. First Goalscorer: Mohamed Salah (10/3) Goals pay the rent and Mohamed Salah has undoubtably paid his fair share, finishing second in the Golden Boot standings last season with 22 goals etched to his name. Interestingly, Salah already has two for the season and even hit a hat-trick against Leeds last term and, as a result of that, we're backing the Egyptian to draw first blood in this one.

Loadingâ¦ Benitez was appointed as Everton's new boss just over two weeks ago, taking over from Carlo Ancelotti after the Italian moved back to Real Madrid. It's not a move that has gone down well in Merseyside, obviously because of his previous stint at Liverpool, with one Reds fan claiming the Spaniard will no longer be a club legend. The former Newcastle United manager is now on the verge of adding his first two signings to the club, and they're both wide players. According to The Times, The Toffees are set to sign Gray from Bayer Leverkusen, for Â£1.5 million, and Townsend, who played for Benitez at Newcastle, on a free, after he left Crystal Palace. The club are in need of more wide players, especially with Richarlison potentially missing the beginning of the season due to his participation at the Olympics with Brazil. However the two signings aren't exactly likely to excite fans who have been used to seeing exciting such as James Rodriguez, Richarlison, Lucas Digne and Moise Kean arrive in recent seasons. It's clear though that the new manager is looking to improve his options on the wings and the report also claims that he wants to sign Dwight McNeil from Burnley. The 21-year-old is highlight rated by the Clarets and have been known to not sell players if clubs don't meet their valuation, as happened with James Tarkowski last year, and Everton currently rate him worth Â£25 million. Speaking recently Benitez said, ""It is very easy to see that we have a great centre-forward. ""He's [Calvert-Lewin] very good in the air, he can score goals. But we have to provide him with good crosses, good passes,"" so it's no wonder he wants to sign more wingers. As well as the wide players, the Athletic also claim that former Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic is also on the verge of moving to Goodison Park. The Premier League side had Robert Olsen in reserve to Jordan Pickford last season, but he's gone back to Roma and the club have no plans to sign him. ",positive

Last week some claimed that Paul Pogba had gone over the top with his celebration after his excellent goal vs Switzerland, with France somehow throwing the game away after Pogba's goal made it 3-1. On Saturday night, Mina may have been trying to tempt fate even more, when he celebrated in the middle of a penalty shoot out as if he'd scored the winner in normal time, during Colombia's Copa America quarter final against Uruguay.

After Jose Maria Gimenez had missed in the attempt prior to Mina's, Luis Suarez made it 3-2 and put the Colombians under some pressure. Fortunately for Mina, Miguel Borja scored to make it 4-2 and Matias Vina missed for the Uruguayans to take Reinaldo Rueda's side through to a semi-final with Argentina on Wednesday morning. Loadingâ¦ Whilst seeing a player celebrate in the way Mina did is quite rare, it actually isn't for the former Barcelona centre back, who has done it for the Spanish giants in the past. The 26-year-old celebrated scoring in a shoot-out just after signing for the Catalans in 2018, scoring against Espanyol in the Catalan Super Cup. After doing it he explained why, saying, ""I always try to be happy, to show the happiness I have inside and to transmit it to those around me, I am happy on a personal level and also because the team played a great match. ""I had already said to my family that I was going to enjoy my first goal."" Mina will come up against his ex Barca teammate in the next round, in the form of Lionel Messi.

A flashpoint during Leeds' 4-0 win came when Alioski went to ground with 20 minutes left, McNeil bent over to say something to him - and Alioski responded with a gesture which provoked a reaction from both benches. Referee Graham Scott called over managers Sean Dyche and Marcelo Bielsa, as well as both club captains, before continuing the game after a lengthy stoppage. There is speculation that there is an alleged racial element to Burnley's complaint, although Dyche did not confirm post-match, saying only: ""One of our players made the report and I was there to be a witness to the report, not the incident."" However some football fans on Twitter have accused NcNeil of spitting at Alioski as he lay on the turf. What's clear is that the Burnley winger approaches Alioski as the Leeds player is down on the pitch and leans down to shout something at him. Any spittle, however, could well be just a result of a player yelling after 70 minutes of football rather than a deliberate attempt to spit at his opponent. Any liquid seems to land by Alioski rather than on him. Hard to tell if this is spit or sweat. Either way, the player shouldn't be over the top of another player like that. https://t.co/kemKP9YJhJ However it's another addition to what was clearly an ugly confrontation between the two players. McNeil was substituted moments after the incident, although Dyche insisted post-match that this was purely a result of his efforts up to that point in the game and a football decision. His opposite number Bielsa said he had not seen the reaction of his player. ""I didn't see that there was an incident between the two,"" he said, per the Guardian. ""If there was a gesture I didn't see it. I saw there was a dispute but I didn't think it was too different to what usually happens within a game."" ",negative

Everton edged a step closer to relegation after being beaten 2-0 at Anfield, with second-half goals from Andy Robertson and Divock Origi securing a crucial victory for the home side. According to The Telegraph, Everton are 'livid' they were not awarded a penalty in the second half when Anthony Gordon went down in the box under pressure from Liverpool defender Joel Matip. Loadingâ¦ The report claims Everton are preparing a formal response to the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) in relation to the incident. Rather than directing criticism at referee Stuart Atwell, Everton are said to be more concerned about the use of VAR. Everton have questioned why the incident was not reviewed in more detail, believing their claim for a penalty was dismissed prematurely without being properly checked. It is the second time in recent months that Everton have complained about a crucial decision going against them. ð£ï¸ ""We could have had a penalty.""ð£ï¸ ""Luck didn't go for us.

Speaking after the defeat to Liverpool, Lampard complained about supposed double-standards at Anfield. âIt's a penalty in the second half for us. I don't think you get them here,"" said Lampard. âIf it's Mo Salah at their end, he gets a penalty.

Loadingâ¦ After several months of speculation, it looks like United are finally set to appoint Ten Hag as the man to take over for next season, after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November. Reports claim that the Ajax boss has already agreed to the move, with Mauricio Pochettino overtaken as the club's preferred choice to be the new permanent boss. Ten Hag is already preparing for next season, with the Dutchman having already identified his first transfer target, and it looks like he knows the names he'll be working with next season. According to the Mirror, 12 players have been told their futures, with six players set to leave when their deals expire and six others told they'll be staying put, despite wanting to leave. The report claims Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata, Tahith Chong and Lee Grant will all be allowed to leave the club. All six are out of contract at the end of the season and they won't be renewing their deals, which certainly won't come as a shock when it comes to some of the names. Pogba, Lingard and Cavani were all already expected to leave in the summer, although the Frenchman's future was still somewhat up in the air. Apparently Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Dean Henderson, Phil Jones, Axel Tuanzebe and Eric Bailly are all unhappy at Old Trafford but won't be able to leave. Martial, Van de Beek and Tuanzebe are all currently out on loan but will be back in Ten Hag's squad for the beginning of next season. Van de Beek has played under the Ajax manager for the Eredivisie giants and may soon change his mind about wanting to leave if he is reunited with his fellow Dutchman. He is also unlikely to want to join Everton permanently, especially if Frank Lampard does take the Toffees down for the first time since 1951. Henderson is likely to be most annoyed at being unable to leave, having sat on the bench as second choice to David de Gea yet again this season. The 25-year-old reportedly wanted to leave last January in order to get first team football and allow him to compete for a place in England's World Cup squad later this year. Things could change for the unhappy players, depending on what Ten Hag wants to do as far as incomings go, and how many he is able to get in. Should the club sign some of their targets, and they'll be looking at a central midfielder, striker and defender at least, then some of those unhappy players may still be allowed to leave. There could be quite the revolving door at Old Trafford this summer. ",positive

Newly announced United boss Erik ten Hag wants to put his stamp on the struggling Red Devils team and is reportedly desperate to bring in Barca midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Loadingâ¦ De Jong worked under Ten Hag at Ajax and developed into one of the best midfielders in the world in the 2018/19 season, where they had a memorable run to the Champions League semi-finals. That prompted a â¬75 million switch to Barcelona, where the Netherlands international has played 136 times. On his Twitch channel, journalist Gerard Romero says Ten Hag wants to reunite with De Jong but Barcelona believe United may try and arrange a swap deal. Erik ten Hag has asked for Frenkie de Jong as a priority. Alex Telles, Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford are players Barcelona think #mufc could offer. Barcelona may be interested in Scott McTominay and Anthony Elanga #mulive [@gerardromero] And Maguire is one of three names mentioned as a potential makeweight. The England defender has been widely criticised following a series of poor displays this season and his future as skipper is not clear. United paid Â£80 million, a world record fee for a defender, to bring him in from Leicester City in 2019. Another player Barca think United could propose is Marcus Rashford, who has also had a disappointing campaign. The academy graduate has looked devoid of any confidence and has scored just five goals in all competitions - his last coming back in January. Left-back Alex Telles has also been linked, while it's said Barca might be interested in Scott McTominay and Anthony Elanga. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick, who will become Austria manager alongside his new role as a consultant, has already said United may need as many as TEN new players. It's claimed Ten Hag is ready to build his first-team around eight players - including youngster Hannibal Mejbri, Alejandro Garnacho and James Garner. He apparently sees the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho as central to his plans. ",positive

The 19-year-old made his debut for the United first-team at the end of last season when he started against Leicester City. He then notched 13 minutes into his second start for the club on the final day of the campaign against Wolves. The Swede has been around the United first-team environment for quite some time now and has seen all the players in training on a daily basis. He's in a good position to judge who is the fastest, having been named in the top 11 fastest United players in the Premier League last season according to Opta. Loadingâ¦ In a feature for United's official website, Elanga chatted with the returning Jesse Lingard about the Olympics and selected his 4x100m relay team. In a strong squad, Elanga picked himself, Marcus Rashford, fellow 19-year-old Teden Mengi and then Daniel James for the finish. ""I'm good at both 100m and 1500m. I love a relay too and if I had to pick my own team, it'd be a serious team,"" Elanga said while in training camp in Surrey. ""[At the] start we'll have Rashy. He'd make sure we blast out the blocks. Then we'll have me. Third we'll have Teds, Teden Mengi. ""And then last, Jamo [Daniel James]. No one is beating us. It's a very, very pacy team. We'll have to sort it out - let's chat to the coaches!"" Last-season, it was Rashford who clocked the fastest-top speed out United's squad. He was top on four different occasions across the season - his highest top-speed coming in the 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in February when he reached 36.26 km/h. Mason Greenwood was closest to Rashford's figures as he clocked 35.04 km/h against Arsenal at Old Trafford. Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Eric Bailly, Luke Shaw, Brandon Williams and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were among United's fastest players according to the data from last term. ",positive

In recent times worrying reports have claimed Ronaldo is not deemed as being particularly approachable when it comes to the young players. Loadingâ¦ A piece from The Athletic said youngsters would rather speak to Edinson Cavani despite his broken English - and that many of the younger members were not happy with Ronaldo's interview with Sky Sports where he dug them out. But according to The Sun, the 36-year-old has made moves to try and change that by conversing with them more regularly. Ronaldo is in in a group chat withMarcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, who have been close friends for a while, as well as young prospects Anthony Elanga and James Garner. He's regularly exchanged messages with his former teammates Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand but now the five-time Ballon d'Or is more immersed with his current colleagues even though some are almost half his age. ""Some of the younger players like to communicate via WhatsApp,"" a United insider told The Sun. ""They are never off their phones and regularly swap exchanges, send jokes and funny clips and chat about stuff like computer games, fashion trends and music. ""Ronaldo is almost twice the age of some of the members of the group and has four children and a pregnant fiance. ""His life is very different to the younger ones who are just starting in the game. ""Some are a bit star-struck by him but are really happy he's joined the group and are delighted he is messaging everyone and joining in. ""It makes him much more approachable, especially at a time when some of the younger members of the squad have been struggling with form."" While Ronaldo himself enjoys engaging in banter on phone, he is yet to allow his son Cristiano Jr to use a mobile.

Loadingâ¦ Lingard had a tough couple of years at Old Trafford and didn't play a single Premier League game for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team last season. He moved to West Ham on loan last January, until the end of the season, and instantly made a huge impact, scoring nine goals in 16 games and helped David Moyes side finish in sixth and qualify for the Europa League. The Hammers were expected to make that move permanent this summer but Transfer Deadline Day came and went with the England international staying at United. According to 90 Min, the Londoners didn't make a move all summer because Lingard let them know he didn't want to move to the London Stadium. The report claims that the club had wanted to make the move and even made an approach, but the player told chairman David Sullivan personally that he didn't want to go back to east London. There are no questions over the Hammers ability to have signed the player financially, having brought Nikola Vlasic to the club on Deadline Day for Â£25 million. It's unlikely Lingard's decision based solely on not moving to West Ham and it's more likely that the forward just wanted to stay to compete for his place in Solskjaer's team. The 28-year-old was told by the manager that he could be part of the team's plans this season but has so far only played four minutes of football. United are stacked in the positions that the former Birmingham City loanee is likely to play in, especially with the additions of Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Mason Greenwood's form upfront and on the right make it difficult for him to be left out of the side right now, and Bruno Fernandes continues to be integral to the team. Lingard's contract expires at the end of the current campaign and it's unlikely he will sign a new deal unless there's proof he could break into the first team. As well as being able to sign a pre contract agreement with a club abroad, Lingard would likely be available for cheaper in January, with a potential free transfer hanging over him. ",negative

Lingard's future is likely to prove one of the key tales of this summer's transfer window after he caught the eye during his scintillating loan stint with the Hammers. The 28-year-old scored nine goals and assisted five others to help West Ham qualify for the Europa League - and that form hasn't gone unnoticed, with United decision makes split on whether to cash in or keep the midfield maestro at Old Trafford. Lingard became a man out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last season, with it looking increasingly likely he would be moved on this summer. But after he shone brightly for the Hammers on loan, it has led many to believe that he could still have a future in Solskjaer's star-studded squad. West Ham, meanwhile, are said to be keen on bringing Lingard back to the London Stadium, but The Athletic suggest they are unwilling to match his parent club's valuation. Despite having less than 12 months on his current contract, United are said to be holding out for Â£30m - a fee that the Hammers can reportedly not afford. That could lead to further debate over Lingard's future and the report adds that there is some disagreement behind the scenes at Manchester United. It is believed that some are open to offering the midfielder a new contract that would protect his transfer value, while others think the time is right to sell. The Red Devils are set to announce the Â£72.9m transfer of Jadon Sancho later this week after the England star completed his medical. And after spending such a staggering amount of money on Sancho, United will know that Lingard remains their most saleable asset. But where will he be playing his trade next season - Manchester or London? ",positive

The 32-year-old was forced into the back of the net after attempting to head away an incoming cross, but amazingly recovered in time to make a dive and clear away a shot on the rebound.   Carroll drew more plaudits for another wholehearted performance in a Royals shirt, despite being on the losing side in a 1-0 defeat to the Baggies thanks to Callum Robinson's strike. The former Newcastle United striker joined the Berkshire club as a free agent last month, and has since scored two goals in five appearances for the Championship side. Those goals came in a 3-2 win away at Swansea City and a 1-1 draw at home to Hull City. Carroll could be crucial in Reading's fight to beat the drop, and many fans love how much he is appearing to enjoy his football again, despite reportedly earning only Â£1,000 a week in Veljko PaunoviÄ's squad. It would be fair to say that his career didn't reach the heights which many expected, with injuries undoubtedly taking their toll on a man who caused plenty of concern for the game's top defenders during his prime. He will hope to add to his two goals for the club when Reading host Luton Town at the Madejski Stadium on Saturday. ",positive
420,https://www.sportbible.com/football/ten-of-the-worst-january-signings-in-premier-league-history-20211220,"Andy Carroll, Guido Carrillo, Savio Nserekoâ¦ 10 Of The Worst January Signings In Premier League History","The January transfer window can be a period of optimism and excitement for fans but notoriously difficult for clubs to get right. Underperforming teams are often tempted into acts of desperation in the transfer market, particularly if the threat of relegation looms large. While there have been some notable success stories, mid-season investment often ends in disappointment. Here we take a look at 10 of the worst January signings of the Premier League era. Middlesbrough smashed their record transfer fee to sign Alves in 2008 and on paper it looked to be a good deal for the Premier League club. The Brazil international boasted an impressive record of 48 goals in 50 games for Dutch club Heerenveen but success in the Eredivisie does not necessarily guarantee goals in England, as the likes of Jozy Altidore and Vincent Janssen have also proved. After a promising start in his debut season, which included a hat-trick in an 8-1 win over Manchester City on the final day, Alves quickly faded the following campaign. He managed just four goals in 31 Premier League games as Middlesbrough were relegated from the top-flight, and the Brazilian was later shipped off to Qatari club Al-Sadd as Boro looked to cut costs. The strangest signing on our list, the circumstances surrounding Nserekoâs move to West Ham were so bizarre that vice-chairman Karren Brady pledged to investigate the transfer following David Sullivan and David Goldâs takeover of the club. Eyebrows were raised when West Ham broke their transfer record to sign Nsereko, then a relatively unknown German U21 international, for Â£9m from Italian second division side Brescia. A disastrous signing, Nsereko made just one start for West Ham and failed to score in his 10 games for the club before being shipped off to Fiorentina the following summer. He failed to settle in Florence and was later arrested by Thai authorities in 2012 after allegedly faking his own kidnapping in an attempt to extort ransom money from his family. Once the golden boy of Liverpool, Torres became a figure of hate on Merseyside when he forced through a January move to rivals Chelsea in 2011 for a then record British transfer fee of Â£50m. The controversy surrounding his defection weighed heavily on Torres in his first season at Stamford Bridge, with the Spaniard providing just one goal in 18 games. Torres struggled for consistency in his second season but played a crucial role in Chelseaâs maiden Champions League triumph, scoring a memorable goal against Barcelona in the semi-finals. He was, however, unable to produce the same individual brilliance he had consistently shown at Anfield and would eventually leave Chelsea in 2015, having failed to justify his record price-tag. It is hard to fathom how Liverpool got it so right and yet so wrong when it came to spending the Torres funds. On a dramatic deadline day in 2011, the Reds signed Luis Suarez from Ajax for Â£22.8m â then a club record transfer fee â before breaking it again a few hours later to sign Carroll from Newcastle for Â£35m. Carroll endured a difficult start to life at Liverpool. He arrived at the club injured and would go on to manage just two goals in his debut season at Anfield. While Suarezâs genius became fully apparent in the following campaign, Carroll continued to struggle and scored just four goals in 35 Premier League appearances. The England international was later sent out on loan to West Ham in the 2012-13 season and would go on to leave Liverpool the following summer with a disappointing record of 11 goals in 58 games. Anzhi Makhachkala director German Tkachenko claimed QPR were âout of their mindsâ when they spent Â£12.5m on Samba in 2013. The London club, who were bottom of the Premier League table at the time, signed the former Blackburn Rovers captain on a lucrative contract with the hope that he would transform their defence and help them avoid relegation. Samba was immediately drafted into Harry Redknappâs starting line-up but failed to impress, with the centre-back forced to apologise to fans after a particularly calamitous display against Fulham. He would miss the final weeks of the season with a knee injury as QPR finished bottom of the table. Despite Tkachenkoâs earlier comments, Samba would return to Anzhi that summer in a Â£12m move after just six months at Loftus Road. Another panic buy from a club in relegation trouble, Fulham forked out a club-record Â£12m to sign Mitroglou from Olympiakos in 2014. Within weeks of his arrival, it became clear that the Cottagers had made a major error. Mitroglou struggled with injuries and by the time he made his debut for the club at the end of February there had already been a change of manager, with Felix Magath replacing Rene Meulensteen. Fitness problems continue to plague Mitroglou and he made just three goalless appearances that season as Fulham were relegated, with the striker returning to Olympiakos the following year. Former Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell was less than impressed with the Greek striker. âThis f*****, he did not stop eating,â said Sidwell. âHe was a big boy. Every time you saw him, he'd be walking round the training ground with a f****** protein bar!â Cuadradoâs time at Stamford Bridge was so forgettable that even the Colombian himself may sometimes question whether it really happened at all. Chelsea spent Â£23.3m to sign the winger from Fiorentina in 2015, with Mohamed Salah being shipped the other way on loan. In hindsight, probably not the smartest move. Cuadrado had caught the eye for Colombia at the 2014 World Cup but even still, the signing always appeared to be unnecessary splurge from the London club. He would go on to manage just 15 appearances for the Blues, without scoring, before he returned to Italian football with Juventus in 2017. After pocketing Â£75m from the sale of Vigil van Dijk to Liverpool, Southampton wasted no time in splashing the cash and promptly broke their own transfer record to sign Carrillo from Monaco in 2018. The Argentinian, who had helped Monaco to the Ligue 1 title in the 2016-17 campaign, was brought in to provide much-needed goals for the relegation-threatened Saints, who had averaged just one per game up until January. While Southampton would eventually beat the drop under new manager Mark Hughes, Carrilloâs time on the south coast would prove to be a spectacular failure. He managed just ten appearances without scoring in his debut season before being sent to Leganes on loan for the next two years. Carrillo would later leave Southampton for free in 2020 having failed to register a single goal for the club. Who can forget the excitement and fanfare that surrounded Sanchezâs arrival at Manchester United in 2018? The Chileanâs move to Old Trafford, a swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan head the other way to Arsenal, was confirmed in unique style â with the Chilean playing âGlory, Glory Man Unitedâ on the piano in a video on the clubâs Twitter account. Sanchez had scored 80 goals in 166 games for Arsenal, winning the FA Cup twice, and there were high hopes he would kick on at United after being made the highest-paid player in the Premier League. However, Sanchezâs career would immediately nosedive following his move to Old Trafford. The forward struggled to adapt to a more defensive style of football under Jose Mourinho, and managed just two Premier League goals in his first six months at the club. Loadingâ¦ Problems off the pitch also hampered his career in Manchester. Shortly after joining United, Sanchez was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence in Spain for defrauding the government of Â£900,000 during his time at Barcelona. Hopes of a fresh start the following season were soon dashed after series of lacklustre performances and Sanchez would end the campaign with just a single Premier League goal. He would later join Inter Milan on loan in 2019 before moving to the San Siro permanently the following year, having managed just three league goals during his time at United. Turkey international Tosun arrived at Goodison Park in 2018 having built up a solid reputation in Turkish football with Besiktas, where he had scored 41 goals in 96 league games. Tosun appeared to possess all the qualities needed to be a success at Goodison Park - strong, committed and good in the air, the archetypal Everton striker. He showed glimpses of his ability during his first season at Goodison Park but would lose his place in the side to Englandâs Dominic Calvert-Lewin following Sam Allardyceâs departure from the club. After failing to regain his spot, Tosun was later sent on unsuccessful loan spells at Crystal Palace and Besiktas. Tosun has featured just once this season, a six-minute cameo in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool, and the striker is likely to be moved on from Everton next month having scored just 11 goals in his five seasons in English football.

After thwarting their set-piece, the away side cleared the ball away which turned into a through ball for Arnaut Danjuma who ran through on goal, unchallenged with NO Brentford players back defending. Danjuma raced down the pitch before slotting the ball into the back of the net to give his side the lead in a mind-blowing sequence. Brentford's shocking defending sent social media wild - with some fans comparing their defending to Manchester United's against Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League.

BBC 5 Live Sport soon uploaded a clip of the booing on social media. ""I'm quite taken aback as to how loud that was,"" said commentator John Murray on the incident. ""I'm quite taken aback as to how loud that was"" - @bbcjohnmurrayListen to the moment some fans inside the Riverside booed England and Austria players taking the knee.:calling::soccer: https://t.co/5Du5Yilmm1#ENGAUT #bbcfootball pic.twitter.com/FbeFU4Bm0I England's match-winner Bukayo Saka was confused as to why fans started booing when they had taken the knee. ""I don't understand why they did it,"" the Arsenal winger said. ""I heard some boos and I heard some claps. But you'll have to ask the fans that were booing to understand why they did it."" Jack Grealish also expressed his dislike at the reaction, and said his England teammates 'didn't like it.' ""I obviously was aware of it,' said the Aston Villa captain. ""I heard it and I didn't like it at all. None of the players liked it. ""I think that will get talked about in the next few days. It's a thing we don't want in football in general and especially in our games."" Bukayo Saka was glowing when I just spoke to him. So proud and happy to score his first England goal. And then I asked him why England fans boo'ed as players took a knee. He looked bemused: ""I don't understand it."" It was an incident that angered many on social media, too. It's sickening that people should boo England's players taking the knee.If you don't like it, just shut up and respect their right to make an apolitical gesture against discrimination. Disgusting to hear so many supposed England fans loudly boo a team with many black players for taking the knee to protest racial inequality, then loudly cheer one of those black players when he scored. Next time these idiots boo, the players should walk off. Pretty grim to hear so many fans boo the knee here at the Riverside (although good to hear so much applause trying to drown them out). Still, it does make you despair a bit. What do you think the England team is all about? England fans booed players 'taking the knee'.Boos were heard in some stadiums on the last day of the season.I spoke to @Towno10 from @kickitout about what the gesture of solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter has achieved and what the future holds for football's fight against racism pic.twitter.com/Tj2L6n0I2g ",negative

Loadingâ¦ Scott Parker's side wowed fans back in December after scoring straight from kick-off against Fulham. The technique went viral and 'Los Blancos' appeared to copy it move for move in their sensational comeback last week. For those unaware of what Bournemouth did, they kicked off and played quick one twos inside the centre circle. While they were doing that, Dominic Solanke was making a run out wide and it allowed Philip Billing to chip a ball over the whole defence. Solanke then scored within seconds of kicking off the second half and left Fulham stunned. Madrid attempted it themselves immediately after starting against the French giants but didn't manage to pull it off, as Gianluigi Donnarumma ran out to smother the ball. Fans have reacted to the footage and they're convinced Bournemouth are shaping the future of football. One commented: ""I went in thinking this was exaggerated but thats the exact play. Thats really interesting."" Another said: ""Bournemouth shaping the future of football, you love to see it."" A third posted: ""You mean they're both using the KSI kickoff glitch."" While another put: ""Never imagined Bournemouth and Real Madrid in the same sentence."" Madrid completed a sensational comeback against PSG thanks to a Karim Benzema hat-trick. The France international scored three times in 17 minutes, with his third coming almost straight from kick-off. Marquinhos' botched clearance allowed Benzema to strike with the outside of his boot to seal victory. Benzema continued his form into La Liga, scoring twice on Monday in Real's 3-0 demolishment of Real Mallorca. He hobbled off late in the game with a calf problem, but manager Carlo Ancelotti isn't concerned. ""We have to evaluate him in the next few days â things don't seem very serious,"" Ancelotti explained. ""Karim did not feel good after a jump â we have to wait until Wednesday [to learn more]."" Real are 10 points clear of Sevilla at the top of the table, but face Barcelona in El Clasico this weekend. Xavi has rejuvenated the Catalan giants in recent weeks after a number of smart transfers in January. Do you think Real Madrid will win La Liga? Let us know in the comments. ",positive

Keith Stroud took charge of his first game of the new season in the Championship, with the fixture at Craven Cottage shown live on Sky Sports. And the 51-year-old hit headlines as he led the two teams out onto the pitch when he blew a kiss at the ball that he then took off the stand. The antics from Stroud were something one might come to expect from the one and only Mike Dean, who has produced a number of hilarious moments over the years. Naturally, the superstitious act garnered a lot of reaction on social media: Stroud has clearly adopted the gesture as his pre-match transition, though he's had to tweak it slightly. In September 2020, also ahead of a Middlesbrough game, he picked up the ball and kissed it prior to the season opener with Watford at Vicarage Road. The kissing the ball action isn't exactly advised in times of COVID-19 and so he has changed up his routine every so slightly. Stroud has refereed over 300 games in the EFL and was the linesman for the 2003 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Southampton. ",negative
426,https://www.sportbible.com/football/portugal-hoping-to-persuade-england-youngster-to-switch-nationality-20210914,Portugal Hoping To Persuade England Youngster To Switch National Allegiance,"Portugal are hoping to be the latest country to persuade a promising young England player to switch national allegiance. Loadingâ¦ England are lucky to be brimming with young talent at the moment, especially having reached the World Cup semi final in 2018 and the Euro final in 2020. The likes of Phil Foden, Mason Mount, Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham are all already important members of the squad and Mason Greenwood isn't far from joining them. However, in the last year the FA have missed out on two potential future stars, with Bayern Munich forward Jamal Musiala and Valencia's Yunus Musah choosing to play for Germany and USA, respectively, despite playing for England's youth teams. The departures away from the Three Lions could continue, with Portugal eyeing Fulham 19-year-old Fabio Carvalho, according to the Daily Mail. The teenager has played for England's under 16, 17 and 18 teams so far and is expected to one day be called up to the senior team. However the Portuguese FA are hoping to fast track the winger into their under 21 team straight away, in an effort to get him to switch. The English FA are hoping that Carvalho continues to represent them, however the former Benfica academy player was born in Lisbon and could choose to represent the country of his birth. Carvalho scored on his Premier League debut for Fulham last season, against Southampton, and made four appearances for the Cottagers in the campaign. His form this term, following the west London club's relegation, has seen him start five of their six Championship games, scoring three times and getting an assist. Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi was previously linked with making a switch to Ghana, despite playing three times for Southgate's team in official matches. If a player plays three or less games for a country before they're 21, competitive or otherwise, they can still change country, as long as they're eligible and the games weren't at a major tournament finals. Hudson-Odoi's competitive fixtures came in the Euro 2020 qualifiers, and he hasn't played since 2019, with his opportunities at his club also restricted, he recently turned down an England under 21 call up. There has been talk as well that Jamaica want to persuade Greenwood to switch allegiance, which they've attempted with several players, including successfully with Michail Antonio. ",negative
427,https://www.sportbible.com/football/liverpool-fail-to-sign-fulhams-fabio-carvalho-after-missing-deadline-20220201,Liverpool Fail To Complete Signing After Running Out Of Time On Deadline Day,"Liverpool failed to complete the signing of highly-rated Fulham youngster Fabio Carvalho after running out of time on deadline day. The two clubs were locked in negotiations over Carvalho for much of Monday after Fulham rejected an initial Â£5m offer for the attacking midfielder, who is out of contract at the end of the season. According to The Guardian, Fulham eventually accepted an Â£8.4m bid for the 19-year-old, who has scored seven goals in 19 appearances for the Championship club this season. Loadingâ¦ As part of the agreement, Liverpool were reportedly willing to send Carvalho back to Fulham on loan for the remainder of the campaign. According to The Independent, Carvalho passed a medical with Liverpool but personal terms and further paperwork still needed to be completed when the English transfer window closed at 11pm (GMT). Liverpool remain keen to sign the England U18 international and are expected to hold pre-contract negotiations with the player and Fulham in the coming weeks. Fulham would be entitled to compensation if Carvalho joins another club at the end of his contract in July. Loadingâ¦ Speaking last week, Fulham manager Marco Silva was adamant Carvalho would remain at the club until the summer. ""Fabio will be with us until the end of the season,"" Silva said. ""I would like to see him here for more years. ""From day one I have been trying to keep him. It is not a surprise that clubs are interested in Fabio. We are talking about a young player with big talent. ""It has been difficult for us to renew with him, but we are trying. ""It is always difficult with a player of this talent - even with a contract it is difficult to keep him, and without it is even worse. But Fabio will be with us until the end of this season."" Carvalho could be the second Fulham youngster to join Liverpool in recent seasons after Harvey Elliott, who signed for the Reds in 2019 when his contract expired at Craven Cottage. Loadingâ¦ An independent tribunal ordered Liverpool to pay Fulham an initial Â£1.9m fee for Elliott, a record at the time for a 16-year-old, which could rise to Â£4.3m depending on bonuses. Liverpool will be hopeful of agreeing a deal for Carvalho, having allowed defender Neco Williams to join Fulham on loan for the remainder of the season. Their failure to land him before the deadline means the club made just one significant signing in January, with winger Luis Diaz joining in a Â£37.5m move from Porto. ",negative
