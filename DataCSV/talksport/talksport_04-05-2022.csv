Despite a massive first-half scare in which Liverpool lost their 2-0 first-leg lead, the Reds came back to score three goals, with the help of Villarreal’s erratic keeper.  The three-time capped Argentina international was signed by Manchester City in 2016, but never played for the club, and it’s easy to see why. Rulli’s ability was already called into question at Anfield when his side were dominated in a 2-0 defeat in a match that saw him struggle to hold onto the ball. The 29-year-old looked shaky throughout the first leg, but things got worse back in Spain with his side looking to hold onto a stunning comeback after levelling the tie 2-2 on aggregate. Unfortunately for Villarreal though, Rulli let a Fabinho shot straight at him through his legs, before failing to collect a close-range Luis Diaz header that was heading straight for him. A wild rush off his goal line then saw Mane round the former Real Sociedad man to end the tie, and talkSPORT host Jason Cundy was far from impressed. “The goalkeeper, he’s a shocker, I’m sorry,” Cundy said. “He was at fault for four of the five goals.   “How can you go into a Champions League semi-final with a goalkeeper that isn’t good enough to be an understudy in the Championship? “Honestly, Sam Johnstone, there’s a lot of clubs after him, he’s out of contract, he’s a better goalkeeper than what I saw tonight and what I’ve seen over the two legs.” England international Johnstone will likely be on the move this summer, having previously been linked to Premier League side Arsenal. Who knows though, maybe next season he could be at Villarreal. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Reds made hard work of their semi-final second leg as their 2-0 lead from the first leg was wiped out at half time at the Estadio de la Ceramica.  But goals from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane cleared up the mess for Liverpool as they ran out 3-2 winners. They will face the winner of the Real Madrid vs Manchester City tie in Paris’ Stade de France on May 28. This is the fourth time Klopp has reached the Champions League final, putting him level with record holders Marcello Lippi, Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlo Ancelotti. However, there’s one feat where Klopp is out there on his own as he becomes the first manager to reach the League Cup, FA Cup and Champions League final in the same season. The reaction of the Liverpool players was somewhat muted as they reached their third Champions League final in five years. But that may be because there’s still plenty for the team to play for as they chase an unprecedented quadruple.  And comments from Liverpool star Mohamed Salah show this side have no intention of sitting back and marvelling at their achievements just yet. Salah told BT Sport: “It’s great to be in a (Champions League) final for a third time in five years, it’s unbelievable. “Everybody’s happy inside. I’m sure they’re going to celebrate, drink a little bit, but we have a game next week, so we have to focus on that as well. “We celebrate today and tomorrow is a new day and we’ll just go from there. Today you have to enjoy it, we’re in the final, you have to enjoy the moment.  “But then from tomorrow, it’s a different competition, you can’t lose the game to Spurs. “It was tough in the first half, but then we went in the dressing room and the gaffer started talking and we were as well, to try and correct it, show we’re a top team, top level, and try and strike back after conceding two goals.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
2,https://talksport.com/football/1100831/luis-diaz-fights-back-tears-liverpool-champions-league-final-january-transfer/,Luis Diaz fights back the tears after reaching Champions League final as Liverpool star is labelled ‘one of the greatest January signings ever’,"Luis Diaz held back the tears at full time as he helped Liverpool reach the Champions League final. The Reds booked their place in Paris as they claimed a 3-2 win in Villarreal, going through 5-2 on aggregate.  Liverpool did things the hard way as their first leg lead was wiped out by goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. Jurgen Klopp then opted to bring on Diaz at half time and the Colombian made an excellent impact. After Fabinho pulled one back, Diaz headed the equaliser, giving Liverpool a 4-2 cushion in the tie. Sadio Mane’s goal sealed Liverpool the win on the night. Diaz’s impact has been nothing short of brilliant since joining Liverpool from Porto in January and talkSPORT hosts Jamie O’Hara and Jason Cundy were in agreement about him being one of the best ever acquisitions in the winter window. O’Hara said on the Sports Bar: “They made some changes, Diaz comes on. What a player he is, probably one of the greatest January signings ever. He changed the game. Cundy said: “Diaz is as good as anyone I’ve seen in the January transfer window. He is as Liverpool as you can get. Look at what reaching a #UCL final means to Luis Díaz 🥹 pic.twitter.com/alz7iZnnOD  “He will go on to become as good as Mane in my opinion. Whether he gets to the levels of what Salah’s achieved I don’t quite know.” Cundy added: “Liverpool are just too good.

In the first leg of Liverpool’s semi-final clash against Villarreal, the 30-year-old scored his 14th goal in the knockout stages of UEFA’s premier club competition.  That strike moved him level with Didier Drogba as the African with the most goals at this stage of the tournament. He netted Liverpool’s third goal as they came back from 2-0 down to beat the LaLiga side 3-2 (5-2 on aggregate) to book their place in the Champions League final. And that strike saw him equal another Chelsea legend in Frank Lampard, who scored 15 times in the knockout rounds of the Champions League during his playing career. This is some achievement from Mane, who has only featured in five Champions League campaigns for the Reds. Meanwhile, Lampard played in 12 for both Chelsea and Manchester City. Mane and co didn’t half do it the hard way in eastern Spain as they’re 2-0 lead from the first leg was wiped out at half time through goals from Villarreal pair Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin.   Jurgen Klopp’s men were a different side after the break and retook the lead on aggregate as Fabinho’s shot squirmed under Geronimo Rulli on 62 minutes. That goal knocked the stuffing out of the home side and Liverpool were level five minutes later thanks to Luis Diaz’s header. And they turned the second leg on its head as Mane stroked the ball home with his left foot after rounding Rulli.  This season could get even better and be the best of Mane’s career, with three trophies and records like this one still to play for. The Southampton forward has enjoyed a very successful 2022 already as he has won the Africa Cup of Nations, sealed Senegal’s place at the World Cup and helped the Reds win the Carabao Cup. Gabriel Agbonlahor tipped Mane for the Ballon d’Or after his exploits for Senegal and with Liverpool’s hopes of the quadruple still alive. “We will probably look at Benzema and Lewandowski, but I’m looking at Sadio Mane,” Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. “He’s won the Africa Cup of Nations, got a chance of winning the Premier League, has won the Carabao Cup and could win the FA Cup and Champions League and he’s scored a lot of goals this season. “I know we’re looking at Benzema, but if they [Real Madrid] get knocked out by Man City then I think Mane would be the favourite to get it. “I look at the way the Ballon d’Or is given, it includes trophies as well. Sadio Mane winning the Africa Cup of Nations, I’d put him above Mo Salah as well.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
5,https://talksport.com/football/1100767/liverpool-villarreal-champions-league-final-fabinho-jurgen-klopp/,Liverpool survive stunning Villarreal comeback to turnaround ‘insipid’ first-half display and reach Champions League final in Paris,"Liverpool booked their place in the Champions League final in Paris as they overcame a first-half from hell to clinch a 3-2 win against Villarreal. Goals from Fabinho, Luis Diaz, and Sadio Mane saved the Reds from European humiliation against a side who cancelled out their 2-0 first leg deficit with ease.  A third-minute opener from Boulaye Dia raised eyebrows and nerves, before former Arsenal man Francis Coquelin gave Liverpool their biggest shock in years. Former Republic of Ireland international and talkSPORT commentator Andy Townsend described Liverpool’s display as ‘insipid’, and the stats agreed. Losing out on possession and shots, it looked like the meticulous planning of Unai Emery had again foiled a European giant, but there was one eventuality he didn’t plan for. Defensive midfielder Fabinho made a rare and unexpected run into the opposition box, and sent the ball through the legs of a below-par Geronimo Rulli to help the Reds regain a stunning lack of composure. And five minutes later, with 23 minutes to play, it was suddenly game over, with second-half substitute Luis Diaz again seeing Rulli let his header pass through with ease. Jurgen Klopp’s men were finally back in their comfort zone when Mane rounded Rulli for his 24th Champions League goal, which also saw him equal Frank Lampard for knockout goals in the competition.  Former Tottenham and Watford man Etienne Capoue was the best player on the pitch for Villarreal’s opening 45, but the turnaround was summed up when he left La Ceramica with five to go after seeing red. Liverpool closed out the second half with ease despite their worst start to any game this season, and will now contest for their seventh European Cup in Paris against either Manchester City or Real Madrid. The result also means Klopp is the first manager to reach a Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup final in the same season, with dreams of an historic quadruple still alive. The recently re-signed German also joins Sir Alex Ferguson, Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi as the only managers to reach four Champions League finals, while his side just can’t stop scoring. 139 goals in 57 games is a new club record for the Reds who were once again transformed by the impact of January signing Diaz.  888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
6,https://talksport.com/football/1100679/jesse-lingard-manchester-united-west-ham-newcastle-premier-league/,"Jesse Lingard has taken ‘two or three steps back’ at Manchester United and should be looking at West Ham or Newcastle to save his career, talkSPORT told","Jesse Lingard has taken ‘two or three steps back’ in his career by staying at Manchester United, says QPR striker Charlie Austin. Lingard’s time in Manchester looks to have come to a sorry end as he was left on the bench during their 3-0 win over Brentford – which was the Red Devils’ final home match of the season.  The 29-year-old’s brother has since hit out at the decision to deny his sibling, who’s been at the club since he was seven years old, a final send-off. But the strained farewell has been a long time coming for Lingard, whose return to Manchester has fallen well short of expectations. The England international has started only four of a possible 47 games for the Red Devils this season, seeing his path to the line-up blocked by summer signings Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. This marks a stark contrast to his loan spell at West Ham last term, where in just half a season he managed nine goals and four assists and was one of the league’s best players. Former Premier League forward and talkSPORT pundit Austin is worried for Lingard, saying his career has been damaged by his desperation to prove himself back in Manchester. “With Jesse Lingard, staying at Man United for the following year, I think he’s taken two or three steps back, I really do,” Austin said on Drive.  “His stock was so high at West Ham, every week goals or assists. He went there and really changed their season, his stock was so high. “Then he wants to go back to Manchester United and fight for his place and unfortunately he just couldn’t get it right, and this year it’s not worked out and now you’re looking at it, what’s the possibilities for Jesse Lingard now?” Lingard’s contract at United ends this summer, with Austin believing he’s played his last game for the club, and his lack of send-off was wrong for a player who’s been there since his academy days. Attention then turned to what’s next for the former Gareth Southgate favourite, with a return to London on the cards. Austin said: “Now it’s time for him to have a clean break and I just felt like last year at West Ham that was the time for him to go. “You’d have to say West Ham [as a destination], you’d have to put Newcastle in the mix. Every player that’s part of the top six that’s no longer wanted by their clubs, Newcastle’s name is going to pop up.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Ivory Coast winger’s winner in the second minute of stoppage-time against Southampton in the Premier League last weekend ensured a long-shot 15-fold punt came to fruition, which earned huge rewards.  But it was in Yorkshire where the bet was completed, with Manchester City’s 4-0 win over Leeds in the evening seeing the ambitious 31,762/1 bet come through. The punter will also have been delighted with Burnley’s late 2-1 win over Watford having bet on Mike Jackson’s men, who were 1-0 down until the 83rd minute, to emerge victorious. “A couple of teams left it late, but after Burnley and Crystal Palace scored late winners over the weekend, one of our customers was left celebrating after successfully predicting the results of 15 separate matches,” said William Hill spokesperson Tony Kelly. “Having staked just 42p on the matches across England and Scotland, the punter took home a hefty £13,340.30 and there must have been some nervous moments with Palace leaving it until the 92nd minute to beat Southampton.” One bettor had a Bank Holiday Monday to remember as their £20 stake on Fulham to score 100+ goals in the Championship this season came through in their penultimate match, leading to winnings of over £6,000. A fine strike from Tom Cairney against Luton confirmed the winnings as the Cottagers notched up their 100th league goal of the season. Marco Silva’s men turned on the style as they inflicted a 7-0 hammering of the Hatters to seal the Championship title.   But still, it’s not quite as impressive as the 15-fold acca. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Dutchman will leave Dutch champions Ajax to take charge at Manchester United in the summer, and is said to have been keeping a watchful eye on events at Old Trafford ahead of his move. According to the Daily Telegraph, Ten Hag and the club are putting together a ‘plan of action’ ready for when he takes over. Part of this plan is to look to revitalise the career of Harry Maguire, who has struggled for form and consistency for the Red Devils. The Dutchman is said to been keen to determine why Maguire appears far more comfortable playing for England than for United, and is also looking to bolster his squad with the acquisition of a left-sided central defender to provide support for the club captain. Meanwhile, the report suggests Ten Hag is keeping tabs on the future of Marcus Rashford and is considering whether the 24-year-old can relaunch his career after an indifferent spell where he has been reduced to a bit-part role. Rashford has one year left on his contract and reports in France have linked Paris Saint-Germain with a move for the forward if, as expected, Kylian Mbappe moves on this summer. Ten Hag is also rumoured to be reviewing the future of right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka who moved to Old Trafford from Crystal Palace for £50million in 2019.  It will be a summer of change at Old Trafford with Ten Hag and his team taking over the reins, as well as some expected squad upheaval. As many as four out-of-contract players look set to leave this summer with potentially more to follow. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani are likely to move on in the exodus, whilst Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard are also set to leave through the exit door. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has reportedly told United officials that United need at least ten new recruits in the next transfer window, citing two new strikers as a priority. After United’s 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Rangnick admitted that he expects top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at Old Trafford next season despite rumours that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner could be looking to move on. Ronaldo was on hand to net his 18th league goal of the campaign, with the returning superstar proving to be one of the bright sparks in a frustrating season for United.   When asked if Ronaldo’s post-match lap of honour after Monday’s victory was a ‘wave of goodbye’ to the United faithful, Rangnick added: “I don’t think it should be a wave of goodbye. “He’s got another year of contract and as far as I know he will be here next season again.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

The fan, named Lola, also issued a plea to the Uruguayan striker, saying multiple times: “Don’t leave!” After Man United’s win over Brentford – the Red Devils’ final home match of the season – Lola’s dream come true as she met Cavani. She also asked Cavani to sign a scrapbook, which he was more than happy to do. And in perhaps the most wholesome moment of the whole episode, Cavani wore a headband Lola wore to all the Man United matches she went to as she hoped to one day meet her idol. You can watch the touching video of Lola meeting her hero above. Cavani enjoyed a very productive first season at Old Trafford, notching up 17 goals in 39 appearances, ten of his strikes coming in the Premier League. This season hasn’t been so memorable for the 35-year-old, who has scored just two goals in all competitions.  His future at the club appears uncertain with his contract set to expire in June. But maybe seeing Lola’s plea could just be enough to convince both the player and club to allow Cavani to stay on at Man United. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
11,https://talksport.com/football/1100512/chelsea-takeover-todd-boehly/,Todd Boehly outlines sporting philosophy and encouraging ticket price information that will surely excite Chelsea supporters,"Todd Boehly says that his sporting philosophy is to ‘excite passion’ in supporters, while also making attending matches accessible for all. The LA Dodgers co-owner is expected to be named as preferred bidder as the race to purchase the Premier League club from Roman Abramovich reaches the latter stages. Boehly has paired up with fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital in their consortium offer for the Blues. As fans look to learn more about their prospective new owner, Boehly  gave an insight into his approach to business during an appearance at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference. He said: “There’s nothing like sports to excite passion and if you have passion, then you have people who care about things. “And if you have people who care about things, you have great opportunity. And really, it’s about curating that experience, that access, that opportunity. “For example, we’ll have four million people coming out to Dodger Stadium this year. So, our goal is to give them the best possible experience. We still have the most affordable tickets in the league basically, for a stadium that’s full regularly. “In some sports like the NFL, they share all the media money. In baseball, you’re really a derivative of your local market.  “The Premier League’s similar. If you look at the way it works, to be one of the big brands, you have a structural advantage. And for us, we’re always looking for structural advantages.” Although Boehly is the frontrunner, Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe launched a late bid to secure the club, but Simon Jordan believes that approach is all about being disruptive. When asked why Ratcliffe has made the late bid, Jordan told talkSPORT: “No idea… being a disruptor? His bid is the lowest bid. He hasn’t bid what the other guys have bid. “The other guys have bid near to £3billion and he has bid the £2.5billion, which was supposedly the price people were to get to and bid a future commitment of £1.75billion. A future commitment, which I’m suspecting the other guys will spend just as much as he’s forced to spend.  “If they are going to develop the stadium, which I suspect they are all going to, they are all going to the same place. “He’s had ample time to get in a situation where he could have done this. Whatever has prompted him behind this? “You also have the Todd Boehly bid, the make up of that and who is behind it. There are some very interesting people, not necessarily financially well heeled, but people who are intellectually well heeled like Danny Finkelstein. “It’s going to be Todd Boehly and his gang, those are going to be the guys who come out of it.  “Jim Ratcliffe, whenever he gets involved in sport it is not always the greatest success. He wasn’t the greatest success with Ben Ainslie over the America’s Cup, but the man has significant wealth. “He’s a Manchester United fan, not that that influences who you can and can’t own. “If he wanted to be involved in this process, he could have been at some point and probably didn’t want to be at the table in a bidding auction with other people, but this bid that has been dressed up as £4.25billion… what you spend in the future has nothing with what you buy the football club for. “There are two things.

The former Arsenal co-owner wrote to the minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, to recommend that a sum of £750million from a potential sale is used to build more than 1,000 artificial pitches, improve 20,000 playing surfaces and invest in changing rooms as part of a donation to the Football Foundation. Abramovich has already committed to using the proceeds made in the sale of Chelsea FC to charitable efforts supporting victims of the war in Ukraine, but speaking to White and Jordan, Dein says he’s hopeful that the English game can benefit, too. He told talkSPORT: “I think that when Roman Abramovich decided that he wanted to sell the club around a month ago, the offers were coming in for around £1.8billion. “All of a sudden thanks to the skill of the bankers in America, it’s now gone to £2.5billion. “I thought about the excess on that money, why shouldn’t some of it come back to English football because after all, it is the English game that has helped to drive the huge increase in the value of the club. “I think it should be aimed primarily at developing the game in the most deprived areas, increasing female participation and supporting ethnic minorities. “With new pitches, training facilities, sporting hubs and coaches can all be achieved with the much wider benefits of physical fitness and mental wellness.  “Of course, we’d also support some of the most urgent government priorities including crime, making streets safer, supporting the union through investment and supporting leveling up. “There’s no question that the majority of the funds should be going to Ukrainian charitable causes, but there’s a lot of money here and I just think that while the majority of the money should go to the Ukrainian charitable causes, I would like to see some of the money coming back to English football. “Of course we have the perfect recipient for it in the Football Foundation because that is the body that could help the money to go to the grassroots game.” Asked if Abramovich is likely to agree to the proposal, Dein said: “It’s far too early to say that.  “There’s a lot of water to go under the bridge before that happens, but I’d just like to make sure that English football is recognised somewhere when it comes to the disposal of the assets and the proceeds.” Responding to Dein’s comments, Jordan said: “First of all, Roman Abramovich hasn’t decided to sell Chelsea. He’s been sanctioned and forced to. Secondly, the redistribution of these funds is Roman Abramovich’s gift to determine where they go. “I would love this idea if some of the other aspects of football had some substance behind it. David was always after the FA chairman’s job so he’ll know, more than anything, that as part of the FA’s commitment to allowing the Premier League to operate, negotiated a deal where five per cent of the proceeds of TV deals should be distributed down to the Football Foundation and grassroots. “Over the £30billion that’s been generated, go and see if the Premier League has paid down the £1.5billion into grassroots that might have been able to build all of these pitches.”  Asked why they haven’t done so, Jordan replied: “Because they haven’t been forced to because the FA is an ineffective operation that doesn’t do what it should and the Premier League is the tail that wags the dog and needs to be brought to book by an effective manager.” Jordan added: “The other part, is why aren’t we taxing agents? Why aren’t they giving their money into the football situation? “Roman Abramovich has a challenge here because he’s already told us that he’s going to write off £1.5billion of the loans that he’s put into Chelsea, the challenge for that is that Abramovich will then be able to have tax losses for £1.5billion which is as good as having money. The challenge is how they’re going to configure this. “David’s idea has merit. Our football family creates more value than any football family in the world, so why has every single country got far more facilities in grassroots football than us?  “I’ll tell you why, it’s because it’s got ineffective management in the governing body. “We can give these clowns that run the FA as much money as we want and all of these wonderful windfall ideas, but unless we get effective leadership that is going to effectively manage the game and how it evolves, then we’ll just be doing what we were going to do by selling Wembley Stadium to fill a gap in a supposed hole. “David’s idea is an interesting idea about the mechanics of where Roman Abramovich’s ownership of Chelsea should go, but it’s not David Dein’s business, it’s Roman Abramovich’s business. Abramovich has said, unequivocally, that he wants all of the proceeds of this sale to go to the Ukrainian war fund. End of discussion. “Then go back to the conversation about how we fund grassroots football.

The 32-year-old has devoted his entire career to Bayern, joining the club at the age of 10 and representing the club at every age group before eventually turning professional in 2008.  Julian Nagelsmann’s side recorded an unprecedented 10th-successive Bundesliga title last month with Muller collecting his 11th winners medal in the process – the most of any player in German football history. Muller boasts a solid record at the top level, scoring 226 goals in 624 games for the Bavarian club and 43 goals in 112 caps for Germany. In addition to Muller’s domestic triumphs he tasted success with Bayern in Europe, winning both the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup twice. Muller also reached the Holy Grail with the German national team when he lifted the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. “I am very pleased to have today extended my contract with FC Bayern Munich until 2024,” said Muller on his official Instagram account. “The path shared since I switched to FC Bayern youth in 2000 has been a fantastic success story so far. I enjoy wearing the red colours on and off the pitch.”  Bayern CEO and legendary goalkeeper Oliver Kahn added: “Thomas Muller is an icon who wears the club badge in his heart. “FC Bayern has always been characterised by continuity, and therefore we’re pleased that we’ve managed to extend the contract of this important player. He’s someone who assumes leadership and is also an important character in the dressing room with his personality.” Muller had been linked with a move to the Premier League in the past with formerManchester United manager Louis van Gaal interested in taking him to Old Trafford in 2015. But despite United’s interest, Bayern were reluctant to let their homegrown star leave the Allianz Arena and by signing a new deal, Muller looks certain to stay put for the foreseeable future.  888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

It was claimed the 37-year-old told television cameras at Old Trafford ‘I’m not finished’ while doing a lap of honour following the Premier League win against Brentford.  Ronaldo had scored in the 3-0 victory in one of their best performances all season. Now he has addressed the claims in a comment on Instagram as he responded to one of his many fan accounts with: “I didn’t say that.” There remains some doubt about what the future holds for the Portugal superstar beyond the end of the season. His return to Old Trafford divided opinion, but he has delivered for the club on the pitch. Ronaldo has scored 24 goals in all competitions this season, including 18 in the Premier League. He will turn 38 next February, but has shown that he can still produce at the top level on a consistent basis.  The uncertainty comes with Erik ten Hag joining as new Man United manager in the summer. He will likely want to sign a high profile striker as part of his overhaul, which could impact Ronaldo’s minutes on the pitch. On his future, interim boss Rangnick said: “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” When walking off the pitch in his final home game for Man Utd this season, Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to send a message to the camera 👀 pic.twitter.com/iKUCB3djMB talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

The boyhood Gers fan worked for the club for more than 30 years having worked under managers from Graeme Souness to current boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst. A post shared by Rangers Football Club (@rangersfc) Bell initially drove the Rangers team buses to matches across the country, before moving on to his role as first-team head of kit. The popular staff member’s death was announced by Rangers on Tuesday morning. He had been in the technical area alongside Van Bronckhorst as Rangers drew 1-1 in the Old Firm derby at Celtic on Sunday. Chairman Douglas Park told Rangers’ website: “As a club, we are absolutely devastated to learn of the loss of our colleague and more importantly, our dear friend, Jimmy Bell. “Jimmy dedicated his life to Rangers Football Club. Having worked under managers from Graeme Souness through to Giovanni, he experienced some of the greatest days in our 150-year history. “Of course, he was here during some of the lowest points, and showed selfless dedication, regardless of the challenge ahead of him. ”Jimmy’s work ethic was second to none. He dedicated countless hours to preparation for each training session and game. No job was too big or too small for him, and he thrived on working for his boyhood club.  “I spoke with Jimmy regularly, having known him from his time as a mechanic and bus driver at Park’s. He was excited for Thursday night’s game at Ibrox [against RB Leipzig], particularly having experienced a European semi-final before under Walter Smith. “Rangers, and Scottish football as a whole, have lost a legend and a friend today. He was a family man, a devoted father, grandfather and husband. “Jimmy will be sorely missed and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Bell family at this difficult time on behalf of Rangers Football Club.” talkSPORT host Jim White delivered an emotional tribute to Bell shortly after the news was announced by Rangers. Glasgow-born Rangers fan White said: “Rangers are going into Europa League action on Thursday night, the second leg of their semi-final. Ibrox will be jumping, they’re up against RB Leipzig a goal down from the first leg. “But they’ll go into this without a man who’s been described this morning, quite rightly, as a major servant to the football club, because it’s with huge sadness in the last few moments that Rangers have announced the death of their much-loved, legendary kitman Jimmy Bell. Rangers Football Club are today devastated to announce the death of our much-loved, legendary kit man, Jimmy Bell.https://t.co/x80xuLBw5x pic.twitter.com/VNsUUQtv7o “Jimmy Bell, for those who don’t know, is just part of the fabric of the football club. That and move. “Jimmy served Rangers for over 30 years and had been a friend and confident to numerous generations of players and staff. “As Rangers say this morning, he’s going to be so sadly missed by everybody at the football club. “A great friend of the players, great character. So many players will mention Jimmy Bell as soon as they talk about their time at Rangers. I’m thinking of people like [Lorenzo] Amoruso. “I’ll tell you who’ll be very upset at this news this morning –Paul Gascoignewho was very friendly with Jimmy Bell. “When the spotlight falls on Rangers on Thursday in a big way, you’d imagine the thoughts of everyone at the club will be with Jimmy Bell and his family. “When the whistle blows, you’d think Rangers will have a super extra spring in their step, to do something for Jimmy.” He concluded by saying: “He was more than just a kit man.” ",positive

While Reds goalkeeper Alisson barely touched the ball during the 2-0 victory for Jurgen Klopp’s men, Rulli was right in the thick of it, just like he was against Man United last summer. The Yellow Submarine’s shot-stopper was hasty to get involved, rushing out on numerous occasions as Liverpool dominated. In a seemingly-nervy display, Rulli was helpless to stop Jordan Henderson’s deflected effort, or Sadio Mane’s poke – but he almost missed a Virgil van Dijk effort from distance and nearly gifted the hosts a cluster of chances with fumbles. Rulli didn’t impress talkSPORT’s Jason Cundy, who describing his performance as “one of the worst goalkeeping displays at an elite level I’ve ever seen.” The Argentina international found himself trending on social media, and it’s not the first time English football fans have come across the 29-year-old. His first encounter with these shores came in the summer 2016, albeit briefly, when Manchester City signed him from Deportivo Maldonado for £4million. However, Rulli would be immediately loaned out to Real Sociedad, where he had spent the last three years on loan, before a permanent sale was agreed in January 2017. While the goalkeeper never graced the Etihad, City’s fans would’ve no doubt cheered his name during the 2021 Europa League final, when Rulli downed United.  While the goalkeeper never graced the Etihad, City’s fans would’ve no doubt cheered his name during the 2021 Europa League final, when Rulli downed United. It was the Villarreal goalkeeper who netted his side’s last penalty before saving from Red Devils stopper David de Gea. With City in the second Champions League final this season, and desperate to stop Premier League rivals Liverpool from a historic quadruple, Rulli was once again on their side on Wednesday night. However, his City heroics ended rather abruptly, just like his spell at the club. talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live! Win cash prizes every fortnight with talkSPORT’s new sportstriviagame.

Neville is a Red Devils legend and made more than 600 appearances for the club in an illustrious career that spanned from 1992 to 2011. He won 20 trophies during his time at the club, which included eight Premier League titles. There is still plenty of affection for the former right-back at Old Trafford and one fan was even sporting a unique scarf in Neville’s honour during their 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday. The Sky Sports cameras panned to the man in question, and Keane and Carragher couldn’t let the opportunity pass. “There must have been a sale on,” former Manchester United captain Keane said. Host David Jones said: “I’m sure they’ll catch on.” Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher added: “Gary Neville or Teabag?”  The Liverpool legend referencing that Neville has an uncanny likeness to the Prison Break character. Keane had some very kind words about Neville later on in Monday Night Football, though, as he picked him in his all-time Manchester United XI. The former midfielder said about the former England right-back: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. “He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself.

Lingard has been at the Red Devils for more than 20 years after first joining as a seven-year-old.  His time at United is set to end this summer when his contract expires, with the midfielder frustrated at the lack of first-team opportunities. The 29-year-old was left on the bench in United’s final home game of the season, which they won 3-0 against Brentford. Other players who are also leaving this summer, like Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic, were given the given the opportunity of a send off – with both named in the starting XI This prompted a furious reaction from Lingard’s brother, Louie Scott, on Instagram – which has since been deleted. “Twenty years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell,” his post read. “No wonder it’s [Europa] Conference League next year. “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league, OK. “Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. “Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, God bless! “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” Not everyone shares that sentiment, though, as former West Ham striker Carlton Cole believes Lingard was not enough of a club legend to deserve such a huge send off. He told the talkSPORT Breakfast: “He’s a good player, Jesse Lingard, but Man United have had lots of top players in the past and did they get a send off?  “Is it different for academy boys? No. You are playing for Man United, they are one of the biggest clubs in the world. “They don’t need to pander to anyone. Unless you’ve served the club and been the main man. “If he was a Roy Keane or a Rooney, then I could understand. They’ve gone on to do big things with the club and broken records.

Despite having 12 shots in the first half, Jurgen Klopp’s side couldn’t find a breakthrough, as Villarreal defended resiliently, just as they did when they knocked out Bayern Munich in the last round.  And, just like when they beat Everton by the same scoreline on Sunday, it took until the second half for the Reds to make their mark. Jordan Henderson found himself in a wide area and, despite looking for one of his teammates in the box, his cross was deflected over ex-Manchester City Geronimo Rulli by a Villarreal defender and into the back of the net. The Reds doubled their lead just two minutes later after another tidy move, which ended in Sadio Mane poking the ball into the back of the net, surviving a tight VAR offside review. It was another comfortable evening for Liverpool, who had 73 per cent possession and conceded just one shot from the visitors, and they will head to Spain confident they can make another Champions League final. The tie is almost done in the eyes of talkSPORT’s Hugh Woozencroft, who said Liverpool have ‘one foot’ in the showpiece final in Paris next month. Liverpool rarely found themselves in space inside the opposition’s penalty area during the first half, so when Mane had the opportunity to head the ball from close range, he would’ve been expected to do better than what he actually did, which was nod it wide. But the best chance of the first half came from Thiago, who has been in fantastic form of late, when his 30-yard effort came crashing back off the post.  But the best chance of the first half came from Thiago, who has been in fantastic form of late, when his 30-yard effort came crashing back off the post. Fabinho had the ball in the back of the next just after the break, but Virgil van Dijk was ruled offside after he headed it onto his Reds teammate inside the penalty area. But you could feel a goal was coming and it did – in bizarre fashion. Henderson made an overlapping run on the right-hand side and his cross was deflected by full-back Pervis Estupinan over the goalkeeper and into the net. And one became two just a couple of minutes later after another lovely move, which saw Salah play in Mane, who slotted past the helpless Rulli again.

They would have been able to breathe a little easier if the linesman hadn’t put his flag up to deny Andy Robertson a second goal in two games, but he mistimed his run after a sumptuous pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold. But Klopp and his side will be delighted to have secured a 2-0 victory at home, which sets them up well for the second leg on Tuesday and a busy run-in ahead. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The 37-year-old signed a two-year deal on his return to Old Trafford last summer, however, the club’s disappointing Premier League season has led to speculation he could bring his stay to an end early. The Portuguese was recently linked with a move back to Real Madrid, who he played for between 2009 and 2018. Meanwhile, the imminent arrival of Erik ten Hag as manager has led to questions over whether there would be any room in his team for Ronaldo. But club legend Keane is in no doubt that Ronaldo will be part of things next season. Asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford – their final home match of the season – could be Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong, Keane said: “I wouldn’t have thought so. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.”  Although it’s been a campaign to forget for the 13-time Premier League winners, Ronaldo can hold his head high. So far he has 24 goals to his name, 18 of them in the league. His latest came in their 3-0 win against the Bees as he slotted home a penalty in the second half. And during that celebration he appeared to hint he was staying on beyond the summer by pointing to himself and then Old Trafford as he took in the crowd’s cheers.

The Reds forward latched onto Mohamed Salah’s cute through ball before poking his side into a 2-0 lead after Pervis Estupinan’s own goal put Liverpool ahead.

It is the Frenchman’s best-ever return in a campaign, and subsequently he is an early frontrunner for the prestigious prize. He is spearheading Madrid’s bid to win a 14th Champions League title, which would Benzema’s fifth. Hat-tricks against Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, plus two in the 4-3 thriller in the semi-final first leg with Man City, have been invaluable to Carlo Ancelotti’s side. But the 34-year-old will likely face fierce competition from other top stars around Europe. What is for sure, though, is that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will unlikely be in the running. Lewandowski has been unlucky to miss out in previous years, having been a shoo-in in 2020 before the award was cancelled.   Liverpool are bidding for an unprecedented quadruple and some of their players will be hard to overlook. Salah has 32 goals for club and country so far this season, while Mane has 22, but crucially beat his teammate to Africa Cup of Nations glory earlier this year. And former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor explained why his tip would be Mane for the Ballon d’Or. “We will probably look at Benzema and Lewandowski, but I’m looking at Sadio Mane,” he told talkSPORT Breakfast. “He’s won the Africa Cup of Nations, got a chance of winning the Premier League, has won the Carabao Cup and could win the FA Cup and Champions League and he’s scored a lot of goals this season. “I know we’re looking at Benzema, but if they [Real Madrid] get knocked out by Man City then I think Mane would be the favourite to get it.  “I look at the way the Ballon d’Or is given, it includes trophies as well. Sadio Mane winning the Africa Cup of Nations, I’d put him above Mo Salah as well.” The 2022 Ballon d’Or ceremony will not be held until October, so there is still plenty of time for more twists and turns in the race to come. talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

Reds boss Jurgen Klopp rested a number of key players and got his reward for selecting Naby Keita, who came up with the winner with a composed winner in the 19th minute.  A fierce-but-fair tackle from the outstanding James Milner set up the chance, before Keita collected Diogo Jota’s pass and rounded Martin Dubravka to score a priceless goal. Milner’s tackle on Fabian Schar left the Newcastle defender in a heap and sparked outrage among the Magpies players, but replays showed the Liverpool veteran got the ball. Reacting on commentary, Sunderland legend Micky Gray said: “He wins the ball. I know Schar is on the ground and he was feeling the challenge, but Milner gets to the ball first. “Eddie Howe is asking the question, and the fans are raging, they want the foul, but I’ve seen the replay and he gets there first. He wins the ball cleanly and it’s a 50-50. “But after that, I know they have a player on the ground, but Newcastle have to continue, but they switch off. “It’s a great ball to Keita and it’s great composure to finish past the goalkeeper and two Newcastle players on the line.”  Unlike the simple 2-0 victory over Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday, Liverpool were made to sweat as the Magpies had two goals chalked off for offside. Nevertheless, the much-changed Reds dominated their opponents and should’ve won by more, it sent a message to title rivals City ahead of their game in hand at Leeds later on Saturday – live on talkSPORT. Pep Guardiola’s side, though, came through a tough test at Elland Road to win 4-0 and go one point ahead of Liverpool at the Premier League’s summit. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Red Devils secured three points in the league for the first time since their win over bottom side Norwich thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. United opened the scoring just nine minutes into the clash as an unmarked Fernandes volleyed home Anthony Elanga’s cut-back. The strike was Fernandes’ first goal in his last 11 outings. Shortly after the Portugal international’s goal, the Bees had two attempts at equalising – Christian Eriksen and Ivan Toney both having attempts at goal. Brentford were relieved to see Ronaldo’s strike just before half time ruled out by VAR for offside. However, the Bees were soon left with a bigger mountain to climb after the restart. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty after Rico Henry attempted to win the ball back in the box and collided with Ronaldo having been barged off it by the Portuguese seconds earlier. Sure enough, United’s talisman grasped the opportunity after Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, making no mistake as he sent a thumping effort past David Raya from the spot. United’s final goal of the evening came from an unlikely source as Raphael Varane netted his first goal when he latched onto Alex Telles’ inswinging corner from the right.    Prior to the game, United fans had organised another another protest against the Glazer family ownership, which was due to result in a mass walkout in the 73rd minute of the match. However, whilst there were banners displaying their discontent towards those running the club, there wasn’t a noticeable walkout from those who attended. Juan Mata received a standing ovation as he made his way for Phil Jones, as the Spaniard made what will likely be his final appearance at Old Trafford, with him expected to leave in the summer. Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “We want Glazers Out”#MUFC fans protest the Glazers on the 72nd minute during #MUNBRE pic.twitter.com/kOYxvHNl7r Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “I wouldn’t have thought so,” he said. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.” United’s victory effectively cements their place in the European spots as they sit in sixth, whilst Brentford remain on 40 points, eight points from the drop. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
25,https://talksport.com/football/1098650/man-city-premier-league-title-liverpool-leeds-jack-grealish-raphinha-stuart-dallas-injury/,Man City regain lead in Premier League title race ahead of Liverpool as Leeds fans pelt laughing Jack Grealish and Raphinha with paper balls but Trevor Sinclair feels lenient referee Paul Tierney ‘invited’ Stuart Dallas injury,"Liverpool’s lead at the top of the Premier League lasted just five hours as Manchester City beat Leeds United 4-0 to leapfrog them in the table. A feisty affair at Elland Road was certainly a threat to Pep Guardiola and his title hopes but in the end his men were able to claim an important three points. In an atmosphere described by ex-Man City winger Trevor Sinclair as ‘on fire’ the visitors took an early lead to settle any nerves. Guardiola’s side had netted 16 goals from set-pieces prior to the game and they made it 17 with just 13 minutes on the clock. A delightfully timed free-kick from the left from Phil Foden did the trick with Rodri netting with a flicked header. And in the second period 17 became 18 as Nathan Ake stabbed home from a Ruben Dias knockdown before Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho struck to seal the victory. The result isn’t helpful to Leeds’ survival hopes as they sit just five points outside the relegation zone but their performance, until the two late goals, will give manager Jesse Marsch some hope. An injury to versatile star Stuart Dallas, which saw him stretchered off, is a blow, however.   It was a tempestuous affair with numerous challenges failing to raise the attention of referee Paul Tierney. Former City star Sinclair believed his reticence may have played a part in Dallas’ injury moments before the break. He told talkSPORT: “I think the Leeds United players realised they have got to get physical if they want to get anything out of this game, and they need it because they are right down there at the bottom of the league. “They need to leave little feet in here and there, that’s what they are doing but unfortunately, when they leave a bit too much in there, Paul Tierney has let it go and it’s unacceptable. He’s got to be pulling them up for a lot more of these fouls.   “We’ve just seen that incident there with Stuart Dallas. I’m absolutely gutted for him but I think the referee being so lenient in that opening 45 minutes, it was almost an invitation for Dallas to go in for that challenge. Someone was going to get injured and unfortunately that’s happened.” Action from the stands also contributed to some tension early on with balls of scrunched up paper thrown at Man City players during thrown-ins and corners. At one point in a break of play, players were forced to clear the pitch of the debris, while later in the match Grealish laughed off being pelted by more of the paper balls.   Even Leeds star Raphinha, wasn’t exempt, with the Brazilian shooting his own supporters some furious glances as he was struck while waiting to take a corner. But the schoolboy japes from Leeds supporters didn’t stop City from passing this tough exam. Foden excelled, Grealish showed graft, and they were able to face-down a frenetic Leeds display and come out with a clean sheet. Jesus showed why he’s still got a huge role to play, despite a probable exit in the summer with Arsenal interested as he snatched a cool third. And Fernandinho took a bow in front of the adoring City fans with his long range strike at the death making him the club’s oldest ever Premier League goalscorer – the Brazilian turned 37 next week. Another match down for both Liverpool and Man City in this unbelievable title race – and neither team have blinked. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Canaries knew going into the game a defeat to Aston Villa and a win for relegation rivals Burnley at Watford would send them down to the Championship.  It appeared as the clock ticked down on the 3pm kick offs that their execution would be stayed for another week, despite a 2-0 defeat at Villa Park, with Burnley 1-0 down in their crucial battle with 19th placed Watford. But the Clarets staged a miraculous late comeback to win 2-1, and continue their resurgence following the sacking of Sean Dyche. Watford managed to hold onto the slender lead they were gifted in the eighth minute from a James Tarkowski own goal for the majority of the match, before a late capitulation saw the Hornets stung. Jack Cork’s header pulled Burnley level on 83 minutes before a neat turn and finish from Josh Brownhill on the 86th sparked pandemonium from the away fans. That result, combined with Norwich’s defeat, put safety mathematically out of reach for the bottom-placed Canaries. Dean Smith was ultimately sent down not only by his old club, but one of his old shining youngsters at Brentford in Ollie Watkins, who scored Villa’s opening goal, with Danny Ings adding a late second.   It was the worst possible afternoon for Norwich, with a tenth loss in 12 league games meaning the yo-yo specialists made it four straight seasons which have ended in either promotion or relegation. It was also a painful way for Smith to mark his return to the ground where he began the season in charge. That was made even worse by Watkins’ goal and the fact the player who created Ings’ finisher was Emi Buendia – Norwich’s player of the year last season who was brought to Villa by Smith in the summer for £38million. The Argentine was key in the Canaries’ promotion back to the top flight last term, and so there was an element of Shakespearean tragedy in that he helped send the club back down. However, the killer blows were landed 90 miles south in Watford, where Burnley scored twice in four minutes late on to give their escape attempt life.   That win continued the Clarets’ unbeaten run since caretaker coach Mike Jackson and assistant/club captain Ben Mee took over from Dyche. Their record of ten points from four games in charge [one draw and three straight wins] means they have won more points than Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick over the last month. Burnley’s comeback saw them move five points clear of the bottom three, with the pressure at the bottom of the table shifting onto 18th-placed Everton and Leeds, who dropped to 17th following Burnley’s win. Watford had started the game second from bottom and nine points behind their opponents with five games remaining, however they now require wins in all their remaining matches this season as well as a big goal-difference swing to remain in the top flight. For Norwich, the results left Smith’s men 13 points adrift of safety with only a maximum of 12 points achievable from their remaining four games of the season.  talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

27,https://talksport.com/football/1099858/mitrovic-championship-fulham-luton-title-goal-record/,Aleksandar Mitrovic breaks stunning 46-game Championship season goal record as Fulham seal league title after hitting SEVEN against play-off hopefuls Luton,"Fulham secured the Championship title in style as they thrashed in-form Luton Town 7-0 in a match that saw Aleksandar Mitrovic break the division’s 46-game season goalscoring record. The champions-elect took on the play-off contending Hatters in front of a packed Craven Cottage following a poor run of form, winning just one in their last five.  A win would seal Marco Silva’s side the title, having already achieved promotion in April. Meanwhile, Championship manager of the season Nathan Jones’s side were unbeaten in three entering into the clash, as the Hatters searched for a win to secure their place in the top six. Luton competed well with the league leaders in the opening stages, demonstrating their physical prowess and showing why they’ve earnt their spot in the league’s coveted play-off spots. However, it was the Cottagers who got the party started in the 28th minute, with captain Tom Cairney netting his third goal of the season from the edge of the box after the ball was pulled back by Harry Wilson. Fulham skipper’s goal marked the west Londoner’s 100th goal of the campaign, a record last set in the division by Manchester City back in 2001/02. Jones’ side were soon dealt another injury blow to add to their ever-increasing list as Fred Onyedinma was taken off with a hamstring injury.   Fulham then went 2-0 up thanks to a thumping, long range effort from Kenny Tete from outside the area, that left Hatters keeper Matt Ingram unsighted and the rest of his side shellshocked. The half time whistle couldn’t have come faster for the Bedfordshire side, with Tom Lockyer having to clear Wilson’s effort off the line to prevent the home side going 3-0 up just before the break. Jones’ side earnt themselves four yellow cards in the opening 45 minutes after battling against an increasingly rampant Fulham side as the chance to seal their play-off spot looked to be sliding away. Unfortunately for Luton, Silva’s side weren’t finished there, though. Top scorer Mitrovic played the ball to Wilson before Liverpool target Fabio Carvalho netted the Premier League new boys’ third. Not long after, Fulham scored their fourth through who else but Mitrovic. The Serbian timed his run to perfection as he calmly slotted his rebounded chance into the back of the net.   Mitrovic’s goal marked his 42nd of the campaign, meaning he went level with the league’s 46-game-a-season’s record holder Guy Whittingham, who achieved the feat with Portsmouth in the 1992/93 season. Bobby De Cordova-Reid then found himself on the scoresheet, with Jean Michael Seri also doing so soon after. There couldn’t have been a more fitting way for the champions to end the game than Mitrovic breaking Whittingham’s record, though. Fulham’s star striker rounded the night off with his side’s seventh goal of the evening, beating Whittingham’s record and summing up an incredible season for Silva’s side. Only former Middlesbrough player George Camsell’s tally remains superior to Mitrovic’s in the division’s history, setting the record of 59 back in 1927/28. Fulham’s demolition of Luton sees the Hatters drop to sixth, denting their goal difference and leaving them just two points above play-off pushers Middlesbrough. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
28,https://talksport.com/football/1100102/cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-jamie-carragher-liverpool-erling-haaland-transfers/,"‘Small club’ – Jamie Carragher slams Manchester United’s decision to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo, saying Erik ten Hag should look to sign Erling Haaland this summer","Manchester United’s move to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo last summer made Jamie Carragher think they were ‘a small club’, the Liverpool legend has revealed. The Red Devils have endured a difficult season by their own high standards, but the 37-year-old has been a rare shining light with his tally of 18 Premier League goals this term matching his final season at Old Trafford before leaving for £80miilion in 2009. Speculation is building about Ronaldo’s future at the club with a return to Real Madrid suggested as a potential solution, however that will depend on Erik ten Hag’s plans when he arrives this summer. With a big rebuild tipped, talk has started about how United can close the gap on the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City who are running away at the top of the tabl. And, according to Carragher, it’s time that United started focusing on long-term solutions if they’re to restore their status as one of Europe’s top teams. Speaking to Sky Sports, Carragher said: “I see Manchester United as one of the super clubs of world football, and I just look at the others ones like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, Barcelona; the ones who have won Champions Leagues. “Even Liverpool right now. Would Liverpool go and bring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think they would, even if they knew he was going to get 20 goals. “Manchester United, for me, should be signing [Erling] Haaland this summer. Man City are getting Haaland, while United have got Ronaldo.   “He is a legend and one of the best goalscorers of all time, and I get that – but it almost made me think that United are a small club. “It reminded me of Wayne Rooney going back to Everton. They knew they weren’t going to win something when Rooney came back but it gives everyone a lift, Wayne’s happy to go back.” Former Man United captain Roy Keane chimed in, saying: “It felt like a short-term fix. [ “[It was] for the fans, the share price and all that, but yeah, he’s still scored the goals that you thought he would do. “As you’ve said, Jamie, I think Man United have got bigger problems than Ronaldo, but it’s something that has to be looked at.”  Signing a new-look attack will be the main priority for United this summer but, according to Ralf Rangnick, that may not come in the form of a traditional number nine. The interim head coach explained: “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons.” Asked for specifics, Rangnick added: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger?  “They are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time, so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
29,https://talksport.com/football/1097142/mauricio-pochettino-psg-contract-kylian-mbappe/,Mauricio Pochettino reveals intention to see out final year of PSG contract and expects to Kylian Mbappe stay next season,"Mauricio Pochettino has revealed he is likely to stay on as Paris Saint-Germain manager next season – together with forward Kylian Mbappe. Pochettino’s revelation comes despite reports suggesting both the former Tottenham manager and Mbappe were set to move on this summer.  In his pre-match press conference ahead of the newly-crowned trip to Strasbourg on Friday, he gave a very different take on the situation. Asked what the percentage chance was of the pair remaining in the French capital past the summer, Pochettino replied: “100% in both cases.” Pochettino then elaborated on the 23-year-old’s future and took an optimistic stance on the outcome of the youngster’s decision. “He will stay,” he added. “That’s what I can see today, it’s what I feel. But then in football you can expect anything.” With his contract at the Parc des Princes expiring in June, Mbappe has been the subject of intense speculation around his future after angling for a move to Real Madrid last summer. So far, Mbappe has turned down multiple contract proposals from PSG, instead preferring to wait until the end of the season to make a final decision.  LaLiga leaders Real claim to have a verbal agreement with the World Cup winner, who would join them on a free transfer in the summer. If Mbappe does continue his PSG adventure then it is likely to happen once his current deal ends on June 30. PSG would therefore save themselves a whopping £29.5million payment to Monaco who inserted a contract extension clause into the deal that took the Frenchman to PSG in 2017. Pochettino – who has one year remaining on his contract – has himself been linked with the Real Madrid post in addition to a move back to the Premier League, amid reports that the 50-year-old is unhappy in Paris. A fractious relationship with sporting director Leonardo has contributed to Pochettino’s troubles and a cataclysmic collapse in the Champions League against Real Madrid in March added further tension to their relationship. PSG’s Qatari owners have reportedly called for a ‘new cycle’ at the club next season which could result in the dismissal of Pochettino and as many as seven first-team players moved on.  Neymar is the biggest name facing the axe with some figures at the club unhappy with the return on their world-record £200 million investment in 2017. Injuries and loss of form have hampered the Brazilian during his time in Paris with some believing that the performances Neymar delivers for Brazil far exceed those for the French outfit. Mauro Icardi, Idrissa Gueye, Julian Draxler, Thilo Kehrer, Leandro Paredes and Layvin Kurzawa are some of the other names likely to be shipped out whilst Angel di Maria will be allowed to leave when his contract expires in June. talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

Reports state that they will now enter a period of exclusivity as they look to complete a takeover from Roman Abramovich. Boehly has paired up with fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital in their consortium offer for the Blues. The group faced competition from two other suitors, including a late bid from British businessman Sir Jim Ratcliffe, which is said to have complicated things after he tabled a bid of more than £4billion. The other consortiums who had been in the running to buy the Blues were headed by Sir Martin Broughton and Stephen Pagliuca, the co-owner of the Boston Celtics. Pagliuca was informed on Friday afternoon that his bid to buy the Blues had been unsuccessful. Raine Group told him that his consortium had not been selected as the preferred bidder.

31,https://talksport.com/football/1099718/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-man-utd-fan-simon-jordan/,Simon Jordan calls Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for Chelsea bid and warns Manchester United fan ‘not always successful’ in sport,"Simon Jordan labelled Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for his 11th hour bid for Chelsea. Todd Boehly’s consortium is understood to remain on course to be confirmed as the preferred bidder and then handed the opportunity to seal a Stamford Bridge takeover from Roman Abramovich. The Russian oligarch put the club up for sale in March amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, but was later sanctioned by the UK government and had his assets frozen. Chelsea were still able to operate on a special licence with New York-based merchant bank The Raine Group handling the process overseeing the sale. The Treasury will have to ratify the club’s sale for the eventual takeover, but significant progress has been made with LA Dodgers co-owner Boehly expected to be named the preferred bidder. That was until Britain’s richest man, Ineos owner Ratcliffe, confirmed a last-ditch £4.25billion bid for the club. Manchester United fan Ratcliffe carried out extensive due diligence on Chelsea in 2019, only to opt against submitting a formal offer to buy the west London club. The British billionaire had distanced himself from a bid for Chelsea in early March, with his brother Bob reiterating previous determination at Ineos not to be ‘dumb money’ in football.  But crucially, Ratcliffe never categorically ruled himself out of a bid for the Blues. Former Crystal Palace owner Jordan does not believe that Ratcliffe’s bid will succeed and the £4.25billion figure quoted is not quite all it seems. When asked why Ratcliffe has made the late bid, Jordan told talkSPORT: “No idea… being a disruptor? His bid is the lowest bid. He hasn’t bid what the other guys have bid. “The other guys have bid near to £3billion and he has bid the £2.5billion, which was supposedly the price people were to get to and bid a future commitment of £1.75billion. A future commitment, which I’m suspecting the other guys will spend just as much as he’s forced to spend. “If they are going to develop the stadium, which I suspect they are all going to, they are all going to the same place. “He’s had ample time to get in a situation where he could have done this.

However, it’s the on-loan Nottingham Forest man’s ‘dream’ to play for Manchester United, who are also said to be monitoring him. That’s according to Sky Sports journalist Florian Plettenberg, who says that Boro could be willing to sell him for £10-12.5million (€12-15m). The 21-year-old has been in fantastic form for Forest this season under former England Under-17 boss Steve Cooper, scoring two goals and providing five assists. Forest are currently fourth in the Championship and are just five points adrift of an automatic promotion spot with four games left to play. They may have been keen to keep hold of Spence if they win promotion but, with some of the biggest clubs in the world sniffing around the youngster, that now seems highly unlikely. Both north London clubs and Manchester clubs could make moves for the flying wing-back this summer, who was named in the Championship Team of the Season. But United may have the advantage when it comes down to agreeing on terms with the player, with Spence apparently a Red Devils supporter.  And Bayern could be eyeing their second English full-back signing in two years, after they signed former Reading defender Omar Richards last summer. Middlesbrough, who look set to narrowly miss out on the Championship players this season, are clearly happy to cash in on a player who hasn’t even been a part of their squad this year. They also have their own talented youngster – Isaiah Jones – who plays in a similar position to Spence and is someone Chris Wilder will hope they can keep hold of. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Bavarian champions secured a 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at the Allianz Arena with Serge Gnabry, Lewandowski and Jamal Musiala all on target. Lewandowski, 33, who is out of contract next year, scored his 33rd league goal this term after dispatching Bayern’s arch-rivals. The Poland international has been linked with a move to Barcelona in recent weeks, with future still up in the air. Chelsea have also previously registered their interest in taking the prolific goalscorer to Stamford Bridge, with Thomas Tuchel a huge admirer of the player. Manchester United have also reportedly contacted his representatives over a possible deal. Lewandowski told Sky in Germany: “There will be a meeting soon, but nothing special has happened so far. I also notice what’s going on. The situation is not that easy for me.” Miss10n accomplished😎🏆 History has been made #10 @FCBayern #DeutscherMeister pic.twitter.com/0AyHZxKgck  Having won back-to-back FIFA best male player awards the last two years, Lewandowski has also got his hands on every possible trophy with Bayern. After arriving on a free transfer from Dortmund in 2014, he has managed 342 goals in 372 appearances. Bayern chiefs are keen for the player to remain at the club, but CEO Oliver Kahn said last Sunday the striker is ‘considering his future’. Kahn’s comments come after he previously admitted Lewandowski will ‘definitely’ stay.  “We definitely have Robert with us for another season,”Kahn recently told Amazon Prime Deutschland. “We know what we have in him and we’re relaxed about it.

34,https://talksport.com/football/1093463/man-city-borussia-erling-haaland-gabriel-jesus-karim-adeyemi/,Man City and Borussia Dortmund clear the decks for Erling Haaland mega deal with Gabriel Jesus departure and Karim Adeyemi move in the making,"The groundwork for Erling Haaland’s blockbuster move from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester City continues to be laid with both teams making plans for the deal. Reports have claimed that City have won the race to secure Haaland’s signature, with the 21-year-old agreeing terms with Pep Guardiola’s side.  The Norwegian’s £63million release clause is set to be triggered, with a £500,000 per-week salary which would make him the highest paid player in the Premier League. Dortmund’s sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, has denied the reports, but news out of Germany suggests BVB have already secured their replacement in preparation for Haaland’s impending departure. Liverpool-linked Germany international Karim Adeyemi looks set to fill Haaland’s huge boots, joining from Salzburg after turning down sister team Leipzig, much like his Norwegian predecessor did. Multiple outlets in Germany claim a £35m deal has been struck for the former former Bayern Munich academy star, who already has a goal and an assist in just 49 minutes of action for his national team. Dortmund are clearly planning for Haaland’s departure, while City seem to be gearing up for his arrival, with Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus seen as collateral. The 25-year-old’s five-and-a-half-year stint at the Etihad looks set to come to an end, with the club keen to recoup some cash before his contract expires in 2023.  Jesus followed up the news with four goals and an assist in a 5-1 win over Watford, keeping City clear of title rivals Liverpool, but he still appears destined for the exit door. The Athletic and reports out of Brazil claim Jesus’ departure is decided, with Arsenal keen to capitalise. Speculation over Jesus has become so strong that Guardiola was asked about the situation following their thrashing of Watford, and said he ‘doesn’t care’ about any potential exits. “I want to tell you something; Gabriel [Jesus] is our player,” Guardiola said.  “I don’t know what is going to happen, but he is a Man City player. When he has days like today, I am the happiest man in the world! “Every player is happy when they play 90 minutes all the time but at the end of the season whether he wants to extend, stay or leave, I don’t know or don’t care. We have less than one month.” That departure will then clear room for Haaland to become the highest paid footballer in England, ending City’s search for a long-term replacement for all-time top scorer Sergio Aguero. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The 28-year-old still remains under contract with Liverpool and posted a picture of his new frame with the caption ‘An afternoon well spent’ accompanied by a strong muscle emoji.  Whilst working out, the German showed off showed off his shredded physique similar to that of Fernando Torres. An extraordinarily buff looking Torres was spotted patrolling the touchline as his Atletico Madrid side beat Liverpool in the UEFA Youth League earlier in the season. The Spaniard has clearly spent a lot of time working on his new muscular physique. Karius, meanwhile, had a slim build when playing regularly for the Reds as their no.1, and now his arms appear huge due to the intense training. The former Mainz goalkeeper joined the Merseyside giants in 2016 and made 49 appearances under Jurgen Klopp. He has since, however, failed to make a single appearance for the club since his calamitous display in the 2018 Champions League final against Real Madrid.  Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema scored the goals thanks to errors from the then first choice goalie. He later apologised to fans after the final whistle, but suffered mentally when, inexcusably, he received death threats on social media in the aftermath. It spelled the end to his career at Anfield, and the goalkeeper made the move to Turkish giants Besiktas on a two-year loan switch. Liverpool then secured the services of Alisson from Roma, and after Karius’ loan move to Turkey was cut short, he joined Union Berlin where he made just five appearances in the Bundesliga. Now, he remains on Merseyside, but is four choice goalkeeper at the club, behind Alisson, Caoimhin Kelleher and Spaniard Adrian, with his contract up this summer.  888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

And it’s not the first time the official has courted controversy this season, having been slammed as ‘arrogant’ by Erling Haaland, while Borussia Dortmund teammate Jude Bellingham was even fined for comments about his involvement in a match-fixing scandal. Berlin-born Zwayer is in the spotlight once again, having previously faced the wrath of Dortmund pair Haaland and Bellingham, with Hammers boss David Moyes the latest man to turn his fury towards the ref. West Ham battled to a 1-1 draw against French side Lyon at the London Stadium on Thursday night in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final. However, the Hammers were left hamstrung when full-back Cresswell was shown a red card just before half-time when the game was still goalless. The 32-year-old was dismissed by Zwayer for bringing down Lyon striker Moussa Dembele when he was perceived to be the last man. Moyes, who voiced his anger at the official, disagreed with the call and felt his side should have been given a foul moments before Dembele was put through, after Bowen went down in the build-up. The 40-year-old official was also targeted by talkSPORT host Jason Cundy, who described his performance as ‘shocking’ and said he ‘mugged off’ West Ham.   It’s the latest criticism of Zwayer’s officiating, having been slammed by top Dortmund stars Bellingham and Haaland for his performance in charge of their ‘Der Klassiker’ derby defeat to Bayern Munich earlier this season. The 18-year-old England ace wasincensed by several decisionsin Bayern’s 3-2 win and launched an astonishing attack on the referee, making a serious claim about him and his involvement in a match-fixing scandal. Zwayer was handed a six-month suspension from refereeing back in 2005, having assisted Bundesliga 2 official Robert Hoyzer who accepted bribes to fix several matches. A report in the German press claimed Zwayer accepted a €300 bribe from Hoyzer, but he and three other officials informed the DFB [German Football Association] about Hoyzer’s illegal activities. Hoyzer was banned for life, while whistle-blower Zwayer was handed a short-term suspension.  Bellingham mentioned this as he fumed about Bayern’s winning goal, scored by Robert Lewandowski from the penalty spot after a dubious handball decision on Mats Hummels. “For me, it wasn’t a penalty,” Bellingham said. “He’s not even looking at the ball, he’s fighting to get it and it hits him. “You can look at a lot of other decisions in the game. If you give a referee, who has, you know match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany what do you expect?” Dortmund had their own shout for a penalty turned down, with manager Marco Rose later being sent off by Zwayer for dissent. On that penalty decision, Haaland said: “Clear penalty. I asked him [Zwayer] why didn’t you go and look [at VAR] and he said ‘no need’ like arrogant. I have to calm down a little bit now but yeah he was arrogant, I won’t say more.”  But Haaland later added: “As I said he was very arrogant. It seems like he wanted the headlines and he will get them now because he made many mistakes. He was not a good referee. What can I say? Not a good game from him. “I totally understand Marco, I support him 100 per cent. I would do exactly the same if I were him. “It’s s***.” Bellingham’s comments later earned his a fine of €40,000 (£33,970) by the DFB, but he managed to escape a match ban. That was perhaps why Moyes kept his own counsel when asked about Cresswell’s sending off after West Ham’s Europa League draw, despite his fury at officials being clear on the pitch.  The Scot also even booked by the German referee at half-time over his protests. He added: “The only thing I’m going to say is there was a tackle on Bowen which was a foul. It was the same phase of play as the red card, and I would have expected VAR to do something about it. “I’m certainly not going to talk about the referee, not at all. “It was not a good performance by us but it was a resilient performance in the second half with ten men. “We didn’t have much of the ball in the second half.

The Englishman was tipped as the next big thing after bursting onto the scene as a 16-year-old debutant for the Hammers against Arsenal in 2015.  However, it was just one of eight top-flight appearances for Oxford during an eight-year spell in east London. Most of his time in the senior ranks at West Ham was spent on loan with Reading and Borussia Monchengladbach, before a permanent switch to Augsburg in 2019 breathed new life into his career. The 23-year-old is now a regular starter in the Bundesliga, where he has already played 73 games. And not as a midfielder, but a central defender, keeping the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland at bay this season. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Oxford admits it was difficult leaving Slaven Bilic’s Hammers to go abroad in search of game time, but feels vindicated in his decision. Oxford said: “I spoke with Slaven and I said: ‘Gladbach want me and I want to go’.  “He was a bit angry and he said: ‘I want you to stay here’. “But I didn’t want to be a fourth option, I wanted to get some minutes. “I chose to come out here because I wanted to be alone and I wanted to get away from everything. “The media in England is a bit crazy sometimes. I just thought, I’ll go abroad and focus for a few years.” In a separate interview with the Telegraph, Oxford reveals why things didn’t go to plan in east London, suggesting expectations were too high for someone so young. He said: “Everyone thought I was Superman and no one really knew what went on behind closed doors.  “I was 16 and everyone thought I could play every week not knowing that I had injuries after a certain amount of games. “I had been with the first team since I was 14. I was never on my age group’s schedule, with the gym-work and everything. All the things you need to make sure your muscles are ready for the professional game. “[Instead] I was straight into the professional game. Injuries – back pains, hamstring problems, everything. “Maybe I also got a bit lost in the bubble because you would when you are 16 and coming out of school. I never had the attitude that they said I did. “You can ask everyone around West Ham. That was the picture they painted and it wasn’t a good one.” However, having emerged as a totally different player, Oxford has a point to prove in the Premier League and an England call-up in his sights.  He added: “The next step is me being called up for England and we will see in the future what happens. “I am from England and I do want to come home.

The Bayer Leverkusen striker is reportedly wanted by Arsenal and many other top European clubs but the Bundesliga side have no intention of selling him. Schick could be set for mega-money move this summer but things could have turned out very differently for the 26-year-old, and he might not have even been a footballer at all. Schick was born and raised in Prague. He grew up admiring David Beckham and had pictures of the former Manchester United star all over his bedroom. Once Beckham moved on, Schick began admiring Cristiano Ronaldo. Who would have known that he would be joint-top scorer in Euro 2020 with the legendary forward all those years later? It is a wonderful story but Schick has been through some tough times to reach his current position.  At the age of 11, Schick was signed by Sparta Prague and made his first-team debut when he was 18. But he was loaned out to Bohemians 1905, where he learned his craft from Roman Pivarnik. Pivarnik told the MailOnline about Schick’s progress: “He was eager to work on himself, very clever and polite. “But he had his own opinions and was not shy to express them. Finishing was his strength, so he should focus on that. “I told him he needs to be tougher when he presses. In youth football he wasn’t interested in playing without the ball. “We had an argument about that and I put him on the bench. Once, I had to raise my voice in the dressing room. “He stayed silent but he didn’t take it as an insult. He had amazing strength. He thought about it and then put in work. He returned to the line-up very quickly.”  However, before his emergence at Bohemians 1905, the Czech striker considered quitting football to pursue a career in modelling like his sister, but his breakthrough in the sport he loved came at the right time and he abandoned those plans. Then in 2016 came his big break as Schick joined Sampdoria in Serie A. The forward had a fine first season in Italy and he managed 13 goals in all competitions. This sparked a transfer chase for the forward and Juventus agreed to pay £26million for the then 21-year-old. But heartbreak was around the corner as the Old Lady’s medical team picked up some potential heart defects, soJuve pulled the plug. Schick was that close to signing that he was even pictured in a Juventus training kit before the deal fell apart.  In theory, that could have been the end of Schick’s career, but further tests found that he had no heart problems and joined Roma that same summer on loan with an obligation to buy. Despite the blow of missing out on the move to Juventus, Schick had no regrets and told Czech newspaper Lidovky: “I never looked back at it; it wouldn’t be worth it. I was glad to move to Roma and I had no regrets that Juventus didn’t work out.” His time with Roma didn’t go to plan. The striker made 58 appearances for the Serie A side, but he spent a lot of time out on the right, meaning he couldn’t show what he was capable of. Then came a loan move to RB Leipzig that kick-started Schick’s career. Partnered with Timo Werner in a 4-2-2-2 system, Schick scored ten goals in 22 Bundesliga appearances, which convinced Leverkusen to splash out £25m on him in the summer of 2020. Since that move, he has averaged over a goal every two games and has scored twenty in the Bundesliga this season.  But it is not just at club level that Schick has overcome the odds, he has done the same at international level. Just over a year ago, Schick was sent off against Wales in a crucial World Cup qualifier. His mistake was branded as ‘terrible’ by Jaroslav Silhavy. The very same person described him as a ‘genius’ just three months later when he scored one of the most iconic goals of the European Championships. Schick produced a magical lob from the halfway-line over Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall during the Czech’s group game with the Tartan Army. This was the moment Schick announced himself to the rest of the world and made himself a hero in his homeland. It would be fair to say that Schick has had an arduous journey, but he is now heading to the very top.  888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
39,https://talksport.com/football/1002821/liverpool-loris-karius-worst-team-in-europe-ucl-final/,From Champions League final to the worst team in Europe: Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius set for Bundesliga transfer to Greuther Furth,"Three-and-a-half years ago Loris Karius was on the precipice of glory when he started the Champions League final. Now, he’s set for a transfer to, statistically speaking, the worst team in Europe. Karius experienced one of the biggest humiliations in football as two jaw-dropping errors from the goalkeeper saw Real Madrid ease to a 3-1 win over his Liverpool team, ending his career at Anfield on the spot. Two months later Jurgen Klopp signed Alisson Becker for £56million and Liverpool haven’t looked back since. In truth, they’ve hardly had to, with the Brazilian backstopping them to a Champions League final win the following year and the Premier League the following season. As for Karius, the German dropped completely off of the radar with loan spells at Besiktas and Union Berlin, only occasionally becoming a meme when he produced more clangers.  The 28-year-old looked to have found a home in the Turkish Super Lig, but after two seasons on loan, he spent the last campaign in Berlin, only featuring five times. Returning to Merseyside during the summer, Karius has seen his standing drop to fourth-choice shot stopper at best, behind the likes of Adrian and Caoimhin Kelleher.   Unwanted at Liverpool, with his contract up in the summer, Karius may now have one last chance to redeem himself, but the odds will be stacked against him with Europe’s worst team interested in his services. Newly-promoted Bundesliga side Greuther Furth have the lowest points total of any team in Europe’s major leagues this season, sitting bottom of the table with four points after 15 games.   With 13 goals scored and 46 conceded, things were far worse for Furth ahead of their first win of the season against Union Berlin last time out, but they’ve now been dealt a huge obstacle. Long-term injuries to senior goalkeepers Marius Funk and Sascha Burchert have left the Bundesliga’s bottom side with a vacancy in goal, which Karius could fill.  Sporting director Rachid Azzouzi confirmed the club are on the lookout for a new keeper, while manager Stefan Leitl was asked directly about Karius. “He’s undoubtedly a very, very good goalkeeper,” Leitl said. “But I’m not involved in names or speculation.” Reports in Germany claim a move could be in the offing, with Karius’ last chance at redemption undoubtedly his toughest yet.

United have come under fire following their defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in the space of five days as they look set for their worst Premier League season on record. The club legend made the comments while working as a pundit after the loss to the Gunners, but on reflection felt perhaps he should have kept that conversation private. Scholes told talkSPORT: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that. I don’t know why I did it! Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth. “I have spoken to him since and probably best I don’t tell you what he said.” Scholes also criticised the club for how Lingard has been treated in the recent weeks and months. The midfielder was all set to move from the club in January, before it fell through at the 11th hour. He is out of contract in the summer and looks likely to make a permanent exit from Old Trafford.  Scholes added: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” But Scholes admitted there could still be a way back into the Manchester United first-team under new manager Erik ten Hag.  Ten Hag will join from Ajax in the summer and the former midfielder thinks a player like Lingard could flourish under the Dutch manager. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him,” Scholes said. “We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

Erik ten Hag will leave Ajax at the end of the season to take the reins at Old Trafford, replacing Rangnick in the Old Trafford dugout on a permanent basis. talkSPORT’s Jim White was left baffled at Rangnick only working six days a month in his new role at United, while also working on the international scene. But his White and Jordan co-host clarified the situation.  “It is not unusual,” former Crystal Palace owner, Jordan, added. “You need to look at the brief at what someone is being brought into do. “A lot of non-executive director and consultants, you won’t have a consultant working full-time will you? No consultants work full-time.” Discussing Rangnick’s six month spell in charge at Old Trafford, Jordan admitted his disappointed that the experienced coach has not made an impact. However, the outspoken pundit admitted that even one of football’s top managers would have struggled to fix the ‘wrong’ culture at Manchester United in the same amount of time. “I felt [Ralf] Rangnick would go into Manchester United and he would be a sea change, and have the courage of his convictions to be able to put his foot down,” Jordan added.  “I think it is much more difficult than that, the entire culture at Manchester United is wrong. The fabric of the playing squad is wrong, they have bought the wrong players, and they are going to have to change it. “I think if you put Pep Guardiola in for six months, he would have struggled with current crop of players. “The attitude and outlook of disposition of that football club from the owners, to the fans, the whole outlook is wrong. “The fans are not satisfied because of the Glazers and the performance of the team, but anybody could have done it for six months.  “But why would he want to be a consultant? He is a person who makes decisions and wants to implement them. “The problem is that he wasn’t involved in the selection process of the manager – he obviously has not been as Erik ten Hag has not spoken to him. “As a consultant, he basically parachutes in and looks at other peoples work, and let others implement his decisions.” Jordan also believes the likes of technical director Darren Fletcher and director of football JohnMurtough should move into smaller roles within the club.  “The structure is wrong,” he added. “Darren Fletcher is not fit for purpose in his role, and neither is JohnMurtough – you need to get the best in class. “I am sure they are very decent individuals, but perhaps they should be working a little bit lower down the food chain inside Manchester United, so the club can start to bridge the gap. “Not just on the pitch, but off it, because off it will influence what happens on it.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

That’s according to former Anfield ace Danny Murphy who, even after taking off his red-tinted glasses, still believes Jurgen Klopp’s side are the people’s favourites for the title. The title race remains finely poised heading into the final seven games of the season, following a pulsating draw between the top-of-the-table battlers at the Etihad Stadium. In one of the finest games of the season, Liverpool twice pegged back Pep Guardiola’s team in a 2-2 draw which sees City still one point ahead of the Reds at the league summit. The match has reopened the Guardiola vs Klopp debate, and it’s obvious which camp Murphy sits in. Asked about the differences between the two managers, who are clearly at the very top of the coaching game, the ex-midfielder says Guardiola success and greatness is undeniable. However, he claims Klopp edges Guardiola for what he has achieved with a much stricter budget than at Man City, and his work in improving players. “The way Liverpool and Klopp have done it is remarkable, in that they keep finding diamonds in the rough and polishing them up to become superstars,” said Murphy on the White and Jordan show.   “And although the admiration is there for what Pep does with Man City’s players, because even though he brings in readymade players, he still makes them better. “They both deserve credit, but I think the way Liverpool have done it is more admirable in that respect, in their recruitment and the type of players they bring into the system and build them. “I think as well from a neutral point of view, you’ve got to want Liverpool to win it, really. “If City win it again it will be four titles in five years. “You don’t want a one-team dominance in any league in Europe, because it becomes tedious and boring!” And, incredibly, Simon Jordan agreed – well, sort of.   The former Crystal Palace owner feels Man City are likely to be victors again this season, but he would much prefer it if they weren’t. “I enjoy watching Liverpool far more than I enjoy watching Man City,” said the talkSPORT pundit. “Man City are a sophisticated and very elegant team but Liverpool are a potent, grab you by the throat, get you out of the chair sort of team. “So if you want me to tell you who I want to win, I’d like Liverpool to win the league because I just enjoy watching them more. “But who do I think is going to win? I think it will be Man City.” Well, do you agree? talkSPORT’s Alan Brazil and Ray Parlour are now live on tour.

43,https://talksport.com/football/1084188/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-pep-guardiola-man-city-dietmar-hamann-better-manager/,‘I just don’t think you can compare them’ – Dietmar Hamann explains why he rates Jurgen Klopp as a much better manager than Pep Guardiola,"Dietmar Hamann has outlined why he rates Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp as a far superior manager to Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola. Hamann, who played for both Liverpool and Man City, said on talkSPORT ‘you cannot compare’ the rival bosses as he feels Klopp has achieved much more with the tools he has had at his disposal throughout his career. Klopp and Guardiola went head-to-head on Sunday at the Etihad Stadium, with the breathtaking Premier League title showdown ending in a 2-2 draw. They are arguably the two best managers in world football right now, but Hamann thinks Liverpool’s charismatic German is superior. Given the fact Guardiola has failed to win the Champions League with Bayern Munich and City, and spent a considerable amount of money compared to Klopp, Hamann thinks the latter has the upper hand. Hamann revealed ahead of the weekend clash that he does not get the hype surrounding Guardiola and, asked to explain why, he told the talkSPORT Breakfast: “If you look at what Carlo Ancelotti has done over the last 20 years with the clubs he won the Champions League with, Mourinho won it with Inter Milan and before that with Porto. “Pep won it with Barcelona, but in Munich he took over a Champions League winning side and was there for three years and didn’t get to the final, he got knocked out of the semis three times – and two or three years after he left they won it again!  “At City now, up until last season he had not been past the last eight and if you look at the moment, the fortunes City have spent, I don’t think it’s enough. “My point is that he hasn’t done anything somebody else before him hasn’t done already. “If you look at Klopp, he took Borussia Dortmund to a Champions League final and the Bundesliga title – which hasn’t been done since. “And obviously he won the league for the first time in 30 years for Liverpool – he really galvanised that football club. “I just don’t think you can compare them. I think what Klopp has done at Liverpool rates far higher than what Guardiola has done at City.  “Everybody is going on about Guardiola that he’s the Godfather of managers, but if you actually look at his record over the last three years – yes he’s done great with City to get 100 points in a season, but Klopp didn’t spend half the money, he’s probably spent a quarter of the money and they have been running them close with 98 or 99 points, and this season it’s the same thing. “Pep has spent nearly half a billion on centre-backs alone, and obviously last year they got to the Champions League final and I’ve got to say he lost the final, because he didn’t play Rodri. “So I don’t understand how people can say ‘what Guardiola has done for football’. Yes, they might play a different brand, but then again, if he hadn’t had Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi in his Barcelona team, he probably couldn’t have played that way. “He has always managed the best teams and for the clubs he’s managed, and the teams he’s had and the money he’s spent over the years, I think it’s not enough.”  talkSPORT pundit Simon Jordan also praised Klopp’s coaching ability, saying he has improved his players in a more effective way that Guardiola. The former Crystal Palace owner also believes Klopp dragged Liverpool from the team that was left by Brendan Rodgers and turned the Reds into an ‘absolute powerhouse’. “This going to be something that Man City fans are not going to like; I think Klopp is turning players into better players, far more than what Guardiola has done”, said the White and Jordan host. “I think he is getting the £35million Sadio Mane’s and £35m-£40m Diogo Jota’s, the £8m Andy Robertson’s and Jordan Henderson’s of this world all together, and making them a version of himself, which is undeniably a powerhouse.  “They are an irresistible force but, unfortunately, what Klopp has is a removable object in Pep Guardiola, so does this irresistible force overcome a removable object? “The bottom line is when both of these managers go, there will be a change, but I think the most diminishing change will be Liverpool’s, because Klopp is a living, breathing embodiment. “I don’t agree with everything he says, but I do agree with the fact he has dragged Liverpool from Brendan Rodgers, what was getting a bit vanilla, to an absolute powerhouse of a football club.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
44,https://talksport.com/football/1100095/man-utd-roy-keane-all-time-xi-cristiano-ronaldo-paul-scholes/,Roy Keane names all-time Manchester United XI and includes legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney but explains why Paul Scholes misses out,"Roy Keane shared a dressing room with some unbelievable players during his time at Manchester United. So when the time came to pick his ultimate Red Devils Premier League XI, he was always going to be spoilt for choice.  Sky Sports asked the United legend to pick his team on Monday Night Football after watching his former club beat Brentford 3-0. Keane admitted he was reluctant to do so because of the risk of upsetting people, but did what he was told, and there was inevitably going to be some huge names left out. “I’ve told you before, I don’t like doing this,” Keane said. “I don’t like upsetting some of my teammates. It’s not easy. “I had to leave out some brilliant characters and brilliant players.” The most notable omissions were the likes of Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Eric Cantona, while also picked some he didn’t exactly get on with.  Keane and Schmeichel famously did not get on, with the pair once having a scuffle in a hotel before a big match, but he was still the pick over Edwin van de Sar and David de Gea in between the sticks. “He was very good… not as good as everyone thought,” Keane said. “He was a good character in the dressing room. The most important thing I had for him was huge respect. He produced big moments and got us through big matches. Peter would produce and help us get trophies. “Being good characters, making important saves. Because we were a decent team, Peter wasn’t called upon much, but he made some big saves for us. He was lively and he produced in the important moments. “Who won the fight? We say it was a draw.”  Neville dominated the right-back position for so many years at Old Trafford, so this decision – with respect to the likes of Wes Brown, Raphael and Paul Parker – was perhaps one of Keane’s easiest. The former midfielder said about Neville: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself. You have to have quality to do what he did.”  Republic of Ireland international Irwin and Keane were good friends so there’s no surprise he made it to left-back, and was a pretty decent player to go with it. Kean said: “I roomed with Dennis at United and Ireland. Brilliant trainer, very rarely injured, turned up to the big matches. If he was playing now, Dennis would be up there with the best. He was a good fella.”  Now is where some of the controversial picks start. United had some fantastic centre-backs from Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Steve Bruce, but Keane explained why he had to go for Stam and Pallister. “I couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. Big strong, brave, brilliant in the one vs ones. I’ve also gone with Garry Pallister. Rio was a good athlete and read the game well, but my relationship with Pally was good. When I first went to United, there were certain lads who went out their way to help and [Lee] Sharpey and Pally were always on the scene. “I was not surprised [when Stam left]. Jaap had a bad injury. But when you’re at a big club, players do come and go quickly. It was a case of moving on.”  United had some brilliant midfielders during the Premier League era and perhaps none more memorable than Beckham. Keane said: “He was younger. He was from London, he loved his gear and his cars. They all have hobbies, but the key for me was are they training properly and giving everything for the cause? Becks did that. “I don’t think I once fell out with him over anything because he turned up every day and put a shift in.”  Giggs is perhaps the greatest Manchester United player of the Premier League era with an incredible 963 appearances in all competitions and a remarkable 13 league titles. “Where do you want to start? He could assist. Everything you want from a wide player. The amount of goals they got from each others’ crosses. “I never felt, even with Giggsy, they were distracted by the off-the-field stuff. Giggs was a superstar in a sense but he was a good teammate to have.”  There were plenty of names Keane could have named in here and one of the most surprising is perhaps leaving out Scholes in favour of Ince. Keane said: “Robson has to go in there. He was a great player for Man United. Scored some big goals for the club. I’m going to put Paul Ince. Another very good player. Tarnished his reputation a bit, he ended up playing forLiverpool. He was a really good teammate. “Tough leaving Scholes out. But I thought Incey was brilliant in midfield. Good teammate to have next to you. He could head it and score goals. I enjoyed his company.”  From Eric Cantona to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Andy Cole and Ruud van Nistelrooy, Keane probably could have picked several strikers in his best XI, but the two he went for were Rooney and Ronaldo. “Yorkie was brilliant, Cantona was brilliant, Ruud, Mark Hughes, Ole. Oh my goodness. Ronaldo and Wayne have to go for what they achieved in the game. All the other brilliant lads I’ve played with, I couldn’t leave any of them two out. “It was easy. You see these young lads coming through, as long as they’re giving their all, that’s part of learning. “These lads, Wayne and Ronaldo, I always felt their priority was football at Man United. If they make a mistake, you try and help them. “Sometimes players have to learn from their mistakes, we certainly wouldn’t be coming down hard.”   When asked if he was happy with his choices, Keane said: “Yeah I’m okay with that. Put it this way, you’ve got a chance [of winning the Premier League]. That’s all you want. “You’ve got players turning up, you’ve got goals in the team, you’ve got characters, you’ve got height, physicality, pace. When asked who would be the manager, Keane joked: “Big Ron Atkinson.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
45,https://talksport.com/football/1085074/unai-emery-ucl-villarreal-bayern-munich-shock-liverpool/,Unai Emery masterminds Champions League shock as Villarreal dump out Bayern Munich to set up semi-final with Liverpool or Benfica,"Villarreal booked their place in the Champions League semi-finals as they dumped out Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena with an 88th-minute goal. Samuel Chukwueze snatched a dramatic 88th-minute equaliser to send Unai Emery’s side through to the last four and will face either Liverpool or Benfica. Four minutes after coming on as a substitute, Chukwueze swept home a cross by Gerard Moreno to cancel out Robert Lewandowski’s 52nd-minute opener and send the LaLiga side through by virtue of a 2-1 aggregate scoreline. Villarreal had withstood mounting Bayern pressure in the second half, with Lucas Hernandez and Thomas Muller among those who had a chance to win it before the visitors sealed the deal with extra-time looming. The hosts had looked listless for much of the first period and it took until just before the half-hour mark for them to muster a shot on target when Jamal Musiala headed straight at Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli.  But it was a different story after the break as Bayern finally got into gear, and Dayot Upamecano should have scored from a clever cut-back by the busy Leroy Sane in the 51st minute. Lewandowski ended a strong spell of pressure by poking Bayern in front on the night moments later, sparking a spell of pressure that saw Hernandez shoot straight at Rulli, and Muller miss a glorious chance with a close-range header from another Sane cross. In the midst of the chances, Moreno had served a warning by flashing the ball across the face of the Bayern box on a swift counter-attack, and that danger became a reality four minutes after Chukwueze’s introduction.  The Nigerian kept his cool to fire another Moreno cross past Manuel Neuer and the ‘Yellow Submarine’ saw out the dying moments to secure a famous aggregate win and a place in the last four. Villarreal managed just two shots on target across both legs and that was all they needed. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
46,https://talksport.com/football/1093814/jamie-carragher-divock-origi-statue-anfield-liverpool-rafael-benitez-everton/,Jamie Carragher jokes Divock Origi deserves statue at Anfield and Liverpool fans chant Rafael Benitez’s name as Reds keep up with Man City and ensure Everton stay in relegation zone,"Jamie Carragher joked Divock Origi deserves a statue at Anfield as the Belgian’s goal helped Liverpool to a 2-0 win over Everton. The Reds initially struggled to break down the Toffees’ stout defence but the game turned following Origi and Luis Diaz’s introduction just after the hour.  Origi neatly laid off Mohamed Salah, who’s cross was met by the head of Andy Robertson on 63 minutes to send the Kop wild. The striker then sealed the derby day win, heading home from close range as he latched onto Diaz’s overhead kick cross-cum-shot. “Where do you want your statue, Divock Origi?” Carragher joked on commentary for Sky Sports after the goal. Liverpool fans were also heard chanting the name of former boss Rafael Benitez, who managed the Toffees from the start of the season until January. Everton offered plenty to the clash having looked threatening on the counter-attack. They had a penalty appeal waved away early in the second half, while Liverpool forward Sadio Mane was fortunate to avoid a red card just before the break. The result sees Liverpool reduce the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester City to a point, while Frank Lampard’s men remain in the relegation zone.   Everton had started the match in the bottom three after Burnley’s victory over Wolves and things got worse for them before a ball was even kicked at Anfield. An injury to Ben Godfrey in the warm-up meant the visitors took the field having changed both centre-backs from the midweek draw with Leicester, Michael Keane the late replacement alongside Mason Holgate with Yerry Mina rested completely following his comeback against the Foxes after two months out with a thigh problem. But that did not alter their tactics, which were understandably evident from the off: get behind the ball in a 4-5-1, eat up as much time as possible at restarts and frustrate the life out of their opponents. It could have been an approach straight out of Lampard’s former mentor Jose Mourinho’s playbook, who famously came here in 2014 with Chelsea to derail a Reds title bid. It certainly worked for 45 minutes as they limited Liverpool to just three shots, none of which were on target, despite 86 per cent possession.  The fact Everton completed only 32 passes in the first half – the fewest by a team in the opening period of a Premier League game since Watford’s 30 in November 2006 – was inconsequential to the overall game plan. Richarlison, who was frequently on the floor and ate up a lot of time for treatment, and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who collapsed to the floor like a weary marathon runner at the end of 26.2 miles every time he collected the ball in two hands, drew most of the ire from Anfield. Youngster Anthony Gordon also trod a fine line, with his booking for a dive in the penalty area from a non-existent Naby Keita challenge his worst offence. Half of the 12 Premier League bookings for simulation this season have been for Everton players, with three alone against Liverpool. But it was all part of the ploy to disrupt and disturb and their hosts fell into the frustration trap. The game had a more old-school derby feel about it, with Diogo Jota and Seamus Coleman involved in one confrontation which saw the Liverpool player pushing a hand towards the defender’s face in retaliation to a challenge, and Sadio Mane in the middle of a melee of 21 players after Abdoulaye Doucoure was booked for chopping down Fabinho.  Incredibly, Everton had the better chances early in the second half as Gordon and Alex Iwobi both directed attempts wide. Prior to that, Joel Matip’s tangle with Gordon inside the area looked like it could have risked a penalty but referee Stuart Atwell was not in the least bit interested. Jurgen Klopp sent on Diaz and Origi just before the hour and the latter, who has made a habit of making his own personal derby history, combined with Mohamed Salah for Robertson to head home unmarked at the far post.  The deluge looked like it would start with Diaz and Salah, who volleyed over, having chances before Demarai Gray whistled a shot past Alisson Becker’s right-hand post to show the visitors were not yet done. Robertson then proved his worth at the other end with a vital block to prevent an Iwobi equaliser. Fittingly Origi, who has barely played this season, finished things off with a close-range header five minutes from time.  The party rolls on at Anfield, with a Champions League semi-final first leg at home to Villarreal on Wednesday, but things do not get any easier for Everton with Chelsea up next at Goodison Park at the weekend. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
47,https://talksport.com/football/1098983/cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-real-madrid-transfer-news/,Cristiano Ronaldo linked with Manchester United exit as ‘Real Madrid plot sensational’ reunion following Erik ten Hag appointment,"Cristiano Ronaldo could be set for a shock move back to Real Madrid this summer, according to reports. The Manchester United talisman is set for an uncertain future at Old Trafford with Erik ten Hag set to take over as the club’s manager at the end of the season. With the Dutch boss focused on a wholesale rebuild of the first team squad that focuses on youth and high energy, Ronaldo is one of a number of players who won’t be guaranteed to start every game. The 37-year-old has been a key player under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick so far this term, scoring 23 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils. Despite Manchester United struggling on all fronts this season, Ronaldo has been one of the few shining lights with the club challenging for a spot in the Premier League’s top six. If he does move on, Real Madrid would offer an interesting option. The Spanish giants have just secured the La Liga title under Carlo Ancelotti, while also being one match away from the Champions League final following their 4-3 defeat to Manchester City midweek. However with Karim Benzema leading Madrid’s line, not to mention the ongoing links with Kylian Mbappe, it remains to be seen how Ronaldo would fit into the ranks at the Bernabeu.   Should he stay at Old Trafford, Ronaldo will no doubt need to adapt. Dean Ashton was discussing the situation at Manchester United following the clash with Arsenal midweek and believes that ten Hag must offer structure to the United squad, regardless of who is involved. He told talkSPORT: “There seems to be a spirit between the players and the staff at Arsenal, and you just don’t see that at Manchester United. “That’s the job of Erik ten Hag, to put a style of play that the players buy into, that makes them want to work for each other, that is identifiable for the players and actually quite simple.  “I think this group of players just needs a structure. They’re quality players, they haven’t just all of a sudden become so bad that you cannot keep them. “I think a manager who goes in there and inspires these players will find that actually there is a decent squad of players there. “With some players going out who don’t want to be at the club and some fresh players coming in with the right attitude, I think things can turn around much quicker than people think.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
48,https://talksport.com/football/1095687/karim-benzema-ballon-dor-panenka-penalty-real-madrid-man-city/,"Karim Benzema tipped for Ballon d’Or as striker’s two goals, including ‘unbelievable’ Panenka penalty, keeps Real Madrid in touch with Man City","Manchester City were unable to prevent the brilliant Karim Benzema as his two goals kept Real Madrid firmly in their Champions League clash against the Premier League side, who won 4-3 at the Etihad Stadium. After Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus fired City into a 2-0 lead early on, Benzema excellently stroked home a volley from the edge of the to halve the deficit.  The strike prompting talkSPORT’s Adrian Durham to say: “Ballon d’Or incoming, surely?” It was a sentiment echoed by teammate Vinicius Jr, who said afterwards: “There are no words that can describe how Benzema plays. He deserves the Ballon d’Or,” he said. “I hope my brother Benzema ends up winning La Liga, Champions League and Ballon d’Or.” Phil Foden restored City’s two-goal lead with a header early in the second half before Real Madrid pulled one back thanks to Vinicius Jr’s excellent run and finish. A stunning effort from Bernardo Silva appeared to give Pep Guardiola’s men a two-goal lead going into the second leg but Benzema had other ideas. The Frenchman, who now has 41 goals for Real Madrid this season, did it in style as he brilliantly made it 4-3 with a Panenka penalty, a strike labelled ‘unbelievable’ by talkSPORT’s Trevor Sinclair. City may regret not making the most of a number of early opportunities as they stormed out of the blocks. They could almost have put the tie out of sight in the opening half-hour but Real, after fine comebacks against Paris St Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds, fought back again. Real were sluggish and sloppy and continually left spaces for the hosts to exploit. Some of Foden’s touches were exquisite and De Bruyne’s throughballs were a constant danger. It was De Bruyne who got City off to the dream start, heading their opening goal after just two minutes from a Riyad Mahrez cross.   The atmosphere crackled and City took further inspiration, doubling their lead nine minutes later. Foden showed great control before laying off to De Bruyne, who drilled a low ball into the box for Jesus. The Brazilian had his back to goal but, buoyed by the four-goal haul against Watford that earned him a place in the side, was too quick for David Alaba. He turned sharply, wrongfooting the defender and blasted a low shot past Thibaut Courtois. City went close again as Oleksandr Zinchenko fired wide and Mahrez infuriated manager Pep Guardiola by hitting the side-netting rather than squaring for Foden, who later shot wide himself. Yet as well as City were playing, they did look vulnerable at the back. Guardiola’s gamble in rushing back John Stones from injury to play at right-back in the absence of Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker also backfired. The England international struggled and was caught out as Benzema crossed and Alaba glanced a header wide. City failed to heed that warning and Real scored through the same route, this time Ferland Mendy crossing for Benzema to divert in, the strike labelled ‘outrageous’ by Sinclair. Stones was replaced by Fernandinho moments later.  City upped the tempo after the break and hit the post through Mahrez. Foden’s follow-up attempt was blocked by Dani Carvajal but he made no mistake in the 53rd minute as he got on the end of a fine cross from makeshift right-back Fernandinho to head City’s third. Yet again from a position of control, City allowed Real back into the game. Vinicius turned Fernandinho out wide and was too quick for the rest of the defence, racing into the box to slot into the bottom corner. It could even have been 3-3 soon after as Eder Militao found space but aimed his header at Ederson. Such was the tension that Guardiola was booked for coming out of his technical area.   City were determined to add to their tally and their fourth came after referee Istvan Kovacs played a good advantage when Toni Kroos felled Zinchenko on the edge of the area. Real stopped expecting the whistle to be blown but Silva played on and smacked a shot into the top corner. They pushed on even after that, with Mahrez inches away from another. Real were not done and pulled another one back eight minutes from time with a Panenka penalty from the cool Benzema after Aymeric Laporte handled.  888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Premier League side eased to a two-goal advantage in the first leg of their semi-final at Anfield thanks to an own-goal from Pervis Estupinan and a Sadio Mane strike two minutes later. Despite holding out for 53 minutes, the scoreline flattered the LaLiga side, who had just one shot and could not force a save from Reds goalkeeper Alisson. The tie is far from over ahead of the return leg at the Estadio de la Ceramica on Tuesday – but few would give the Spanish club a chance after witnessing the Premier League side’s dominance on Wednesday night. As Champions League semi-finals go, it is difficult to think of an easier victory, and ex-Chelsea player Cundy was wholly unimpressed. According to him, Liverpool’s victory resembled Tyson Fury’s knockout win over Dillian Whyte on Saturday, while the pundit also suggested a Reds fan could’ve partnered Virgil van Dijk at the back. “First of all, congratulations to Liverpool,” he began. “Cruise control. There’s not a world that exists right now where Villarreal can trouble Liverpool at any price. “Liverpool were totally dominant. In some ways, it was too easy for them. I don’t know what I’ve just watched – but Villarreal are a disgrace.  “That is a disgrace. UEFA must be watching that and thinking, ‘We are in big trouble’. “If that’s what’s getting to the semi-final and facing English teams… Liverpool did not get out of second gear. That Villarreal side there was like playing the last group game against a side that’s not even good enough to drop into the Europa League. “It was shocking. Liverpool are brilliant – but that was a disgrace to the Champions League. There are players who haven’t even broken a sweat in a Champions League semi-final. “There’s only one team that can do anything to Liverpool right now and that’s Man City, maybe Chelsea in a one-off. They are streets ahead. Villarreal were beaten before the first whistle went. “West Ham would give them a better game. Everton gave them a better game. I’ve got no idea how Villarreal have made it this far. “I can’t believe what I’ve witnessed. I reckon you could’ve had a fan alongside Van Dijk tonight.  “You could’ve pulled a fan out of the stadium and said, ‘Look – it’s your lucky day, you’re going to play for Liverpool in the semi-final of the Champions League, get your kit on’. “That’s how bad Villarreal were.” When asked to defend his view by a Liverpool fan, who highlighted Villarreal’s resilience for much of the first hour, Cundy added: “The only shock is that it’s only 2-0. “It was like watching Tyson Fury vs Dillian Whyte at the weekend. “Liverpool were just hitting them with little jabs and eventually they were going to get their knockout.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

City are still leading the title race but know that nothing but a win will do against the Whites as Liverpool hunt them down. Neither City or Liverpool have slipped up in recent weeks and the away side will be looking to seal another huge result. However, Leeds are unbeaten in their last five league games under Jesse Marsch, so you would expect Elland Road to be rocking on Saturday afternoon. The American has made the Whites a lot more solid and they haven’t conceded a goal in over 221 minutes of football. But despite their upturn in form, Leeds aren’t safe yet and are part of the relegation fight along with Everton and Burnley. They are five points clear of the drop zone but 18th-placed Everton have a game in hand, so they probably need something from this match, which should give Liverpool fans hope. Marsch has faced Guardiola once as a manager; he lost, but Leeds look a lot better defensively under the American, so this will be a test for the defending champions.  This Premier League clash will take place at Elland Road on Saturday, April 30, with kick-off at 5.30pm. This match will be exclusively live on talkSPORT and coverage will start at 5pm with Faye Carruthers. Commentary will come from Clive Tyldesley and former Manchester City man Trevor Sinclair.

Subs: Zinchenko, Steffen, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Egan-Riley, Mbete-Tabu, McAtee.  Leeds boss Marsch has described City as the best team in the world and called on his players to make a nuisance of themselves against Guardiola’s title-chasers. “I know that a lot of times, playing against the relegation teams can be a pesky match and that’s our job on the day, to make the match pesky for Man City,” Marsch said. “They’ve got an aura, they’ve got quality. They’ve got everything – money, success, expertise – they’ve got everything. “It’s incredible to have these kinds of clubs in the world in our sport that are just so dominant in every phase. “The make-up of what the club is in terms of the network of other clubs that they’re connected with. The power behind the club and this team is incomparable.” ",positive

The Portuguese forward got his third via a stunning free-kick late on in the game as the Premier League club capitalised on Tottenham’s loss against Brighton. Although its been a difficult season for the Old Trafford side, there is still some light at the end of tunnel for them. Following Spurs’ 1-0 defeat to Brighton, the Red Devils knew a victory would put them to within three points, with six games remaining. And despite the protests that happened in the game, and outside of the ground, where Man United fans were portraying their anger at the Glazer family, the players remained professional on the pitch, and got the job done. It was the perfect start for Ralf Rangnick’s side, albeit with a bit of luck. Playing out of the back, Norwich defender Ben Gibson was dispossessed by Anthony Elanga who had the simple task of passing the ball across the box for Ronaldo to virtually tap in. Even though the Red Devils were good value for their lead, they were not comfortable in the match, and on the counter-attack, the Canaries should have done more to test the hosts’ goal. But they were unable to do so, and midway through the second half, Ronaldo doubled his goal tally.   From an in swinging corner by Alex Telles, Ronaldo got away from Gibson and in typical fashion buried the header into the bottom left past Tim Krul. Whilst the hosts merited the two goal lead, they were never comfortable as Norwich showed great character to get themselves back in the contest. Finding his way into the left hand side of the penalty box, Pukki had time and space to weigh up his options, and delivered a perfect cross to the far post where Kieran Dowell had the simple task of heading past David De Gea. Prior to the game, the Everton academy product spoke to talkSPORT and said there could be an ‘upset’ on the cards when his side face Manchester United in their next game.   And whilst his side couldn’t live up to his words, he certainly did by getting his side back into the game, and then providing an excellent assist for the Finnish forward. The 24-year-old hadn’t scored or assisted in the league this season until today, but picked one of the best grounds to find his goal scoring touch. Things could have gone even better for the bottom side in the Premier League as De Gea was forced to make a few good saves. But they were unable to take the chances, and with Ronaldo on the pitch, the hosts always had a chance of winning the game.  Winning a free-kick after Elanga had been fouled, the 37-year-old stepped up and smashed his effort in. It cannoned off the left-post, and even though Krul got a hand on to it, he was unable to keep the ball out. It was a massive goal for the Red Devils, and one that could prove to be crucial if Rangnick’s side are to qualify for the Champions League next season. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The 37-year-old signed a two-year deal on his return to Old Trafford last summer, however, the club’s disappointing Premier League season has led to speculation he could bring his stay to an end early. The Portuguese was recently linked with a move back to Real Madrid, who he played for between 2009 and 2018. Meanwhile, the imminent arrival of Erik ten Hag as manager has led to questions over whether there would be any room in his team for Ronaldo. But club legend Keane is in no doubt that Ronaldo will be part of things next season. Asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford – their final home match of the season – could be Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong, Keane said: “I wouldn’t have thought so. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.”  Although it’s been a campaign to forget for the 13-time Premier League winners, Ronaldo can hold his head high. So far he has 24 goals to his name, 18 of them in the league. His latest came in their 3-0 win against the Bees as he slotted home a penalty in the second half. And during that celebration he appeared to hint he was staying on beyond the summer by pointing to himself and then Old Trafford as he took in the crowd’s cheers.

53,https://talksport.com/football/1084657/pep-guardiola-press-conference-fernandinho-man-city-exit/,‘Sorry? I didn’t know!’ – Pep Guardiola surprised in press conference as Fernandinho announces plan to leave Manchester City this summer,"Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho has announced this will be his last season at the club – much to the surprise of manager Pep Guardiola. The 36-year-old, who has spent nine years at the Etihad and won 11 major trophies, is out of contract in June and does not intend on signing a new deal. Many expected the 2020/21 campaign to be his last, but having signed an extension, the Brazilian has spent most of this season on the sidelines. Fernandinho is now planning a return to his homeland in search of minutes. Asked if he would like to extend his stay for another year, he replied: “No, I want to play regularly. “I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important for me.” City boss Guardiola reacted with surprise when informed of the news in his press conference – which followed shortly after Fernandinho addressed the media. “Sorry?” he asked. “Oh, I didn’t know it!”  “You give me the news. I didn’t hear it. We will see what happens. I don’t know what will happen. He is so important. I’ll ask him.” The City boss added: “At the end of the season we talk, maybe it’s because of his family. I would love it. We will talk.” Having been a key player for City ever since his arrival from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, Fernandinho has been forced to play second fiddle to Rodri in recent years. The club captain made his last start for City in the home Champions League tie against Sporting in early March. Nevertheless, Guardiola insists Fernandinho’s role off the pitch has been immense. Guardiola added: “The role he plays this season – I like the people who behave behind the scenes.  “I know what he has done, behind me, he handles many of our players and stars for the benefit of the team. “I praise him and he was here when I arrive. Raheem (Sterling), Kevin (De Bruyne), John (Stones), a few players. We know him well, from day one to now always here. “An incredible player for Man City. There are things nobody knows but I know exactly.” Fernandinho followed up his revelation with two tweets, adding: “I was 100% honest and spontaneous in answering that question at today’s press conference. But anyone who knows me also knows that my greatest honesty is with Man City and my duties as team captain. “My focus is 100% on winning all the titles we are playing for and I will only talk about my future at the end of the season.

54,https://talksport.com/football/1094005/arsenal-gabriel-jesus-transfer-man-city-premier-league/,Arsenal ‘believe transfer can be completed’ for Gabriel Jesus as Man City’s four-goal star refuses to commit future to Premier League leaders,"Arsenal are keen on signing Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus this summer, with the Brazilian star refusing to commit his future to the Premier League title challengers. The 25-year-old forward has just one year left on his current deal at the Etihad Stadium, having joined the club in 2017, and it’s understood the Gunners see him as an ideal candidate to bolster their attacking options.  Mikel Arteta is expected to lose senior strikers Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah come the end of the campaign once their current contracts expire – meaning the Spaniard will soon be without any experienced centre-forwards. Now, according to the Daily Mail, ‘preparations for the club’s summer transfer strategy are under way’, and natural centre-forward Jesus is a ‘prominent’ part of their plans. It’s also been reported signing the Brazil international as ‘a deal the Gunners believe can be completed’ given he is ‘expected to seek a move’. The former Palmeiras goal scorer has been unable to cement a spot in City’s starting line-up this season, and reports have suggested he is looking to secure regular game time elsewhere. He perhaps sent a message to his club, as well as his suitors, by firing four goals past Watford in a 5-1 victory on Saturday as he completed the 90 minutes for only the tenth time this term. And when speaking following his stellar performance, Jesus opted not to confirm where he would be playing next season.   When quizzed on whether he would like to fight for a place in Pep Guardiola’s starting XI, Jesus said: “It’s not time to think about this. You expect me to say this, but it’s true. “This is no time to think about this. Now is the best moment of the season.” He continued: “It’s not just me, it’s [all] the players. If you ask, everyone’s going to say ‘I want to play’ and the season that I arrived here I played a lot, I think.” “I know what I expect of course but I know we have very good players who can play every game as well and sometimes it’s not just me, it’s Riyad [Mahrez], sometimes Raz [Sterling], and [Jack] Grealish arrives this season and sees how it is here. “We have a lot of good strikers, wingers and forwards.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
55,https://talksport.com/football/1086678/sean-dyche-leaves-burnley-premier-league-relegation-battle/,Burnley sack Sean Dyche with just eight games left to save Premier League status,"Burnley have parted company with Sean Dyche with just eight games left of the Premier League season. The Clarets currently sit 18th in the table and are four points away from Everton in 17th. The 50-year-old, who signed a new contract due to run until the summer of 2025 in September, had been the longest-serving manager of any club in the Premier League, having taken charge in October 2012. During that time he had twice led the Clarets to promotion and brought European football to Turf Moor in 2018 despite a limited budget, but his side have been in the bottom three virtually all season and last week’s 2-0 defeat at Norwich was seen as a major setback in their survival bid. The club posted on social media about the decision to axe Dyche and released a statement.  Chairman Alan Pace said: “Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Seanand his staff for their achievements at the Club over the last decade. “During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. “However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. “The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.” Pace, whose ALK Capital group took over at Turf Moor in December 2020, said club captain Ben Mee would be part of the coaching staff for Sunday’s trip to West Ham as a replacement is sought. “Under-23s coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee have been asked to take charge of the team for Sunday’s game with West Ham United,” Pace added. “The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
56,https://talksport.com/football/1100088/cristiano-ronaldo-age-stats-manchester-united-premier-league/,Cristiano Ronaldo proves that age is but a number as key Manchester United stat emerges following goal against Brentford in Premier League win,"Manchester United have lacked much in the way of success this term, but Cristiano Ronaldo might just be the exception. In a largely disappointing season, the 37-year-old has been one of the few bright spots after completing a move from Juventus last summer and proving to the football world he very much still has it. Given Ronaldo’s age, plenty of pundits suggested the Portugal star might struggle to thrive in the elite environment of the Premier League, but if there’s one thing CR7 enjoys it’s the pressure of proving people wrong. After scoring twice on his second United debut in the 4-1 victory over Newcastle, supporters knew their former hero had not lost any of his sparkle and that’s become abundantly clear in the months since. In fact, there’s even a suggestion that he’s got better since he was last at the club. Ronaldo’s last season at Old Trafford was in the 2008/09 campaign in which the forward racked up 18 goals in 33 Premier League appearances. This term, he’s exceeded that with time to spare. In 29 league appearances, three of which have come from the bench, Ronaldo has already scored 18 times.  With three top flight fixtures remaining, it would take a brave person to bet against Ronaldo exceeding that tally. Of course there’s ongoing speculation about whether the experienced forward will remain at United next term, but regardless of what the future holds, it’s clear that Ronaldo’s Old Trafford legacy is well and truly intact after his hugely successful swansong. With his immediate future in doubt, Piers Morgan made a rather bold call during his appearance on talkSPORT as he called for the player to leave United and move to his beloved Arsenal instead. Speaking ontalkSPORT Breakfast, Morgan said: “When it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, we’ve got the richest of all of them.  “Stan Kroenkehas got £10billion, he’s married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has £15billion. He’s just bought a ranch for £750million, he can afford to buy a couple of strikers! “Do you know what I’d do if I was Arsenal manager? I’d go in, get Cristiano Ronaldo and put him up front. I’ve had this conversation with him last week. I said ‘come to Arsenal’. “The Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting. On paper, United have far more talented players and far more experienced, talented players but they don’t have the right attitude. “The mental attitude is shocking. Whatever is going on in that club…if they didn’t have Ronaldo in the team they wouldn’t be winning, whereas Arsenal have young, hungry, really promising guys who have a great attitude. People like [Bukayo] Saka, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Kieran] Tierney and all of these guys.  “That’s what’s encouraging. If you combined the United talent with our mentality then both clubs would be sorted. “I’m not even joking. I’d love to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Arsenal. If he’s not going to stay at United, I’d take him in a heartbeat. “I watched that game at the weekend and he was the best player on the pitch. “As a striker, when you watch Ronaldo’s movement and his goalscoring record at 37, I’d put Ronaldo at the front and let these kids learn from him.” However, for now it appears he is staying put judging by his most recent celebration at Old Trafford. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

Ten Hag will leave Ajax to take charge at Old Trafford in the summer, with current interim United manager Ralf Rangnick stepping aside as planned and moving into a consultancy role.  He has agreed a contract which will run until June 2025, with the option to extend for a further year. Ten Hag, 52, has been Ajax manager since 2017 and has won two Eredivisie titles and two Dutch Cups. He is on the verge of winning a third league title, with Ajax four points clear at the top of the table with five games left of the 2021/22 season. Ten Hag said: “It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. “I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. “It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.”  Rangnick has been in interim charge since November, having replaced the sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Solskjaer led the Red Devils for almost three years but was unable to win a trophy at the club where he became a legend in his playing days. His inability to succeed despite the signings of iconic forward Cristiano Ronaldo, England superstar Jadon Sancho and World Cup winner Raphael Varane curtailed his career with the club. German coach Rangnick then arrived in attempt to steady the ship until the end of the current campaign, before moving into a two-year consultancy role. But performances have continued to slip and Manchester United currently sit sixth in the Premier League table and facing a huge battle to finish in the top four. United’s 4-0 mauling at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday underlined the work required to turn around the 20-time champions, who have failed to launch a sustained title bid since last winning the league in 2013. Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino was the initial favourite to succeed Solskjaer, but Ten Hag ended up as the undisputed choice following a rigorous process. 🇳🇱👔The new First-Team Manager of Manchester United: Erik ten Hag.#MUFC || #WelcomeErik John Murtough, United’s football director, said of their new manager: “During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team’s attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. “In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. “We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer.” Ajax also confirmed the news with chief executive, and former Manchester United goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar saddened by the departure and insistent Ten Hag would remain focused on the Dutch giants’ title bid.  He said: “Four and a half years is a good amount of time, but we would have liked to have kept Erik at Ajax for longer. He is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world, in a fantastic league.” “We owe Erik a lot of thanks for what he has achieved with Ajax so far, but we are not done yet. At the end of the season, I will look back more extensively on his departure. For now, what matters is the final games of the season in which we all want to bring home the league title.” Meanwhile, Ten Hag added: “I’m happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important. But I only have one interest now and that’s these last five games. “I want to finish my time here on a positive note, by winning the league. By doing so, we’ll qualify directly for the Champions League. Ajax belongs there.”  Before becoming a coach, Ten Hag had a modest playing career in the Eredivisie with clubs including Twente and Utrecht. But his coaching career was a success from the off, leading Go Ahead Eagles to the Dutch top flight in his only season with the club in 2012/13. He then moved to Bayern Munich II, working near to current Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, a man he credits with influencing his philosophy. Speaking in 2019, he said: “I learned a lot from Guardiola.   “His philosophy is sensational, what he did in Barcelona, Bayern and now with Manchester City, that attacking and attractive style sees him win a lot. “It’s this structure that I’ve tried to implement with Ajax.” A two-year spell with Utrecht from 2015 saw them go from 11th before his arrival to a fifth place and fourth place finish in the Dutch top flight. And this transformative reign saw Ajax take the chance on him. They were richly rewarded too, with a stunning Champions League run in 2018/19 with homegrown talents, including Matthijs de Ligt, Donny van de Beek and Frenkie de Jong.  That ended in a semi-final loss to Tottenham Hotspur, despite out-playing them over both legs, and saw several stars, like De Ligt and De Jong, move on. Ten Hag, though, continued his success with a title in 2020/21 after the previous season was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajax are in pole position for the title in the current campaign with PSV Eindhoven four points behind with five games to play and it’s clear Ten Hag is intent on another trophy lift to end his time in Amsterdam. What a Saturday we have lined up. First up in the capital city is Arsenal vs Manchester United live on talkSPORT, with the visitors possibly boosted by the announcement of Erik ten Hag being named the permanent manager.

Indeed, the 23-year-old is loved by his country so much that he even received 10 votes in… no, not the Ballon d’Or – his country’s recent presidential election. Sunday’s election saw Emmanuel Macron re-elected for a second term, beating Marine Le Pen. But it seems some voters would have much preferred the France international as their political leader. According to French outlet Marca, Mbappe had been put forward as a candidate ‘in Tallenay, a small village of 400 inhabitants’ and received 10 votes in the eastern region. “We saw one come out, then two, then three…. it was very well done, they looked like real ballots,” the mayor of Tallenay said. “The name had not been scribbled quickly with a pen, but had been typed on a computer and then printed. “If Kylian Mbappe wants to come and discover our village, he is welcome,” added the mayor. The Paris Saint-Germain star admitted he’d received an onslaught of abuse on social media following his penalty miss against Switzerland in the round of 16 at the European Championship. However he has insisted he’s moved past it. “It is over now, it is behind me,” Mbappe told L’Equipe,“I have so much love for the French national team.” And his nomination for the top job in his country certainly shows the relationship between the player and Les Bleus supporters are more than fine.  Of course, a win in the presidential election never looked quite as likely as when his side secured the Ligue 1 title this season. However, stranger things have happened… ",positive

After failing to secure a good run in the Champions League and a host of wobbly league performances, the former Tottenham boss is expected to be sacked – despite securing the Ligue 1 title on Saturday. PSG are also understood to be in discussions with other potential suitors for the role. Both ex-Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane and Tottenham Hotspur boss Antonio Conte are reportedly options for the French side. And with Ten Hag confirmed to be taking over the reigns at Old Trafford this summer, Pochettino’s future now looks unclear. The Argentine had been the running for the job but missed out to the Dutchman who impressed the Old Trafford hierachy. That comes despite Sir Alex Ferguson liking the ex-Spurs man. So, what’s going on at PSG, who have they got their eyes on and what’s next for Poch? talkSPORT.com takes a look… “We understand that PSG are finalising the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino just days after they won the title,” Jim White said on Tuesday’s White and Jordan show. “We also hear [Antonio] Conte might be considered and that [Zinedine] Zidane might considered as a replacement.” The Ligue 1 giants have underperformed this year, despite their 10th title win in France. After failing to win away against any of the top six clubs, Pochettino has left fans unimpressed as he struggled to exert dominance in the league. This is despite his star studded squad, featuring Neymar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, with the Argentine struggling to showcase his considerable talents after joining on a free transfer from Barcelona. Pochettino also failed to get his side past the Champions League round of 16, losing 3-2 on aggregate against Real Madrid after throwing away a 1-0 lead in the first leg.  And European football expert Julien Laurens  confirmed the former Totteham boss’ tenure hasn’t quite been up to scratch for the French club. “It seems likely [he’s getting sacked],” Laurens told talkSPORT, “He’s got one year left on his contract, but it’s more and more likely that he won’t be there next season. “There’s a few things, you mentioned the Champions League, it’s not so much not winning the Champions League because there’s a lot of managers who would be sacked in that case for not winning it. “But it’s more the exit against Real Madrid, the way that happened. On top of that the team hasn’t been playing great this season despite the players that they have in terms of quality. “It’s an unbalanced squad, we’ve said that many times on the show, but still the football should have been much better than what we’ve seen so far. “And despite winning Ligue 1, which is the first real title for Pochettino which I think is really good for him, I don’t think it’s enough to keep him in the job.”  Former Crystal Palace chairman jordan believes Pochettino has got himself into an undesirable situation with an unconvincing title win and Champions League failure. “On the bigger scale of things, and with the exception of Lille, Ligue 1 is Paris Saint-Germain’s staple diet of consumption,” he began. “The Champions League, with all the investment they put in to the players, with the signing of [Lionel] Messi and so and so forth, I think he reaps what he sows. “He wanted to bat his eye lids at Manchester United earlier on in the season, he wanted to make sure he was available in the conversation, and that was coming from his end, guaranteed. “I don’t know where this leaves Pochettino,” Jordan continued, “Where does he go next? He’ll have won the French league, he’ll have that as some sort of currency. 🔟 Championships𝟏𝟗𝟖𝟔 – 𝟏𝟗𝟗𝟒 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟑 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟒 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟓 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟔 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟖 – 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟗 – 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎 – 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟐🔴 #𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗠𝗣𝟭𝟬𝗡𝗦 🔵 pic.twitter.com/iOQ948VJhE “But I don’t see him coming out of PSG and everyone going ‘Oh, he’s a commodity we must now have’.” And Laurens agreed with Jordan, stating that Pochettino being ‘desperate’ to make the switch to Old Trafford has not helped his cause this season. The PSG boss had been one of United’s options to become their next permanent manager and had been strongly linked when the position became available in November. However, fellow candidate and Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag seemed to wow the Red Devils, pushing Pochettino down the pecking order, and the Dutchman has since been confirmed as United’s boss for next season. “He [Pochettino] wanted to go in the autumn, so why would they [PSG] keep a manager who was so desperate to leave to go to United when [Ole Gunnar] Solskjaer was sacked?” Laurens asked. Pochettino has long missed the boat with United, but Laurens still  believes his reputation is still good in France. A return to Spurs could be an option for him, should current boss Conte leave for his soon-to-be vacant position at PSG.  White quizzed Lauren’s on Pochettino’s potential replacements – Zidane and Conte – and the journalist confirmed that whilst Zidane was top of PSG’s wish list, the possibility of the Tottenham boss being appointed isn’t dead in the water. The journalist said: “Zidane is the priority, 100 per cent, and they’ve been talking to him for a while now and he’s still undecided, because again, in the back of his mind is the French national team. “He knows he’s the next guy after [Didier] Deschamps – that is, whenever Deschamps steps down. The problem is no one knows when Deschamps will do that.  He continued: “Zidane might have to wait a long time, and he doesn’t want to wait a long time to go back into management. So PSG is very tempting to him too, but he hasn’t decided yet.” Then, there’s the Ligue 1 champion’s other option – Conte. Having only taken over the job at Spurs in November, the Italian’s contract will still have another year left come the end of this season. However, rumours suggesting a possible premature exit for the former Chelsea boss have been mounting.  Given Spurs’ are still fighting to secure Champions League football and it’s likely Conte will have doubts over club chairman Daniel Levy’s willingness to invest in the team, it’s possible he could be open to the idea of a move to PSG. And this is something Laurens confirmed he’d heard rumblings of – meaning there is still a possibility that Pochettino and Conte could switch roles. “I think Antonio Conte was quite clever in a way,” he said. “He’s done a decent job at Spurs, they could finish in the top four. In that case I think he’ll be happy to stay. “Especially if the club says ‘we’re going to back you up financially and we’re going to recruit good players, the ones that you want’.  “And if he misses top four he can easily say ‘well I’ve had other offers’, he’s already offered himself to PSG, he’s already put a plan together even – who he wants to work with over there, the money he’s looking for. He continued:  “I think if PSG can’t get Zidane, and sack Pochettino, he will certainly be on the shortlist. “I believe from what I’ve been told, they’re [PSG and Conte] are in informal talks. It’s not Conte himself of course, it’s people around him. But there’s already been talks.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

The Chelsea defender will leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season on a free transfer. Manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed at the weekend that Rudiger had informed him he would be joining another club. It has not been confirmed what club that would be, but it has been widely reported that Madrid will be the destination. Real Madrid manager Ancelotti was asked about the rumours that the centre-back had already agreed a four-year deal with his side. The boss was quizzed after his side’s seven goal thriller with Man City in the Champions League semi-finals, but he batted away the question in humorous fashion. Ancelotti said: “Toni Rudiger? Toni who? Who’s this?! [laughs]. “He’s STILL a Chelsea player… I can’t say anything about this.” ""Antonio Rüdiger… Who is this?!"" 😏The reaction from Carlo Ancelotti should tell you all you need to know about that potential transfer! 🎤 @AndyKerrtv #beINUCL #UCL #MCIRMAWatch Now 👉 https://t.co/NRYe31nXnO pic.twitter.com/jhcJdp3WcJ  Defensive reinforcements may be top of the agenda for the Italian in the summer after seeing his side concede four times against Man City in the  first leg of their last-four tie. City roared out of the blocks with two early goals, before a wonderful finish by Karim Benzema pegged them back. Phil Foden scored early in the second-half but Vinicius Junior replied almost immediately, with Bernardo Silva striking home a thunderous effort as City stepped up a gear. Benzema then scored an outrageous Panenka penalty to make it 4-3 and leave the second leg on a knife edge. The ease at which City were able to carve open the Madrid defence will likely be a huge concern for Ancelotti and Rudiger may be just the solution he is looking for. talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

The Ineos owner has said he will invest £1.75bn over the next ten years, which will help make Stamford Bridge a ‘world-class stadium’. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. “£2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. “That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. “This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” He is said to have explored the possibilities of purchasing the club back in 2019, only to buy French club Nice instead.  Ratcliffe’s previous due diligence on the club will expedite the process of his bid, minimising any delays in the sale process headed up by New York merchant bank the Raine Group. Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca were all hoping to hear this week which of their consortium offers to buy the Blues had been selected as the preferred bid. However, Ratcliffe’s late entrance adds another heavyweight bid to the battle to buy the club from Abramovich. Chelsea will still hope to have a new owner in place by the end of May, despite any delays that come from Ratcliffe’s late entry into the race for the Stamford Bridge club. Once the Raine Group selects a preferred bidder, the Government must then grant a new licence to allow the sale to be completed. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. ",positive

That’s according to Guardian journalist Fabrizio Romano, who says that Barca boss Xavi – who has turned around the club’s fortunes since he was appointed in November – wants the superstar striker. It would reunite Lewandowski with ex-Arsenal man Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who played together under Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund. The former Gunner has been in exceptional form since arrving at the Camp Nou with 10 goals in 14 games. This has fired Barca up the table and, if they win their game in hand, could be just nine points behind LaLiga leaders Real Madrid, who have seven games to go. And next season Aubameyang could find himself alongside one of the best strikers in world football once again. They played next to each other back in 2013/14 for Borussia Dortmund with Lewandowski scoring 28 goals in all competitions and Aubameyang netting 18. The duo also combined six times with the Pole assisting the Gabon star five times. It appears they could now dovetail once more, this time in Spain. Romano tweeted: “Bayern have received no communication from Robert Lewandowski and still want him to stay. “He’s well informed on Barcelona by asking some players, Xavi wants him. “Barca are in contact with his agent, Lewandowski asks for a three-year deal – but nothing has been agreed yet.” This comes the summer after Chelsea were reportedly keen on the Polish striker, who was ‘keen’ on a move to west London, according to The Athletic. It is said that Lewandowski waskeen on a moveto Stamford Bridge but, with two years left on his contract, Bayern’s stance was that their star man was unsellable.  They, instead, re-signed Romelu Lukaku, who is still yet to find his feet back at the club.

The Norwegian striker has long been linked to the Premier League club and head to the team his father, Alf-Inge, played for in the early 2000s. The 21-year-old has become one of the most coveted talents in world football as he developed into a deadly striker at Borussia Dortmund. He has a remarkable record of 82 goals in 85 games since joining from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, opting for Germany over Manchester United. A £63million release clause in his contract means he is available for a cut price fee and all the top clubs in Europe have been sounded out. His dad, and the player’s agent Mino Raiola, have held talks with a number of teams as they weigh-up their next move. The list of candidates have been whittled down to City, Barcelona and Real Madrid. The Mail report that City have agreed terms with Haaland’s representatives to make him the highest paid player in the Premier League.  The five-year £500,000-a-week they are prepared to pay him would eclipse the money being paid to Cristiano Ronaldo. The report adds that the £63million release clause is set to be triggered imminently. Dortmund have denied that a deal is in place, but it seems inevitable that Haaland will be playing away from the Bundesliga club. City have been playing without a recognised centre forward for the majority of the season and former Rangers striker Ally McCoist thinks this is terrifying for the rest of the league.  He told talkSPORT Breakfast: “From City’s point of view, could that be the final piece of the jigsaw? To be fair, they’ve been doing better than alright without a recognised centre forward. “I think it is terrifying for the rest of the league. The scary thing is they are not even getting the finished article. “They’re getting a 21-year-old machine. He is going to develop. He’s got all of the qualities to develop into one of the best ever. “He’s powerful, quick and clever. Scores all sorts of goals.

Pep Guardiola’s side are the favourites to land the prolific Norway international ahead of the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Recent reports suggested the Sky Blues had won the race for his signature, but these claims have since been rebuffed by the Dortmund chief. Haaland is understood to be keen on a move to the Premier League and to learn from Guardiola. In response to the reports, Kehl pointed to Haaland’s €80million (around £67m) release clause, tellingSky Deutschland: “There is a release clause, you know, and there is a deadline. “We want to make a decision as soon as possible. Erling always wants to play and you always try to make a good decision together with him.” Kehl was also recently asked whether any club had already expressed an interest in paying the players release clause. The Dortmund chief bluntly replied: “No.” In March it was revealed the striker had discussed personal terms with City with the Premier League champions were prepared pay him an eye watering £500,000 a week.  Haaland’s agent, Mino Raiola, could also earn a huge bonus along with the player’s father, former City midfielder Alf-Inge. Should Haaland move to the Etihad, the deal could come close to the £100m mark, but would provide City with a centre-forward option, having previously missed out on Harry Kane. So far this season, Haaland has netted 25 goals and contributed nine assists from 26 appearances in a Dortmund shirt. He also has 15 goals in 17 appearances for his country.

Gabriel Jesus was the star of the show with four of the hosts’ goals at the Etihad Stadium – the Brazilian putting in a stunning showing after being linked with a surprise transfer to Arsenal. Reports emerged earlier on Saturday that the Gunners are keen on signing the striker in the summer. It’s claimed the 25-year-old is even ‘open’ to the idea of the switch, with Arsenal chiefs and his representatives in open dialogue ‘for a number of months’. And the City star certainly sent a message to his current club, as well as his suitors, with a ruthless display against Watford. Liverpool fans were hoping former manager Roy Hodgson would be able to do them a favour in the title race as he took his Hornets to Manchester, but they did not get their wish. Jesus put City 2-0 up within 23 minutes of play with two simple finishes, before Hassane Kamara scored gave the visitors some hope of a comeback. However, that hope was extinguished quite quickly, and in some style too, as Rodri made it 3-1 just minutes later with an absolute rocket.   City put the result out of sight after the break as a Jesus penalty and another tap-in from the Brazilian completed his four-goal haul and a big win for Pep Guardiola’s men. The three points puts the pressure back on Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby against Everton, and also closed the goal difference gap between the title rivals to just two – City have now netted 59 times this term, while the Reds have plundered 61. The game also brought Jesus into renewed focus, following reports from The Athletic that his future could be away from Manchester City. The Brazil international is approaching the final year of his contract at the Etihad, which ends in 2023.   City are also believed to be closing in on a stunning move to land Erling Haaland, which would knock Jesus down the pecking order. He has often played second-fiddle throughout his Premier League career, first to club legend Sergio Aguero, and it’s unlikely he’d want to stay and sign a new deal just to sit on the bench. Enter Arsenal, who have reportedly been in extensive talks with the player’s representatives as Mikel Arteta looks to sign a new main centre-forward in the upcoming summer transfer window.  Having allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join Barcelona in January, and with Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah both out of contract in the summer, Jesus would have the opportunity to be Arsenal’s Batman after years of being City’s Robin. Arteta has previously worked with Jesus during his career as a coach under City boss Guardiola, and it’s claimed the Emirates would be his most likely next destination if he did leave. Jesus has made 229 appearances for City since his 2017 arrival from boyhood Brazilian club Palmeiras for £27million, scoring 89 goals and providing 45 assists. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Borussia Dortmund striker is set to join the Premier League champions this summer, with City willing to pay his release clause of £63million. The 21-year-old has become one of the most coveted talents in world football having developed into a deadly striker at Dortmund. Haaland, who joined the German side from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, has a remarkable 82 goals in 85 games for Dortmund. He also helped Dortmund win the DFB-Pokal (German FA Cup) last season. According to Transfermarkt, his value stands at £135m, so for Man City to be signing him for less than half of that price, could prove to be one of the best signings in their history. A number of clubs want to sign him, with his dad Alfe-Inge Haaland and his agent Mino Raiola reportedly speaking to a number of Europe’s big hitters, including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. The latest reports suggest City have agreed terms with Haaland’s representatives which would make him the highest paid player in the Premier League. One of those terms include his salary, which reports suggest will stand at half a million quid every week. Speaking on White and Jordan, the former Crystal Palace chairman was far from happy when hearing about the figures involved, labelling the amounts of money as ‘ridiculous’ and ‘obscene.’   “We are already in the territory of ridiculous level of a return for footballers,” Jordan said. “I don’t begrudge anybody making money, people deserve to be successful. And in their field if they’re good at what they do, they should get rewarded. “But we are getting into the level of what footballers are getting paid, it’s ridiculous. “Now I don’t know whether this is £500,000-a-week after tax or £500,000-a-week before tax, either which way, we are moving into a territory of obscene amounts of money.  “No one should really want this, we throw these figures around in a country that’s got foodbanks up the ying-yang as if 500-grand-a-week on a footballer is something we should all accept. “They’re not worth it, he’s not worth £500,000-a-week, and these players that are getting paid this kind of money aren’t worth it. “Back in the day when people were making lots and lots of money, do you know what the key component was? You had to be really, really, really good. “And it seems to me now in football, you can be quite average and become a multi-multi-millionaire.  “It’s not bitterness, it’s not resentment, I’ve had my time and I made a lot of money, and I was really good at what I did, and I wasn’t so good at other things, that’s why I cost myself a lot of money. “In this world of football, it seems to be sometimes, and not in the case of Erling Haaland, because he isn’t mediocre. “But what the 500-grand salary does, it makes a 200-grand salary look like it’s an average pay. So someone that is average in the Premier League gets paid £10million a year. “And you’ve got to sit back and pause for a second and go, half of these players can only kick with one foot.  “And you look at it and go, how do you get £10million-a-year to be an average footballer, that’s what a £500,000 salary does.” Whilst Pep Guardiola is set to bring in one of the best players in the world, Jordan doesn’t believe Haaland will send the club into the ‘stratosphere’. “We’ve got a big six in this league which [some of them] consist of Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, arguably,” he added. “And those clubs are not going to sit on their hands and allow those clubs to disappear into the ether.  “Liverpool are margins away from Manchester City, margins. So I look at it and say yes it’s a component part [signing Haaland] that Man City haven’t got, and it will add to them. “But I don’t think it will send them into the stratosphere. “I think Liverpool have bought a boy in [Luis] Diaz, that will change the direction of travel for Liverpool. “So I think there will still be the competitivity [in the league].” 😫 “No one should really want this… It’s ridiculous! It’s obscene amounts.”🤦‍♂️ “We throw these figures around in a country that has foodbanks as if it’s something we should accept!”Simon Jordan passionately reacts to #MCFC offering Haaland £500k-a-week. pic.twitter.com/IWvyQgnrsr 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

Ndombele, who’s on loan at Lyon from Spurs, slotted in the French side’s equaliser after Jarrod Bowen had put the Hammers in front early in the second half.  Lyon have the advantage going into the second leg in April 14, however, David Moyes’ men can be proud of the result having spent the second half a man light. Aaron Cresswell was sent off for pulling Moussa Dembele down on the stroke of half time, but the decision by referee Felix Zwayer didn’t sit well with many, with Hammers boss Moyes being yellow carded for his protests at half time. Former West Ham player Alvin Martin said on commentary for talkSPORT: “The thing I can’t understand is that I think he’s going away from goal… Zouma I thought was closer but on the replay he seems to stop he should keep going. “That’s a massive turning point in the tie, there’s no doubt about it. This has not been a difficult game to referee but he’s made it more difficult. He’s created issues of his own making. “Dembele’s not through on goal, Cresswell has touched him but maybe the referee could’ve given a yellow card and I don’t think there would’ve been any argument from either manager.” Martin added: “For me it was a yellow all day long.   “Two players went down for Lyon earlier and the referee stopped the game for them. He had no right to stop the game. But as soon as he does that he sets a precedent for the game but when Bowen goes down why doesn’t he do the same thing?” Nevertheless, a draw keeps West Ham’s dream of a place in the semi-finals, against either Barcelona or Eintracht Frankfurt, well and truly alive. It promises to be a spicy return leg in the culinary capital of France after tempers occasionally boiled over, while Dembele’s wink, which bore resemblance to Cristiano Ronaldo’s wink after Wayne Rooney was sent off at the 2006 World Cup, after Cresswell’s red card will not have gone unnoticed among the Hammers ranks. Lyon may be having an erratic season domestically – they currently lie ninth in Ligue 1 – but they are unbeaten in this competition and knocked out Porto in the last 16. They are also seasoned European campaigners and quickly began to showcase their repertoire of the darker arts, infuriating West Ham when Jerome Boateng and Ndombele both stayed down after no foul had been given.   German referee Zwayer seemed taken in by their antics, stopping play each time with West Ham looking to attack. Then, in first-half stoppage time and with West Ham frustration growing, Cresswell suddenly found himself chasing down Dembele and pulled him back on the edge of the box. Kurt Zouma was also on the scene as cover but Zwayer decided Cresswell was the last man and pulled out a straight red card, to the obvious delight of the winking Dembele and the dismay of David Moyes. The Hammers manager’s grasp of German is not known, but he evidently made his feelings clear enough as Zwayer booked him as he stormed down the tunnel.  But West Ham’s sense of injustice fuelled them into taking the lead seven minutes into the second half. Michail Antonio’s burst forward caused havoc in the Lyon defence and Pablo Fornals tried to slip in Bowen. Boateng made a mess of his attempt to control the ball and it rolled behind Bowen, but the winger managed to retrieve it, turn and clip the ball over Lyon keeper Anthony Lopes via a deflection off the sliding Boateng. However, Lyon grabbed a 66th-minute equaliser when Ndombele got in the box to fire home from six yards after a cross from substitute Tete hit Ryan Fredericks.    There was a sour note to the match after a pitch invader – the second of the game – jumped out of the home end and actually stopped a promising Hammers attack before he was escorted off. Dembele put a header over as West Ham saw out eight nervy minutes of stoppage time to give themselves a fighting chance in seven days. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The first leg of the quarter-final tie turned on the stoppage-time incident as Cresswell was shown a straight red for pulling Lyon forward Moussa Dembele down on the edge of the box.  Replays showed the former Celtic forward, who winked at the Lyon bench after Cresswell was sent off, wouldn’t have had a clear run at goal and former Hammer Alvin Martin believes the decision was harsh. Martin said on commentary for talkSPORT: “The thing I can’t understand is that I think he’s going away from goal… Zouma I thought was closer but on the replay he seems to stop he should keep going. “That’s a massive turning point in the tie, there’s no doubt about it.

He’s created issues of his own making. “Dembele’s not through on goal, Cresswell has touched him but maybe the referee could’ve got a yellow card and I don’t think there would’ve been any argument from either manager.” The half-time whistle was blown shortly afterwards and Moyes was then disciplined by Zwayer as he gave the German official a piece of his mind. But Moyes’ anger was quite justified in talkSPORT host Hugh Woozencroft’s eyes, who accused Zwayer of treating the players ‘like children.’  Woozencroft said on talkSPORT: “You’d think the referee has a toddler and he was refereeing the game in his back garden at the weekend because he has treated the players like children. “You used to have to foul a player for it to be a foul, now you touch a player and it’s a foul. I really expected VAR to overturn that.” Martin added: “For me it was a yellow all day long. “Two players went down for Lyon earlier and the referee stopped the game for them. He had no right to stop the game. But as soon as he does that he sets a precedent for the game but when Bowen goes down why doesn’t he do the same thing?” West Ham responded to the setback impeccably as Jarrod Bowen put them ahead early in the second half. However, the French side got level as Tanguy Ndombele fired in a loose ball after Ryan Fredericks failed to fully clear Tete’s low cross as the two sides played out a 1-1 draw. 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The Premier League side managed to secured a 1-1 draw with the French giants in a rocking London Stadium, a result that was all the more impressive considering they played the majority of the game with just ten men. The decisive moment came just before half-time when Cresswell was given a red card for a challenge on Moussa Dembele. The West Ham dugout and supporters were left furious with the game-changing decision that left the Hammers with a huge challenge ahead of them – David Moyes was later booked for his protests toward the match officials at the break. Quizzed on the red card after the match, Moyes took a much more pragmatic approach to delivering his verdict, saying: “I’m certainly not going to talk about the referee, not at all. “The only thing I really want to focus on is do you think it’s a foul on Jarrod Bowen in the lead up to the goal? Because if it is, VAR should have intervened and brought it back. “That’s what we do in the Premier League, it’s in the same phase of play and I’d have expected VAR to have checked that.” Moyes’ stance was echoed by Craig Dawson, who when asked about the referee’s decision, said: “He makes his decision very quickly, but there’s not much that we can do as players.  “We have to deal with it and I think we did that tonight and put in a great shift.” One man who did not mince his words was talkSPORT’s Jason Cundy, who described the referee’s display at the London Stadium as ‘shocking’. First describing him as ‘a clown’, Cundy later told The Sports Bar: “I don’t even think it’s a foul. “I can’t believe the referee, he was a shocker. The referee was shocking.  “Everyone slaughters the referees that we’ve got here in the Premier League. I’ve said this for years, I think that we’ve got the best referees in the world, I genuinely do. “They make big mistakes sometimes, but I see what goes on on the continent and some of the debacles that go on. “I don’t think there’s actually a foul. I honestly don’t think it’s a foul, let alone a red card. The referee could have played on. He touches his arm, he doesn’t drag him or pull him, Dembele goes over, cons the referee and the referee cannot wait to get the red card out. “They’ve been mugged off there, West Ham.”  In response, Darren Ambrose added: “I don’t think it’s a foul, but at the very worst you can pull him up, give a yellow and a little free-kick. That’s at the very worst. “He could not wait to get the red card out. “Look at the size of Moussa Dembele compared to Cresswell, he’s hardly touched him. He’s brushed by him with his shoulder. “It’s not enough to fall over like that.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive

The outspoken TV host and diehard Gunners fan says Ronaldo is not given the right respect in Manchester United’s ‘arrogant’ dressing room, and he’d be better off helping Arsenal return to their rightful place in the Premier League title race.  Manchester United are going through a huge period of transition and look set to make plenty of changes this summer after appointing Erik ten Hag as their new permanent manager. The Dutch boss is facing a big rebuilding job at Old Trafford, similar to the one faced by Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium. Despite faltering form in recent weeks, having lost three straight games against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, big back-to-back wins over Chelsea and Man United sees the Gunners still firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish as they compete with rivals Tottenham for a spot in the Champions League. While passionate Gooner Morgan was full of praise of Arteta’s talented young stars, he believes a stunning move for global superstar Ronaldo would be the perfect addition to help the team return to the top. And he has even asked the Portuguese superstar directly to join his beloved club. Speaking on talkSPORT Breakfast, Morgan said: “When it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, we’ve got the richest of all of them.  “Stan Kroenke has got £10billion, he’s married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has £15billion. He’s just bought a ranch for £750million, he can afford to buy a couple of strikers! “Do you know what I’d do if I was Arsenal manager? I’d go in, get Cristiano Ronaldo and put him up front. “I’ve had this conversation with him last week. I said ‘come to Arsenal’. “The Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting. On paper, United have far more talented players and far more experienced, talented players but they don’t have the right attitude. “The mental attitude is shocking. Whatever is going on in that club…if they didn’t have Ronaldo in the team they wouldn’t be winning, whereas Arsenal have young, hungry, really promising guys who have a great attitude. People like [Bukayo] Saka, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Kieran] Tierney and all of these guys.   “That’s what’s encouraging. If you combined the United talent with our mentality then both clubs would be sorted. “I’m not even joking. I’d love to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Arsenal. If he’s not going to stay at United, I’d take him in a heartbeat. “I watched that game at the weekend and he was the best player on the pitch. “As a striker, when you watch Ronaldo’s movement and his goalscoring record at 37, I’d put Ronaldo at the front and let these kids learn from him.” Morgan added: “There’s a brilliant story from Saturday. I walked into this box and there is Dennis Bergkamp, my all-time Arsenal hero. 💬 ""We learned a lot from the English guys. They know what English football means. They know what Arsenal means, and you guys know that as well."" ❤️ Dennis Bergkamp pic.twitter.com/mHV3LwaR5f “I was telling Dennis about how Thierry Henry always gets annoyed when I say that Dennis is my number one, when there’s a tap on my shoulder and it’s Thierry! “I found myself doing a picture with the two of them, then I went down and saw that Arsenal released some footage of them talking to Smith Rowe and Saka and you could see the awe in those young guys’ faces. “I don’t feel like there’s that respect from those young guys at United for Ronaldo. “I think that the egos are writing cheques that the lack of trophies doesn’t cash, and my message to those young United stars is that you’re talented, but your egos are out of control and you should be begging Ronaldo for advice.  “If you had even a tenth of his work ethic, his ability, his success and his trophies all around the world then you’d be much better than you are now, but there’s an arrogance there about those players which we don’t have at Arsenal. “That’s not the problem. Bring in a couple of world-class players and then I might start to believe in the process.” You can watch the long-awaited return of Piers Morgan on his new showPiers Morgan Uncensored, every weeknight at 8pm on TalkTV – which debuts with an explosive world-exclusive interview with Former President Donald Trump.

The Gunners struck twice within 34 minutes via Nuno Tavares and Bukayo Saka before Ronaldo pulled one back for United – and Rangnick’s men had a glorious chance to equalise when a penalty was awarded in the second-half.  Much to everyone’s surprise, Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take it, not Ronaldo – and the midfielder miscued his effort onto the post and wide. Granit Xhaka subsequently put the game out of United’s reach, perhaps along with the top-four, given the Gunners are now six points ahead of the Red Devils with a game in hand. Ruing the penalty miss, Rangnick explained that Ronaldo, who announced the death of his new-born son five days ago, did not feel comfortable taking it. The German told talkSPORT: “The two of them talk about it and Cristiano told me he didn’t feel well enough, or didn’t feel as though he should take the penalty – and that’s why Bruno took it.” When asked whether it was to do with his recent personal tragedy, Rangnick answered: “I don’t know. You’ll have to ask him. “They’ve both taken penalties and converted penalties, so it’s up to the two of them to decide.”  Speaking on talkSPORT’s live commentary, ex-Premier League striker Dean Ashton suggested the penalty miss could cost United Champions League qualification – and Rangnick appears to agree. He admitted the spot-kick transformed the game and the result now leaves them unlikely to finish inside the top-four, with Tottenham also ahead of them and boasting a game in hand. “I think the equaliser in that moment, in one of our best moments of the game, would’ve changed it,” Rangnick added. “This would’ve lifted confidence. Even after that penalty, we still had the chance with Dalot when he hit the post. “For me, the second goal from Cristiano was not offside. We could watch it ourselves, that was in one line, there was no offside situation. “I also thought we were unlucky with other VAR situations besides that one.”  When asked about United’s top-four chances, he continued: “It’s mathematically not impossible, but it’s not very realistic. “A win today, or at least a draw after being 2-0 down, would’ve helped us.” 888Sport: Get 33/1 Villarreal to win OR 8/1 Liverpool (£5 max bet)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries &Full T&C’s apply 18+ Begambleaware.org ",positive
