Neville is a Red Devils legend and made more than 600 appearances for the club in an illustrious career that spanned from 1992 to 2011. He won 20 trophies during his time at the club, which included eight Premier League titles. There is still plenty of affection for the former right-back at Old Trafford and one fan was even sporting a unique scarf in Neville’s honour during their 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday. The Sky Sports cameras panned to the man in question, and Keane and Carragher couldn’t let the opportunity pass. “There must have been a sale on,” former Manchester United captain Keane said. Host David Jones said: “I’m sure they’ll catch on.” Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher added: “Gary Neville or Teabag?”  The Liverpool legend referencing that Neville has an uncanny likeness to the Prison Break character. Keane had some very kind words about Neville later on in Monday Night Football, though, as he picked him in his all-time Manchester United XI. The former midfielder said about the former England right-back: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. “He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself. You have to have quality to do what he did.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live! Win cash prizes every fortnight with talkSPORT’s new sportstriviagame.

2,https://talksport.com/football/1100217/arsenal-transfer-news-lautaro-martinez/,Arsenal to renew interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez with transfer hinging on Champions League with Man United also keen,"Arsenal have renewed their interest in signing Inter striker Lautaro Martinez. According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

3,https://talksport.com/football/1100129/aleksandar-mitrovic-goal-record-fulham-newcastle-premier-league-promotion-relegation-championship/,Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic holds astonishing record as former Newcastle man records fourth promotion of his career… and will hope to avoid another Premier League relegation,"Fulham are facing the challenge of adapting to life back in the Premier League after securing promotion from the Championship. Thankfully, in Aleksandar Mitrovic, they have a player who is used to making that transition – although the Serbian striker will now want to buck the trend of his unwanted record. A stunning 7-0 victory over Luton on Monday evening saw the Cottagers cement top spot in the second tier, with Mitrovic earning plaudits of his own. Scoring a brace at Craven Cottage, the 27-year-old frontman scored his 43rd goal of the season, becoming the Championship’s highest-ever goalscorer in a single campaign and the highest-scoring player in a single season in English football for over half a century. He surpassed Guy Whittingham’s 42 goals for Portsmouth in 1992/93, the most in the current 46-game league format, and only former Middlesbrough player George Camsell’s tally remains superior to Mitrovic’s in the division’s history, setting the frankly unbeatable record of 59 back in 1927/28. As a result, Mitrovic will be hoping to use some of those goals to help Fulham avoid relegation from the top flight next season. Unfortunately, based on his track record, facing the drop next term could be written in the stars. Mitrovic has spent seven years playing in English football, with the striker earning either promotion or suffering relegation in every one of those campaigns.   The former Newcastle United’s striker’s first season at St James’ Park saw the club relegated from the top flight in 2015/16, before being promoted again the next year. In 2017/18, Mitrovic spent the second half of the season on loan with Fulham, where he helped the club to earn promotion via the play-offs  with 12 goals in 20 matches. Since then, the 27-year-old has been part of the yo-yo culture at Craven Cottage, with two demotions and two promotions putting Fulham firmly in the category of inbetweeners. While surely proud of the promotions achieved, Mitrovic will no doubt be hoping that he can end this run next term by helping Fulham finally establish themselves as a Premier League club for more than just one year. talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

4,https://talksport.com/football/1100102/cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-jamie-carragher-liverpool-erling-haaland-transfers/,"‘Small club’ – Jamie Carragher slams Manchester United’s decision to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo, saying Erik ten Hag should look to sign Erling Haaland this summer","Manchester United’s move to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo last summer made Jamie Carragher think they were ‘a small club’, the Liverpool legend has revealed. The Red Devils have endured a difficult season by their own high standards, but the 37-year-old has been a rare shining light with his tally of 18 Premier League goals this term matching his final season at Old Trafford before leaving for £80miilion in 2009. Speculation is building about Ronaldo’s future at the club with a return to Real Madrid suggested as a potential solution, however that will depend on Erik ten Hag’s plans when he arrives this summer. With a big rebuild tipped, talk has started about how United can close the gap on the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City who are running away at the top of the tabl. And, according to Carragher, it’s time that United started focusing on long-term solutions if they’re to restore their status as one of Europe’s top teams. Speaking to Sky Sports, Carragher said: “I see Manchester United as one of the super clubs of world football, and I just look at the others ones like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, Barcelona; the ones who have won Champions Leagues. “Even Liverpool right now. Would Liverpool go and bring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think they would, even if they knew he was going to get 20 goals. “Manchester United, for me, should be signing [Erling] Haaland this summer. Man City are getting Haaland, while United have got Ronaldo.   “He is a legend and one of the best goalscorers of all time, and I get that – but it almost made me think that United are a small club. “It reminded me of Wayne Rooney going back to Everton. They knew they weren’t going to win something when Rooney came back but it gives everyone a lift, Wayne’s happy to go back.” Former Man United captain Roy Keane chimed in, saying: “It felt like a short-term fix. [ “[It was] for the fans, the share price and all that, but yeah, he’s still scored the goals that you thought he would do. “As you’ve said, Jamie, I think Man United have got bigger problems than Ronaldo, but it’s something that has to be looked at.”  Signing a new-look attack will be the main priority for United this summer but, according to Ralf Rangnick, that may not come in the form of a traditional number nine. The interim head coach explained: “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons.” Asked for specifics, Rangnick added: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger?  “They are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time, so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

6,https://talksport.com/football/1100162/jesse-lingard-man-utd-instagram-post-brother-classless/,Jesse Lingard’s brother hits out at ‘classless’ Manchester United as academy product is denied Old Trafford send off… but pundit questions if he deserves one,"Jesse Lingard’s brother hit out at Manchester United after the midfielder was denied a send off at Old Trafford. Lingard has been at the Red Devils for more than 20 years after first joining as a seven-year-old.  His time at United is set to end this summer when his contract expires, with the midfielder frustrated at the lack of first-team opportunities. The 29-year-old was left on the bench in United’s final home game of the season, which they won 3-0 against Brentford. Other players who are also leaving this summer, like Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic, were given the given the opportunity of a send off – with both named in the starting XI This prompted a furious reaction from Lingard’s brother, Louie Scott, on Instagram – which has since been deleted. “Twenty years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell,” his post read. “No wonder it’s [Europa] Conference League next year. “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league, OK. “Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. “Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, God bless! “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” Not everyone shares that sentiment, though, as former West Ham striker Carlton Cole believes Lingard was not enough of a club legend to deserve such a huge send off. He told the talkSPORT Breakfast: “He’s a good player, Jesse Lingard, but Man United have had lots of top players in the past and did they get a send off?  “Is it different for academy boys? No. You are playing for Man United, they are one of the biggest clubs in the world. “They don’t need to pander to anyone. Unless you’ve served the club and been the main man. “If he was a Roy Keane or a Rooney, then I could understand. They’ve gone on to do big things with the club and broken records. That’s when I think clubs do that. “Jesse is a homeboy, but I don’t think there’s a lot in it.” talkSPORT's new sport trivia game is live!

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether.

8,https://talksport.com/football/1100095/man-utd-roy-keane-all-time-xi-cristiano-ronaldo-paul-scholes/,Roy Keane names all-time Manchester United XI and includes legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney but explains why Paul Scholes misses out,"Roy Keane shared a dressing room with some unbelievable players during his time at Manchester United. So when the time came to pick his ultimate Red Devils Premier League XI, he was always going to be spoilt for choice.  Sky Sports asked the United legend to pick his team on Monday Night Football after watching his former club beat Brentford 3-0. Keane admitted he was reluctant to do so because of the risk of upsetting people, but did what he was told, and there was inevitably going to be some huge names left out. “I’ve told you before, I don’t like doing this,” Keane said. “I don’t like upsetting some of my teammates. It’s not easy. “I had to leave out some brilliant characters and brilliant players.” The most notable omissions were the likes of Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Eric Cantona, while also picked some he didn’t exactly get on with.  Keane and Schmeichel famously did not get on, with the pair once having a scuffle in a hotel before a big match, but he was still the pick over Edwin van de Sar and David de Gea in between the sticks. “He was very good… not as good as everyone thought,” Keane said. “He was a good character in the dressing room. The most important thing I had for him was huge respect. He produced big moments and got us through big matches. Peter would produce and help us get trophies. “Being good characters, making important saves. Because we were a decent team, Peter wasn’t called upon much, but he made some big saves for us. He was lively and he produced in the important moments. “Who won the fight? We say it was a draw.”  Neville dominated the right-back position for so many years at Old Trafford, so this decision – with respect to the likes of Wes Brown, Raphael and Paul Parker – was perhaps one of Keane’s easiest. The former midfielder said about Neville: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself. You have to have quality to do what he did.”  Republic of Ireland international Irwin and Keane were good friends so there’s no surprise he made it to left-back, and was a pretty decent player to go with it. Kean said: “I roomed with Dennis at United and Ireland. Brilliant trainer, very rarely injured, turned up to the big matches. If he was playing now, Dennis would be up there with the best. He was a good fella.”  Now is where some of the controversial picks start. United had some fantastic centre-backs from Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Steve Bruce, but Keane explained why he had to go for Stam and Pallister. “I couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. Big strong, brave, brilliant in the one vs ones. I’ve also gone with Garry Pallister. Rio was a good athlete and read the game well, but my relationship with Pally was good. When I first went to United, there were certain lads who went out their way to help and [Lee] Sharpey and Pally were always on the scene. “I was not surprised [when Stam left]. Jaap had a bad injury. But when you’re at a big club, players do come and go quickly. It was a case of moving on.”  United had some brilliant midfielders during the Premier League era and perhaps none more memorable than Beckham. Keane said: “He was younger. He was from London, he loved his gear and his cars. They all have hobbies, but the key for me was are they training properly and giving everything for the cause? Becks did that. “I don’t think I once fell out with him over anything because he turned up every day and put a shift in.”  Giggs is perhaps the greatest Manchester United player of the Premier League era with an incredible 963 appearances in all competitions and a remarkable 13 league titles. “Where do you want to start? He could assist. Everything you want from a wide player. The amount of goals they got from each others’ crosses. “I never felt, even with Giggsy, they were distracted by the off-the-field stuff. Giggs was a superstar in a sense but he was a good teammate to have.”  There were plenty of names Keane could have named in here and one of the most surprising is perhaps leaving out Scholes in favour of Ince. Keane said: “Robson has to go in there. He was a great player for Man United. Scored some big goals for the club. I’m going to put Paul Ince. Another very good player. Tarnished his reputation a bit, he ended up playing forLiverpool. He was a really good teammate. “Tough leaving Scholes out. But I thought Incey was brilliant in midfield. Good teammate to have next to you. He could head it and score goals. I enjoyed his company.”  From Eric Cantona to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Andy Cole and Ruud van Nistelrooy, Keane probably could have picked several strikers in his best XI, but the two he went for were Rooney and Ronaldo. “Yorkie was brilliant, Cantona was brilliant, Ruud, Mark Hughes, Ole. Oh my goodness. Ronaldo and Wayne have to go for what they achieved in the game. All the other brilliant lads I’ve played with, I couldn’t leave any of them two out. “It was easy. You see these young lads coming through, as long as they’re giving their all, that’s part of learning. “These lads, Wayne and Ronaldo, I always felt their priority was football at Man United. If they make a mistake, you try and help them. “Sometimes players have to learn from their mistakes, we certainly wouldn’t be coming down hard.”   When asked if he was happy with his choices, Keane said: “Yeah I’m okay with that. Put it this way, you’ve got a chance [of winning the Premier League]. That’s all you want. “You’ve got players turning up, you’ve got goals in the team, you’ve got characters, you’ve got height, physicality, pace. When asked who would be the manager, Keane joked: “Big Ron Atkinson.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

The French centre-back is currently starring for the French club, having arrived on loan from the Gunners at the start of the season. The 21-year-old has been hailed as a ‘future great of French football’ by his current Marseille manager Jorge Sampaoli, with Saliba hugely impressing across his 49 appearances for the club this season, including 34 Ligue 1 starts. His form this term has placed a big question mark over his future, and whether he will return to Arsenal or, like former Gunners teammate and fellow Frenchman Matteo Guendouzi, seal a permanent move to his on-loan side. Saliba is yet to play a competitive game forMikel Artetain more than two years at the club, and has recently called Marseille ‘my club’ – implying he may not be keen on a return to north London. “My wish is to finish the season well, to leave on a good note in case I don’t come back,” Saliba said in a recent interview. “It would be my pleasure to come back no matter what, it’s not as if I know I’m not going to come back, it’s Marseille, it’s my club.” Having helped Marseille to second place in Ligue 1 and a place in next season’s Champions League, Saliba admitted he would love to get a taste of that atmosphere.  He added: “[Playing in] the Champions League with OM? When you see the atmosphere in the Conference League or in Ligue 1, I can’t even imagine what it would be like on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening.” Meanwhile, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has revealed his confusion and frustration with his former club’s handling of Saliba’s situation. The north London club’s all-time top goalscorer has questioned why the young defender was forced out of the Emirates Stadium before being given a real opportunity in the first team. “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” the Arsenal legend toldAmazon Primeof his old club’s treatment of Saliba.  “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

10,https://talksport.com/football/1100088/cristiano-ronaldo-age-stats-manchester-united-premier-league/,Cristiano Ronaldo proves that age is but a number as key Manchester United stat emerges following goal against Brentford in Premier League win,"Manchester United have lacked much in the way of success this term, but Cristiano Ronaldo might just be the exception. In a largely disappointing season, the 37-year-old has been one of the few bright spots after completing a move from Juventus last summer and proving to the football world he very much still has it. Given Ronaldo’s age, plenty of pundits suggested the Portugal star might struggle to thrive in the elite environment of the Premier League, but if there’s one thing CR7 enjoys it’s the pressure of proving people wrong. After scoring twice on his second United debut in the 4-1 victory over Newcastle, supporters knew their former hero had not lost any of his sparkle and that’s become abundantly clear in the months since. In fact, there’s even a suggestion that he’s got better since he was last at the club. Ronaldo’s last season at Old Trafford was in the 2008/09 campaign in which the forward racked up 18 goals in 33 Premier League appearances. This term, he’s exceeded that with time to spare. In 29 league appearances, three of which have come from the bench, Ronaldo has already scored 18 times.  With three top flight fixtures remaining, it would take a brave person to bet against Ronaldo exceeding that tally. Of course there’s ongoing speculation about whether the experienced forward will remain at United next term, but regardless of what the future holds, it’s clear that Ronaldo’s Old Trafford legacy is well and truly intact after his hugely successful swansong. With his immediate future in doubt, Piers Morgan made a rather bold call during his appearance on talkSPORT as he called for the player to leave United and move to his beloved Arsenal instead. Speaking ontalkSPORT Breakfast, Morgan said: “When it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, we’ve got the richest of all of them.  “Stan Kroenkehas got £10billion, he’s married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has £15billion. He’s just bought a ranch for £750million, he can afford to buy a couple of strikers! “Do you know what I’d do if I was Arsenal manager? I’d go in, get Cristiano Ronaldo and put him up front. I’ve had this conversation with him last week. I said ‘come to Arsenal’. “The Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting. On paper, United have far more talented players and far more experienced, talented players but they don’t have the right attitude. “The mental attitude is shocking. Whatever is going on in that club…if they didn’t have Ronaldo in the team they wouldn’t be winning, whereas Arsenal have young, hungry, really promising guys who have a great attitude. People like [Bukayo] Saka, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Kieran] Tierney and all of these guys.  “That’s what’s encouraging. If you combined the United talent with our mentality then both clubs would be sorted. “I’m not even joking. I’d love to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Arsenal. If he’s not going to stay at United, I’d take him in a heartbeat. “I watched that game at the weekend and he was the best player on the pitch. “As a striker, when you watch Ronaldo’s movement and his goalscoring record at 37, I’d put Ronaldo at the front and let these kids learn from him.” However, for now it appears he is staying put judging by his most recent celebration at Old Trafford.

11,https://talksport.com/football/1100030/erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-transfer-news/,"Erik ten Hag told to ‘find a way’ to get ‘phenomenal’ Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United team, and Ralf Rangnick wants quality strikers","talkSPORT host Jason Cundy believes incoming Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag must prioritise getting Cristiano Ronaldo into his team. The Ajax manager will take the reins at Old Trafford in the summer, and after underwhelming Premier League season, with the new man expected to oversee a squad overhaul. Ten Hag’s favoured style of play centres around dominating possession and pressing from the front which doesn’t necessarily suit 37-year-old Ronaldo, who’s Man United’s top scorer this season. But despite this, Cundy believes that whilst United do need to bolster their attacking options, Ten Hag must still build his team around Ronaldo given his impressive displays, which has seen him notch up 24 goals so far this season. “If Ten Hag is going to play the way he has done at Ajax, you would’ve thought that Ronaldo cannot play every single game,” the former Chelsea player said on The Sports Bar following Man United’s 3-0 win over Brentford. “But then you find a way. His goals have been phenomenal again. His goals to game ratio is phenomenal, greatest goal scorer ever. “So you find a way to have Ronaldo in and around the squad. Whether he’s going to start 38 Premier League games I very much doubt, I can’t see that happening. “United do need help up top, they do.”  United legend Gary Neville echoed Cundy’s thoughts, saying on commentary for Sky Sports: “This is the best they have played this season. “They have looked more connected as a team. “My man of the match is Cristiano Ronaldo. The penalty, the build-up to it, and he had one disallowed in the first half. “Just his all-round performance has been outstanding.” The Portuguese’s future at the club has been questioned over the last few months after his side have suffered yet another disappointing season, with hopes of silverware fading after their defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last-16 of the Champions League in March. However, despite this, Red Devils hero Roy Keane doesn’t believe his former teammate Ronaldo is heading for the exit, agreeing that Ten Hag needs to keep him at Old Trafford.  “I don’t think his body language was suggesting that he was leaving,” Keane explained. “I just look at the goals he’s got, his performances warrant him staying at the club.” Keane continued: “But Man United need to get other strikers in there, there has to be competition for places. If your leading goal scorer, who you’re depending on is 37 years of age, then that’s certainly not good. “But I’d certainly be hanging on to Ronaldo. You might have to have a conversation about the way you’re going to play, or that he won’t be playing week, in week out. But why would you get rid of a player that scores that many goals?” And the need for additional firepower is something current boss Ralf Rangnick is well aware of.  “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons,” he said. Asked what he meant, he explained: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger, they are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

The 37-year-old signed a two-year deal on his return to Old Trafford last summer, however, the club’s disappointing Premier League season has led to speculation he could bring his stay to an end early. The Portuguese was recently linked with a move back to Real Madrid, who he played for between 2009 and 2018. Meanwhile, the imminent arrival of Erik ten Hag as manager has led to questions over whether there would be any room in his team for Ronaldo. But club legend Keane is in no doubt that Ronaldo will be part of things next season. Asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford – their final home match of the season – could be Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong, Keane said: “I wouldn’t have thought so. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.”  Although it’s been a campaign to forget for the 13-time Premier League winners, Ronaldo can hold his head high. So far he has 24 goals to his name, 18 of them in the league. His latest came in their 3-0 win against the Bees as he slotted home a penalty in the second half. And during that celebration he appeared to hint he was staying on beyond the summer by pointing to himself and then Old Trafford as he took in the crowd’s cheers.

The Red Devils secured three points in the league for the first time since their win over bottom side Norwich thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. United opened the scoring just nine minutes into the clash as an unmarked Fernandes volleyed home Anthony Elanga’s cut-back. The strike was Fernandes’ first goal in his last 11 outings. Shortly after the Portugal international’s goal, the Bees had two attempts at equalising – Christian Eriksen and Ivan Toney both having attempts at goal. Brentford were relieved to see Ronaldo’s strike just before half time ruled out by VAR for offside. However, the Bees were soon left with a bigger mountain to climb after the restart. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty after Rico Henry attempted to win the ball back in the box and collided with Ronaldo having been barged off it by the Portuguese seconds earlier. Sure enough, United’s talisman grasped the opportunity after Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, making no mistake as he sent a thumping effort past David Raya from the spot. United’s final goal of the evening came from an unlikely source as Raphael Varane netted his first goal when he latched onto Alex Telles’ inswinging corner from the right.    Prior to the game, United fans had organised another another protest against the Glazer family ownership, which was due to result in a mass walkout in the 73rd minute of the match. However, whilst there were banners displaying their discontent towards those running the club, there wasn’t a noticeable walkout from those who attended. Juan Mata received a standing ovation as he made his way for Phil Jones, as the Spaniard made what will likely be his final appearance at Old Trafford, with him expected to leave in the summer. Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “We want Glazers Out”#MUFC fans protest the Glazers on the 72nd minute during #MUNBRE pic.twitter.com/kOYxvHNl7r Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong.

The champions-elect took on the play-off contending Hatters in front of a packed Craven Cottage following a poor run of form, winning just one in their last five.  A win would seal Marco Silva’s side the title, having already achieved promotion in April. Meanwhile, Championship manager of the season Nathan Jones’s side were unbeaten in three entering into the clash, as the Hatters searched for a win to secure their place in the top six. Luton competed well with the league leaders in the opening stages, demonstrating their physical prowess and showing why they’ve earnt their spot in the league’s coveted play-off spots. However, it was the Cottagers who got the party started in the 28th minute, with captain Tom Cairney netting his third goal of the season from the edge of the box after the ball was pulled back by Harry Wilson. Fulham skipper’s goal marked the west Londoner’s 100th goal of the campaign, a record last set in the division by Manchester City back in 2001/02. Jones’ side were soon dealt another injury blow to add to their ever-increasing list as Fred Onyedinma was taken off with a hamstring injury.   Fulham then went 2-0 up thanks to a thumping, long range effort from Kenny Tete from outside the area, that left Hatters keeper Matt Ingram unsighted and the rest of his side shellshocked. The half time whistle couldn’t have come faster for the Bedfordshire side, with Tom Lockyer having to clear Wilson’s effort off the line to prevent the home side going 3-0 up just before the break. Jones’ side earnt themselves four yellow cards in the opening 45 minutes after battling against an increasingly rampant Fulham side as the chance to seal their play-off spot looked to be sliding away. Unfortunately for Luton, Silva’s side weren’t finished there, though. Top scorer Mitrovic played the ball to Wilson before Liverpool target Fabio Carvalho netted the Premier League new boys’ third. Not long after, Fulham scored their fourth through who else but Mitrovic. The Serbian timed his run to perfection as he calmly slotted his rebounded chance into the back of the net.   Mitrovic’s goal marked his 42nd of the campaign, meaning he went level with the league’s 46-game-a-season’s record holder Guy Whittingham, who achieved the feat with Portsmouth in the 1992/93 season. Bobby De Cordova-Reid then found himself on the scoresheet, with Jean Michael Seri also doing so soon after. There couldn’t have been a more fitting way for the champions to end the game than Mitrovic breaking Whittingham’s record, though. Fulham’s star striker rounded the night off with his side’s seventh goal of the evening, beating Whittingham’s record and summing up an incredible season for Silva’s side. Only former Middlesbrough player George Camsell’s tally remains superior to Mitrovic’s in the division’s history, setting the record of 59 back in 1927/28. Fulham’s demolition of Luton sees the Hatters drop to sixth, denting their goal difference and leaving them just two points above play-off pushers Middlesbrough.

The 23-year-old has been incredible for the Hammers in midfield as they continue to perform well in the Premier League, while also reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League. This, coupled with his standout displays when playing for England, have made him one of the most highly-rated young talents in the game. Chelsea and Manchester United have both been linked with moves for the player who West Ham would want around £150million for. It has been reported that Rice has turned down three contract offers from the club with his future looking set to be away for east London. “I feel like playing well comes with speculation,” Rice told Sky Sports. “I’ve had two or three top seasons with West Ham and the top clubs around the country are always going to be watching. It’s not just me, it’s the same for every player. “I think it’s important not to get too carried away with that. We’ve had a good season with West Ham and there have been big games I’ve had to play in so I feel like my focus has always been on that. If I thought about other things, I’d get carried away and that wouldn’t be fair on the team or the manager. “I can’t help speculation, even with the numbers that get talked about. I get battered for it all the time on social media, but I can’t help that. I can help by going on the pitch and performing as best as I can. “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.”   “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.” Rice came third in the prestigious Football Writers’ Association Men’s Player of the Year award, behind only Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne, when the results were announced on Friday. It gives an indication of just how good Rice has been this term and the midfielder thinks he can only get better. “It’s not bad,” Rice said on finishing third in the FWA awards. “I would like to have won it, but obviously up against Salah and De Bruyne it’s hard to say, because I can never imagine putting my name with those types of players. “To come third, it shows that people have appreciated what I’ve done on the football pitch. This season, I feel like I’ve taken another step in the right direction in my career, but I’m still only 23 and trust me, I know myself and I’ve got so much more that I can let out of the bag. “I know that, my coaches tell me that and I think it just comes with time and as I get older, it’ll keep coming and coming. I feel like you’re only seeing the start of me. I’m going to keep pushing and getting better.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

It’s understood fans are preparing a march before the Monday night clash with Brentford. It’s understood supporters are being urged to walk out of Old Trafford on 73 minutes, 17 minutes from the end, to signify the 17 years in which the club has been under the current ownership. While admitting that United fans are more than entitled to make their feelings known in a peaceful manner, Jordan believes that there’s only so much that supporters can do when dealing with vast sums of money within the game. He told White and Jordan: “I do think that some fans are getting ahead of themselves and getting carried away with what they’re entitled to do, how to represent their discontent, how influential they are in the world of football and how the European Super League was stopped by fans. “There’s a balance between expressing dissatisfaction, and then engineering disruption and your reach exceeding your grasp. “Man United fans are fully entitled to express their feelings. It’s not my right to tell them how to feel about their ownership model, they’ve every right to be as unhappy as they want to be, but if you’re going to realistically oust the Glazers, you need a proper solution. “But if you’re just going to bark at the moon because you don’t like something… everyone knows they’re unhappy about it. “Do you think this dissatisfaction would be anywhere near as acute if they were winning on the pitch?”   “I acknowledge their point, but if the club were doing well on the pitch, it would be nowhere near the level it is now.” Jordan added: “The Glazers need that team to win too. They’re not stupid. They know that when they’re not in the Champions League their share price is deflated. “Of course their hearts are not with United, they’re American. Do you think Roman Abramovich cared that much about Chelsea? He cared because it was a reflection of him and he wanted to win and he wanted to buy Chelsea to legitimise his position in the world. “What you’re looking for is the perfect circle where someone buys your football club, gives you exactly what you want and when you want it. Even then there will be a segment of Man United fans who won’t be happy if the team doesn’t win.”  But stepping outside of the situation at Old Trafford, Jordan believes that fans must start understanding that football is ‘a money business’. He said: “Man City wasn’t bought because Sheikh Mansour cared about Manchester, he wanted to legitimise a particular regime. “Newcastle hasn’t been bought because the Saudis are wonderful people, they’re being bought for the exact same purpose. “This notion that football clubs aren’t commercial animals, people have to grow up and accept that. “We’ve got to live in the real world where footballers are getting £200k a week, big businesses are broadcasting it around the world, it is now a money business.”  Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

19,https://talksport.com/football/1099694/man-utd-transfer-ward-prowse-beckham-free-kick-record-world-cup-2022/,"‘Phenomenal’ James Ward-Prowse is a Manchester United transfer target, has David Beckham free-kick record in his sights, and wants World Cup 2022 role","Manchester United transfer target James Ward-Prowse has been tipped to leave Southampton this summer by former teammate Charlie Austin. The England international is enjoying his most prolific season of his career, netting 10 goals in all competitions, and a £75million deal has now been mooted ahead of the Old Trafford overhaul. His set-piece taking has always been lavished with praise and this season a raft of fantastic free-kicks see him now hot on the heels of David Beckham’s Premier League record. The England icon netted 18 in the English top flight and Ward-Prowse now has 14 to his name. But as a potential battle with Man City for his signature beckons, the clubs challenging for the midfielder have been told that the ‘underrated’ schemer would not only be valuable because of his deadball abilities. Austin, who played with Ward-Prowse 46 times over a four-season spell, reckon his all-round game make him a ‘phenomenal’ acquistion, despite the midfielder taking his time to reach his peak. Asked why he had taken so long to reach this level, he told Drive Time last week: “I don’t know. When I was there with him he played second fiddle to [Victor] Wanyama, to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jordy Clasie, Oriol Romeu and Steven Davis. “Maybe he just took his time and then over the last two years he’s cemented himself as club captain but certainly know I think it’s time to leave.”  So why would Ward-Prowse want to leave having reached new heights at St Mary’s? Austin thinks he may well have ambitions for later in the year. He said: “I think, if he wants to go to the World Cup, he needs to be at a different football club [compared] to what Southampton are offering and how they are performing. “I think he’s more appealing if he’s at a different club.” Pressed again on why he didn’t move earlier in his career, Austin added: “He’s come throught the academy there and has been there for so many years. I just think that it hasn’t been the right opportunity. “I think now is the time for him to move. “His set-pieces and that are brilliant. He’s probably going to beat David Beckham’s record but, the nuts and bolts of his game, running hard, winning the ball back, and leading his team are phenomenal.”  And former Newcastle and Crystal Palace star Darren Ambrose also believes that Ward-Prowse is capable of playing for a side outside of the top three – which is definitely the case right now for United. He toldtalkSPORT:“I’ve been a massive advocate of James Ward-Prowse, and I think he gets into any team. “If you look at the Premier League table with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea as the top three, anybody below that he would get in the team as a starter and not make them worse, absolutely.  “The argument of what happens if you take the free-kicks out of it, you can’t because that’s a massive part of the game. “Not many clubs have a set-piece taker like him so you can’t argue about what happens if you take that element out of his game.” He added: “When you’ve got a player like James Ward-Prowse, there’s no one better as a deliverer of balls into the box and when you get a free-kick around the box, you think it’s a goal. I think he’s massively underrated.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

20,https://talksport.com/football/1099718/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-man-utd-fan-simon-jordan/,Simon Jordan calls Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for Chelsea bid and warns Manchester United fan ‘not always successful’ in sport,"Simon Jordan labelled Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for his 11th hour bid for Chelsea. Todd Boehly’s consortium is understood to remain on course to be confirmed as the preferred bidder and then handed the opportunity to seal a Stamford Bridge takeover from Roman Abramovich. The Russian oligarch put the club up for sale in March amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, but was later sanctioned by the UK government and had his assets frozen. Chelsea were still able to operate on a special licence with New York-based merchant bank The Raine Group handling the process overseeing the sale. The Treasury will have to ratify the club’s sale for the eventual takeover, but significant progress has been made with LA Dodgers co-owner Boehly expected to be named the preferred bidder. That was until Britain’s richest man, Ineos owner Ratcliffe, confirmed a last-ditch £4.25billion bid for the club. Manchester United fan Ratcliffe carried out extensive due diligence on Chelsea in 2019, only to opt against submitting a formal offer to buy the west London club. The British billionaire had distanced himself from a bid for Chelsea in early March, with his brother Bob reiterating previous determination at Ineos not to be ‘dumb money’ in football.  But crucially, Ratcliffe never categorically ruled himself out of a bid for the Blues. Former Crystal Palace owner Jordan does not believe that Ratcliffe’s bid will succeed and the £4.25billion figure quoted is not quite all it seems. When asked why Ratcliffe has made the late bid, Jordan told talkSPORT: “No idea… being a disruptor? His bid is the lowest bid. He hasn’t bid what the other guys have bid. “The other guys have bid near to £3billion and he has bid the £2.5billion, which was supposedly the price people were to get to and bid a future commitment of £1.75billion. A future commitment, which I’m suspecting the other guys will spend just as much as he’s forced to spend. “If they are going to develop the stadium, which I suspect they are all going to, they are all going to the same place. “He’s had ample time to get in a situation where he could have done this. Whatever has prompted him behind this?  “You also have the Todd Boehly bid, the make up of that and who is behind it. There are some very interesting people, not necessarily financially well heeled, but people who are intellectually well heeled like Danny Finkelstein. “It’s going to be Todd Boehly and his gang, those are going to be the guys who come out of it. “Jim Ratcliffe, whenever he gets involved in sport it is not always the greatest success. He wasn’t the greatest success with Ben Ainslie over the Americas Cup, but the man has significant wealth.  “He’s a Manchester United fan, not that that influences who you can and can’t own. “If he wanted to be involved in this process, he could have been at some point and probably didn’t want to be at the table in a bidding auction with other people, but this bid that has been dressed up as £4.25billion… what you spend in the future has nothing with what you buy the football club for. “There are two things. The price you’ve got to pay to own this business and what you project to spend in the future, that’s for the birds.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

21,https://talksport.com/football/1094930/man-utd-news-paul-scholes-jesse-lingard-premier-league/ ,‘I don’t know why I did it’ – Paul Scholes regrets revealing Jesse Lingard conversation but believes Manchester United have treated the midfielder poorly,"Paul Scholes admitted he regretted revealing his conversation with Jesse Lingard where the midfielder labelled the Manchester United dressing room a ‘disaster’. United have come under fire following their defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in the space of five days as they look set for their worst Premier League season on record. The club legend made the comments while working as a pundit after the loss to the Gunners, but on reflection felt perhaps he should have kept that conversation private. Scholes told talkSPORT: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that. I don’t know why I did it! Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth. “I have spoken to him since and probably best I don’t tell you what he said.” Scholes also criticised the club for how Lingard has been treated in the recent weeks and months. The midfielder was all set to move from the club in January, before it fell through at the 11th hour. He is out of contract in the summer and looks likely to make a permanent exit from Old Trafford.  Scholes added: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” But Scholes admitted there could still be a way back into the Manchester United first-team under new manager Erik ten Hag.  Ten Hag will join from Ajax in the summer and the former midfielder thinks a player like Lingard could flourish under the Dutch manager. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him,” Scholes said. “We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
