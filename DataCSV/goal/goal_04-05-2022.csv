Game-changer Diaz leads Liverpool to yet another Champions League final,"Match statistics: Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool It has been said before and it will be said again for sure, but let us say it now and let us say it loud. What a signing Luis Diaz is, and what a player he is going to be for Liverpool. He has only been here three months, but the Colombian has already made a huge impression at Anfield. You don't get many ¬£50million ($67m) bargains, but he's most definitely one. And here, on the big stage, in the Spanish rain and with the Reds‚Äô Champions League dreams hanging by a thread, it was he who stepped up and delivered. Talk about a game-changer. Talk about a season-changer. Oh how Liverpool needed him. Oh how they had wobbled for 45 minutes without him. They were staring over the cliff-edge when their January signing was called for, but now they can start dreaming of Paris, and the possibility of an incredible seventh European Cup. Luis Diaz. That is all. ü§© pic.twitter.com/HkksE2nSBO Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side had arrived in Villarreal with one foot in the final, or so the story went, 2-0 up from the first leg and having looked a cut above throughout. The only question, we thought, was how comfortable the margin would be. But we should have listened to Unai Emery. He had promised that we would see a different Villarreal from the one which had surrendered so meekly on Merseyside. Liverpool, he warned, would be made to ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù at the Estadio de la Ceramica. He got that right. As the rain poured down, and as this tight, compact, fantastic little stadium rumbled, Klopp‚Äôs side were stunned, knocked from their stride and put under the most intense of pressure. Their lead was gone by half time, Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin striking to turn Villarreal fans‚Äô hope into belief. Like Juventus and Bayern Munich before them, Liverpool appeared to have no answer. So composed a week ago, they were anything but here. They were rattled, their performance littered with mistakes, missteps and misunderstandings. They conceded early in the half to Dia, and late in the half to Coquelin. When the whistle came for the interval, it was they who needed it. Then came Diaz, and after that everything changed. Liverpool were a team transformed with their new superstar on the field. They ran in three goals in the space of 12 second-half minutes to turn the tie their way again. By the end, somehow, they were back in comfort mode, able to enjoy the last 20 minutes like nothing had happened. Diaz grabbed the second of their goals, a smart close-range header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross. But even before that, he had helped get the Reds on the front foot, always an option on the left flank, running at defenders and creating danger from the get go. He has some mentality, and some engine, on him, this boy. Liverpool could barely string two passes together in the first half, but they quickly found their groove after the break, even if they needed a helping hand or two from Geronimo Rulli, the hapless Villarreal goalkeeper. Rulli was once on the books of Manchester City, and Liverpool must wish he still was. The Argentine was culpable for the goal which got Klopp‚Äôs side back into the game, allowing Fabinho‚Äôs angled shot to squeeze between his legs and into the net at the near post. A howler, however you slice it. Liverpool celebrated, and you got the impression then that, even at 3-2 on aggregate, Villarreal sensed the jig was up and their chance had passed. Five minutes later came Diaz‚Äôs strike, and that was that. Sadio Mane ran in a third after another shocker from Rulli, and in the end the biggest surprise was that Liverpool did not add more to their tally. Mohamed Salah and Curtis Jones, the substitute, had the best of their chances. Klopp wasn't going to disappoint the traveling Reds.üëäüëäüëä#LFC üî¥ #UCL pic.twitter.com/6FBcFnOGkT At the end, Klopp and his players celebrated accordingly, saluting their supporters, who were perched high up behind the left-hand goal. It has been a wet week on Spain‚Äôs east coast, but little will dampen the travelling Kop‚Äôs spirits, you can be sure of that. The bars of Castellon and Alicante and Valencia will have done decent business, and Anfield wil be bouncing when Tottenham arrive in the Premier League on Saturday evening. They may have been given an almighty scare, but their quadruple bid is still on course. We now know that they will play every game they could possibly have played this season, 63 of them across four competitions. The last of those will be at the Stade de France on May 28, against either Real Madrid or Manchester City. Their third Champions League final in five seasons. And surely, it will feature the name of Luis Fernando Diaz Marulanda in the Reds‚Äô starting line up. How could it not, after this? Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Former Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke has led the Cherries with 29 goals, while Billing has added 18 goal involvements.

Diaz proved that once again in the win over Villarreal, with former Liverpool forward Peter Crouch praising the Colombian for leading Liverpool to victory after coming off the bench in the second half. ""Luis Diaz changed the game,"" Crouch said on BT Sport. ""He was fantastic as soon as he came on. A complete game-changer.

Salah and Liverpool secured their place in the final on Tuesday with a 3-2 win against Villarreal in the second leg of the semi-final, going through 5-2 on aggregate. If Madrid make it past Manchester City in the other last four clash on Wednesday, it will lead to a rematch of the 2018 final, which the Spanish side won. Salah suffered a shoulder injury in the first half of the 2018 final as he tussled with Sergio Ramos. Asked if he would rather face Man City or Madrid in the decider in Paris, Salah said to BT Sport: ""Yeah, I want to play Madrid. ""City is a really tough team, we've played against them a few times this season. If you ask me personally, I'd prefer Madrid."" He was then asked if he wants revenge against the Spanish side, to which the Egypt star replied: ""We lost in the final against them, so I want to play against them and hopefully win it from them as well."" It was no easy feat for Liverpool despite their 2-0 lead from the first leg. Villarreal struck twice in the first half to pull level in the tie, but Liverpool fought back in the last 45 minutes as Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane struck to put the Reds back in the lead and through to the final. Salah said: ""It was tough in the first half but then we went to the dressing room, the gaffer started talking and we talked to each other as well. ""That character and personality in the dressing room shows that we are a top team, so that's why we can strike back after losing 2-0 in the first half playing away.""

Unai Emery‚Äôs men doubled their advantage four minutes before the half time as Francis Coquelin headed Etienne Capoue‚Äôs cross past goalkeeper Alisson. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side launched a comeback in the second half. First, Fabinho pulled one back for the visitors two minutes after the hour mark thanks to Mohamed Salah‚Äôs assist.

Jurgen Klopp's team were made uncomfortable in the first half on Tuesday as a 2-0 lead entering the game evaporated. However, in the second half, they scored three times in 12 minutes with the help of errors from Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. The Reds have enjoyed a balanced attack this season, with four players reaching double-digit goal tallies. Mohamed Salah leads the way with 30 goals, followed by Diogo Jota (21), Sadio Mane (21) and Roberto Firmino (11). Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson have also achieved double digits for assists. Liverpool have become the first ever English club to reach the final of the European Cup or Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. As a result of their success in all competitions, they will play in every possible game this season - 63 across all competitions. Klopp meanwhile has reached the final of the Champions League for the fourth time as a manager, the joint-most of any coach in the competition along with Sir Alex Ferguson, Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi.

""The investigation has made it clear that a number of women within Ajax have been confronted with undesirable behaviour,"" Ajax's statement read. ""This ranges from bad jokes and derogatory or hurtful comments, to an unwanted arm around the shoulder and other intrusive behavior."" Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's CEO, said: ""I would like to give a big compliment to the women who have already come together with initiatives. ""It is good to start a discussion about this subject from practice. We also like to use their input in the action plan and in the supervisory committee.

Rulli's first error of the day came on a goal from Fabinho, who smashed a shot between the goalkeeper's legs to restore Liverpool's aggregate lead. Moments later, Luis Diaz put the tie nearly out of reach, with his header also going between the goalkeeper's legs. Sadio Mane all but iced the tie wth his goal, which saw Rulli caught far out of his box, leaving the Senegal star with a simple finish into an empty net.

However, six goals in his last three appearances have demonstrated his quality and De Bruyne is eager to continue to link up with the striker. ""Since he (Jesus) came here, I've had a good relationship with him, I think we've found each other lots of times,"" De Bruyne told reporters.

This time, manager Unai Emery has kept the 22-year-old on the bench alongside Cote d‚ÄôIvoire‚Äôs Serge Aurier and Algeria international Aissa Mandi. Meanwhile, Senegal‚Äôs Dia will lead the Spaniards‚Äô chase for goals alongside the returning Gerard Moreno, while Netherlands international of Nigerian heritage Arnaut Danjuma has been ruled out of this crunch fixture due to a muscle injury. For Liverpool, Mohamed Salah, Naby Keita, Sadio Mane and Mali prospect Ibrahima Konate have been named in the Reds‚Äô lineup for the clash billed for the Estadio de la Ceramica. Former Cameroon international Joel Matip is among the English Premier League side‚Äôs named substitutes. For the Spanish elite division side to fancy their chances of reaching the final where Manchester City or Real Madrid awaits, they must first overturn their 2-0 deficit, a task Emery confessed is tough. ""Lifting a 2-0 is very difficult. We are working to make a good match, find answers in our game and try to get closer to them on the scoreboard. In Liverpool, the field factor was crucial and we would like it to be decisive here as well,"" he told the Villarreal website. ""We want to achieve it and we will fight. They were superior in the first leg and have the result in their favour, but we are going to work to try to win on our pitch, to give joy to our fans. ""We must find excellence in our game. We have to do something that nobody has achieved this year: beat Liverpool by more than two goals. We must find more weaknesses than other teams have achieved. It will be difficult, but we are working and we will try to achieve it."" Chukwueze wrote himself into Champions League folklore when his late breakway finish sealed one of the competition's great modern upsets against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the quarter-final. The Super Eagle came off the bench to finish a last-gasp counter-move that saw the visitors earn a 1-1 draw on the night and a 2-1 aggregate victory, to reach the last four of Europe's top knockout tier for only the second time.

Nigeria international Chukwueze, Senegal‚Äôs Boulaye Dia, Algeria‚Äôs Aissa Mandi, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire‚Äôs Serge Aurier as well as Netherlands international of Nigerian descent Arnaut Danjuma have been in fine form for the Spanish heavyweights in the 2021-22 campaign. Aside from their strong contributions to the team in the Spanish elite division, the quintet has also played significant roles as Unai Emery‚Äôs men continue chasing the Champions League diadem this season. While confirming that the Africans are critical to the club‚Äôs European title ambitions, former Spain international  Senna, who represented Villarreal between 2002‚Äì2013 and helped them win two Uefa Intertoto Cups ( 2003, and 2004) has been impressed with their displays in the current campaign. ‚ÄúI think the African players especially [Samuel] Chukwueze are performing very well so far this season, alongside the other player [of African descent] who joined them at the start of the season [Arnaut] Danjuma,‚Äù Senna told GOAL during a media parley organised by La Liga. ‚ÄúWe are very happy with them and I hope they can continue to make positive contributions to the team."" Senna also outlined his desire to see Chukwueze and the club's other African players enjoy long tenures with the Yellow Submarine. ‚ÄúUltimately, I hope they stay with us for a few more years to come,"" he concluded. Apart from Chukwueze, who was part of Emery‚Äôs squad that won last season's Europa League - after defeating Manchester United in the final inside Stadion Gdansk - Danjuma, Mandi, Dia and Aurier are all new arrivals this season. They joined the club at the start of the 2021-22 campaign from Bournemouth, Real Betis, Reims, and Tottenham Hotspur respectively. Only Dia was named in Villarreal's starting XI for their second leg against the Reds in front of their own fans on Tuesday evening. Despite losing 2-0 in the first leg played at Anfield courtesy of an own goal by Pervis Estupinan and Sadio Mane‚Äôs effort, Emery‚Äôs men will still fancy their chances of making it to the final where they could square up against Manchester City or Real Madrid if they progress.

The 19-year-old, who ranked 32nd in GOAL's 2022 list of the 50 best wonderkids in world football, has hugely impressed on loan at Championship side Huddersfield as they push for promotion to the Premier League. A ball-playing centre back who came through the Chelsea academy, Colwill has inevitably been compared to former club captain Terry, but while he is flattered by comparisons, he won't be paying them much mind. Colwill told The Athletic: ""I‚Äôm not going to complain. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to be called the new John Terry. ""I haven‚Äôt made the comparison myself so the fans and media can make whatever comparisons they want to make, it isn‚Äôt going to affect me. ""John Terry is a club legend and leader, someone every centre-back at Chelsea should look up to. A great guy and player. I've not had the chance to speak to him too much. When he was around the academy building we‚Äôd have the odd little chat but it‚Äôd be more of a, ‚ÄòHi, how are you?‚Äô, kind of thing, not on a personal level about football or things like that."" Colwill has also drawn attention for choosing the number 26 while at Huddersfield, the same as Terry wore throughout his Chelsea career as he led the club to Premier League and Champions League glory. However Colwill says this is not a tribute to or imitation of Terry, but is instead because his birthday is February 26. Huddersfield are set to compete in the Championship play-offs, and Colwill is hopeful of making the step up to the Premier League next season - whether in Yorkshire or at Stamford Bridge. He said: ‚ÄúEven though I know there are a lot of people talking about me, I don‚Äôt listen. I just say it‚Äôs all a load of rubbish because if I start playing badly for a few games, they will be saying I‚Äôm not good enough. ""It‚Äôs just a lot of talk and I don‚Äôt buy into it. I haven‚Äôt really thought about playing in Chelsea‚Äôs first team next season. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with what‚Äôs going on with the takeover. I have just been concentrating on Huddersfield. It‚Äôs the only thing I can affect right now. I won‚Äôt be thinking about what I do next until this season is done. ‚ÄúThings have been going well. Why am I going to start thinking about the future when I have to concentrate on the present? It has to stay that way.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready. I‚Äôve learnt a lot this year so the next step I hope will be in the Premier League with Chelsea, Huddersfield or whoever.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Wales international was diagnosed with the illness in October last year and has been out of the game since then. But the 24-year-old is working his way back to full fitness and hopes to return to action for the Cherries before long. ""I am delighted to say the treatment was successful and I can now say that I have been given the all clear and am now cancer free,"" Brooks said in an update published on social media. ""Those words feel incredible to say and I am so thankful for all your messages and good wishes, these really helped me through the tough times."" pic.twitter.com/AhK8TrkaF3 He added: ""I am so excited to start the journey back to full fitness and continuing my football career,"" he added in a post on social media. ""The lads at Bournemouth have had an excellent season so far and I am looking forward to being back at The Vitality to cheer the team on as we head into the most important fixtures of the season. ""I am determined to work my hardest over the months ahead and I can't wait to be back out there and playing in front of you on the pitch in the not too distant future."" Brooks joined Bournemouth from Sheffield United in 2018. He immediately became a first-team star for the Cherries in the Premier League, making 30 appearances in the top-flight in his first season for the club. But an ankle injury saw him limited to just nine league appearances the following season as they were relegated to the Championship. He remained a key player for the club in their first year back in the second tier, but his cancer diagnosis limited him to just seven Championship appearances this season.

The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate‚Äôs go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley‚Äôs Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them. Player Selection odds Jordan Pickford 1/12 Aaron Ramsdale 1/10 Nick Pope 4/9 Sam Johnstone 2/1 Jack Butland 5/1 Etienne Green 20/1 Alex McCarthy 25/1 Freddie Woodman 28/1 Fraser Forster 33/1 ùó¶ùòÅùóÆùóøùòÅ ùóºùóªùó≤. ùóïùó≤ùóªùó∞ùóµ ùóºùóªùó≤. ùó¶ùó≤ùóπùóπ ùóºùóªùó≤.England right-back edition üí´ pic.twitter.com/nAwhrBkm8H There are a number of spots in Southgate‚Äôs defensive unit that appear to have been filled, with eight players currently odds-on to make England‚Äôs final 23-man party. Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings‚Äô value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development. Player Selection odds Harry Maguire 1/20 John Stones 1/20 Ben Chilwell 1/16 Luke Shaw 1/12 Kyle Walker 1/8 Ben White 1/3 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1/3 Reece James 4/11 Kieran Trippier 7/4 Tyrone Mings 2/1 Conor Coady 2/1 Fikayo Tomori 3/1 Eric Dier 7/2 Joe Gomez 7/2 Marc Guehi 7/2 Trevoh Chalobah 7/2 Tariq Lamptey 4/1 Well‚Ä¶ About time üòÖ an absolute dream to score my first England goal ü¶Å well done boys! Great performance! ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher‚Äôs impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England‚Äôs depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ‚Äì a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England‚Äôs run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup. Player Selection odds Declan Rice 1/20 Jude Bellingham 1/20 Mason Mount 1/20 Phil Foden 1/20 Jack Grealish 1/16 Bukayo Saka 1/10 Jordan Henderson 1/3 Kalvin Phillips 1/3 Emile Smith Rowe Evens Conor Gallagher 7/4 James Ward-Prowse 11/4 Jesse Lingard 11/4 Curtis Jones 4/1 Harvey Barnes 4/1 Harvey Elliott 4/1 James Maddison 4/1 Oliver Skipp 4/1 Ruben Loftus-Cheek 5/1 Dele Alli 6/1 Jacob Ramsey 6/1 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 10/1 ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏èHarry Kane is now @England's joint-highest goalscorer in major tournaments (EUROs, #WorldCup), alongside @GaryLineker on 10 goals pic.twitter.com/8uyw6EBXbY Given that he is captain of the Three Lions and a man well on course to chase down Wayne Rooney‚Äôs all-time record goal haul for his country, it may come as a surprise to find that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not top of the market when it comes to attacking calls. He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen‚Äôs fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester‚Äôs Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate‚Äôs goalscoring ranks.

In total, 32 countries will compete for the ultimate prize on football‚Äôs grandest stage, but who are favourites to go all the way and which of the outsiders could spring a surprise? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Brazil may not have savoured World Cup glory since 2002, but they are five-time winners and currently boast the strength in depth - with the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Junior and Alisson at their disposal - to make them 9/2 (5.50) favourites in Qatar. Holders France are another of those that are well fancied to mount a serious challenge for the ultimate prize, with a star-studded squad that includes Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba knowing what it takes to emerge victorious, and Didier Deschamps' side are available at 11/2 (6.50). England made their way to the semi-finals in 2018, before reaching a final on home soil at Euro 2020, and the Three Lions are also 11/2 (6.50) to bring a 56-year wait for international success to a close. Just behind them at 8/1 (9.00) are 2010 winners Spain, who have an exciting young squad at their disposal, while Argentina ‚Äì who are hoping to see Lionel Messi land the one major honour that has so far eluded him in a remarkable career - are priced at 9/1 (10.00) just ahead of perennial challengers Germany at 11/1 (12.00). Belgium, who have slipped from the top of the FIFA world rankings, may feel that 2022 presents their golden generation ‚Äì with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard still going strong ‚Äì with a last shot at international honours, but they are priced at 12/1 (13.00). Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal - who came through the play-offs - are another of those available at 12/1 (13.00), alongside a Netherlands team that are bursting with potential. Denmark, who have welcomed Christian Eriksen back into their ranks following his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, are considered to be 28/1 (29.00) shots for what would be a stunning and very emotional triumph. Croatia reached the final in 2018, as Luka Modric closed in on Ballon d‚ÄôOr glory, but are 50/1 (51.00) to go one better four years on. Uruguay ‚Äì who still have the vast experience and considerable goal threat of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez in their ranks ‚Äì are also available at 50/1 (51.00), with Switzerland and reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions Senegal priced at 80/1 (81.00). The United States, with youthful exuberance on their side, are not expected to figure in the final shake-up as they sit at 100/1 (101.00), with a Poland squad led by prolific Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski priced at 125/1 (126.00). There are a number of teams at 150/1 (151.00), including Mexico and Canada, while hosts Qatar have drifted out to 350/1 (351.00) as they become serious long shots on home soil.

Fulham remain strong favourites to savour title glory in their first season back in the second tier following relegation, while Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest are among those pushing hard for places in the Premier League. GOAL has all you need to know about the favourites to lift the Championship trophy, as well as those teams making a strong bid to be rubbing shoulders with English football's elite in 2022-23. Having spent two of their last three seasons in the Premier League, and with promotion already confirmed, Fulham are now priced at 1/500 (1.0)to secure another instant return by winning this year's Championship. Marco Silva inherited a squad that boasts a number of players that represented the Cottagers in the Premier League last season, and that top-flight calibre - along with a few notable additions - has allowed them to start pulling clear of their fellow second-tier frontrunners. Despite having not lifted this trophy since 2001, the 2018 and 2020 play-off winners look a strong bet to rejoin English football's elite as champions this time around. After last season's heart-breaking play-off semi-final defeat to Brentford, Bournemouth are 50/1 (51.0) to make absolutely sure of a return to the Premier League by clinching top spot. Having left Fulham to move to the Vitality Stadium in the summer of 2021, Scott Parker has his current charges ranked as the closest challengers to his former club, but everyone outside of west London appears to be playing for second place. With Fulham already preparing for a return to the big time and Bournemouth highly tipped at 1/6 (1.17), Nottingham Forest have become the value bet at 4/5 (1.8) as Steve Cooper seeks to wake a sleeping giant of English football from the deepest of slumbers. The former Swansea City boss has made a remarkable impact at the City Ground since succeeding Chris Hughton and has the Reds looking to return to the top flight for the first time in the 21st century. Luton Town have exceeded all expectations to sit fifth with only two games left on their schedule, while the same can be said for Huddersfield Town - who occupy fourth spot - and they are both priced at 9/2 (5.5) to bounce their way back into the big time. Sheffield United are attempting to yo-yo into the Premier League at the first time of asking and remain very much in the mix at 11/4 (3.75), but Middlesbrough have been pushed out to 10/1 (11.0) despite benefiting from the ability of former Blades boss Chris Wilder to master the Championship following his appointment in early November. Millwall are desperately clinging to the coattails of the top six-chasing pack, but they will require favours from others on the final day of the regular season in order to secure tickets to the play-off lottery and are priced at 500/1 (501.0) as a result.

Sky Sportin Italy reports that Kalidou Koulibaly and Victor Osimhen could still leave the club this summer. The Serie A side hopes to convince the defender to stay but has decided they would listen to offers of over ‚Ç¨100 million for Osimhen. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah is tempted by the prospect of a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain - according toThe Telegraph. The 29-year-old is approaching the final year of his contract at Anfield and has yet to agree an extension with the club. PSG are among those interested in Salah, who would be open to joining the Ligue 1 champions, but he is also likely to consider a move to Spain if his future at Liverpool cannot be tied up.  Tottenham and Leeds are among the teams considering a summer move for Derby teenager Malcolm Ebiowei. The Sunreports the Premier League sides have been keeping track of the 18-year-old striker, who has made 18 Championship appearances this season. Championship winners Fulham are also in contention to land him.  Arsenal are, according to theDaily Mail, lining up one final bid to get Eddie Nketiah to sign a new contract. The Ghana prospectcontinues to head towards free agency as things stand, but has been catching the eye of late after being given more regular opportunities to prove his worth.  Leicester are considering a double swoop for Strasbourg duo Habib Diallo and Habib Diarra, according toFootmercato. Diallo has scored 12 goals this campaign to help lift Julian Stephan's side into European contention in Ligue 1. Diarra, 18, has featured less frequently but the highly-rated teenager has caught the eye of Foxes scouts. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

23,https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-liverpool-star-equals-lampard-s-champions-league-record/bltd1876dcaa5bab4dc,Mane: Liverpool star equals Lampard's Champions League record,"Sadio Mane has equalled Frank Lampard‚Äôs record as the player with the most goals in the Champions League knockout stages for an English team. Sadio Man√© ‚öΩÔ∏è =  Frank Lampard ‚öΩÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/gP39KZuKF7 The reigning African Player of the Year was among the goalscorers as Liverpool secured a 3-2 comeback victory over Villarreal in Tuesday‚Äôs semi-final second leg clash at Estadio de la Ceramica. Despite the Yellow Submarine leading 2-0 at half time, they failed to reach the final as they allowed the Premier League side to score three second half goals through Fabinho, Luis Diaz and the Senegal international. Mane‚Äôs effort also saw him overtake Didier Drogba's feat to become Africa‚Äôs highest goalscorer in the tournament‚Äôs knockout phase with 15 goals. Former England international Lampard achieved that milestone during his trophy-laden career at Chelsea between 2001 and 2014. Should the African Cup of Nations winner find the net in the final at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, the 30-year-old would eclipse the Englishman‚Äôs record. Alongside Salah and Mali prospect Ibrahima Konate, Mane was in action from start to finish against Unai Emery‚Äôs men. For Salah, who has now failed to score in his last four matches in the European competition, he could match the Drogba and Sergio Aguero should he get a hat-trick in the final on May 28. As things stand, the Egypt international is just three behind both the Ivorian and Argentine for the most goals netted in the Champions League for an English side (36 goals each). The last time he hit the target in Europe was against Inter Milan on February 16 in the Round of 16 as Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men secured a 2-0 away win in Italy. On whether he sets himself goals and assists targets each season, Salah told the Liverpool website: ‚ÄúAlways. Before the season starts I know what I want from the season individually and collectively, for sure. ‚ÄúThe collective is the most important thing and the first target for the season as well. I have big expectations for myself. Honestly, I never said it before but before the season starts, I was like, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôll go for 40 goals a season and 10 assists, 15 assists.‚Äô So I now reached the assists before getting the goals!‚Äù Liverpool have now reached their 10th European Cup/Champions League final, the fourth side to reach the competition showpiece on 10+ occasions, after Real Madrid (16), Bayern Munich (11) and AC Milan (11).

The individuals have been accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players. According to The Guardian, Eyi - who was the national U17 coach - has already admitted to committing the aforementioned crimes and is waiting to be sentenced. Mombo, who is heading Gabon's top tier, is also under investigation alongside Orphee Mickala of Tout Puissant Akwembe FC and Moussavou FC's Triphel Mabicka. Mombo allegedly sexually abused young players and demanded sex from players to secure places for them on the national team. The administrator has denied the claims. The suspects have been banned from all football-related activities for 90 days by the world football governing body. ""These sanctions have been imposed in connection with ongoing criminal investigations concerning the above-mentioned Gabonese football officials, who were identified as having allegedly been involved in acts of systematic sexual abuse against minor players, as reported by local authorities and published in certain media outlets,"" read part of the statement from Fifa. The Gabonese Football Federation President Pierre-Alain Mounguengui has also undergone pre-trial detention at the central prison in Libreville after being arrested in connection with the aforementioned crimes. Despite not being directly connected with the crimes, the 64-year-old might serve up to three years in jail if found guilty of not reporting the offenses against the minors. An initial statement from the international player's union, Fifpro, asked action to be taken to prevent sexual abuses from happening and urged the Gabon government to treat the case as 'a matter of urgency'. ""Our preliminary inquiries yielded consistent evidence from credible witnesses who all tell of an ongoing and long-embedded practice of forcing young players into sexual relationships as a pre-condition for footballing opportunities,"" Fifpro stated. ""If these allegations are indeed true, it is yet further evidence that football is being consistently exploited, across leagues and continents, as a forum for abusers to access, groom, extort and assault players. More must be done to prevent this horrific abuse and we call on football‚Äôs governing bodies to act as a matter of urgency."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

25,https://www.goal.com/en/news/leipzig-s-gvardiol-on-chelsea-s-transfer-shortlist-to/blt710d41f3623dd83f,Leipzig's Gvardiol on Chelsea's transfer shortlist to replace Rudiger and Christensen,"Chelsea have earmarked RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol to replace the outgoing Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. The 20-year-old defender is seen as a good option to play on the left side of a back three and is being considered for a summer move despite his age. Of course, he isn't the only target and the Blues are currently unable to properly plan for the summer until the club's new owners take over from Roman Abramovich as talks remain ongoing. The Blues have also identified Sevilla's Jules Kounde, Paris Saint-Germain defender Presnel Kimpembe and Atletico Madrid's Jose Giminez as potential signings. In all three cases, the Blues have explored options to sign them in the past, with Chelsea having pushed right up to last summer's deadline day to try to sign Kounde. Even in Gvardiol's case, the Blues have been scouting him ever since he broke through with the Croatian giants Dinamo. They sent scouts to watch him personally on at least two occasions and have continued to monitor him from afar with their video and data-driven scouting systems. It is thought Thomas Tuchel could sign two defenders to replace both his outgoing ones with Rudiger having agreed a deal with Real Madrid and Christensen thought to have already done so with Barcelona. There remains the presence of exciting defenders in the loan group with Huddersfield's Levi Colwill, Venezia's Ethan Ampadu and Blackpool's Dujon Sterling as alternative options to be recalled to bolster the squad. There are also midfield targets like West Ham's Declan Rice and Monaco's Aurelien Tchoameni on Chelsea's radar but there's fierce competition for both players and the Blues would have to successfully sell one of their senior midfielders to make it happen. Crystal Palace midfielder Conor Gallagher is the one loanee who is almost certain to return in the summer. Most clubs have begun their transfer market activity despite the various leagues finishing off their final few fixtures. However, due to sanctions placed on the club after Roman Abramovich was deemed to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin by the UK Government, they are unable to plan for the future. Aside from scouting and drawing up shortlists, the Blues can't do much and are keeping the majority of their activity in-house. It is hoped that the sale of the club to Todd Boehly's consortium is completed soo. The Government is urging the board and Raine Group to hurry the process along before the licence expires on 31 May 2022. After that, they would have to draw up a new operating license and many within the club think that extending restrictions beyond that day would become damaging for the future. There's currently plenty of hope, however, that the sale will be concluded before the transfer window opens on 10 June. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Pharaohs' captain has been a key factor for the Reds in all competitions this term, particularly in the Premier League, where he has scored 22 goals and provided 13 assists to ensure the team continue to push for the title. They are currently a point behind leaders Manchester City, who are on 83 points, while Salah has also scored eight goals in 11 Uefa Champions League matches, helping Liverpool reach the semis in the UCL as well as an FA Cup final. The Merseyside charges have won the League Cup already and Salah played his role in ensuring the team secures their first silverware this season...it's enough to convince Rio that he deserves the Player of the Season prize. ""There is only one man for me, I have to be honest, he has been decisive,"" Ferdinand said on his official YouTube channel. ""He has the most goals and the most assists in the league, you can‚Äôt go against that. ""It is Mo Salah. He has been ridiculous. You can see fear in defenders when he is on the pitch, he does every part of the game really well. His finishing, he does all types of finishes. ""You just look at the goals and assists, that is enough to say he is the most decisive player in this league."" Salah is in the Liverpool team that has travelled to Spain to play Villarreal in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, hoping to complete the job and make it to the final. The Reds won the first leg at Anfield 2-0. ""It's half-time. In the best possible way, you ignore the result from the first game,"" Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp stated ahead of the game. ""If that would be a cup game, only one game and it would be decided and we have to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there ‚Äì and that's what we want to try there. Knowing that they will go with all they have, it's absolutely clear."" Salah was introduced from the bench at the weekend as Liverpool defeated Newcastle United 1-0 away. ""It will be a tough one, but it's fine, really completely fine, because a Champions League semi-final should be tough and that's absolutely OK,"" Klopp continued. ""We never expected it to be easy, this will not be easy, but we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

27,https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-young-man-utd-fan-begs-cavani-not-to-leave-gifts/blt302b88e570f94b2a,Watch: Young Man Utd fan begs Cavani not to leave and gifts him headband,"A young Manchester United fan has begged Edinson Cavani not to leave Manchester United, with the veteran Uruguayan striker among those heading towards free agency. At 35 years of age, and having been restricted to just 18 appearances across all competitions this season, one of the finest finishers in world football will be bidding farewell to Old Trafford over the summer. His departure, after hitting 17 goals last season, will sting for some, with one particular Red Devils follower gutted to see her idol heading for the exits. The supporter in question, who is called Lola, was thrilled to meet up with her sporting hero following United‚Äôs 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford ‚Äì with Cavani seeing 15 minutes off the bench in that contest as he said his goodbyes to the Old Trafford faithful. The South American was happy to interact with a young fan as he made his way out of the ground and even went as far as donning a ‚ÄúMiss Kick‚Äù head band that Lola was desperate for him to have a picture taken with. Proving that he remains a class act on and off the field, Cavani was branded a ‚Äúlegend‚Äù for making the dreams of a passionate follower come true. The former Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain frontman made a move to Manchester as a free agent in October 2020 after a number of other clubs passed up the opportunity to snap him up. United‚Äôs show of faith was rewarded with an impressive haul of goals in his debut campaign, with Cavani finishing the season as the Red Devils‚Äô third-top marksman behind Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. He agreed to extend his spell in England for a further 12 months, but he has struggled for a spark this term alongside a number of underperforming colleagues. A lack of regular minutes has done Cavani‚Äôs cause few favours, with only six Premier League starts taken in as he sits behind returning hero Cristiano Ronaldo in the attacking pecking order. With limited game time taken into account, a man with over 370 club goals to his name ‚Äì and a further 54 for his country ‚Äì has decided that he will be taking on a new challenge in 2022-23. There has been talk of interest being shown from La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, while a return to his native South American at Argentine giants Boca Juniors has also been speculated on for some time.

Ronaldo scored his 18th Premier League goal of the season during United's 3-0 home win against Brentford on Monday, dispatching a 61st-minute penalty in emphatic fashion. United are destined to miss out on Champions League qualification despite the victory, and it has been suggested that Ronaldo will seek a move in the summer transfer window, but he seemed to indicate that he plans to stick around after the final whistle. Ronaldo joined the rest of his team-mates in a lap of honour to mark the Red Devils' final home fixture of the 2021-22 campaign, and was closely followed by the Sky Sports cameras. The 37-year-old was heard talking into the camera at one stage, and a fan account on Instagram subsequently claimed that he'd said ""I'm not finished"" in an apparent hint that he will see out the final year of his contract at Old Trafford. When walking off the pitch in his final home game for Man Utd this season, Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to send a message to the camera üëÄpic.twitter.com/8zW02vGYgw That might not end up being the case, however, as Ronaldo has replied directly to the post by clarifying: ""I didn't say that."" Ronaldo only returned to United from Juve last summer, and has since netted 24 goals across all competitions for the club, but has ultimately been powerless to prevent them from extending their recent trophy drought to five years. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has been tipped to move on when the transfer market reopens, and has been linked with a number of top clubs, including Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo did send one clear message after the Brentford game, though, during which the Portugal forward seemed to hint that he still feels he has unfinished business in Manchester. ‚ÄúOnce again, great support from the stands,"" he wrote on Instagram. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take this opportunity of our last game of the season at Old Trafford to thank our amazing supporters, who endured a difficult season by our side and never abandoned us. ‚ÄúThanks, guys. Your support means the world to us and our goal is to become better everyday, so that we can achieve what we all want: glory for Man. United!‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Belgium international midfielder has starred during the reign of the Catalan coach at the Etihad Stadium, with three Premier League titles and four League Cup triumphs complemented by back-to-back PFA Player of the Year successes. De Bruyne has taken in over 250 appearances as Guardiola calls the shots, enhancing his reputation as one of the finest creative talents on the planet, but the 30-year-old remains reluctant to be drawn on whether he is a better player now than he was in 2016. When that question was put to the talented Belgian ahead of a Champions League semi-final second-leg clash with Real Madrid, De Bruyne said: ‚ÄúIt's hard to tell. Maybe yes, maybe no. ‚ÄúObviously he has helped me to progress in various ways but it's hard to say I would or would not be like this with other managers. ‚ÄúHe has done amazing things with me and the team to get success but the players work very hard to achieve that - if you don't want to listen or work hard you won't get better. ‚ÄúIt is a combination of everything. I'm lucky to come across a manager who plays the way I like to play and that makes it more handy for me.‚Äù When the heat is on, Kevin De Bruyne stays ice-cold üßä pic.twitter.com/z2ch82q7sR Guardiola has given De Bruyne freedom to express himself in the middle of the park, with an impressive number of goals and assists delivered as a result. There have been suggestions that he could come into Ballon d‚ÄôOr contention, as he continues to be showered with praise in the Premier League, with a humble but ambitious operator considered by many to be performing at the peak of his powers. Quizzed on whether he feels like the best version of himself, De Bruyne added: ‚ÄúYou guys can tell me. ‚ÄúThe first months of the season were really hard, I have never experienced the pain that I had back then. I was trying to come back but was in pain with my ankle every day and it wasn't something I enjoyed. ‚ÄúMentally it was hard to overcome that but once the pain was gone after a couple of months I started to feel more confident in myself and my body to get back to where I belong and now playing all these games week in, week out, I feel back to the level that I was before. ‚ÄúI don't know if there is much difference from before, I just try to be as constant as I can and I think I have managed myself very well.‚Äù De Bruyne has taken in 40 appearances for City across all competitions this season, registering 15 goals and 12 assists.

Only four places among the continental elite can be secured through final top-flight standings, but there are three consolation prizes up for grabs. Some heavyweight outfits have already hit their ultimate targets when it comes to European qualification, but others are set to be left disappointed after seeing struggles for consistency cost them dear. Which sides will end up where in 2022-23? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Title-chasing Manchester City and Liverpool are guaranteed to be gracing the group stage of next season‚Äôs Champions League. They will be finishing as the Premier League‚Äôs top two in 2021-22, but it remains to be seen in what order as the battle for domestic supremacy goes down to the wire. It appeared for long periods as though Chelsea would ease their way to third place, but the Blues have started to wobble of late and the 2021 Champions League winners are beginning to shoot concerned glances over collective shoulders. Arsenal, after a five-year absence from European football‚Äôs top table, are desperate to force their way back into the Premier League‚Äôs top four and may yet be able to edge their way above London rivals Chelsea into third ‚Äì with neighbours Tottenham clinging to their coattails. West Ham could add a fifth Premier League entry to the Champions League pot for 2022-23, but they would need to win the Europa League this term in order to make that possible and have work to do in a semi-final showdown with Eintracht Frankfurt that they currently trail 2-1 on aggregate. Teams qualifying for the Champions League as things stand: Team Position Manchester City 1st Liverpool 2nd Chelsea 3rd Arsenal 4th Tottenham remain very much in the hunt for a top-four finish, with a potentially crucial derby date with north London foes Arsenal fast approaching. They also have an opportunity to rein in Chelsea, but would happily settle for fourth place if Antonio Conte can get them over that line. For now, Spurs sit fifth and have Thursday night football on the agenda for next season. Manchester United are in a similar boat, with the Red Devils seeing Champions League ambitions dashed for a fourth time in the space of seven years. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was unable to get the Red Devils firing, even after acquiring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho, and interim coach Ralf Rangnick will head upstairs into a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer knowing that he has also failed to deliver on his remit. There is still a chance that United, who are heading towards potentially their worst Premier League finish, could slip out of sixth spot in what would be another truly humbling fall from grace. No Europa League places will be filled by the winners of domestic cup competitions in England this season as Liverpool lifted the Carabao Cup and the Reds will also be lining up against Chelsea in the final of the FA Cup. Teams qualifying for the Europa League as things stand: Team Position Tottenham 5th Manchester United 6th As mentioned, West Ham are still in the hunt for Europa League glory this season and have started to put all of their eggs in that particular basket. If David Moyes‚Äô men were to come up short, there is still a chance that they will be returning to a continental stage in 2022-23. They sit seventh in the Premier League at present and could catch Manchester United if the wheels were to fall off at Old Trafford in dramatic fashion. While they continue to look upwards for now, there is also the threat of Wolves chasing them down from behind ‚Äì with the men from Molineux boasting a game in hand that could help to fire them towards the Europa Conference League. There is just one place in that competition up for grabs when it comes to teams in England, with Leicester dropping into it this season ‚Äì and making their way to the last four ‚Äì after slipping out of the Europa League.

31,https://www.goal.com/en/news/emery-klopp-basel-bar-liverpool-path-european-glory/bltf07fd194f2d47eef,"Emery, Klopp and the night in a Basel bar which set Liverpool on the path to European glory","Bed was the only thing on Jordan Henderson‚Äôs mind when he returned to Basel‚Äôs Novotel hotel. It was just before midnight, and it had not been a good day. Having led at half-time, Liverpool had lost, painfully, to Sevilla in the final of the Europa League, their 3-1 defeat ensuring another trophyless season for the men from Anfield. Henderson himself had not even made it off the bench. Having rushed back from a knee injury to feature, the captain watched on as Jurgen Klopp instead turned to Divock Origi, Joe Allen and Christian Benteke in a fruitless attempt to turn the tide. Back at the hotel, the plan was to switch off, to try and force some sleep and hide from the disappointment and the bitterness. ‚ÄúTo not see anybody and get my head down,‚Äù as he put it. Klopp had other ideas. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got 10 minutes,‚Äù the manager told his players and staff. ‚ÄúAnd then I want you all back down here in the bar. All of you.‚Äù Henderson was reluctant - ‚ÄúIt was the last thing I wanted, to be honest‚Äù - but he and his team-mates obliged. And as the minutes passed, the pain slowly began to subside. Soon there were smiles and there was laughter. Perspective had been restored, positivity had returned. Some time in the early hours, Klopp grabbed a microphone. ‚ÄúWe are Liverpool, tra-la-la-la-la,‚Äù he sang, urging the rest to join in. They did. Defiance in Switzerland. It was daylight before the last of the stragglers headed to their rooms. Almost six years on, Henderson looks back on that impromptu party and recognises its significance. ‚ÄúI will always remember it,‚Äù he told reporters before Liverpool‚Äôs victory over Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final last week. ‚ÄúThe manager was different, his mentality was different. It felt as if he knew it was the start of something to come.‚Äù Klopp had been as saddened as anyone by what had happened in St Jakob Park, cutting a forlorn figure as his side fell apart in the second half. But in his post-match press conference, he would deliver one of the most prescient quotes of his Liverpool reign. ""Someday,‚Äù he told reporters, ‚Äúeverybody will say that Basel was a very decisive moment for the wonderful future of Liverpool FC.‚Äù Much has changed since then, of course. Only four of Liverpool‚Äôs 18-man squad - Henderson, Origi, James Milner and Roberto Firmino - remain, and the Reds have long moved past the Europa League as a point of reference. If they finish the job against Villarreal on Tuesday, they will contest their third Champions League final in five seasons. Klopp has built an incredible side, and plenty of its origins can be traced back to Basel, and the lessons learned at the hands of Unai Emery and Sevilla. It was the manner of that defeat, for example, which convinced Klopp of the need to add serious attacking speed and a more flexible, physical kind of midfielder. He signed both Sadio Mane and Gini Wijnaldum, as well as Joel Matip, that summer, and offloaded no fewer than 15 players, including four of his 18-man squad in Basel. He had arrived on Merseyside convinced that the team he had inherited from Brendan Rodgers was a good one, but had quickly realised there were deep-rooted issues in terms of confidence and mentality. As he told his players in one memorable meeting: ‚Äúnobody likes this team, not even ourselves.‚Äù Changing that mindset was already high on the agenda, but even more so after Sevilla, whose comeback opened up all of the scars Liverpool would rather have kept hidden. Put under pressure, they folded, losing their lead, their composure, their belief and finally the game. Even Klopp was criticised, spending much of the second-half attempting to whip up the crowd as his substitutions and tactical tweaks had minimal effect. ‚ÄúThe first thing you have to do when you look at the man in the mirror is criticise yourself,‚Äù he admitted afterwards. ‚ÄúI can improve a lot.‚Äù He also promised that Liverpool would ‚Äúuse this experience together‚Äù, that they would learn and grow and improve. They did. Within 12 months they were back in the Champions League, their side then evolving further with the arrivals of Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, as well as the perfectly-timed emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold. They have not looked back since, nailing their recruitment and growing into one of the two best teams in Europe, and perhaps the best in Reds history. The fact there is even a discussion is remarkable, given the greats that have gone before. If May goes as well as February, March and April did, this side could end up with everything they could ever wish for - FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League, to go with the Carabao Cup they won earlier this year. In their way this week, of course, is a familiar foe. Emery hurt them with Sevilla and he could hurt them again with Villarreal, even if Liverpool looked a cut above when securing a 2-0 first leg lead at Anfield last Wednesday. A red-hot atmosphere is expected at the Estadio de la Ceramica. Villarreal have little to lose and everything to gain, and know the first goal, whenever it should arrive, would put them right back in the tie. Even if they get it, though, do not expect Liverpool to panic. Not this team. The world has changed since Basel. And Klopp and his side have their eye on Paris this time around.

The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward has had two spells as part of the coaching staff for the Netherlands national side, while also working within the youth structure at PSV. But this summer, Van Nistelrooy will make the step up to take charge of the senior side in Eindhoven, replacing the outgoing Roger Schmidt after a season in charge of Jong PSV in the second tier of Dutch football. Given his playing career, the 45-year-old will be expected to particularly oversee improvements in attack, though there is a chance he will first have to rebuild his forward line. Cody Gakpo is expected to move on, with a host of Europe's biggest clubs - including Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich - having been linked with the 22-year-old winger. At the start of the season, the same thing was expected for Noni Madueke, but injuries have hampered the England youth international in 2021-22, meaning the Premier League and Bundesliga clubs that are keen on the forward may well decide to look elsewhere, at least for now. Regardless, Van Nistelrooy is going to require reinforcements, one of which could be the teenager that has lit up his own side this term. With just a single game of Jong PSV's season to play, Johan Bakayoko can already boast a record of 17 goals and 11 assists for the team in 2021-22, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 85.4 minutes in the second division. Madueke, is that you? üßêDe 18-jarige Johan Bakayoko steelt de show bij Jong PSV tegen Almere City: twee assists en een goal ‚ú®#JPSALM pic.twitter.com/G5Cj5p0psn Given he only managed a solitary strike and three assists in 19 appearances at that level last season, that is quite some improvement from the Belgium youth international, and one which Van Nistelrooy has played a key role in. ""You can see that he has power and also a good shot,"" Van Nistelrooy told ESPN in January. ""He plays such controlled football that you forget that he is only 18. ""If he continues to invest so much in what he does, he is a boy who is on the right track to join the first team at the end of the season."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That step has not quite materialised, however, with the 19-year-old having made just two appearances off the bench for PSV's senior side thus far, but that is likely to change once Van Nistelrooy takes the reins. PSV certainly envisaged him becoming a first-team player when they tempted him to join the club from Anderlecht in 2019, with Bakayoko having previously spent time at Club Brugge and Mechelen. His first two seasons with the club, though, suggested that he may be some distance off that level, and that following Madueke's path of starring for the youth sides before making an impact on the Eredivisie was unlikely. The club, though, saw things differently, and in the summer of 2021 offered the teenager a new four-year contract, which Bakayoko signed while donned in a white suit and red bowtie. ""Now it's up to me to prove that I can put up the numbers required of me,"" he said at the time. ""I want to be more decisive in terms of my stats, and I've been talking to the coaches about doing that."" He has been a man of his word, honing his finishing ability under Van Nistelrooy's watchful eye, though he is much more than a player who puts the ball in the net. Naturally left-footed, he generally plays from the right-hand side, using his speed and close control to cause nightmares for opposing full-backs before cutting inside to either score or create chances for his team-mates. With six, he has the most goals from outside the penalty area in the Dutch second tier, with his decision making in terms of when to try his luck and when to look for help much improved from previous years. ""At the beginning of 2021, Johan was not doing well,"" his agent, Gerard Witters, told Het Nieuwsblad. ""But after he got his new contract, everything changed. ""He started to boost his stats and his recent games were phenomenal. The club has told me that Johan is already better than they initially thought he would be. ""Before he sometimes played like a crazy dog. He had great qualities and was very explosive, but he produced poor crosses and took shots when they were not the best option. ""Now he knows a lot more what he's going to do and defenders can't stop him anymore, despite the fact that he always does the same movement (cutting inside).‚Äù Bakayoko's form has been particularly good since the season's winter break, with his confidence spiking after he netted four times against VVV-Venlo in January. More recently, he came off the bench for the final 33 minutes against FC Eindhoven and scored twice before assisting PSV's third goal in a game that looked to be heading for a draw until the youngster's introduction. Now the challenge becomes replicating those performances against the best teams in the land, with PSV hopeful of yet again challenging Ajax for the title after their back-and-forth race this season. His history with Van Nistelrooy should certainly help in that respect, and if the legendary striker is to succeed as a coach, then he will hope that he can soon rely on his young charge to lead the way.

The Cottagers took down Preston North End 3-0 to earn their spot in England's top-flight while continuing their run towards winning the Championship with four games left to play. Their promotion owes much to the form of Aleksander Mitrovic, who reached the 40-goal mark for the season with a brace against Preston. With the win, Fulham have now secured 86 points after 42 games, sealing promotion while making them the favourites to win the title. Star striker Mitrovicbroke the Championship goal record back in February with his 32nd goal of the campaign, and he's gone on to add more since.

A week after the Bavarian giants secured a 10th straight Bundesliga title, their winning streak was brought to an end when Mainz outclassed Julian Nagelsmann's team. The squad took a two-day trip to Ibiza in the wake of the defeat, much to the ire of club legend and pundit Lothar Matthaus. The ex-Germany star said on Sky: ""It doesn't fit at all, especially after a game like this. If you had won yesterday, I would say: stay in Ibiza for three days."" He added: ""It's not possible after this game! Not only because of the players, but also because of FC Bayern's public image. Bayern fans get angry and then the players go on vacation. ""Free days are normally cancelled after such a display."" Matthaus is not the only prominent voice in Germany to hit out at Bayern this weekend, as Hertha Berlin coach Felix Magathcriticised them for taking their foot off the gas immediately after winning the league title. ""For all teams, the season lasts until the last matchday and I don't know why a team can then say: 'We won't play the season to the end and coast through three matchdays before closing.'It doesn't serve the Bundesliga or the competition,"" he said. Bayern director Hasan Salihamdzicdefended the team's holiday in Ibiza, telling Sport1: ""Last week the players informed us that they would like to spend the free days as a group on Ibiza. ""We accepted it as a team-building exercise. ""As a player, I learned that you can becomestronger from dealing with losses. ""Such a group trip can be the basis for that.""

The 48-year-old, who recently signed a contract extension until 2026, has made the decision to step down from his role following meetings with CEO Edwin van der Sar and the club's supervisory board. The director said he feels ""ashamed"" of his actions after it was revealed he had sent a series of messages to employees of the club. ""I am ashamed. Last week I was confronted with reports about my behavior. And how this has come across to others,"" Overmars said in a statement published on Ajax's website. ""Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I was crossing the line with this, but that was made clear to me in recent days. ""I suddenly felt enormous pressure. I apologise. Certainly for someone in my position, this behavior is unacceptable. I now see that too. But it is too late. I see no other option but to leave Ajax. ""This also has a major impact on my private situation. That is why I ask everyone to leave me and my family alone."" In his comments on the situation, supervisory board chairman Leen Meijaard said the revelations of Overmars' messages were ""devastating for the women who have had to deal with the behavior"". He added: ""Marc is probably the best football director that Ajax has had. We upgraded and extended his contract for a reason. But, unfortunately, he has really gone over the line, so continuing as director was not an option, as he recognized himself. It is extremely painful for everyone. I want to express the wish that everyone involved is given the peace and privacy to process this."" The club's chief executive, Van der Sar, described the situation as ""appalling"", telling the club's website: ""I find the situation appalling for everyone and I agree with [supervisory board chairman] Leen Meijaard's words. ""In my role, I also feel responsible to help colleagues. A safe working climate is very important for everyone at Ajax. We will pay even more attention to this in the near future. Marc and I have been playing together since the early 1990s, first at Ajax and then with the national team and we have been colleagues in the management of Ajax for almost ten years now.

39,https://www.goal.com/en/news/overmars-antwerp-technical-directorajax-inappropriate/bltf86f3edaca6cc37d,Overmars named Antwerp technical director just weeks after leaving Ajax following 'inappropriate messages' to female colleagues,"Marc Overmars is to become technical director at Royal Antwerp, just weeks after leaving Ajax due to the sending of ""inappropriate messages"" to female colleagues. Overmars had served as Ajax's sporting director for close to a decade before stepping down in February, with his reputation left tarnished after a series of harassment allegations were lodged against him. The 48-year-old issued an apology for his actions but Ajax admitted there was ""no option"" for him to continue in his role after stepping ""over the line"", leading to question marks over his future in the game. Overmars is returning to football by signing a multi-year contract at Antwerp, with his official presentation taking place on Monday. The Belgian club regard the controversial nature of his Ajax departure as a private matter, and identified him as a good fit for the position of technical director based on his record in the boardroom at Johan Cruyff ArenA. Overmars has been drafted in as a long-term successor to Luciano D'Onofrio, who had been in charge of Antwerp's transfer dealings up until last summer. The Dutchman's tenure could yet be affected by the results of the Institute of Sports Law's examination into his case at Ajax, though, with it possible he could face punishment for his behaviour towards several female colleagues. Antwerp's interest in Overmars stemmed from his impressive recruitment record at Ajax, as he invested ‚Ç¨350 million in the squad between 2013 and 2021. The former Arsenal star and Netherlands international played a key role in helping the club win multiple Eredivisie titles and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, securing cut-price deals for the likes of Frenkie de Jong, David Neres and Nicolas Tagliafico. Overmars will now be tasked with taking Antwerp to the next level, as they currently sit third in the Belgian Pro League with aspirations to become a Champions League side in the coming years.

41,https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-man-utd-picked-ten-hag-over-pochettino-new-manager/blt8d448c41282193f2,Why Man Utd picked Ten Hag over Pochettino to be their new manager,"In the end, it came down to two choices for Manchester United: Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag? The well-known former Premier League manager against the ‚Äòmysterious‚Äô Dutchman who has transformed Ajax over the last few years. It took just one round of formal interviews for Ten Hag to emerge as the leading candidate, as he impressed John Murtough and Darren Fletcher with his plan for putting United back on top and Pochettino, who had led the managerial hunt process for a while, was pushed into second place. Originally, there had been four candidates on the shortlist to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick, with Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui and Spain national team manager Luis Enrique also in contention. Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and others were considered but never as concrete options due to various obstacles. However, by the beginning of April, four had become one, with the United hierarchy having settled on Ten Hag, whose appointment was confirmed on Thursday morning. It is understood that the 52-year-old made quite the impression when Murtough and Fletcher flew to Amsterdam to conduct the formal interview. The pair, who led the process, were struck by his passion, energy and enthusiasm for the huge challenge which is getting United competing for major honours again. OFFICIAL: Manchester United confirm Erik ten Hag as their next manager üî¥ pic.twitter.com/pJFKinQtSu His no-nonsense approach to management was also evident as he clearly pointed out departments and other areas within the club that need to be improved. This week it was confirmed that two heads of United‚Äôs scouting system, Marcel Bout and Jim Lawlor, will be leaving the club at the end of the season after eight and 16 years of service, respectively. While sources say those decisions are not down to Ten Hag, they are the first departures of what is set to be a busy summer of restructuring and rebuilding at Old Trafford. And it‚Äôs not just club staff that will be at risk ‚Äì the squad needs a big clear-out too. The players‚Äô preferred choice was Pochettino, with some senior players believing they would thrive under the guidance of the former Spurs boss. However, sources say Ten Hag was the ""unanimous choice"" with the board after the interview process and despite what some of the players thought, they believe he has the capability and vision required for the next stage of the rebuild. Richard Arnold, the club‚Äôs new chief executive, met with Ten Hag after his formal interview to give his stamp of approval and while Rangnick insists he was not part of the decision-making process, the German was asked for his opinion in the recruitment meetings he was involved in. Club sources say Ten Hag was the candidate who was ""most closely aligned with the club‚Äôs identity and strategy"" and his commitment to improving and developing young players was also considered a major plus. His attack-minded playing style also appealed. The Dutchman has spoken openly about his admiration for Pep Guardiola, admitting that the Manchester City boss has influenced his footballing philosophy. While sources dispute the claim that financial factors played a part in Ten Hag's appointment, it was appealing to United that they would only have to pay Ajax ¬£1.6 million ($2m) in compensation fees, given it would have been far more expensive to have prised Pochettino away from Paris Saint-Germain. Meanwhile, the timing of the appointment has been key for those involved in the recruitment process, with sources revealing that United were determined to have a deal agreed with their new manager before the end of the season. GOAL understands that the club have been pushing ahead with their usual transfer process and have shortlisted players for each of the priority positions. A central midfielder, striker and defender are on the shopping list and Ten Hag will be able to make a decision on the chosen targets while also presenting his own options. Still, this is an appointment that carries some risk. For all the clamour and excitement surrounding the imminent arrival of Ten Hag, he has never previously worked in the Premier League, unlike Pochettino. However, club sources believe that his other attributes are strong enough to ensure that his lack of experience in England will not be an issue. Murtough said: ‚ÄúIn our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that.‚Äù Only time will tell if he is capable of getting United out of their current mess, but the belief is that there is no better man for the job right now.

42,https://www.goal.com/en/news/would-man-city-sell-gabriel-jesus-arsenal/blta434fde6e10b4969,Would Man City be mad to sell Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal?,"No Brazilian has more goals per minute in the Champions League than Gabriel Jesus. Not Neymar. Not even the original Ronaldo. Nor Romario, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo or Kaka, for that matter. And no Brazilian has a better goals per minutes ratio in the Premier League either, with Jesus ahead of players such as Roberto Firmino, Philippe Coutinho and Robinho. So in a week where he scored five times to keep Manchester City's challenge for a Champions League and Premier League double alive, it seems crazy that the club would consider allowing him to leave. Against Watford on Saturday, he was clinical, netting with three instinctive finishes and a penalty to keep the Premier League leaders a point clear at the top of the table. In midweek against Real Madrid, meanwhile, his performance was even more impressive, as he terrorised David Alaba and Eder Militao with the intensity and pressing that Pep Guardiola loves. And when an early opportunity presented itself, he kept his cool to turn and slot his shot past Thibaut Courtois. Add in his goal in the massive Premier League clash against Liverpool earlier this month, and Guardiola has turned to Jesus for arguably the two biggest games of City's season, and the forward has responded. Vivendo um sonho. üí≠#al√¥m√£e#gratid√£o#doperi pic.twitter.com/rRfQJ2ncGk As a snapshot of his season, it portrays a key figure delivering for one of the best teams in the world. But zoom out and the picture becomes a little more distorted, as a player that is often on the periphery starts to emerge. In a team that is without the central striker that Guardiola spent all last summer searching for, Jesus has only seven Premier League goals this season, including those four against Watford ‚Äì fewer than five of his team-mates. And his recall for the game against Liverpool in April was his first Premier League start in 2022, while the victory over Real Madrid was just his second Champions League start all season ‚Äì the other being in the last-16 second leg against Sporting CP when the tie was effectively over with City 5-0 up from the meeting in Lisbon. Zoom out even further, and you find a player that has not started for Brazil in any of their last five matches, including when he was missing from the Selecao's squad altogether for their recent World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia. His club future will prompt some soul-searching, but for a 25-year-old who is six months away from Qatar 2022, it is a frightening prospect that he might not be part of Tite's roster. To prove himself for his country, Jesus needs game time, but he has not been able to nail down a regular starting role at City. It was not easy when he first moved to the Etihad Stadium as a raw, exciting teenager from Palmeiras in January 2017, when he was competing directly with Sergio Aguero, the club's greatest ever goalscorer. And it will be no easier next season, with the added competition from Argentina international Julian Alvarez and the probable arrival of Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. But in the space in between, Jesus has still more often than not found himself on the outside looking in, which is why he is understandably considering his future. Arsenal and Barcelona have been linked with a move for him, and GOAL has learned that his agent, Paulo Pitombeira, has met with Arsenal technical director Edu to discuss a possible deal this summer. For now, Jesus' focus remains on the hunt for silverware with City as another big week looms on the horizon, starting with a huge Premier League clash at Leeds on Saturday, followed by a tantalising second leg in Madrid. ""It's not time to think about this,"" he told reporters about the links to Arsenal. ""I think you expect me to say this, but it's true, it is, this is no time to think about this. ""Now is the best moment of the season. I want to enjoy it, to keep focused on my team, with my team-mates, to fight for the Premier League."" But with just 12 months remaining on his contract, a decision on Jesus' future cannot be put on hold for too long. From City's point of view, they have a number of other senior players with contracts running into their final year, with deals for Raheem Sterling, Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez all expiring in the summer of 2023. Jesus is the most likely of the group that they can cash in on this summer, although Guardiola shows no signs of wanting him to leave. ‚ÄúGabriel is our player. He belongs to Manchester City,"" the City boss said last Saturday. ‚ÄúIf there is one person in world football that deserves days like Gabriel had [against Watford], then it is him. ""We are delighted ‚Äì he helped us a lot, as he always does.‚Äù But the power is with Jesus. He has already seen his friend and mentor Fernandinho announce that he will leave at the end of the season in a bid to continue his own playing career after also becoming a bit-part player at the Etihad Stadium, and Jesus could follow suit. Arsenal have shown an interest, and Mikel Arteta is a coach that Jesus knows well from his days as Guardiola's assistant. Moving, though, would be the biggest decision of Jesus' career to date, and while Guardiola and City would love to keep him, they may be powerless to stop him from walking through the exit doors.

Jesus, who joined City in 2017, is still fighting to hold down a regular starting place and has been linked with moves to Juventus, Barcelona and Arsenal. ‚ÄúI think it's not time to think about this,‚Äù the Brazilian told reporters when asked if he would stay and fight for his place if City added another striker. ‚ÄúI think you expect me to say this, but it's true. ‚ÄúNow is the best moment of the season, I want to enjoy it, to keep focused on my team, with my team-mates to fight for the Premier League. ‚ÄúI won it with my team-mates three times and I know how that feels and I want to have that feeling again and then, of course, we have the tough, tough game on Tuesday against Real Madrid, a tough opponent, and that is my focus.‚Äù With fierce competition for places, the Brazilian striker has started half of City‚Äôs Premier League matches but only once in the Champions League in a round of 16 clash against Sporting CP when the tie was already effectively won. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me, everyone's going to say I want to play,‚Äù Jesus added when asked about game time. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of good strikers, wingers and forwards, so yes, everyone wants to play. That's the challenge, you have to keep focused on the game and then when you get the opportunity, you try to do your best.‚Äù The 25-year-old goes into the Champions League semi-final first leg having scored an impressive four times in the 5-1 victory over Watford on Saturday, taking his total to 11 for the season. He also starred in both legs of the last-16 triumph over Real in 2020, scoring home and away in an unusual left-wing role. ‚ÄúI am happy because I have the confidence not just from [Pep Guardiola] but also from the players,‚Äù Jesus said. ‚ÄúIt's not news for me or for the players. ‚ÄúWhen I start or Riyad [Mahrez] starts, Raz [Sterling], Phil [Foden], [Jack] Grealish, Bernardo, [Ilkay] Gundogan, we try our best, everyone has the experience. ‚ÄúSo I'm still young, but I think in the last five or six years I have played a little bit tough and big games so I know I can play but sometimes the manager tries another player and I try to focus when I get the chance.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A season-long loan move to Huddersfield Town in the summer of 2021, therefore, offered Colwill the chance to show why he had garnered such a nickname while playing first-team football. To say Colwill was confident of doing just that would be an understatement. While Terry's famous No.26 shirt has been semi-retired at Chelsea since he left the club in 2017, Colwill wasted no time in picking the same number when he arrived in West Yorkshire. And Colwill has since shown exactly why he has been so regularly compared to the Blues legend. The teenager has made over 20 league starts for Huddersfield over the course of the campaign, putting in a series of impressive performances for a team that finds itself fourth in the Championship and chasing what would be a surprising promotion back to the Premier League. ""On the pitch, how we play and the intensity on the pitch is so different to academy football. It took me a few weeks to get used to it and I am still learning,"" Colwill told GOAL back in September. ""The manager, Carlos Corberan, made a brave choice because, as an 18-year-old coming to the Championship at centre-half from Chelsea, it may have led to everyone asking questions, saying: 'Is he just getting the chance because he came from a big club?' ""I needed to prove myself, but for him to trust me and bring me in, all I can say is thank you for trusting me."" From impersonating Steven Gerrard to impressing Thomas Tuchel üí™ Levi Colwill is following in John Terry's footsteps üîµ pic.twitter.com/FVBBCYUIp3 That trust has been repaid, with Colwill having put in the kind of performances that led to Leicester City attempting to hijack his loan in the January transfer window so he could spend the second half of the season at the King Power Stadium. And he is the latest in a long line of Premier League loanees to have thrived at the John Smith's Stadium. ""We had Ben Chilwell on his first loan from Leicester, we took Trevoh Chalobah from Chelsea, had Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal,"" Leigh Bromby, the ex-Premier League defender who is now head of football operations at Huddersfield, explains to GOAL. ""Before that, we had two Chelsea players in Izzy Brown and Kasey Palmer, while we also got Aaron Mooy in from Man City, and they all came in and did well. ""Now it is Levi's turn as one of our top-end loans, and he has come in and done well."" He adds: ""We looked at Levi last January, so we were aware of him before we signed him. I am sure there was more interest around Levi. ""There were teams aware of him, but luckily for us, we have a really good relationship with Chelsea and a backlog of successful loanees. ""As a person, he has fit in so well. It's his professionalism, the way he has conducted himself and approached the loan has been fantastic. ""Some players come in from bigger clubs and think maybe it will be easy. He has humility and openness to come in and work for his place and buy into what we are doing. ""He has been excellent and is not only a credit to himself but Chelsea, with the way they work with players and prepare them. The way he has fit into the dressing room has been unbelievable. ""The players and staff really like him and love working with him. He's looking to improve and working to get better. Talent-wise, for his age, he is the best I've seen when I've either been playing or coaching. ""The chances, for me, are so high that he will go back and play for Chelsea and England."" Colwill's form saw him recognised this week by NXGN, as he was the only Chelsea player to make the 50-man list of football's best wonderkids for 2022. The 19-year-old is benefitting from Huddersfield's top-flight standard coaching, nutrition and physical performance facilities, while being watched over by the club's loans manager, David Fox. ""You forget he is so young,"" Fox, who had a 15-year professional career after coming through Manchester United's academy, tells GOAL. ""He has literally just turned 19 and played the whole season at 18. His performances, character and mannerisms are not that of a typical 18-year-old. ""He is unbelievably hard-working and humble. He comes from a good upbringing both at home and at Chelsea. ""We wanted him in for pre-season, which gave him time to settle and adjust. He was able to come in, do pre-season, play the pre-season games and bed in with the lads. That was a real positive to get his feet in the door before the season started. ""Chelsea want him in their first team some day, and if we can get him to help him while making him better along the way, then that's what it is about."" It is now a case of which team Colwill will play Premier League football for next season, rather than whether he will play it. Chelsea and Thomas Tuchel will integrate him into the first-team squad in west London during pre-season, meaning a decision on his future is likely to be delayed compared to last summer. Reece James has shown that the step up from the Championship to the Chelsea senior side can be made after he went from a loan spell at Wigan Athletic straight into Frank Lampard's plans in 2019. If there is no space for him next season, though, then he is sure to have options, with Huddersfield hoping they can get themselves to the front of the queue by securing promotion in the coming weeks. But if Colwill does not return to the Terriers following the end of the current campaign, the club can be proud of how it has helped develop another prospective England international. ""We made him better, he made us better and it will help Chelsea in the long run,"" says Bromby. 'The new John Terry' is just getting started. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The statue of Stokoe sits outside the Stadium of Light in memory of Sunderland's former manager, recreating the pose he struck while dancing across the turf following the club's FA Cup final win over Leeds in 1973. A man was seen desecrating the memorial while wearing a Newcastle shirt in footage that has been circulating on social media, and a full investigation is now underway. A spokesman for Sunderland said in a statement on Monday: ""This matter has been referred to the police and we will not be making any further comment at this moment in time."" Meanwhile, Northumbria Police has confirmed that a man is now in custody in relation to the incident. ‚ÄúWe are aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show a man urinating on a memorial outside the Stadium of Light in Sunderland,"" a spokesman for Northumbria Police said. ‚ÄúThis type of behaviour is totally unacceptable and a full investigation has been launched into the incident. ‚ÄúA 21-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and remains in police custody at this time. ‚ÄúWe recognise that incidents of this nature can cause anger and frustration within our communities. ""We would ask everyone to please respect the ongoing investigation and refrain from anything that could jeopardise these live enquiries.‚Äù Stokoe began his career at Newcastle in 1950 and spent 10 years with the club, making 261 appearances in total as a defender while also picking up an FA Cup winners' medal. He saw out the remaining years of his playing days at Bury between 1960 and 1964 before moving into management, eventually taking over at Sunderland in the Second Division in 1972. Stokoe delivered the club's first FA Cup since 1937 the following year and guided them to promotion to the First Division as second-tier champions in 1975-76, while he also returned for a brief spell as caretaker boss in 1986-87.

46,https://www.goal.com/en/news/englands-no1-who-are-the-favourites-to-be-goalkeeper-for/nib2z3et77tl1lyqpqczvfac1,England's No.1: Who are the favourites to be goalkeeper for Euro 2021?,"Now that Euro 2020 has been pushed back to Euro 2021, England's dilemma over their goalkeeping situationhas been pushed firmly into the back seat. Gareth Southgate had been facing a difficult call over who would start between the posts for the Three Lions'opening group gameagainst Croatia on June 14. Now, those vying for the position will have some extra time to find their form and stake a claim to be England's No.1. For England‚Äôs disastrous campaign at Euro 2016,it was Joe Hart, Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster who made the cut -but none of the three were in the squad for the World Cup two years later. The gloves are there to be won ‚Äì but who are the contenders to wear them? Everton goalkeeper Pickford is the favourite to start the first game, by virtue of being England‚Äôs current No.1. The 26-year-old now has well over 100 Premier League appearances under his belt, as well as 24 full international caps. Pickford won plaudits for his displays at the 2018 World Cup, and  was instrumental in the penalty shoot-out win over Colombia. However, his club form has been erratic in recent seasons. Southgate has faced calls to drop himafter a number of high-profile mistakes, and he is far from guaranteed the starting spot he might have expected to have at this point of his career. With 29 games played, Pickford has kept just six clean sheets in the Premier League this season. He recently hit back at criticism from pundits including Gary Neville, saying ""everyone hates you"" as an England player. Currently leading the Premier League clean sheets chart is Burnley‚Äôs Pope, and the 27-year-old may feelthe Euros are his opportunityto shine. The shot-stopper currently has just two senior international caps to his name, having found himself behind Pickford and Hart in the past. That relative inexperience may have hurt his chances, with Southgate perhaps unwilling to make such a big call on the cusp of an international tournament. Now, he has more time on his side. Regardless, he has inarguably been one of the stand-out performers in his position in the Premier League this season. Pope has also kept clean sheets on both of his England appearances to date ‚Äì a 2-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in 2018, and a 4-0 thrashing of Kosovo in Europeanqualifying in November 2019. Henderson has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with Sheffield United this season, his first in the Premier League. On loan from Manchester United, Henderson has registered 10 clean sheets from 27 league games, and is many fans‚Äô favourite to start at the Euros. There are currently questions around his club future, with  calls for him to replace the declining David de Gea at Old Traffordnext season. Such a move would help his chances, providing he continues to start regularly. Like Pope, his lack of caps mean it would be a surprise to see Southgate pick him to start over the more experienced Pickford. Henderson is yet to make his senior international debut, but should be expected to make the final squad to gain experience of an international tournament. A number of other goalkeepers have made a claim this season and could make the squad, though it would be a shock to see any of them play. Aaron Ramsdale  has broken into Bournemouth‚Äôs first team at the age of 21 and could be sent to gain experience, though the Cherries‚Äô struggles are evidenced by his meagre tally of four clean sheets. Fraser Forster, who once looked like taking the No.1 shirt during his time at Southampton, is first-choice once again at Celtic and may be keen to add to his six caps to date. More experienced is the 36-year-old  Ben Foster, though he has a similar number of senior international appearances with eight. And despite Watford fighting relegation, he has more clean sheets to his name than De Gea, Ederson, Bernd Leno, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Rui Patricio ‚Äì and Pickford. Alex McCarthy  of Southampton turned 30 at the end of last year and has been called up to the England squad on a number of occasions, though he only has one appearance to show for it. He played in a 3-0 win over the United States in November 2018, but is slipping off the radar as he battles with 24-year-old  Angus Gunn  for the goalkeeping position at Southampton.

47,https://www.goal.com/en/news/worlds-best-right-back-james-chelsea-champions-league/bltf2a1978fbe296900,The world's best right-back? James confirming his status as a Chelsea - and Champions League - superstar,"Reece James and the Champions League are striking up a special relationship, even if there have been some bumps along the way. He enjoyed one of his early breakout moments in the Chelsea team when he netted the equaliser for the Blues in their memorable 4-4 draw with Ajax in 2019, though what followed in Europe that season he would sooner forget. A 7-1 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich was humbling for James, who was run ragged by an emerging Alphonso Davies, highlighting the size of the step up he was needing to take having spent the previous season on loan in the Championship at Wigan Athletic. Fast-forward 12 months, and having been guided by Thomas Tuchel, James was lifting the European Cup in Porto having been one of the outstanding performers in Chelsea's win over Manchester City. Targeted by Pep Guardiola, James put in a supreme defensive display, highlighting the fact that he is more than just an attacking full-back who struggles when closer to his own goal. That is not to say that his attacking output has diminished, and on Tuesday he again showed himself to be a constant threat in the final third as he helped put Juventus to the sword at Stamford Bridge. The Champions League is the stage for the world's best players, and right now it is difficult to find anyone in better form or who is more well-rounded than James as a right-back. Reece James is an absolute joke! ü§≠Another outstanding finish from the Chelsea star! üî• pic.twitter.com/iUdgv2XI8A REECE JAMES. üí•CHELSEA'S DEFENDERS HAVE NOW SCORED 16 GOALS THIS SEASON. UNREAL. üò≥ pic.twitter.com/bKVZorYYES His arrowed strike across Wojciech Szczesny for Chelsea's second in their 4-0 win over the Bianconeri means he is now the Blues' outright top scorer this season with five goals, moving him ahead of ¬£97.5 million ($136m) summer signing Romelu Lukaku, who has four. James also has five assists to his name, with there only one other Premier League player with at least five goals and five assists in all competitions so far in 2021-22: Mohamed Salah. The England international also played his part in the third goal of the night, showing deft control in box in the build-up to Callum Hudson-Odoi firing home, as well as the fourth, as his sensational cross-field ball helped create Timo Werner's stoppage-time strike. There will be staunch opposition to the take that James is the best right-back in the world on current form from Liverpool supporters who back Trent Alexander-Arnold, and there are certainly arguments that can be made for both players. But James' superior defensive abilities, as well his new-found eye for goal just gives him the edge, and that is an opinion that Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate seems to share if his selections over the past 12 months are been anything to go by. Despite all that, Tuchel was cautious to name James as the best in the world in his position when asked by GOAL during Monday's press conference, perhaps in a bid to keep the 21-year-old focused on getting even better. ""Right now he plays as a wing-back, and he does this at a very high level,"" the German coach said. ""I see no reason why we should get carried away by things like if he is the best in the world or the best in England or the best in Europe. ""If he plays, he needs to be the best version of himself. He is improving, he takes responsibility and it is needed. ""He is far from finished in his development. He is super young. He has all the potential to be a big and important player for Chelsea and he is on his way. ""I feel he is dedicated and hungry for more, and that is what we want."" James himself is a man of few words, but when asked by GOAL about his current form during the recent international break, he said: ""I would say this is the best that I have ever performed. Recent results and performances have shown that as well."" Before he met Tuchel, James was already an exceptional talent. He was the captain of Jody Morris' FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2018, and won the club's Academy Player of the Year award in the process. He followed that up by being nominated for EFL Team of the Season in his first year as a professional at Wigan, but he remained a rough diamond. Tuchel has polished that diamond, accentuating his physical and ball-striking gifts by simplifying James' game with clear instructions about what he can and cannot do in his system. It led to a baptism of fire for James last season, where he was in and out of the team, facing the brunt of Tuchel's tirades from the touchline. But along with his tactical improvements, he has added more mobility to his game, allowing him to be in positions to score more often, and turning him the complete wing-back. The world's best? Right now, it is difficult to argue against it. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Manchester United forward has represented his country on 46 occasions, scoring 12 goals, but will not be adding to his collection of Three Lions caps any time soon after being overlooked in the latest selection made by Gareth Southgate. Why has the Red Devils star been overlooked and could his place in plans being drawn up for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year be under threat? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The 24-year-old has been a regular for England since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2016, with appearances made at two European Championships ‚Äì including a Euro 2020 final against Italy ‚Äì the 2018 World Cup and UEFA Nations League finals.

He knows he is in a situation where he has not been getting in the United team consistently and he will be searching as much as anybody to get that form back. ‚ÄúWe all believe he can be an asset for his club and for his country. ‚ÄúWith one or two of our players in the past, who have had dips and come through them, you can say, 'look, they came through that, they responded well and became more strong and they showed the character needed'. ‚ÄúThat is what he is going to have to prove now in the coming weeks and months.

Only five goals, the most recent of which came on January 22 against West Ham, and two assists have been recorded across 26 appearances in all competitions and he has not turned out in the colours of his country since being introduced as an extra-time substitute late on in the Euro 2020 final ‚Äì an outing in which he missed his penalty in a shootout defeat.

Hudson-Odoi represented England at every youth level from U16 to U21 before making his first senior international appearance in 2019. However, the 21-year-old has only been able to take his tally of caps to three since then and he was left out of Gareth Southgate's last Three Lions squad in November, leading to question marks over his future. Hudson-Odoi is also eligible to play for Ghana due to his heritage and, under current FIFA rules, any players that have played three or fewer international games before the age of 21 are allowed to switch allegiances if they choose to. The Chelsea winger has not featured for England in two-and-a-half years, but has now given the clearest indication yet that he remains determined to break into Southgate's squad. Speaking after the Blues' 2-1 win against Palmeiras in Abu Dhabi, Hudson-Odioi replied when asked whether he would commit his international future to the Three Lions and reject Ghana: ‚ÄúHopefully. I don‚Äôt know. ""At the end of the day, we will wait until that time comes.‚Äù Hudson-Odoi also explained why he decided to snub a loan move away from Chelsea last summer amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund. The Blues' academy graduate, who recorded an assist for Lukaku's opener against Palmeiras, says he is relieved to have had the chance to revel in more success under Thomas Tuchel. ‚ÄúYou want to win as much as possible with a club like this,‚Äù said Hudson-Odoi. ‚ÄúOur aim is always to win games and win as many as possible. ""If I went out in the summer I wouldn‚Äôt get opportunities to play like this and win trophies. I‚Äôm really delighted that I stayed and obviously I got the opportunity to play. ""For me I‚Äôve just got to give it 120 per cent from minute one every single game.‚Äù Pressed on whether he can already be considered a Chelsea legend with Club World Cup and Champions League winners' medals now on his record, he added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like a legend at all.

Al Rihla translates to 'the journey' in Arabic, with the ball design drawing inspiration from Qatar's unique architecture, ""iconic"" boats and national flag. The Al Rihla is said to move quicker in the air than any of the previous World Cup balls and reportedly provides ""the highest level of accuracy and reliability on the field of play"". The 20 panels of the ball are included to help enhance aerodynamics, helping players improve the accuracy and swerve of their shots, while the product is made entirely from water-based inks and glues ‚Äì a first for a World Cup model. Franziska Loeffelmann, design director in the football graphics and hardwear department at Adidas, has offered a summary of the key features. She said: ‚ÄúThe game is getting faster, and as it speeds up, accuracy and flight stability becomes critically important. The new design allows the ball to maintain its speed significantly higher as it journeys through the air.‚Äù Tickets for World Cup 2022 first went on sale at fifa.com/tickets on January 22. The first phase of sales ran until March 29 and consisted of random sales selection draw and first come, first served periods. A second phase was opened after the finals draw on April 1 and operates in a similar fashion to the initial process. The third and final phase of tickets sales is the 'last-minute' one, which is purely run on a first come, first served basis and will extend through to the end of the tournament. All supporters planning on attending games at the World Cup finals are reminded by FIFA that ‚Äúat the request of the Qatari authorities, all local and international fans must apply for a Hayya Card. Hayya Card is your entry permit to the State of Qatar and your stadium access (along with the match ticket). International fans will also need to confirm their accommodation plans.‚Äù Individual tickets are split up into four categories and the prices for each category - converted to British pounds from U.S. dollars - are shown below. Tickets from category four are only available to residents of Qatar.

They struck another two-tournament deal with FIFA ahead of the 2018 event that covers television, radio and online coverage. Agreements put in place across the globe are reported to have netted world football‚Äôs governing body around $1.85bn ($1.41bn). In the United States, World Cup 2022 will be broadcast by Fox in English and Telemundo in Spanish. They wrestled rights away from ESPN and Univision ahead of the 2018 tournament and have a deal in place through to the end of the 2026 finals ‚Äì which will be staged across America, Canada and Mexico. Who is going to win the World Cup? üèÜ pic.twitter.com/FgZdaz7YpG Brazil, who have reclaimed the number one spot on FIFA‚Äôs ranking chart, are the favourites at bet365 to savour World Cup glory in Qatar. The Selecao are five-time winners of the competition, but their last success came 20 years ago in Japan and South Korea. Defending champions France, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba at their disposal, are also highly fancied and push Brazil close at the top of a congested betting market. England, who reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and final of Euro 2020, have pieced together an exciting young squad that will believe they can bring 56 years of hurt to a close in 2022. Spain and Germany complete the top five of leading contenders for global glory, with Argentina ‚Äì who are looking to land Lionel Messi his first crown ‚Äì sitting just outside of that pack. Belgium‚Äôs so-called golden generation have failed to deliver tangible success when at the peak of their powers, and have work to do in order to earn favour with punters, while Portugal will feel that anything is possible with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks. The Netherlands are another dark horse that could go well if early momentum is established, but little is expected from the USMNT and Mexico as they are given triple-figure prices before a ball is kicked in anger. Unsurprisingly, seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Messi is a market leader when it comes to top scorer honours at World Cup 2022. The mercurial Argentine has endured a testing 2021-22 campaign after leaving Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, but remains a talisman for his country and still has plenty of magic left up his sleeve. Neymar and Antoine Griezmann, of Brazil and France respectively, are also being tipped to fill their boots when leading the line for two nations taking aim at the ultimate prize. England captain Harry Kane is looking to land back-to-back Golden Boots and tends to save his best for the big occasion, while Ronaldo can never be ruled out of any competition relating to acts of goal-scoring brilliance. In the Golden Ball stakes, 2014 winner Messi figures prominently once again. Neymar is also in that mix, as the man expected to lead Brazil‚Äôs charge, while Mbappe has been showing at PSG that he could be the next superstar to set world football alight. A number of singles will be released from the official FIFA World Cup 2022 Soundtrack. The first of those was revealed on April 1, with Hayya Hayya (Better Together) made available across multiple platforms. FIFA has said ‚Äúthe uplifting track, featuring Trinidad Cardona, Davido and Aisha, draws on R&B and reggae influences‚Äù as the organisation seeks to ‚Äúconnect with audiences worldwide through the shared passions of football and music‚Äù.

54,https://www.goal.com/en/news/rudiger-real-madrid-exit-tuchel-hold-off-chelsea-ownership/blt347e82b23f5797bb,Rudiger's Real Madrid exit shows Tuchel can't stem Chelsea's ownership crisis any longer,"Thomas Tuchel did wonderfully well to initially block out the impact of the sanctions placed upon Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but now it feels like the ownership chaos is finally catching up with the club. The uncertainty which has surrounded Stamford Bridge since the United Kingdom government decided to punish Roman Abramovich for his ties to the Kremlin is now evident on the pitch. A once solid side is now leaking goals, as underlined by the dreadful defensive displays in the recent home defeats by Brentford, Real Madrid and Arsenal. Tuchel is now longer sure whom he can count on. After last week's dire 4-2 defeat to Arsenal, the Blues boss said that he had got his starting line-up all wrong, which is believed to have been an admission that the players he picked simply weren't as motivated as Mikel Arteta's men, who are fighting hard to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. ""You need to have the tactics right, and it is doubtful I had this right,"" Tuchel told reporters, ""and you need the team selection right, and again, it's doubtful I had this right."" The mood at Chelsea hasn't quite plummeted as low as at Manchester United, whom Chelsea play on Thursday evening. However, the ongoing search for a new owner is clearly taking its toll, with real-world effects reminding the players of the club's perilous position on a regular basis. Indeed, there are numerous empty seats at every home game now because of Chelsea's inability to sell tickets under the terms of their sanction-hit operating licence, with only existing season-ticket holders allowed to attend. The effect on the atmosphere has been obvious and the loss of vocal support, coupled with the mounting air of anxiety, has arguably played a role in the team's horrible run of form at Stamford Bridge. Then, of course, there's the even more significant effect that Chelsea's inability to make moves in the transfer market is having on the squad. Last week, amid emotional scenes at Cobham, Antonio Rudiger informed the squad that he would be joining Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer. The 29-year-old promised both his manager and his team-mates that he will remain focused during the final weeks of the season but, given the circumstances, that might be impossible, even for the man that Tuchel describes as Chelsea's ""aggressive leader"" behind the scenes. Rudiger has been a mentor for both Trevoh Chalobah and Malang Sarr this season, while his outgoing personality and language skills have long allowed him to cross dressing room divides and unite the squad. Tuchel appreciated that he was among the first Rudiger spoke to after finalising his move to Madrid. ""That shows me we have a relationship where we handle things directly and honestly and are not afraid to tell each other what we think,"" the German told reporters ahead of the United game. But there is no disguising the significance of the centre-half's imminent exit, particularly as it could be an ominous sign of further unrest to follow. ""At the moment, it is not possible [to replace him] because of the sanctions,"" Tuchel lamented. ""And even when the sanctions are in the past, it will still be incredibly difficult to do so."" Antonio Rudiger will leave Chelsea at the end of the season, with Real Madrid leading the race to sign him ‚úçÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/OHZyzE90Y4 Chelsea are going to have enough problems at the back as it is, with Andreas Christensen having agreed to join Barcelona when his contract expires this summer. The Dane requested that his move be kept private but it has been an open secret in the football word for some time now. Chelsea have already instructed Blackpool loanee Dujon Sterling to return for pre-season but the sad fact of the matter is that Tuchel wants to sign two new defenders this summer and presently isn't in a position to be able to make any concrete plans. The sanctions forbid new signings and it could be a month before the takeover goes through, meaning Chelsea will be playing catch-up when it comes to challenging their rivals for transfer targets this summer, with Manchester United already looking at ways of strengthening their squad ahead of Erik ten Hag's arrival from Ajax. ‚ÄúOf course, we would have some targets [by now] and we would have for sure contacted some players and found out about their situations,‚Äù Tuchel explained. ‚ÄúBut our hands are tied now. We can still have the talks inside the building but we cannot act."" Chelsea are doing what they can, though, drawing up wishlists based on the assumption the new owners will be keen to spend similar sums to recent windows. The Blues will focus on signing a centre-back, with Sevilla's Jules Kounde, Paris Saint-Germain's Presnel Kimpembe and Atletico Madrid's Jose Gimenez among their targets. There's also interest in signing a central midfielder, with West Ham's Declan Rice and Aurelien Tchouameni both under consideration. Bringing in a new forward has also not been ruled out, but it depends on offloading at least one of their frustrated forwards. Romelu Lukaku has become hugely unpopular with the club's fans, with his form having nosedived following his now infamous interview withSky Sport Italia, and the new owners will have to decide whether to write off tens of millions of pounds on the club-record signing. AC Milan could offer Romelu Lukaku a Chelsea exit, depending on the outcome of their current takeover üëÄ‚úçÔ∏è @NizaarKinsella A decision will also have to be made on Timo Werner, who, before his run of good form, had sounded out a move to Borussia Dortmund. Sales cannot be seriously discussed, though, until the ownership situation is resolved. Nor can Chelsea look to tie down Jorginho, N'Golo Kante and Marcos Alonso, all of whom will enter the final year of their respective contracts come the summer. The sanctions, which have resulted in players putting their own hands in their pockets to resolve minor operational issues around Cobham, remain a major problem for Chelsea, leaving them at a major disadvantage in their long-term bid to compete with Manchester City and Liverpool at the pinnacle of European football on an annual basis. For now, though, Tuchel and his coaching staff are merely trying to focus minds on the upcoming FA Cup final against Liverpool. The former PSG boss has also tried to dismiss the speculation surrounding his future by insisting that he has no intention of quitting the club. ‚ÄúIt is maybe for me very important to give this message: I‚Äôm committed, I‚Äôm looking forward to [the challenge] and I‚Äôm passionate about it,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAnd as soon as we can act, we will try to turn things around and maybe turn a disadvantage into an advantage. I don‚Äôt have the solution right now but we will try to stay positive about it.‚Äù However, the feeling is if the crisis gets much worse, he could leave Chelsea. That is the grim reality of a mess all of the club's own making. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

55,https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics. Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps. A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10. Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea. ‚ÄúSanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea‚Äôs many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (¬£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom‚Äôs brand 3, and its $72m (¬£55m) kit deal with Nike,‚Äù says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company. ‚ÄúWhile Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association. ‚ÄúChelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships. ‚ÄúNike‚Äôs deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club‚Äôs sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (¬£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.‚Äù Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just ¬£20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth ¬£9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at ¬£3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club. It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration. In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin‚Äôs vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today‚Äôs sanctions are the latest step in the UK‚Äôs unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

56,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-sold-summer-chelsea-nightmare-no-sign-ending/bltc6088ba258162b62,No way back: Lukaku must be sold this summer as Chelsea nightmare shows no sign of ending,"In the moments after Thomas Tuchel had made his final substitutions of the afternoon at Goodison Park, the broadcasters picked out Romelu Lukaku sitting on the Chelsea bench. Motionless and expressionless, the Belgium international could only watch on, knowing he would not be involved against his former club, Everton. Though Chelsea found themselves 1-0 down against the relegation-threatened Toffees after Richarlison had opened the scoring early in the second half, Tuchel decided against calling upon his ¬£100 million ($136m) club-record signing in his pursuit of an equaliser. Instead he threw on Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech, the wide forwards joining fellow substitute Mateo Kovacic on the pitch after the midfielder replaced Jorginho at half time. Neither Pulisic or Ziyech could muster much in their 30 minutes on the pitch, however, as Chelsea slipped to a third defeat in their last six Premier League matches. pic.twitter.com/A7qdaI0OBU ""We had to take Jorgi off and I only had three changes,"" was Tuchel's short explanation of leaving Lukaku in reserve when speaking to reporters post-match, though such an excuse would hardly have been believable at the start of season. After triumphantly leading Inter to the Scudetto in 2021, the reigning Serie A Player of the Year was expected to be a difference-maker for a Chelsea side when they faced deep, low blocks, as they did on Sunday. Instead, he is nothing more than a bit-part player at Stamford Bridge. Of Lukaku's last nine appearances, only one has come from the start, while he is yet to score a league goal in 2022. The last time he completed 90 minutes came all the way back in February, in the infamous game against Crystal Palace that saw him break the record for the fewest touches recorded by an outfield player in a Premier League game (seven) since Opta records began. Kai Havertz replaced him in the line up following that game at Selhurst Park, and scored eight in 12 games to justify his selection, but the Germany international has gone off the boil of late, failing to score in his last six. He was clearly rattled against Everton by Yerry Mina's attempts to wind him up, and throwing on the more experienced and physically imposing Lukaku might have been the way for Tuchel to go. But instead he kept his tracksuit on, the ¬£325,000 wage he earned over the past seven days done so solely in training sessions. That is not a sustainable place for Chelsea to be in, particularly given their ownership situation, and their relationship with Lukaku is one they need to get out of sooner rather than later. A parting of ways this summer would be the best for all parties, too, with GOAL having learned that the player is unhappy with his lack of game time under Tuchel and is exploring other options. A return to Inter has been touted in many quarters as his preferred option in Serie A. Lukaku's preference, however, would be to remain at Chelsea and make his second spell at the club more successful than his first, but he ultimately wants the support from the coaching staff to allow him to flourish. That seems unlikely to be forthcoming while Tuchel remains in charge, though, with the German coach unwilling to adapt his style of football to incorporate Lukaku. Selling Lukaku so soon after he returned to the club would be a bitter pill for Chelsea to swallow, and they would only receive a fraction of what they paid for the 28-year-old if they were to sell this summer. But with the situation unlikely to change in Chelsea's final five games of the season, the time has come for a difficult decision to be made. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Net worth, Chelsea bid & which sports teams he owns","Several candidates emerged as potential new owners at Chelsea once Roman Abramovich announced that he would be selling the club, but Todd Boehly appears set to inherit the reins at Stamford Bridge as a consortium he heads up become the preferred bidders at Stamford Bridge. A new era for the Blues is being ushered in, with a Russian billionaire that has been at the helm since 2003 preparing to walk away after seeing his assets frozen by the UK government. Change has not been quick to implement in west London, with a protracted takeover saga seeing a number of interested parties enter the fray, but Boehly has emerged as a leading contender to take ownership of the Premier League heavyweights ‚Äì which begs the question: Who is he? GOAL takes a look... Boehly is an American businessman, philanthropist and investor who went to school in Bethesda, Maryland before moving to England to study at the London School of Economics. From there he spent time working at Citibank and CS First in Boston before moving on to Guggenheim Partners in 2001. He launched that firm‚Äôs credit investing business and would go on to become president of the company. In 2013 he fronted a deal between Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers to create SportsNet LA ‚Äì a network that broadcasts all things related to the baseball franchise. Two years later, in 2015, Boehly pooled some of the assets he collected at Guggenheim ‚Äì including The Hollywood Reporters, Dick Clark Productions and Security Benefit ‚Äì to found Eldridge Industries, a holding company that owns stakes in roughly 80 finance, media, sports, real estate and technology businesses. A Todd Boehly-led consortium is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government üîµ pic.twitter.com/js0XF0qWhJ The 46-year-old is, according to Forbes, worth around ¬£3.6 billion ($4.5bn). He previously made a play for Chelsea back in 2019, with an offer in the region of ¬£2.2bn ($2.8bn) being knocked back. Boehly is the co-owner of seven-time MLB World Series winners the Los Angeles Dodgers ‚Äì who last captured the grandest prize in baseball back in 2020. He also owns stakes in 17-time NBA champions the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Sparks women‚Äôs basketball team. His latest bid for power at Stamford Bridge has seen Boehly team up with fellow Dodgers co-owner Mark Walters, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital ‚Äì with that consortium boasting some serious spending power between them.

Blues supporters will be eager to see a long-running saga, which has presented plenty of challenges on and off the field, brought to a close as soon as possible, while they will also be pleased to hear that a potential new owner has ambitious plans for his various sporting ventures. Boehly said while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in LA: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing like sports to excite passion. And if you have passion, then you have people who care about things. ‚ÄúAnd if you have people who care about things, you have great opportunity.

We still have the most affordable tickets in the league basically, for a stadium that‚Äôs full regularly. ‚ÄúIn some sports like the NFL, they share all the media money. In baseball, you‚Äôre really a derivative of your local market. ‚ÄúThe Premier League‚Äôs similar. If you look at the way it works, to be one of the big brands, you have a structural advantage.

Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs side have occupied a Champions League qualification spot for long periods of the 2021-22 campaign, with the west London outfit proving to be the best of the rest behind title-chasing Liverpool and Manchester City. They have however taken only one win from their last four games ‚Äì with their latest game delivering a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Everton ‚Äì and are now just three points clear of Arsenal and five ahead of Tottenham with four fixtures left. The Blues‚Äô fate remains in their own hands, but mistakes have crept into their game with club captain Cesar Azpilicueta paying the price against Everton for dwelling on the ball too long as he presented Richarlison with the opportunity to grab the match winner. Loftus-Cheek told Chelsea‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all very disappointed. Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it‚Äôd be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. ‚ÄúThey came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven‚Äôt kept clean sheets from individual errors.

If you don‚Äôt have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. ‚ÄúThis is not Chelsea standard at all.

59,https://www.goal.com/en/news/unbelievable-priceless-cavani-more-to-man-utd-than-goals/1i16nqxusty7l1ogbjpr4yhdfu,'He's been unbelievable' - Priceless Cavani brings more to Man Utd than goals,"For all the talk of summer transfer budgets and the constraints imposed after another season impacted by Covid-19, there are some things money cannotbuy. The experience that Edinson Cavani has brought to Manchester United‚Äôs forward line is priceless, with  his decision to stay with the club for another season  one that has saved United millions this summer. Speak to anyone at the club and they could talk about Cavani'simpressive goalscoring record, including 10 goal involvements in his last seven games, but the first thing that gets mentioned is how he is teaching those around him. ‚ÄúIn the last month or so he‚Äôs been unbelievable,‚Äù  Luke Shaw told  Sky Sports  after United‚Äôs 3-1 Premier League win away to Aston Villa.  ‚ÄúNot just the goals but the experience he brings to the team and the younger players. ""He pushes them a lot and hopefully he can keep doing that towards the end of the season.‚Äù United‚Äôs first-half performance at Villa Park left them screaming out for the Uruguay international. They were again lacking that focal point up top; somethingwhich has been true in many of the games when Cavani has notfeatured. Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood were switching between the central striker position, but too often they drifted out to the wings or dropped too deep. They are both top level forwards but neither, at this moment in time, have honed their craft as real No.9s. At the other end of the spectrum is Cavani.  His finishing is as clinical as you could imagine for a 34-year-old who has played at the highestlevel for 17 years, but it is his movement which is on another plane. His goal off the bench on Sundaywas a perfect example, as he darted between Matty Cash and Ezri Konsa to get on the end of a very good cross from Rashford. It was an elite finish, but his vision and movementreally took the breath away. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the centre forward you want in the box. His movement is incredible and it‚Äôs something everyone can learn from,‚Äù manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said in the past. Greenwood does not have much to learn when it comes to finishing.  That might be a big statementto make on behalf ofsomeone who is just 19, but his goal on Sunday further added to that argument. He threw Tyrone Mings off with ease after a jinking turn, before finishing at the near post. It was his 16th Premier League goal andmakes him the highest goalscoring teenager in the club‚Äôs history. Although his finishing is not under any question, both he and Rashford can learn from what Cavani does in the box.   It is what the former Paris Saint-Germain stardoes off the ball which really adds to United‚Äôs attacking play. He knows precisely how to time his runs, how to play on the shoulder of the defender and drop his marker and how to drag the opposition across the box to give his team-mates more space. Add to that,his vision is second to none. They are all attributes that he has learned over nearly two decades of playing top-level football. So while big-money figures are thrown about for the likes of Erling Haaland and Harry Kane -both of which would be a great fit in United‚Äôs system -Cavani has a level of experience that neither of them could bring. Whilethere is genuine belief that Greenwood has a long career ahead as a No.9, he needsto learn from Cavani while he can. ""He‚Äôs learning on the job which is not easy. It‚Äôs difficult and he‚Äôs had to bear a lot of responsibility and he‚Äôs popped up with so many important goals for us,"" Solskjaer said. ""The kid just turns the game around in one split second and the goal against Villa was excellent, so I‚Äôm delighted that he‚Äôs got back to his goalscoring best and he‚Äôs learning more and more all the other bits as well."" Youcan see why Solskjaer has done everything he can to persuade him to stay, despite his apparent wish to return to South America. Cavani's goal involvements are vital, but his influence on thetraining ground is just as important. He is the master teaching the apprentices, and another year of that is priceless for Solskjaer‚Äôs long-term plan. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

60,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-cavani-rashford-man-utd-strikeforce-gone-missing/bltf00c3048d4e5cef2,"Ronaldo, Cavani and Rashford - Man Utd's strikers have gone missing in more ways than one","When the team news dropped at the Etihad on Sunday, there was only one question from the Manchester United fans; where is Cristiano Ronaldo? Not only was the Portugal international not in the starting XI for the Premier League derby day mauling by Man City but he wasn‚Äôt even in the country. Manager Ralf Rangnick admitted that he did not know the 37-year-old had left the UK on his private jet ahead of the game but refused to criticise the forward for his decision with the German manager saying he had ‚Äòno issue‚Äô with his actions. It is not the first time Ronaldo has jetted off when not needed. Club sources said in January that players were free to do what they wished in their down time and on both occasions when the Portugal captain has taken a quick break in his home country he has returned to training as expected. Rangnick‚Äôs explanation - that Ronaldo was carrying an injury - appeared to be refuted by the player‚Äôs sister on social media as she suggested he was in fact just dropped. The decision to play with a false 9 meant Ronaldo would be only be used as a substitute and by the end of Friday‚Äôs training session he had reported to the club doctor with an injury. Whatever Ronaldo does, there will always be a circus around his actions and decisions. He returned to a fanfare but the last few months have been a disappointment and the derby snub was just another example. His goals have dried up, with just one league goal this year, and he cuts a frustrated figure on the pitch; throwing his arms in the air, kicking goal posts and remonstrating to referees. When he agreed to return in August it was not with the idea of fighting for fourth spot. He hoped he would be coming back to win trophies. It is therefore hardly surprising that he has yet to make a decision on his long-term future at Old Trafford. It is understood if United fail to get that coveted Champions League spot then he would look to leave; even at 37, the Europa League is beneath him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a strange situation that he finds himself in back at Manchester United,‚Äù former United striker Teddy Sheringham told GOAL. ‚ÄúIt must be very, very different from when Sir Alex was there and running everything ‚Äì everything was a tight ship all sailing together. It seems like there are lots of fragments at Manchester United all going their own ways and there is no leadership anywhere. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ideal for Ronaldo to come back into that. I would think that if it carries on like this until the end of the season and he has a chance to go somewhere else, I think that could probably happen.‚Äù One of the issues for both Rangnick and Ronaldo is that at the beginning of the season this was not what the club had planned. Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Edinson Cavani and Ronaldo meant Rangnick had plenty of options up front. But various circumstances meant United started the derby without a centre-forward in the starting XI or on the bench. Ronaldo‚Äôs absence will always be noted no matter what the reason but Rangnick would not have had to rely on him so heavily had Cavani been fit. The Uruguayan decides when he is fit enough to play and the derby was the 17th Premier League game he has missed this season. Rangnick said in his Friday afternoon press conference that Cavani should be available for the Saturday evening visit of Tottenham Hotspur. But, with another training session to complete before that, anything is possible. Then there is the current issue with Rashford which also complicates Rangnick‚Äôs strikeforce plans. The England international has been struggling for form and is low on confidence which has affected his displays. The interim manager is impressed with Rashford in training but wants to him replicate that form on the pitch, something he has not been capable of in recent weeks. United have 10 games to salvage a fourth-place finish and if they‚Äôre going to manage it they not only need a helping hand from their rivals but a revival from a strikeforce whose main stars have gone missing... in more ways than one.

Various landing spots for a 34-year-old frontman have been mooted, with leading sides in Spain and Italy said to be keen on adding a proven performer to their respective ranks. Cavani has, however, shown across 18 months at Old Trafford that he can be a useful asset for the Red Devils ‚Äì with 19 goals recorded through 49 appearances ‚Äì and Rangnick is reluctant to part with a player of such pedigree before he hits free agency in the summer. United‚Äôs German tactician has said of his immediate plans for Cavani: ‚ÄúWe have had quite a few conversations over the last couple of weeks, probably the player with whom I have spoken the most. ‚ÄúI told him from the very first day he is a highly important player, he is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal. And as I said, his professionalism and his work ethic is just amazing. ‚ÄúI told him that I desperately want him to stay and stay until the end of the season, and he knows that. He knows how highly I rate him and how highly I respect him.‚Äù Anthony Martial is pushing for a winter move away from Manchester, with Rangnick confirming that the France international forward has expressed a desire to move on after finding regular game time hard to come by. Donny van de Beek is another that has been struggling for minutes, but the Netherlands international midfielder has been assured by his current coach that there is a role for him in a star-studded squad. Rangnick said of a playmaker that is still searching for a spark in English football and the words of advice he would offer to a talented 24-year-old: ‚ÄúJust work hard. So far, as I have got to know him, he has got a top mentality. ‚ÄúHe works hard in every training session. He is a team player through and through. There will be games where he will get his chance to play, I am sure. ‚ÄúI also had a long conversation with him last week about that and again, of course it is difficult for him right now because he also wants to play for the Dutch national team, he wants to qualify for himself and play in the World Cup in Qatar and in order to do that he needs to get game time here. ‚ÄúBut I still believe we should keep him, and he should stay here, definitely until the end of this season and try to get as much game time as he possibly can.‚Äù United‚Äôs first outing of 2022 is set to see them play host to Wolves on Monday.

A product of the Red Devils‚Äô famed academy system will see his contract expire in the summer, meaning that he will move on and sever ties with the club that gave him a big break and paved the way for international recognition with England to be enjoyed. Lingard will be walking away without taking in another appearance on home soil, with Ralf Rangnick opting to leave the 29-year-old midfielder as an unused substitute in a 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford ‚Äì United‚Äôs final outing in front of their own supporters in the 2021-22 campaign. Louie Scott has posted in a passionate message on Instagram: ‚Äú20 years of blood, sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell. No wonder it‚Äôs Conference League next year. ‚ÄúAttacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you‚Äôre ran by people who don‚Äôt even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! ‚ÄúBeen there since nine years of age and didn‚Äôt even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.‚Äù It appeared at one stage as though Lingard would leave Old Trafford before the current campaign got underway, having spent the second half of last season impressing on loan at West Ham. The Hammers were eager to do a permanent deal, while Newcastle expressed interest in January, but the Red Devils refused to sanction a sale and made a bit-part player in their plans see out his contract. He has taken in 22 appearances across all competitions for United this term, but only two of those have been Premier League starts. Alternative options have continued to be favoured despite struggles for consistency leaving the Red Devils without a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League, with Europa League football in 2022-23 the best that they can hope for. Many have questioned why Lingard has been used so sparingly, and why exits were blocked off in the winter transfer window, with club legend Paul Scholes telling talkSPORT: ‚ÄúI think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. ‚ÄúThat clearly hasn‚Äôt happened. He‚Äôs deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He‚Äôs a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance‚Ä¶ I think he‚Äôs unfairly treated.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He has done his best to make that possible in the current campaign, after securing an emotional return to English football, but a 24-goal haul has failed to inspire a top-four finish or deliver major silverware. There have been rumours of a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr mulling over a move elsewhere as the Red Devils struggle to replicate their success of the not too distant past, but Ronaldo has suggested that he is ready to form part of another rebuild under incoming manager Erik ten Hag. An all-time great signed a two-year contract when rejoining United from Juventus in the summer of 2021. He stated at that stage that he may be tempted to stay on beyond 2023, with his latest post on Instagram offering no indication that he is considering an imminent change of scenery. After finding the target from the penalty spot in a 3-0 victory over Brentford, Ronaldo said on social media: ‚ÄúOnce again, great support from the stands. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take this opportunity of our last game of the season at Old Trafford to thank our amazing supporters, who endured a difficult season by our side and never abandoned us. ‚ÄúThanks, guys. Your support means the world to us and our goal is to become better everyday, so that we can achieve what we all want: glory for Man. United!‚Äù United‚Äôs struggles for consistency in the Premier League this season have contributed significantly to the questions being asked of Ronaldo‚Äôs ongoing presence. He has graced a Champions League stage of some description in every single one of his senior campaigns to date, with that run stretching back to his early days at Sporting. As he is now 37 years of age and approaching the end of a remarkable career, Ronaldo would have been eager to remain at the highest level for as long as possible. A top-four finish is realistically now beyond United, as they could suffer their worst ever finish in the Premier League, but continental qualification remains on the agenda. The Red Devils sit sixth in the table at present and appear to be well on course to add Europa League football to their schedule for 2022-23. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

United snapped Ibrahimovic up on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, and he enjoyed a fruitful debut campaign at Old Trafford, scoring 28 goals across 46 appearances. The Swede's impressive form in the final third helped the Red Devils secure a Europa League and League Cup double, and although his second campaign was blighted by injury, he still looks back on his experience in English football fondly. The 40-year-old, who is now taking in a second spell at Milan, believes he also managed to silence a fair few doubters by proving that he could deliver in the Premier League.

Ibrahimovic has played a key role in transforming the Rossoneri back into title contenders, but even if the 2021-22 season ends in Scudetto glory, he is not planning to walk off into the sunset.

A Portuguese superstar at Old Trafford has faced questions of his value to a collective cause in 2021-22, but has still plundered 23 goals to keep an inconsistent outfit in the hunt for European qualification. There have been suggestions that he will walk away from the final year of a lucrative contract once the current campaign comes to a close, but interim boss Rangnick ‚Äì who will be sticking around as a consultant while also taking the reins of the Austria national team ‚Äì is reluctant to be drawn on whether a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner will still be a United player in 2022-23. When that question was put to Rangnick by Sky Sports ahead of a Premier League clash with Brentford, the German tactician said: ‚ÄúThis is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. ‚ÄúHe's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers.

Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that.‚Äù Transfer plans need to be drawn up by United at some stage over the coming weeks, with it important that they do not leave themselves playing catch-up when another window swings open. Investment over recent years has delivered little return, as the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have shown how it should be done, but Rangnick believes the gap to arch-rivals can be closed sooner than many people think. He has said of recruitment by the Red Devils: ‚ÄúIf you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. ‚ÄúThey strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ‚ÄúI wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks.

The 37-year-old has since been the Red Devils' main source of goals, netting 23 across all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign, and Dalot says he is also a great source of inspiration behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Speaking ahead of Man Utd's next Premier League game, against Brentford, the Portuguese defender told Sky Sports of Ronaldo: ""I'm sure I speak not just for me but he's been one of the most positive things about this season - to work with somebody who has his culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality and being close to him now, it's been very helpful for me and my career. ""I don't have any more compliments to give about the way he works, he's a fantastic human being as well. The numbers are there, the stats are there, so we're obviously very happy to have him here."" Dalot added on how the rest of the squad gets on with Ronaldo: ""He's a very friendly person. When he feels he has the trust of other people, he gives 100 per cent of himself to you. ""Everybody gets along with him here, everyone likes to have him around. It's always a big plus to have a player and a person like this in the changing room."" Dalot went on to discuss the appointment of Ten Hag, who will replace Ralf Rangnick in the Old Trafford dugout at the end of his final season with Ajax. The full-back is glad the squad has the clarity of a permanent boss to work with after Rangnick's six-month interim spell in charge, and feels Ten Hag has all the qualities to be successful in Manchester. ""I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he is a great manager - what he's done with Ajax is something outstanding,"" said Dalot. ""He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well. ""In our heads, it's going to be clear who the manager will be next season and that's good because we go for our break in our heads knowing who to expect. ""Then we will have time in pre-season to work together, get our ideas right and start the new season."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

De Bruyne has seen off competition from City team-mates Ruben Dias, Ilkay Gundogan and Phil Foden to retain the prize he won for the first time in 2019-20. Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Tottenham striker Harry Kane also missed out after the latest annual voteamongst the members of the players' trade union, with the Belgian recognised for another stellar campaign which saw him help City win a fifth Premier League title and fourth consecutive Carabao Cup. De Bruyne has now joined United legend Ronaldo and former Arsenal star Henry as the only players to win the PFA accolade two years on the bounce, and expressed his delight. ""The fact the players chose me for this award means that I've done very well,"" said the 29-year-old. ""You want to win all the trophies with the team and this is probably the most important one as an individual trophy in the league. To be voted by your competitors, by players who you compete with every game - to choose you, that says a lot. ""They're the people in my view who know the most about the game. Very honoured and proud to receive this award twice in a row! üèÜ  @PFA   pic.twitter.com/H47FZPOLM3 ""When you have these things you can show your kids and say 'Look! this is what Daddy did when he was younger'."" De Bruyne contributed 10 goals and 18 assists to City's cause in 40 outings across all competitions this term, despite also dealing with a string of injuries which saw him sit out a further 12 matches. In addition to adding two more domestic trophies to his illustrious CV, the midfielder also played a key role in the club's run to their first Champions League final, which they lost 1-0 to Premier League rivals Chelsea. Foden was the only man to be nominated in both categories this yearand, while he ultimately missed out on the senior award to his Etihad Stadium colleague, he has become the 39th winner of the PFA Young Player of the Year. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, Manchester United starlet Mason Greenwood, West Ham's Declan Rice, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, who got the nod last season, were also up for the prize, but Foden edged them out after coming of age in Pep Guardiola's City squad.  ""I'm really honoured,"" the man who scored 16 goals and laid on a further 10 across 50 appearances for City in 2020-21 said of his PFA win. ""There have been some great players in the past who have won it,and I feel so lucky because there have been so many great young talents this year. ""I'm feeling really happy to win it and it's a special moment. I would like to thank my parents, all of the coaches and the players as well, because without them creating chances for me, I wouldn't score, and maybe I wouldn't win the awards.

68,https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-bruyne-stepping-up-man-city-fight-champions-league/bltccdd5027f87de3c8,In-form De Bruyne stepping up to lead Man City‚Äôs fight against ‚Äòsame stuff‚Äô Champions League failures,"Kevin De Bruyne couldn‚Äôt hide his frustration when Manchester City crashed out of the Champions League to mid-table Ligue 1 side Lyon two years ago. ‚ÄúDifferent year, same stuff,‚Äù was his honest response following the shock quarter-final defeat in Lisbon. That was the latest in a line of miserable exits and hard-luck stories that have kept City waiting to get their hands on the European trophy. Away-goal exits to Monaco and Tottenham, refereeing controversies against Liverpool, a semi-final defeat to Real Madrid, when they failed to threaten in a 1-0 loss ‚Äì there have been plenty of draining disappointments. Last year was as close as City got, making it all the way to the final and a clash with a Chelsea side that finished 19 points behind them in the Premier League. But there was to be more pain, literally for De Bruyne when he was forced off early with a fractured nose and eye socket and concussion, in a flat 1-0 defeat. Many of City‚Äôs most recent legends ‚Äì Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany for example - have left the club without securing a Champions League winners‚Äô medal and, turning 31 in June, the race is on for De Bruyne to ensure he doesn‚Äôt follow them. A major part of Belgium‚Äôs golden generation that has been regularly the top-ranked nation in the world but failed to win an international trophy, De Bruyne deserves to win one of the major honours. At City now, he‚Äôs leading the challenge for a treble, with the Champions League trophy remaining the one that the club covets more than any other. Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side head to Spain for their quarter-final second leg with Atletico Madrid holding a slender 1-0 advantage, courtesy of a De Bruyne strike in the first leg. And the City boss is thankful to have such a creative force that can make a difference, particularly against risk-averse Diego Simeone, who lined his side up in an already infamous 5-5-0 formation that failed to produce a single shot at the Etihad Stadium. The Premier League champions fared little better, although they at least tried to be creative, and when Phil Foden carved open the best opportunity, De Bruyne slotted the ball past Jan Oblak. His opening goal in the thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday was his sixth goal in six games and, without an orthodox striker, De Bruyne ‚Äì so often the player that lays on opportunities for his team-mates ‚Äì has stepped up to make the difference with key contributions. ‚ÄúI like that he is a player who does not just make a lot of assists, he is scoring a lot. I told him he has to score more goals to reach another stage,‚Äù Guardiola said on Sunday. ‚ÄúHe is scoring a lot of goals and making chances, knowing the position he is playing is so difficult against Liverpool because they are so narrow. And his vision for the last pass is exceptional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true he struggled in the first part of the season a lot with the injuries from the Champions League final and the European Championship.‚Äù Guardiola believes that De Bruyne is back playing at his highest level, whilst acknowledging exactly what a standard that is. From a fifth-minute opener to a stunning 94th-minute pass that gave Riyad Mahrez the chance to snatch a victory against Liverpool, his full qualities were on show. The incredible range of passes, the leadership that exudes confidence and an astonishing work rate, De Bruyne led from the front in a clash between the two best clubs in England, and possibly the two best sides in Europe, with both on a collision course for the Champions League final in Paris. ‚ÄúIf a team comes here to play, it is always a good game and Liverpool came here to play the way they play, so that's why it has always been good,‚Äù he told reporters after the match. Liverpool were open and attacking but finding that same space against such a well-disciplined Atletico side is far more difficult with the Spanish champions the masters of keeping games tight and happy for both sides to have few chances. De Bruyne is expecting a different game at a passionate Wanda Metropolitano, although Simeone may not want to gamble too early. ‚ÄúSome games are tough ‚Äì against Atletico, where you play against such a defensive wall, it is not the best game to play or watch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere's nothing we can do about it. ‚ÄúI think it will be a little bit tight at the beginning. Depending on the score, it has to change if it stays this way but I don't expect it to be a similar game.‚Äù It will be the third of a critical run of four matches with Liverpool again in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. De Bruyne is no stranger to punishing schedules but conceded it was tough in the early part of the season as he recovered from an ankle injury suffered during the Euros. The commitment as ever was there ‚Äì and he slumped to the floor with fatigue after an injury-time winner at Arsenal at the turn of the year. But he's ready for the final push. ‚ÄúEven if you wanted to, you don't have the time to think about it,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúMonday is a recovery day, Tuesday we leave for Madrid and it is the same for the cup game. ‚ÄúIt would have been nice to think about the end of the season but you don't get the time. That is maybe a good thing because you just play, play, play and then we will see what happens.‚Äù There‚Äôs no time for a break ‚Äì not with a first-ever Champions League to win.

De Bruyne came off just after the hour mark with City struggling to defend their slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg in the Wanda Metropolitano. His club will hope he has escaped serious injury as they hope to continue fighting on multiple fronts in the final months of the 2021-22 season. The Belgian pulled up in discomfort while on the run during the second half of the quarter-final second leg, just as Atletico began to push forward in their search for an equaliser. He was unable to continue, and limped off as Raheem Sterling was brought in to replace him. City were dealt a further blow minutes later when full-back Kyle Walker left the action due to injury. Walker had clashed with Renan Lodi and despite receiving treatment was ultimately obliged to leave the field, replaced by Nathan Ake. Now Pep Guardiola will hope neither of his key first-teamers has sustained lasting damage with a huge match on the horizon. On Saturday City take on Liverpool in the semi final of the FA Cup, just a week after the Premier League high-fliers shared the points in an enthralling 2-2 that left the former at the top of the table by a single point.

That is not a problem at present, with the 30-year-old Belgium international looking to chase down more major honours in 2021-22 and add to what is already an enviable collection of medals. He will be back for more next season, as he works on a contract through to 2025, but is wary of predicting when a distinguished career could come to a close and if he could seek another challenge away from the Etihad Stadium at some stage. Two-time PFA Player of the Year De Bruyne told Metro when quizzed on his future plans and whether he is currently at his peak: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about my prime years. ‚ÄúThere is a misconception that you are past your prime at 31! I feel good and I‚Äôm playing good, so hopefully I can carry on for as long as possible. ‚ÄúI have another three years on my contract here and that‚Äôs a long time. As long as I‚Äôm fit and feel happy I‚Äôll play but it‚Äôs hard to decide now how long that will be. ‚ÄúI can see myself still playing at 35, 36 but it has to be the right club, the right challenge.‚Äù When the heat is on, Kevin De Bruyne stays ice-cold üßä pic.twitter.com/z2ch82q7sR De Bruyne signed his most recent contract with City in May 2021, with a two-year extension to his previous terms agreed at that stage. He has remained a talismanic presence for the Blues since then and is fast closing in on 300 appearances for the club. That mark will be hit before the current campaign is out, with Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side continuing to chase down silverware at home and abroad. City continue to occupy top spot in the Premier League table, ahead of a crunch clash with Liverpool on Sunday, are into the semi-finals of the FA Cup and hold a 1-0 lead over Atletico Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final encounter.

Their final chance of silverware gone, as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford. Ralf Rangnick had called for a better display from his team than the one he saw in Madrid, and for half an hour he got what he asked for. But Renan Lodi's header, coupled with naivety from United in the second half, sent the Red Devils crashing out at the last-16 stage. Not only does this mean that their wait for a trophy will go into a sixth year, but their dismal record in Champions League knockout ties has continued. They have won just two ties since 2011: an elite European club, at least on the pitch, they are not. A more immediate concern is that a return to the competition next season is far from certain. A fourth-place finish in the Premier League is out of their hands, and with potential qualification by winning the tournament this season now impossible, they face a real prospect of another year of Europa League football, at best. Watching some of United‚Äôs displays this season, it would not be difficult to argue that they belong in Europe‚Äôs second tier, rather than among the very best. To be fair to Rangnick's side, they performed better here than they have for most of the season. But as with previous games, they only managed to sustain it through the first half. Fred, who has been in fine form in recent weeks, was exceptional at the heart of United‚Äôs midfield. One slick move where he turned Stefan Savic on the byline to create an opening for United in the first half will make it onto his season highlight reel, but in another trophyless season that counts for nothing. The intensity, aggression and precision that had been so lacking at the Wanda Metripolitano in the first leg was evident from kick off at Old Trafford. Rangnick had called for the players and the supporters to be on top form to get them through, and it seemed like they had listened. Manchester United end the season trophyless for the fifth campaign in a row üò≥ pic.twitter.com/wQkt87MbaA Anthony Elanga was denied by the face of Jan Oblak after a slick move from United, but despite their possession and dominance, they failed to really test the Atletico goalkeeper. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's first Champions League game in 11 years where he played 90 minutes and did not manage a shot. If there is one team in Europe you do no want to go a goal down to in a knockout tie, it is Diego Simeone‚Äôs Atletico. They are masters of the dark arts, and were more than happy to sit back and soak up pressure before hitting United on the counter. Their off-the ball-tactics angered United's players, staff and fans, but they knew exactly what they needed to do and it worked perfectly for the visitors. While Atleti know exactly how to perform to go through in these knockout ties, this is a United side who have no idea how to perform when the pressure increases. ""They know how to play these games,"" David de Gea told BT Sport. ""As soon as they scored the goal, they put the whole team in front of [Jan] Oblak. A very defensive team. We are really really sad. ""Of course, it‚Äôs hard for the club, for us, for the fans, really hard. This is where we are at the moment, it‚Äôs a difficult situation. ""We need to keep fighting, keep trying our best, but it‚Äôs a difficult moment again. I feel sad for the fans and for everyone. We are not good enough."" De Gea is not wrong in his final assessment, and major changes need to be made from top to bottom at United for that fact to change. Otherwise, that trophy drought will go on and on and on.

Bayern were knocked out at the quarter-final stage this week after losing to Villarreal. The coach revealed that he has received abuse on Instagram since their loss and added that his mother is also being targeted. ""I can handle criticism well. The situation is different with the 450 death threats on Instagram,"" the 34-year-old told reporters. ‚ÄúI actually get that after every game, whether we win or lose.I don't actually read them. I always delete a lot.Usually I only see the first line there. ""It's clear that a lot of people want to kill me, but now they're also shooting at my own mother, who has nothing to do with football and the elimination.That's a bit wild thenm but if I look at all of this, then I won't be able to finish. ""How do I deal with it? I don't give a f*ck.People should write what they want, but think a little more about it.I can not understand."" The Bavarian side's only chance of silverware this season remains the Bundesliga. They are closing in on securing the league title this term as they sit nine points clear of Borussia Dortmund with five games to go. They take on Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday. ""I want us to be champions and ideally in the next two games,"" Nagelsmann added. ""Then I will plan a lot and want to do better next year.If someone likes me, then they should like me because I'm Julian Nagelsmann and not because I'm the coach at Bayern, and if they don't like me, that's okay too.I have nothing to prove to anyone but myself.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

That was all it took to turn a sticky night into a spectacular one for Liverpool. They‚Äôre not there yet, but Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side are now overwhelming favourites to reach their third Champions League final in five seasons, after seeing off Villarreal 2-0 in their semi-final, first leg at Anfield on Wednesday night. Quick-fire strikes from Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane did the damage for the Reds, who, for 45 minutes, had looked as if they might find Villarreal‚Äôs ‚ÄòYellow Wall‚Äô as puzzling and as frustrating as Juventus and Bayern Munich had before them. Those two giants had fallen, but it would be a surprise if Liverpool were to go the same way now, even if they still have to finish the job in Spain next week. This was a convincing, dominant performance from Klopp‚Äôs men, who still have that unprecedented quadruple firmly within their sights. Unai Emery sent his side to annoy, but the gulf in quality between the two sides was evident throughout. Liverpool‚Äôs biggest annoyance, in fact, will be that they didn‚Äôt finish the tie here. They certainly had the chances to do so. That nutmeg assist from Mohamed Salah üòà pic.twitter.com/gT0xK3luwS In the end, a two-goal cushion will do them. It came courtesy of a piece of good fortune, Henderson‚Äôs clipped cross from the right drifting over the head of Geronimo Rulli, the Villarreal goalkeeper, and into the net, and from a piece of elite attacking quality, Mo Salah finding the perfect pass for Mane, who found the perfect finish for 2-0. Emery‚Äôs side looked shell-shocked. They had conceded only two goals in four games against Juve and Bayern, but suddenly they had shipped two in the blink of an eye, Liverpool‚Äôs relentless intensity too much even for a team designed to, in the words of their manager, ‚Äúsuffer without the ball‚Äù for long periods. They certainly did that here. Liverpool had almost three-quarters possession, took 19 shots and forced 10 corners. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk spent more time in the Villarreal half than in their own, while Alisson Becker was a spectator for the most part. Safe to say, it wasn‚Äôt the ding-dong we saw at the Etihad on Tuesday night. African players with the most Champions League knockout goals:Sadio Mane - 14 üá∏üá≥Didier Drogba - 14 üá®üáÆ pic.twitter.com/kPz25Lg9mL The result, though, is what is important, and Liverpool will certainly be backed to finish the job in six days‚Äô time, even if they must first negotiate a tricky Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. They had all the quality here, the tone set by Thiago Alcantara‚Äôs probing and Luis Diaz‚Äôs pressing. What a pair of signings those two are turning out to be, players of pedigree and desire and class. Throw in Mane, who again led the line superbly, and Salah, who didn‚Äôt score but created havoc with Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right, and you have a potent combination. The night finished as it had started, with The Beatles playing on the Anfield PA system. It was ‚ÄòYellow Submarine‚Äô before kick-off, a nice touch given the opposition, but it was a different tune being belted out by the end. ‚ÄòI Feel Fine‚Äô has become the soundtrack to Liverpool‚Äôs season, and no wonder. They're so glad, that Jurgen is a red, and come the end of next month, these fans, and this team, could have everything they ever dreamed of. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Liverpool's quadruple bid off to perfect start with epic Carabao Cup victory","Match statistics: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (10-11 pens.) The day began with tears for the injured Thiago Alcantara, but there were only smiles at the end for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup trophy used to be a permanent fixture at Anfield, and it is back in the Reds‚Äô possession once more. The first leg of a potential quadruple is in the bag, for Jurgen Klopp and his team. They and their fans went through hell to get there, mind. This will go down as one of the most incredible football matches - never mind finals - in living memory. Where do you even begin to unravel what we witnessed here today at Wembley? It took 120 minutes and 22 penalties to settle it. But when Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, sent his spot-kick into orbit at around 7.20pm, Liverpool could finally celebrate. And boy did they. SCENES!!! ü§ØKepa Arrizabalaga misses the 22nd penalty after being subbed on for the shoot-out! üò® pic.twitter.com/yLIOIQWdUD KEPA MISSED IT ü§ØLIVERPOOL ARE CHAMPIONS üèÜ pic.twitter.com/zCcEccrgnQ Kepa had been brought specifically for the shootout, his job to save penalties rather than take them. But the Spain international, a specialist, could do nothing as, one by one, Liverpool‚Äôs stars held their nerve from 12 yards. Caoimhin Kelleher was the 11th Red to do so, burying his penalty with aplomb. What a day this was for the Irishman, the deputy for Alisson Becker who did not put a foot, or a hand, wrong throughout. Kepa‚Äôs miss sparked wild scenes. Red smoke filled the north London air as the pyrotechnics were unleashed. Klopp, his staff and his players sprinted to Kelleher, who celebrated in front of the Liverpool supporters as the Wembley DJ played ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll Never Walk Alone‚Äô. Who says the Carabao Cup doesn‚Äôt matter, eh? There was nothing to separate the sides in the two league meetings earlier this year, and this was just as tight a contest, if not tighter. At times, it bordered on farcical. Chelsea had three goals disallowed and Liverpool one. VAR played its part, and so did the two goalkeepers. Kelleher made big saves from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku, while Edouard Mendy made an incredible one to deny Sadio Mane. The Senegal star was the Man Of The Match by a mile, and he was not even there for the conclusion. Chance after chance came and went. Mo Salah clean through, denied on the line by Thiago Silva. Mason Mount hit the post and missed another good opportunity. Mendy denied Virgil van Dijk and Luis Diaz. It was relentless, breathless, almost dangerously intense. Lord only knows what Klopp and Thomas Tuchel went through on the touchline. They embraced during the first half, and shared a nice moment when Kepa blazed his penalty over, but their heart-rate cannot have dropped below 130bpm here. And so Liverpool have ‚Äòtheir‚Äô trophy back. This is the ninth time they have lifted the League Cup, and only two of those have been settled in 90 minutes. They really are the marathon men in this competition, aren‚Äôt they? There is still plenty of running to do this season, mind. They enjoyed themselves here, but they know that there could be so much more to come. Manchester City are in their sights in the Premier League, and they will fancy their chances of going deep in both the Champions League and the FA Cup, too. That is for tomorrow, though. Today, it is time to celebrate. Klopp did. He danced a jig to Dua Lipa in front of his adoring fans. Kelleher could barely contain himself, Harvey Elliott grabbed a flare, the passion written all over his teenage face. James Milner, the oldest member of the squad, smiled like it was his first time. Joel Matip grinned and bounced, Van Dijk waved a corner flag around. It was carnage. A fitting climax, you could say. Liverpool Football Club are doing what they do. They are gathering cups again. One suspects there will be more to come this season, as well. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Van Nistelrooy was one of the finest strikers of his generation, scoring more than 300 goals in his career despite repeated battles with injury. He will now embark on his first senior coaching job at one of the Eredivisie's top sides. ""PSV has appointed 45-year-old former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy as their new manager on a 2025 contract to replace Roger Schmidt, who will leave his post at the end of the season when his contract ends,"" PSV explained in a statement published on the club's official website. ‚úî PSV U19‚úî Assistant coach @OnsOranje & PSV‚úî Jong PSVReady for the next step: ùóµùó≤ùóÆùó± ùó∞ùóºùóÆùó∞ùóµ ùó£ùó¶ùó© ùóôùó∂ùóøùòÄùòÅ ùóßùó≤ùóÆùó∫. Van Nistelrooy said: ‚ÄúIt has always been my dream to be head coach at PSV. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked intensively with Toon Gerbrands, PSV‚Äôs current General Manager, the past few seasons. ""I was convinced I could pursue a professional coaching career and originally thought I needed one more year to gain experience. ""But sometimes things do go their way and you find out that life is not completely manageable. This is the right moment to take the next step.‚Äù Van Nistelrooy's ties with PSV go back a long way. The forward came to prominence at the club after smashing 77 goals in 90 games between 1998 and 2000, a record which helped them to back-to-back league titles and also prompted United to take him to Old Trafford. At United and later Madrid, the Dutchman added three Premier League and Liga crowns to his collection and also finished as the Champions League top scorer in three different seasons, though he never got his hands on the European crown. A serious knee injury in 2008 while playing for Madrid curtailed his career at the top level and Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots four years later after spells at Hamburg and PSV. He then turned his hand to coaching, spending time as Dick Advocaat's Netherlands assistant and most recently as part of the youth set-up at PSV. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,‚Äù the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. ‚ÄúA year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,‚Äù Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip üòå A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I‚Äôll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 üôåüèæ A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. ‚ÄúI wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible ‚Äìyou only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

78,https://www.goal.com/en/news/vinicius-tobias-real-madrid-teenage-signing-brazil-alexander/blt851cb664e4627f8e,Vinicius Tobias: Real Madrid's new teenage signing could be Brazil's answer to Alexander-Arnold,"Dani Alves, Cafu, Carlos Alberto - when it comes to producing top-quality right-backs, few do it better than Brazil. The well, however, has run dry in recent years, so much so that despite being less than a month away from his 39th birthday, Alves is expected to be the Selecao's starter in the position for the 2022 World Cup. Quite who steps into the Barcelona star's shoes when he eventually hangs up his boots is anyone's guess right now, but there is hope that in a few years, the next top Brazilian right-back will be ready to pull on that famous yellow shirt. The player in question is Vinicius Tobias, who has been raising eyebrows for a number of years in his homeland, having come through the ranks at Internacional. The 18-year-old, who on April 1 completed a move to Real Madrid, appeared on the radars of Brazilian fans after helping the country's Under-15s win the South American Championship in 2019, with Vinicius scoring in the final victory over Argentina. He has since been likened to Trent Alexander-Arnold, in part because, like the Liverpool star, he started life as a central midfielder who has since been moved to the flank, but has been able to retain his playmaking abilities. Madrid are in desperate need of such a player within their first team, with Dani Carvajal having been exposed at times this season, particularly in the Champions League, while versatile duo Nacho and Lucas Vazquez are not natural right-backs despite having both filled in when Carvajal has been absent. There are high hopes at Madrid for 16-year-old Alejandro Jimenez, who is already a regular in the Blancos' U19s side, but with Bayern Munich sniffing around the Spain youth international, Vinicius has a real chance to nail down a starting role at Santiago Bernabeu for years to come. His road to the Spanish capital has, however, not been an easy one. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: At the age of just 12, Vinicius was forced to leave his mother's home in Sao Paulo and move over 1,100 kilometres (685 miles) south along Brazil's eastern coast to Porto Alegre, where he had been enrolled into Internacional's academy. He caught the eye of the club's scouts with his ability to take on opponents and drive into the penalty area from central midfield, as well as his vision of the game and tendency to always find team-mates with his passes. ""I was signed as a forward, but by 2017, I was playing as a midfielder,"" Vinicius told GloboEsporte when relaying the tale of his transition to right-back. ""Our full-back, Gustavo Bagatini, was injured and we didn't have another one. I asked the coach, Lucas Marchetti, for the chance to play there. It wasn't very difficult, but I still had a lot to learn."" Vinicius learned quickly, and he has never looked back, crowning his time at Internacional by helping the club win the Brazilian U20 Championship in 2021. ‚ÄúHe is the typical Brazilian player, an athlete with technical abilities of a very high level,"" Joao Miguel, who coached Vinicius to that title, tells GOAL. ""The relationship between the ball and and him is great, while the ability he has to solve the problems of the game is also very high, as well as his understanding of the tactical issues of the game. ‚ÄúHis physical attributes are very good, too, and he has good mental strength. He is a player who likes a duel and who enjoys the challenges of the game. ""So it is with huge happiness that he is already making his way abroad, where he will shine thanks to all of these skills."" Those skills led to interest from a number of top European clubs in Vinicius, with Real Madrid joined by Bayern Munich, Juventus and Atletico Madrid in monitoring the progress of the teenager. However, the race to sign Vinicius was won by Shakhtar Donetsk, who announced in July 2021 that they had agreed a ‚Ç¨6 million (¬£5m/$7m) deal to bring the defender to Ukraine, with Vinicius set to arrive six months later. He left Internacional without ever having played a first-team match for his boyhood club, but he was instantly integrated into the Shakhtar senior squad, with whom he spent their mid-season training camp in Turkey, appearing in six friendlies. Those games look likely to be his only appearances for the club, however, with Vinicius one of a group of Brazilian players based in Ukraine who took to social media upon Russia's invasion of the country in a bid to find safe passage out of their adopted home. After a number of days, the youngster joined his compatriots in crossing the border out of Ukraine, before it was announced by FIFA that players from Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to move outside of the transfer window so as to further their careers. Aware of him from their previous interest, Madrid moved quickly to secure Vinicius' signature, signing him on an initial loan through to the end of the 2022-23 season, with the option to make the deal permanent for ‚Ç¨17m (¬£14m/$18m) included. Though he has been through a lot since his arrival in Europe, Vinicius has settled well in Spain, and recently debuted for Real Madrid Castilla in the third tier of Spanish football. He has also trained with the first-team squad, though he is ineligible to play for them this season due to there already being three non-European Union players - Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Eder Militao - who play regularly in Carlo Ancelotti's side. Vinicius' time to step onto the Liga stage will come, however, even if he has to wait for his chance. It is something he is getting used to doing, but there is a belief that once he arrives into top-level football, he is unlikely to depart anytime soon. Brazil's long history of producing the world's top right-backs looks likely to continue. Additional reporting by Jorge Castro Picon.

79,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabio-miretti-juventus-wonderkid-italian-de-bruyne/blt382083c5ac6e8ad8,Fabio Miretti: Juventus wonderkid aiming to become 'The Italian De Bruyne',"Italian football is in a strange place right now. Internationally, they boast the champions of Europe, but are still coming to terms with the Azzurri missing out on a second successive World Cup. At club level, meanwhile, Italy boast one of, if not the most competitive of Europe's top five leagues, but have had just one team ‚Äì Atalanta ‚Äì reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League in the past three seasons. Fans around the country, therefore, are hopeful that a new generation of Italian footballers can help lead both the national team and its most historic clubs back to the top of the world game. Though using youth football results as a means of predicting the future is a dangerous game, there have been some encouraging signs so far in 2022. Italy qualified with ease for the upcoming Under-19s European Championship, and will be considered one of the favourites to win the competition in Slovakia when it kicks-off in mid-June. Juventus, meanwhile, have become just the second Italian side to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League since its inception in 2013, and will face Benfica in Nyon on Friday for a place in the final. And one player at the heart of both those sides around whom there is plenty of excitement is midfielder Fabio Miretti. The 18-year-old has been with the Bianconeri for 11 years, and having made his first-team debut already this season, there is genuine belief that Miretti can go on to become a star at the Allianz Stadium. It was he who scored the opening goal for Juve as they beat Liverpool 2-0 in the Youth League quarter-finals, while he also netted in two of Italy's three elite-round qualifying matches to earn their spot at the Euros. Such decisive actions suggest he already has the mentality to succeed, and follow in the footsteps of his footballing idol, Kevin De Bruyne. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""What impresses me is his technique, but also his vision,"" Miretti told Tuttosport when discussing the Manchester City star. ""He always knows where to pass the ball. He is a champion, a complete midfielder in every aspect."" Miretti certainly displays plenty of those same traits in his own game, with the teenager most comfortable playing as a No.8 in either a midfield three or diamond formation. Can @JuventusFCYouth produce more of these slick moves in Friday's semi-final with Benfica?Watch #UYL action on https://t.co/9QkhwHwkXF üì∫ ""Miretti has enormous football intelligence, excellent technical qualities and has grown a lot in how he covers the field, in terms of both intensity and stamina,"" Juventus U19s manager, Andrea Bonatti, told Tuttosport. ""He has creativity, goals and is a positive influence in the dressing room. He feels the pleasure of contributing towards his team-mates scoring and winning."" Miretti joined Juventus in 2011 after being spotted playing for Cuneo, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Turin. Torino were also keen on enrolling the youngster into their academy, but Miretti ‚Äì who once refused to cut his blonde hair as a boy so he could look more like his hero, Pavel Nedved ‚Äì chose Juve over their city rivals. Working his way through the various age-group sides, he began to appear on the radar of the Old Lady's more die-hard supporters as a 16-year-old, when he scored 16 goals and laid on six assists in 17 games for Juve's U17s side in 2019-20. He has since gone onto captain the Primavera (U19s) side while appearing regularly for Juventus U23s, who play in the third tier of Italian football. So far this season, he has three goals and four assists in Serie C. Having first caught the eye of Massimiliano Allegri during pre-season, Miretti made his first-team debut in December, when he came off the bench for the final minutes of Juve's Champions League win over Malmo. He followed that up with a Serie A debut in March, and it is expected that he will earn more chances in the final weeks of the season as Weston McKennie, Denis Zakaria and Arthur Melo spend time on the sidelines nursing injuries. Capable of playing any midfield role, Miretti has been taking advice from Manuel Locatelli when training as part of the senior squad, and there is hope that the pair will one day be the key pieces in the Juventus engine room. Miretti's commitment to his boyhood club was confirmed in January when he signed a new contract that will keep him with Juventus until 2026, in turn ending the hopes of clubs in the Bundesliga, Premier League and Ligue 1 of signing him as interest began to ramp up. Other Serie A clubs have also reached out to Juve to enquire about Miretti's potential availability, but the 36-time Italian champions are not yet ready to let one of their academy's prized assets leave, either on loan or permanently. Instead, they are hopeful that he can lead them to Youth League glory in the coming days, which in turn could be the catalyst for a new generation of Italian stars to emerge at the very top of the game.

80,https://www.goal.com/en/news/tom-rothe-borussia-dortmund-teenager-record-breaking/bltbcf6c9383928b761,Tom Rothe: Borussia Dortmund teenager breaking Bundesliga records,"""Not so bad."" That was Tom Rothe's assessment when he was shown a replay of his first professional goal by Sky Sports, the full-back heading in a corner to crown his Borussia Dortmund debut against Wolfsburg on April 16. The strike made Rothe the youngest player to ever find the net on their Bundesliga bow, doing so at the age of 17 years and 169 days - an achievement that is a bit more than just ""not so bad"". ""Tom did an excellent job,"" said Dortmund boss Marco Rose at full time. ""Of course, the goal gave him more self-confidence and even more security. ""For his age and the circumstances, he plays very calmly."" Though Rothe's surprise selection came in part due to injuries to Raphael Guerreiro and Thorgan Hazard. That he was chosen to start by Rose ahead of Germany international Nico Schulz highlights just how highly he is thought of at Signal-Iduna Park. Rothe's dream debut üòç pic.twitter.com/fEKQwSGqNL ""Tom is brutally ambitious,"" Mike Tullberg, Dortmund's Under-19s manager, tells GOAL and SPOX. ""He has done the most training sessions with us, completes the most sprints, eats the healthiest food and has the best stamina. He's a top professional through and through."" Rothe has shone under Tullberg after joining Dortmund from St. Pauli in the summer of 2021, providing three goals and 11 assists across all competitions for the recently crowned U19 Bundesliga West champions. ""He's a great boy, but he should still be an U17s player and go to school,"" Tullberg continues. ""That's why you have to be careful with him that things don't go too fast."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That might be difficult after Rothe's headline-grabbing senior debut, with it likely he will now train with the first-team squad for a prolonged period for the first time since pre-season. That is not to say that he does not fit in, especially from a physical point of view, with his 6'3 (192cm) frame making him one of the taller members of the Dortmund squad. That physical stature is matched with excellent stamina and speed, while his game intelligence and quality in possession mark him out as the ideal modern full-back, even if players in his position are generally much shorter. ""He's strong in the air and his crosses are great,"" Tullberg details, while Rothe's diagonal passes from left to right have not gone unnoticed among those who have watched him regularly, as well as the calmness he shows both with and without the ball. He is versatile, too, having been deployed at times on the left-hand side of a back three, while being as comfortable playing as a left-back in a back four as he is when giving more licence to get forward as a wing-back. The senior coaching staff had been toying with promoting him to the first-team squad on a more regular basis in recent months, but were reluctant to disturb his education by constantly moving him between teams. At international level, meanwhile, Rothe has earned himself a promotion, after making his Germany U19s debut in March, as he appeared in three of their European Championship qualifiers. That is just the latest new experience for the 17-year-old, who has been away from his family for the first time over the course of his debut season at Dortmund having settled into a room at the club's boarding school at their training ground in Brackel. Rothe, though, has shown that he has the mentality to deal with such changes, even if there are improvements he can still make to his game. ""He still has a lot to learn,"" says Tullberg, citing Rothe's positional play and defensive tackles that need further work, while he still has to learn how to properly cover for his team-mates if they find themselves out of position. At Dortmund, though, they firmly believe that Rothe can overcome all these challenges and become a star of the first team. ""He's one of those players who you can say has what it takes to get to the top,"" Tullberg concludes. For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.

The Reds tried to sign the Portuguese forward during the last transfer window although were unable to get the deal over the line in time despite having agreed a transfer with the Cottagers. Indeed, that ¬£8 million total fee still stands, with it now appearing that Jurgen Klopp will get his man in the summer. Liverpool have been keen to avoid going to a tribunal over Carvalho's signing, which would be required as the player is under the age of 24 and is out of contract in the summer. Negotiations with the Championship side - who are 11 points clear at the top of the table and appear destined for a return to the Premier League - were cordial in January 2022, with time ultimately running out to finalise the move on deadline day. A number of clubs have been keen on signing the highly-rated 19-year-old, who has made 30 senior appearances for the Cottagers in the 2021-22 season, scoring eight goals. It is Liverpool who have always been favourites to land his signature, however, and GOAL can confirm that despite interest from a host of other clubs across Europe, the Reds have secured a deal that will take him to Anfield in the summer. They will pay an initial ¬£5m ($6.5m) with up to ¬£3m ($4m) in performance-related add-ons. There is also a 20 per cent sell-on clause included, with Carvalho set to finalise a five-year contract. He will not be loaned back to the Cottagers next season, with Liverpool expecting him to compete for a first-team spot immediately. Klopp is a big admirer of the Portuguese, who, after representing England at youth level now appears to have settled on playing for Portugal after turning out for their Under-21 side during the most recent international break. Commenting on speculation linking Liverpool with Carvalho, Klopp said in February 2022: ""I don't know. We will see. We are obviously still interested, it would be crazy if we are not. ""It's obviously not in our hands. It was late before the deadline [in January] and it didn't work out. We will see what happens."" Carvalho will not be the only youngster moving to Merseyside this summer. Liverpool are also set to sign 16-year-old winger Ben Doak from Celtic in a ¬£600,000 ($795,000) deal.

Bayern were crowned last weekend following their Klassiker victory over Borussia Dortmund and subsequently sustained their first league defeat since February at the hands of the mid-table side. Now Magath fears that a repeat of Saturday's lacklustre performance next weekend against Hertha's relegation rivals Stuttgart could harm his team's chances of staying up. ""The situation is still critical between Stuttgart, Bielefeld and us,"" Magath told Sky after Hertha's 1-1 draw at Arminia Bielefeld When asked about Bayern's clash with Stuttgart next week, Magath added: ""You don't know what to say about that. FC Bayern are champions, I don't know if they are now stopped playing. ""I only saw the result. I don't know how it came about, but it's not nice. ""For all teams, the season lasts until the last matchday and I don't know why a team can then say: 'We won't play the season to the end and coast through three matchdays before closing.'It doesn't serve the Bundesliga or the competition."" With Greuther Furth already condemned to the second tier and bottom place in the Bundesliga, the remaining two relegation spots are being disputed by three sides. Arminia Bielefeld currently occupy the second automatic place and lie two points behind Stuttgart, who in turn trail Hertha by four as they seek to avoid the play-off berth. Hertha, who meet Mainz next weekend, need only match Stuttgart's result against Bayern to assure safety for another season, while Bielefeld will go down if Stuttgart beat the champions and they fail to win over Bochum.

The prolific Polish striker remains a talismanic presence at the Allianz Arena, with a 48-goal haul this season helping to deliver a 10th successive Bundesliga title for German giants. He is, however, only tied to a contract through to 2023 and, at 33 years of age, is said to be mulling over a new challenge in Spain after seeing the prestigious Ballon d'Or elude him to this point. Spanish midfielder Martinez, who spent several years playing alongside Lewandowski at Bayern before making a move to Qatar in June 2021, told El Larguero of the rumours regarding a possible transfer to Barca: ‚ÄúJust today I spoke to him. He told me: ‚ÄòEvery day you have more grey hair‚Äô. Bayern‚Äôs issue is that there is no clause. If they don‚Äôt want to sell you, you‚Äôre screwed. ‚ÄúI think that there is some possibility. I think he believes that by playing in Spain he would have had a Ballon d‚ÄôOr or two. And that‚Äôs why he wants to try. ‚ÄúHe has the feeling that he deserved the Ballon d‚ÄôOr.

GOAL has, however, been able to confirm that contingency plans are being pieced together in Bavaria when it comes to lining up possible replacements for the record-breaking frontman. Ajax star Sebastian Haller has been identified as a potential target for Bayern as they sweat on a big career call from Lewandowski. Barca have not been shying away from the fact that they would be interested in entering into talks if there is a deal to be done in the next window, with the Liga heavyweights having already been heavily linked with another proven performer currently plying his trade in the Bundesliga ‚Äì Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland.

Manchester United are interested in the Ajax striker, who has hugely impressed in the Eredivisie following an underwhelming stint with West Ham, while both AC Milan and Inter are also keen. However, Bayern would have a first-choice striker spot available should Lewandowski complete his rumoured switch to Barca - leaving space open for Haller to fill. GOAL has learned Ajax are keen on Bayern striker Joshua Zirkzee, who is currently impressing on loan at Anderlecht. Bayern could therefore use Zirkzee as a makeweight in any potential signing of Haller, although they are also linked with two other Ajax players, Noussair Mazraoui and Ryan Gravenberch. Bayern are unsurprisingly keen to keep Lewandowski, who is arguably the world's best striker right now - he has scored 48 goals so far this season, and still going strong aged 33. However, he only has a contract until 2023, and no extension has been secured as yet as talks for a renewal drag on. Lewandowski himself has said contract talks are ""not easy"", while Blaugrana president Joan Laportahas now confirmed there is interestfrom the Spanish club.

The highly-rated Spain international has spent the last three months out of action, with a troublesome hamstring complaint preventing him from playing any part in the Blaugrana‚Äôs plans. A decision was taken at the end of January not to send him under the knife once more, having previously undergone a number of knee operations, and the hope is that the youngster is now free of any lingering fitness concerns.

Koeman was dismissed in October after less than 18 months in charge with the club ninth in La Liga and six points behind leaders Real Madrid. Xavi was confirmed as his replacement the following month and has lifted the club up to second in the table, though they are currently 15 points behind rivals Real Madrid, who could clinch the title this weekend. Koeman could only guide Barca to a third-place finish in his only full season in charge before being dismissed after picking up just 15 points from the first 10 games of the 2021-22 campaign. His time at the club was overshadowed by the club‚Äôs financial problems, which restricted their activity in the transfer market and ultimately led to the departure of Lionel Messi last summer. There was also the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic which forced many matches behind closed doors and the return of Joan Laporta as president. ""I can write a book [about my time at Barca]. Many things happened to us,‚Äù Koeman told a news conference. ‚ÄúCovid issue, lack of president for a while, I had to answer all kinds of questions, not being able to sign the players we wanted, [financial] fair play complications, without Leo Messi from one day to another, losing [Antoine] Griezmann on the last day of the market.‚Äù Koeman was keen to stress his support for Xavi when asked about the impact his successor has had at Camp Nou, though he did point out the larger gap between themselves and champions-elect Real Madrid. ‚ÄúSure, they have improved in some things. They have signed three strikers or three players who can play up front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is not good to compare. When I left, Barcelona was eight points away and now almost double. It is not good to compare. ‚ÄúXavi's task It's just as complicated as me. This is the reality of Barcelona today. It needs time to return to what it was and, therefore, I ask for peace of mind and not to think that we haven't won titles. We have to think long-term, trust and support the coach.‚Äù Koeman was critical of Barca president Laporta, who he believes did not offer him enough support, particularly when publicly questioning his future last summer. ‚ÄúIt's true that Barca's situation is the same as it was with me. That means that changing a coach is not always something that guarantees you to improve,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don't want to make any criticism. The only thing I ask is to support Xavi. A coach is not the only culprit. I didn‚Äôt have the full support of the president and I hope he has learned from this and supports Xavi. ""The club's situation hurts me, it's sad because I'm a cule. I ask for maximum support for Xavi, he's a legend, a very good coach and little to blame for Barcelona being in this situation"". Asked about his relationship with Laporta, Koeman said: ‚ÄúI have not spoken much out of respect for the club. It is not good that I have to answer questions of this kind every time. ‚ÄúI have felt, in other clubs, especially in two years as a coach, that we know exactly the risk of being a coach: If things don't work as the club thinks, they can kick you out. ‚ÄúBut, for me, the president left doubts. Off the record [he] said ‚ÄòI don't know if he continues, we have doubts. It's not good‚Äô. ""We have to speak clearly in private, but defend the coach in public. If you don't support your coach, it's even more complicated."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Raiola represented some of the biggest names in football, including Paul Pogba, Erling Haaland and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He had worked in football since the 1980s and was a crucial factor in some of the biggest deals in the game, such as Pogba's then-world record ¬£89 million move to Manchester United in 2016. A statement from his family posted to social media read: ""In infinite sorrow, we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent that ever was. ""Mino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realised it. ""Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football. His presence will forever be missed. ""Mino's mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion."" pic.twitter.com/xuZWBNA62N Raiola, who was born in Italy but moved to the Netherlands as a child, began working as an agent four decades ago. His first major deal was the transfer of Pavel Nedved from Sparta Prague to Lazio in 1996. He worked through the modern financial boom in football, including the birth and growth of the Premier League and Champions League, and was equally admired and reviled for his direct style and ruthless drive to get the best possible deals for his clients. As well as Pogba, Matthijs de Ligt‚Äôs ‚Ç¨73m (¬£62m/$77m) move to Juventus from Ajax in 2019 was overseen by Raiola, while he was also involved in Gianluigi Donnarumma's free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain following his Milan exit last year. He suffered recent health issues and was admitted to hospital earlier this week, although his family were left outraged after it was widely, and falsely, reported that he had died on April 28.

90,https://www.goal.com/en/news/rip-mino-raiola-king-of-the-super-agents/bltdce77619e5ec3a1f,RIP Mino Raiola: King of the super-agents,"Mino Raiola had an accountancy firm called Maguire Tax & Legal, its name inspired by an Oscar-winning movie starring Tom Cruise. Many of his adversaries within the game were offended by the insinuation he was any way similar to Jerry Maguire, the fictional sports agent who comes to champion love (or 'kwan') over greed. However, his clients would always tell you the comparison was just; that he formed a special bond with each and every one of them. Such polarised opinions perfectly illustrated the way in which Raiola divided the football world. He will forever be remembered as one of its most controversial yet compelling characters, seemingly loved and loathed in equal measures, a self-styled super-agent doing right by clients, but wrong by clubs. The 54-year-old was born in Agri, Italy, but his parents emigrated to Netherlands when he was still an infant, settling in Haarlem. It was in this Dutch municipality that Raiola was raised before taking the first steps to becoming arguably the 'king of super-agents'. Raiola was a moderately talented player in his youth and he played for his local club before quitting the game at just 18. However, while he started studying law, he had not lost his passion for football, electing to take charge of the Haarlem youth team. pic.twitter.com/xuZWBNA62N Even at such a tender age, Raiola was a straight-talker with a distinct lack of respect for any figure of authority other than his restaurateur father. ‚ÄúThe president of Haarlem came to eat with us every Friday,‚Äù he explained in an interview with Il Secolo XIX in 2011. ‚ÄúI was always telling him that he knew nothing about football. ""One day he takes me aside and says: ‚ÄòListen, you try it.‚Äô He appointed me sporting director.‚Äù Raiola, though, became frustrated by his inability to make what he believed were the requisite changes due to a lack of funds. However, with Dutch players very much in vogue in the mid-1980s, he saw that there was money to be made in selling his adopted nation‚Äôs top footballing talent to Italy, which was then the centre of the footballing universe. Raiola, having honed his skills as a mediator while working as a broker for Dutch businessmen with commercial interests in Italy, negotiated a deal with the players' union in the Netherlands that enabled him to represent all of the country‚Äôs footballers. His goal at this point was to establish a special working relationship with Napoli, ‚Äúthe club of my heart‚Äù. However, the deal collapsed. ""I called [then Partenopei president Corrado] Ferlaino and we started the collaboration,"" he later explained. ""I offered him [Dennis] Bergkamp for 700 million lire [‚Ç¨362,000]. He hesitated. Two years later [1993], he offered ‚Ç¨14 million, but I gave the player to Inter."" With the Bergkamp deal, which also saw Wim Jonk join the Nerazzurri from Ajax, Raiola had established himself as a major player in Serie A, the deal coming as it did a year after Bryan Roy's successful switch from Amsterdam to Foggia. What was clear at this juncture was that Raiola was as adept at pleasing his clients as upsetting their clubs. Indeed, Ajax, who had profited substantially from Raiola-arranged deals during the early 1990s, were less enamoured with the way in which star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Juventus in 2004. Their ill-feeling only intensified two years later when the fallout from Calciopoli led to the release of the following recorded telephone exchanges between then Bianconeri managing director Luciano Moggi and Raiola: Moggi: ""You and Ibra continue to make trouble. Don't send him to training ..."" Raiola: ""Tomorrow, I'll keep the player at home all day; he won't show up for training. I then have an appointment with the directors of Ajax at noon, but I'll come at two ..."" Raiola's influence on players was also questioned by Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson during his club‚Äôs ultimately futile attempts to persuade former midfielder Paul Pogba to remain at Old Trafford in 2012. The Scot subsequently admitted that he and Raiola took an instant dislike to one another, saying they were like ""water and oil"". Raiola's relationship with Pep Guardiola was even worse, with the agent labelling the Catalan a ""coward"" and a ""dog"", and even suggesting that the former Barcelona boss should have been sent to a psychiatric hospital for not playing Ibrahimovic. Raiola also claimed that he ""went for"" Guardiola after the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley but was held back by then-AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. ""Lucky for Guardiola!"" Raiola quipped. In his eyes, his willingness to literally fight for his clients underlined his commitment to their cause, while he always insisted that he did not engineer transfers, but merely facilitated them. ""I think that when a player decides to leave a team he should leave,"" he reasoned. ""I have never made compromises; I work exclusively in the interest of my client. ""The players are my fortune and I have a great responsibility towards them.However, I have never carried out improper activity or activity that I, personally, do not think proper. ""The old agents favoured the interests of the club. For me, the player comes first.‚Äù And that is precisely why they continued to flock to him. From Ibrahimovic and Pogba to Erling Haaland and Gigi Donnarumma, Raiola remained arguably the most influential agent in football right up until his untimely death at the age of 54. Football agent Mino Raiola has passed away aged 54, his family have announced.RIP. pic.twitter.com/SdSKUoiJux There were always question marks over the size of his cuts, but that was part of a broader debate over the role of agents within the game. Whatever one's view of Raiola's role in transfers, there is no denying that this was a man with a unique way with words who knew not only to sell himself, but also his players. He spoke eight languages (Italian, Dutch, French, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and ""of course Neapolitan"") and had a particular flair for hyperbole. He memorably compared Pogba with a Salvador Dali painting and claimed that Ibrahimovic‚Äôs move to Paris Saint-Germain finally provided visitors to the French capital with something to see other than the Mona Lisa. For all his bombast, though, he rather humbly puts his impressive linguistic capabilities down to ""preparation, not intelligence"". Ultimately, there was a contradiction at the core of Raiola's work, and his character. He said he resolved problems. His detractors claimed that he created them. Perhaps the truth was somewhere in between ‚Äì and perhaps utterly irrelevant because the bottom line is that Raiola made money. Both for his clients ‚Äì and himself. ""We live in a cynical world,"" as Dicky Fox says in 'Jerry Maguire'. ""A cynical world. And we work in a business of tough competitors."" Raiola was undoubtedly one of the toughest competitors in his particular field, which probably also made him the best. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

United drafted in Rangnick on an interim basis after deciding to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the team's poor start to the 2021-22 campaign. Rangnick has since managed to steady the ship, reigniting the Red Devils' hopes of a top-four Premier League finish, but will be moving into an advisory role at the end of the season. A permanent replacement for Solskjaer is still being sought, and Ten Hag has been reported as one of the leading candidates for the role. Rangnick is not aware of any discussions with the Dutchman taking place, but ranks him among the elite coaches in the business. ""I don't know him to start with as a person, but I've seen how Ajax have developed since he's been there,"" the United chief has told Sky Sports. ""I know about the work he did while he was at Bayern Munich and it's obvious he's one of the top coaches in Europe but there are a few others. ""We've not spoken about any new manager so far and therefore we've not spoken about him."" Rangnick was speaking ahead of the Red Devils' crucial derby clash with Manchester City on Sunday, and went on to reveal that he already has a preferred option in mind to fill his spot in the dugout. ""So far, we've not spoken about that,"" he said. ""Not with [football director] John Murtough or anyone else, we've not spoken about this topic over the last weeks and months since I've been here. I know my opinion but so far we've not spoken about that so it's all I can tell you."" Ten Hag began his coaching career with the Go Ahead Eagles in 2012, where he spent one year before taking over Bayern Munich II. The 52-year-old moved to Twente after leaving Germany and guided the club to a fourth-placed Eredivisie finish in 2016-17, attracting attention from Ajax in the process. Ten Hag was handed an initial two-and-a-half-year contract at Johan Cruyff Arena, and has seen that agreement extended after delivering four domestic trophies, including two Eredivisie titles. Ajax are on course to retain the trophy this season and still going strong in the Champions League, but Ten Hag has entered the last 18 months of his contract and United could yet come calling in the summer.

92,https://www.goal.com/en/news/youri-regeer-ajax-academy-star-first-team-breakthrough/blt50b6dca39987d0d8,Youri Regeer: Ajax's latest academy star set for first-team breakthrough,"The conveyor belt of talent emerging from the Ajax academy into the club's first team has shown no signs of slowing down in recent years. Ryan Gravenberch and Jurrien Timber are just two of the Eredivisie champions' current homegrown talents who have become fixtures in Erik ten Hag's side, as well as full Netherlands internationals before their 21st birthdays. If there is one position on the field, however, where Ajax seem to currently have a never-ending supply of youngsters emerging, it is at right-back. Sergino Dest, Noussair Mazraoui and Devyne Rensch have all developed into becoming senior internationals having come through the ranks in Amsterdam, with Dest, of course, having already flown the nest to join Barcelona. It is expected that Mazraoui will also leave the club this summer, with his contract set to expire at the end of June, while many believe that teenager Rensch will eventually be moved into central defence, meaning there is likely to be an opening in the position in the not-too-distant future. Given recent form, there is a good chance it will be filled by another academy graduate, with 18-year-old Youri Regeer having made quite the case for inclusion in the club's first-team plans, even if he has rarely been thought of as being a defender. A midfielder by trade, Regeer has shown immense versatility since he joined Ajax as a 14-year-old in 2017, and over the course of the current campaign has thrived playing at right-back, suggesting he will be the next cab off the rank in that position sooner rather than later. Despite having only turned 18 in August, Regeer is already the captain of Jong Ajax, who play in the second tier of Dutch football, and has over 60 matches at that level under his belt already having become the fourth-youngest debutant for the team when he made his bow in early 2020. A first-team debut in December's cup win over Barendrecht has since followed for a player who has been destined to become a footballer since his very early years. ‚ÄúHe's never really done anything different in his entire life. From an early age he was already playing with a ball,"" his father, and former Telstar midfielder, Arend Regeer tells GOAL. ""Having fun in football has always been a priority, that is no different at Ajax now.‚Äù Regeer Jr. began his footballing education at local club SV Zandvoort, though he initially was not allowed to join in when he first turned up at the age of four. ‚ÄúAs a youth player, he liked doing everything,‚Äù his father says. ""He played up front, in defence, and also took part in goalkeeper clinics. He even won cups as a goalkeeper!"" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Regeer went onto join ADO Den Haag at the age of 12 as both Ajax and AZ Alkmaar rejected him at trials, though two years later, the former liked what they had seen of Regeer and brought him to the capital. There he was part of a celebrated group of players that included highly-touted talents such as Gravenberch, Rensch, Naci Unuvar, Brian Brobbey and Sontje Hansen, and as such Regeer would sometimes fade into the background, noted more for his versatility and being a team player rather than his ability. That said, his willingness to play any and all positions meant he was able to take opportunities to fill gaps at a higher level, and he made sure to take them. For example, when then-Ajax Under-19s coach John Heitinga required someone to play as a right-sided forward against Valencia in the group stage of 2019-20 UEFA Youth League, Regeer was called upon, despite having only just turned 16. He returned his manager's faith, however, scoring a hat-trick in a 5-3 win over the Spanish side that, in part, led to him being the youngest player called-up to the Netherlands U17 squad for the 2019 World Cup in Brazil. After suffering a painful 3-0 defeat to Japan in their opening game, the Dutch brought Regeer into the starting line-up, deploying him as a holding midfielder in the group stage before dropping him back further to become a ball-playing centre-back in the knockout rounds. In the semi-finals against Mexico, however, it was Regeer who missed the crucial penalty in the Netherlands' shootout loss in a moment that could have broken a less resolute individual. ‚ÄúThe World Cup was a big blow, and the first few days after were very hard,"" Regeer told Voetbalzone. ""But I wanted to play the next match at Ajax anyway, and I scored twice. ""That was a turning point. I knew I was back on the right track."" Regeer has been on the right track ever since, and his tally of five goals and nine assists for Jong Ajax this season marks him out as being one of the best players in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie, particularly given he has played predominantly as either a holding midfielder or at right-back. ‚ÄúI prefer to play as a number six or number eight, as a box-to-box midfielder,‚Äù Regeer tells GOAL. ""This year, I mostly played at right-back. If you look at my numbers in the first half of the season, they are excellent from that position. ""I know that there may be a chance to break through to the Ajax first team at right-back, rather than as a number six, and so I have to keep doing what I can to make that happen.‚Äù Away from the pitch, Regeer remains grounded for a player on his apparent pathway, with his father describing him as being ""someone who gets along with everyone"". ‚ÄúHe's a very down-to-earth boy,"" Arend Regeer adds. ""He occasionally goes along to help out SV Zandvoort U21 with their training, which I think is very nice to see.‚Äù Following his first-team debut in late 2021, Regeer would have been hopeful of further catching Ten Hag's eye at Ajax's winter training camp, only for the trip to Portugal to be cut short after just two days due to a Covid-19 outbreak. If he was disappointed, Regeer did not show it when Jong Ajax returned to action on January 10, as he broke the deadlock against FC Utrecht while being played in yet another different position, as Heitinga deployed him as a number 10. ‚ÄúYouri is a very important player for us. He takes a leading role both on the ball and in the defensive aspect of the game, and it is not for nothing that he is our captain,‚Äù Jong Ajax's assistant coach, Michel Kreek, told GOAL post-match. ""He is an incredibly driven young player who is versatile while being above average in almost every position. That is, of course, very advantageous if you can be distinctive in so many positions. ‚ÄúYouri recently made his debut in the first team, so the potential is there. If he gets the chance, I am convinced that he can play very well as a right-back for the first team, too.‚Äù The next aim for Regeer is to make his top-flight debut as he attempts to become a regular in the Ajax side over the course of the next few years, though there are question marks over his future given his contract is set to expire at the end of the season. ""It's not an issue for me, I'd rather keep that to myself,"" he says amid reports that talks are progressing well regarding a new deal. ‚ÄúPlaying for the Ajax first team is, of course, the most important thing for me, but we will soon see what will happen."" Ajax will hope that Regeer sticks around to make the leap in the coming months. Whether it is at right-back or elsewhere, he certainly has the talent to fill any gaps that may emerge in one of Europe's most exciting young squads.

The Ajax boss will leave his current position and become United‚Äôs fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferugson left the club in 2013. The Dutchman will replace Ralf Rangnick, who has been interim manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November. üá≥üá±üëîThe new First-Team Manager of Manchester United: Erik ten Hag.#MUFC || #WelcomeErik United have confirmed that Ten Hag has signed a three-year contract, with a 12-month extension option beyond that point, and will join the club following the conclusion of the Dutch league season. He impressed Old Trafford chiefs during an official interview in March, and Joel Glazer and CEO Richard Arnold made him the preferred candidate earlier this month. It is understood United will pay Ajax a compensation fee of ¬£1.6 million. The Dutchman is hoping to go out on a high and win the Eredivisie for the third time - his side currently sit four points clear of second place PSV with five games left to play. It is understood he will also look to bring his own backroom staff with him and will have an instant input on transfers. United are expecting to take in a busy summer window as they look to rebuild the squad again with a number of high-profile players out of contract. GOAL sources say Ten Hag will be shown a shortlist of players for each position before a decision is made on who to make moves for. He will also be able to present his own ideas. OFFICIAL: Manchester United confirm Erik ten Hag as their next manager üî¥ pic.twitter.com/pJFKinQtSu The 52-year-old has told the Red Devils' official website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" United's football director, John Murtough, added: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team‚Äôs attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag has told Ajax's official website of ending on a ""positive note"" there: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important. ""But I only have one interest now and that's these last five games. I want to finish my time here on a positive note, by winning the league. By doing so, we'll qualify directly for the Champions League. Ajax belongs there."" United have arranged a pre-season tour for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. Ten Hag will be in position before they head off on tour and their first game is against Liverpool in Bangkok in July. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Man Utd were battered by Liverpool on Tuesday night, following up a 5-0 loss to the Reds at Old Trafford earlier this season with a 4-0 defeat at Anfield. With the loss, United have seen their top-four hopes continue to dim, with Rangnick acknowledging that his side have every reason to be embarrassed after another lesson from a top club. ""It is embarrassing, it is disappointing, maybe even humiliating,"" Rangnick told BBC Match of the Day. ""We have to accept they are six years ahead of us now. When Jurgen Klopp came, they changed at the club and lifted not just the team, but the club and city to a new level. ""That is what needs to happen with us in the next transfer windows."" Asked what United need to start closing the gap on Liverpool in his post-match press conference, Rangnick replied: ""If you analyse the situation it is not difficult... for me, it is clear there will be six, seven, eight, maybe 10 new players. And before you sign those players, you need to be aware how you want to play."" Rangnick's squad began the match with a three-at-the-back system, with Phil Jones brought into the team for only his second start in two years. It immediately backfired, as Liverpool were up a goal within five minutes before running rampant for the rest of the first half. Rangnick changed things up at the interval, bringing Jadon Sancho on for Jones to add another attacking option, but he admitted that formation matters little in a match where Manchester United were so thoroughly outclassed. ""I don't think a different formation at the start would have changed anything,"" Rangnick said. ""The first goal we conceded, it was not part of the game plan to be that high up and concede a counter-attack after five minutes. That changed the game. ""The first half, we were just not good enough. We did not win any first ball or second balls. We were second-best in all relevant areas. ""Second half we changed a centre-back with Jadon Sancho. The first 25 minutes we were better and had pressure on the ball at times. [We] had two or three moments, but the third goal killed the game off.""

95,https://www.goal.com/en/news/no-ronaldo-maguire-how-ten-hag-man-utd-might-play/blta9a877e755b665c8,No Ronaldo or Maguire? How Ten Hag's Man Utd might play,"After ramping up their recruitment process in recent weeks, Manchester United have made a decision over who will be their next permanent manager. Current Ajax boss Erik ten Hag will take the reins at Old Trafford this summer, after impressing in his interview and emerging as the standout candidate before signing a three-year deal with the Red Devils. So, why Ten Hag? What does he offer? What kind of tactical approach will he implement at Old Trafford? And what effect will his appointment have on the club's transfer targets? In terms of his preferred formation, Ten Hag employed a 4-4-2 (with a diamond in midfield) during the early years of his coaching career before moving on to a 4-3‚Äì3. Now, though, he favours a 4-2-3-1, which will obviously be familiar to United's current squad, given it's the same system used by former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the one which interim manager Ralf Rangnick has also belatedly decided upon. Also, just like Rangnick, Ten Hag likes his teams to play an energetic, possession-orientated brand of football, with players pressing from the front. However, Rangnick hasn‚Äôt been able to fully implement this style in his four months at the club, with the German coach questioning the fitness levels of his squad. Certainly, the players have not looked physically capable of sustaining the kind of relentless pressure that Rangnick demands for a full 90 minutes, having not played anything like that under Solskjaer. So, for such an intensive approach to work, Ten Hag has to improve his players' stamina levels, and also get them to play with greater commitment and drive. That will be easier said than done, given certain players have been critical of the training sessions put on by Rangnick and his coaching team. But those critics will have no place to hide if Ten Hag does arrive. Players who have previously worked with the Dutchman have noted his meticulous planning of each and every session. He is said to be keen on video analysis and will suddenly stop sessions if a player is out of position. Ten Hag will at least take encouragement from the fact that Rangnick has already made it clear to the board that United need to recruit more players with the requisite physicality and aggression to play this kind of football. GOAL understands the club is already drawing up transfer target shortlists for each of their priority positions, and that these names will then be presented to the new manager, who will be the deciding factor in which players are signed. It is also believed that Ten Hag  will also be able to present his own targets to the board. Time is obviously of the essence, which is why the club have been so keen to get a new manager in place sooner rather than later, so as to begin shaping the squad for next season as quickly as possible. But which members of the current squad would already be suited to Ten Hag's preferred playing style? Fred, Bruno Fernandes, Jadon Sancho and Scott McTominay are the players who press the most, so should have no problem adapting. Paul Pogba also ranks highly, but is expected to leave when his contract expires this summer. Pressing is a key part of Donny van de Beek‚Äôs game, too, and when Ten Hag takes over at United, the Dutch midfielder, who is presently on loan at Everton, would likely be welcomed back to Old Trafford with open arms by his former boss. The older members of the squad are likely to be deemed surplus to requirements, though. Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani are both out of contract in the summer and set to leave, while Nemanja Matic, at 33, has also confirmed his intention is to depart come the end of the season. But what of Cristiano Ronaldo? He doesn‚Äôt press in the way Ten Hag requires but has been the club‚Äôs leading scorer across all competitions this season, so a massive decision will have to be made on whether space can be made for the prolific Portuguese superstar in the new set-up. It's also worth remembering that a new striker is high on United's list of priorities this summer, with Tottenham ace Harry Kane of particular interest. The next manager will also have to make a call on Marcus Rashford, who has struggled terribly this season. Still, Ten Hag revitalised Sebastien Haller's career after the centre-forward's tough time at West Ham, so maybe he could do something similar for Rashford. Of course, one of the key elements of Ajax‚Äôs success is the ability to move quickly in transitions, but United are hampered in that regard by the make-up of their midfield. Consequently, the club is also hoping to sign a world-class midfielder for the 2022-23 campaign, with West Ham‚Äôs Declan Rice their No.1 choice. However, agreeing a deal with West Ham will not be easy, with manager David Moyes insisting that it would require a bid of more than ¬£150 million ($200m) to convince the Londoners to part company with their most prized possession. United are unlikely to meet such an exorbitant asking price, but they will have to find a commanding midfielder capable of linking the play if they are to start challenging the game's very best teams for major honours again. There are also issues in defence, particularly as Ten Hag's approach requires effective attacking full-backs, which could spell trouble for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who struggles going forward. Luke Shaw is obviously far more capable offensively, but the England man's form will have to improve dramatically if he is to retain his starting spot next season. Ten Hag will also have to decide upon a regular partner for first-choice centre-half Raphael Varane, with Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly both more comfortable on the ball than captain Harry Maguire, whose performances have been repeatedly criticised this season. Make no mistake about it: there could be some high-profile casualties when Ten Hag takes over, not least because of his willingness to put his faith in youth, which tallies perfectly with United's traditions. So, which youngsters could benefit? Well, for starters, James Garner has shone on loan at Nottingham Forest and  Anthony Elanga has shown he is worthy of his place in the first team under Rangnick. There are plenty of other exciting talents within the Under-23s and youth-team squads that could fit in nicely with Ten Hag's tactics, but there is no disguising the fact that a major squad overhaul is necessary.

The Brazilian's future at the Etihad Stadium has come under scrutiny as of late, with reports linking him to a move away this summer. But Jesus delivered a timely reminder of his potency in front of goal as City brushed past Watford to cement their place at the league's summit. City's centre-forward needed just four minutes to open his account against the Hornets and doubled his and the club's tally shortly after as Pep Guardiola's men enjoyed total dominance. Rodri added a third after Hassane Kamara had dragged Watford within touching distance, and after the break Jesus completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, his first since leaving Palmeiras for City in 2017. For good measure the Brazilian made it 5-1 just minutes later by rounding off a fine team move from the hosts, making it a day to remember after struggling to impress throughout the 2021-22 season. ""Today was my day. We played very good today, we created a lot of chances, that's what we need to do,"" Jesus beamed to Sky Sports after the final whistle. ""We made passes and passes to create chances and try to score, and today we were very good on the finishing. ""It was my first hat-trick in the Premier League. I've tried. Sometimes I've scored two then I've hit a post, the defender has blocked [my shot], or the keeper has saved, but today was my day. ""I'm very happy with the three points. The team played so good and we deserved it."" Prior to Saturday's match Jesus had scored just three times in 23 Premier League outings this term, meaning that he more than doubled his tally at Watford's expense. The striker will hope this fine form continues in order to convince City he can lead their attack, and also strengthen his bid for inclusion in Brazil's World Cup squad at the end of the year. ""If there's one person who deserves the best in life for him, his family and his friends, it's Gabriel,"" Guardiola told the BBC. ""All of us at the club, when he has one of these situations, we're happy for him because he's so generous. It doesn't matter what position he's going to play, we know how he fights for his mates. He's fantastic."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Argentina international, who turned 22 on transfer deadline day, will remain on loan at River until July at least. Alvarez, who scored 20 goals in 35 league appearances for River last season as well as registering nine assists, was a target for a host of European clubs, including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. ‚ÄúJulian is a player we have monitored for some time,‚Äù City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said. ‚ÄúHe is capable of operating in a number of attacking roles, and we firmly believe he's one of the best young attacking players in South America. ‚ÄúI am so happy we have managed to bring him to Manchester City. I really believe we can provide him with the right conditions to fulfil his potential and become a top player.‚Äù City believe they are buying a player with a huge potential, with Alvarez considered one of Argentina‚Äôs most promising young stars. Manchester City have signed a striker!Julian Alvarez has joined Man City from River Plate üìù pic.twitter.com/uQmCh7GsFR He has already made six appearances for the national team in World Cup qualifiers and Copa America, and his playing style has drawn comparisons with City legend Sergio Aguero. He spent two years at Real Madrid's academy as a youngster but was unable to sign for them as he was under the age of 13. After returning to Argentina with River, he made his professional debut in 2018 and has 36 goals in 96 appearances and was understood to have a release clause in his contract worth ¬£17m ($23m). Mainly a striker, Alvarez can play anywhere across the front three and was used as a right winger in Argentina's 0-0 draw with Brazil in November. He is set to stay at River until the summer before meeting up with his new team-mates in pre-season. Alvarez could be ready to be part of Pep Guardiola's squad for the new campaign, but the club are set to keep an open mind over his future. There is the possibility that he could be sent out on loan to a sister club that is part of the City Football Group. City are likely to buy a main striker before the start of the new season, having missed out on Tottenham's Harry Kane as a replacement for Aguero, with Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland a potential target.

A medical trip to Munich prompted reports of a meeting with Barcelona boss Xavi, while liking an Instagram post about the Santiago Bernabeu sparked talk of a move to Real Madrid. Even eating homemade caramel while watching Manchester City increased speculation of a summer switch to the Etihad Stadium. It's certainly not easy being one of the most sought-after strikers on the market, then ‚Äì every tiny gesture comes under intense scrutiny. The interest is understandable, of course. It's not just because Haaland is one of the most prolific players on the planet. He's also going to become available for what looks like a bargain ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£62m/$81m), with the release clause in his Borussiad Dortmund contract set to come into play this summer ‚Äì even if agents fees and a signing-on bonus will make the final cost of acquiring Haaland far higher. Nearly every elite European club has joined the race for the 21-year-old's signature but City are emerging as the frontrunner. Madrid remain in the hunt, but they are also pursuing Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe, while Barcelona's delicate financial situation means that a move to Camp Nou remains unlikely, even if Blaugrana boss Xavi has not ruled it out just yet. Erling Haaland is FLYING ‚úàÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/MIHhKruol5 Opportunity knocks for City, then, and they have been pushing hard to make the Haaland transfer happen, with Pep Guardiola keen to add a striker with a killer instinct to his well-drilled team. Executives are believed to have met the Norwegian's representatives recently, although the club are remaining cautious, with high-profile transfers always complicated. A year ago, for example, they were confident that they could complete a deal for Harry Kane only for Tottenham to refuse to sell even though the England international wanted to move to Manchester. This time around, of course, the buyout clause means the selling club will not prove a stumbling block. The only challenge is convincing Haaland that the Etihad is the right destination for him. Although money is obviously relevant, personal preference is key, which is why the opportunity to work under a transformative coach like Guardiola is a major selling point. The City boss has a proven track record of improving already-great players, while the prospect of winning plenty of silverware should certainly appeal to Haaland, who has won just a single DFB-Pokal with Dortmund, who were also knocked out at the group stage of this season's Champions League. Guardiola's awkward relationship with Haaland's agent Mino Raiola is not thought to be a major issue, despite some harsh words exchanged in public between the pair in the past, particularly concerning Zlatan Ibrahimovic's time under the Catalan coach at Camp Nou. Meanwhile, Haaland's father Alfie spent three seasons at City during his playing days, and he and Yorkshire-born Erling often attended matches throughout his childhood. Manchester City have 'a deal in place' to sign Erling Haaland this summer, The Daily Mail reports üëÄ pic.twitter.com/2RXdXnnm7i With salary demands expected to be similar to some of City's highest earners, everything would appear to be in place for a move to go through. Signing Haaland would be a major coup and despite being very successful without a striker, the club are desperate for a natural predator to lead their attack. Last season's Premier League title success and run to the Champions League final was achieved largely without Sergio Aguero, who was plagued by injury and illness issues, and the Argentine's subsequent exit has hardly affected them at all this term. However, it was not Guardiola's intention to go through another season without being able to regularly call upon an orthodox centre forward. Even after the Kane move fell through, there was interest in Cristiano Ronaldo before his return to Manchester United but it came to nothing. Ultimately, City decided against buying an inferior striker for the sake of it, but it has left Guardiola having to come up with workarounds, even if they are proving highly effective. ‚ÄúThe club needs a striker, definitely. I don‚Äôt agree with [people] saying we play fantastically well without a striker just because we are winning,‚Äù Guardiola said ahead of last week's Manchester derby. ‚ÄúWhen we are not winning, you say we need a striker, that I‚Äôm naive. 'How do these guys play without a striker?' The sound of Erling Haaland hitting a volley üò±pic.twitter.com/ZijtADcDtd ""The club is going to try, it hasn‚Äôt happened yet but, in the end, we adapt and never complain. ‚ÄúWith a striker, we play in a different way but if you don‚Äôt have one, you have to adapt with the quality that we have. ""If you don‚Äôt have one you have to play in a completely different way to United, Southampton, Liverpool, because they play another philosophy. In England, we are a little bit like an exception in that.‚Äù City have already moved to ensure the situation won't happen again by signing Argentina international Julian Alvarez from River Plate in January, and he will join up with the squad in the summer, although he could yet go out on loan. However, after 80 goals in 79 appearances for Dortmund, Haaland remains the priority target and it is hoped that a decision will be made soon, with sources telling GOAL that his next move could be confirmed in the next few weeks. After the summer-long saga involving Kane ultimately ended in frustration, an early agreement for Haaland would be such a pleasing contrast. Even more importantly though, this slick City side with Haaland up front would be an even more intimidating force than they already are. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Gunners are hopeful of signing the Brazil international from Manchester City as they look to strengthen their attack ready for the 2022-23 season. Jesus is seeking a more important role that will see him earn more regular game time, with the 25-year-old having started 17 of the 24 matches in which he has featured in the English top-flight this season. Jesus' agent Paulo Pitombeira has met with Arsenal technical director Edu to discuss a possible deal. The discussions are still at the early stages and there has been no talk about salary figures so far. However, it has already been decided that the attacker's agent will be the intermediary in negotiations with City. Jesus' contract at the Etihad Stadium expires in 2023 and he is hoping for more regular playing time, which he believes he can get at Arsenal, but he will not attempt to force City to let him leave. Indeed, there is still the possibility that the former Palmeiras striker will ultimately agree to new terms at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's pursuit of Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland may also be a factor in him being open to making a summer switch, as the arrival of another star striker could result in Jesus falling further down the pecking order. Arsenal, meanwhile, are looking to bring in a forward, with Alexandre Lacazette set to leave on a free transfer in the summer. Eddie Nketiah has performed well in recent weeks although his long-term future remains unclear as his contract is also coming to an end in 2022. Jesus stayed quiet when asked about his future at the weekend, after he fired in four goals as City beat Watford 5-1 to ensure they remain top of the Premier League. ‚ÄúI think it's not time to think about this,‚Äù he told reporters when asked if he would stay and fight for his place. ‚ÄúI think you expect me to say this, but it's true.

Even boss Guardiola claimed to have been left in the dark - asked for his reaction to Fernandinho‚Äôs decision, Guardiola said: ‚ÄúOh. I didn't know. You give me the news. I didn't hear it. We will see what happens. I don't know what will happen. He is so important. I'll ask him. ‚ÄúAt the end of the season we talk, maybe it's because of his family. I would love it [if he stayed]. We will talk. ‚ÄúThe role he plays this season, I like the people who behave behind the scenes.

However, he may not be leaving just yet, as the veteran indicated he is still totally committed to Man City and is still open to talks with the club when the season ends. He wrote on social media after the press conference: ""I was 100 per cent honest and spontaneous in answering that question, but anyone who knows me also knows that my greatest honesty is with Man City and my duties as team captain.

The Ukrainian defender has watched on helplessly for the last few weeks as his homeland has been devastated by the Russian invasion. But football has been something of a salvation, with his time on the training ground giving him an opportunity to forget all about what is happening for a couple of hours at least. Manchester City and Pep Guardiola have been mindful of the strain and Zinchenko has been carefully protected since the incursion started. He has started just three games since the beginning of March - the FA Cup matches against Peterborough and Liverpool and the Champions League second leg against Sporting C.P. when the tie had been effectively decided in Portugal. But throughout, the 25-year-old has always made himself ready if Guardiola requires him and the City boss needs him now. ‚ÄúAbove all it's not been an easy period for Oleks,‚Äù he said after Saturday‚Äôs 5-1 victory over Watford. ‚ÄúWhat happened in his country with his loved ones - people forget about Ukraine, now we don't talk about it any more, there's no flags for Ukraine, Oleks is living it every day. ‚ÄúIt's been a tough period for him personally and it's another occasion where the way he plays, the quality, the assist, he's always focused, always concentrating and he's incredibly appreciated in the locker room.‚Äù A lovely moment with Zinchenko giving his shirt to a lad with a Ukraine flag.üá∫üá¶Some performance from Zinny again. Reliable as always. pic.twitter.com/KjFxtx3O3a The Premier League leaders are nursing an injury-hit defence and, with no room for slip-ups in their title race with Liverpool and a first Champions League trophy to win, everyone is needed to step up for the remainder of the season. Against Watford, Ruben Dias made his first start following a seven-week break after recovering from a hamstring injury, but that was the only good news. John Stones was left out of the squad all together with a muscle strain while Aymeric Laporte played just over an hour and was replaced by Nathan Ake to make sure both weren‚Äôt over-stretched ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs European semi-final first leg with Real Madrid. Guardiola already has enough problems for that fixture in the full-back positions, which is why Zinchenko‚Äôs performance against Watford was so encouraging. Joao Cancelo is already ruled out through suspension while Kyle Walker is a doubt - not playing a single minute since he limped off with an ankle injury against Atletico Madrid in the previous round. Zinchenko has always been a reliable alternative for Guardiola whenever he‚Äôs needed him and has never shied away from throwing in him for big games - starting last season‚Äôs Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain and the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea in the final. After playing five years under the Catalan coach, he knows exactly what‚Äôs required of him and while Watford were comfortably brushed aside, Zinchenko‚Äôs performance shows why he can be relied upon to step in effortlessly. There was his involvement in the opening goal - playing high up the pitch to latch onto Cancelo‚Äôs cross before drilling a pass into Gabriel Jesus for a simple tap-in. Then fewer than 10 minutes later, he sprinted to make a last-ditch tackle on Emmanuel Denis when the Watford forward should have scored. ""Absolutely exceptional,‚Äù Guardiola said of Zinchenko‚Äôs performance. ‚ÄúWe don't have many options. We don't have full-backs, I don‚Äôt know when Kyle will arrive, we will see, Joao is out and John will be difficult to get too. ‚ÄúDefence is about attitude. He's not the fastest but his focus is always there and that's the most important thing. People talk about and think about Kevin [De Bruyne], Jack [Grealish] and Phil Foden, but defending wisely is a talent. I like when my defenders enjoy defending.‚Äù What followed Zinchenko‚Äôs standout moments was a typically destructive team performance from City with every player making a big contribution although Jesus understandably took the biggest plaudits for his four goals. But Guardiola was able to rest many of his big names and still pull apart the Hornets with Bernardo Silva, Foden and Riyad Mahrez on the bench and De Bruyne withdrawn early. The final few weeks of the season will stretch City if they are to hold off Liverpool and land a second successive Champions League final. After a painful period, Zinchenko will be relieved to be distracted by football. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Haaland has been tipped to leave BVB and join City in the summer transfer window, with it reported that he has a record-breaking contract waiting from him at Etihad Stadium. The 21-year-old is still tied to a deal at Westfalenstadion until 2024, but Zorc concedes there is a possibility that the striker could leave the club at the end of the season. Haaland made his 21st Bundesliga appearance of the 2021-22 campaign on Saturday as Dortmund suffered a 3-1 loss to Bayern Munich at Allianz Arena. Bayern secured a 10th successive league title as a result, and Zorc fielded questions on Haaland's future after the final whistle. Pressed on whether the Norway international will head to the Premier League when the transfer window opens, the BVB chief told Sky Germany: ""That wouldn't come as a complete surprise to us."" Haaland has also been linked with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, but it has been reported that City are set to win the race for his signature by meeting his ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£63m/$81m) release clause. Dortmund's player licence director Sebastian Kehl has confirmed that the club are now waiting for Haaland to confirm his next move, as he said earlier this month: ""We have an exit clause that is known and there is a deadline. ""We want a decision as soon as possible."" City manager Pep Guardiola has so far refused to be drawn on the speculation, though, as he remains fully focused on ensuring that his team finish the season as strongly as possible. ""I have other things in my head rather than what is going to happen next season,"" he said when quizzed on Haaland last week. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

103,https://www.goal.com/en/news/levi-colwill-chelsea-teenage-loan-best-friend-musiala/7f4onjxnmpgd10bpns63mbeli,Levi Colwill: Chelsea's teenage loan star out to emulate best friend Musiala,"Ten years ago in Southampton, two eight-year-olds could be found playing football together, likely unable to imagine the paths they would each walk over the next decade. One of those youngsters was Jamal Musiala, the former Chelsea academy star who has gone onto break countless records for both Bayern Munich and Germany over the past 18 months. The other was Levi Colwill, who while not having broken through at the highest level as yet, is regarded as one of the top young defensive talents in English football. Colwill and Musiala moved from their homes on the south coast to Chelsea together, and the former is now spending his first year playing senior football on loan at Huddersfield Town. He has impressed in West Yorkshire, too, with the centre-back'searly-season performances earning him a maidencall-up to the England Under-21s squad for their gameagainst Kosovo on Tuesday. ""Yes, he was definitely one of my best friends,"" Colwill says of Musiala, with whom he shares a birthday, when speaking to Goal. ""We played for the same Sunday team [City Central FC],and we went up together for our Chelsea trial. We have just done everything together. ""We keep in touch still now and he is a good mate. It is amazing to see what he has achieved so far. It gives me goosebumps every time because I have been through everything he has been through, all that grind. ""To see what he has done now is inspiring and it shows me what is possible. If I keep working hard, I know I can achieve what he's done."" A post shared by Levi Samuels Colwill (@levicolwill) Though Colwill has not hit the same heights as Musiala as yet, there is no doubt that the teenager is ahead of the curve when it comes to his own development. Few 18-year-olds are trusted to start regularly at the heart of defences in the Championship, but Colwill has not missed a minute of the Terriers' first five league games of the campaign. It is not just in defence that he has made an impact, either, with his 94th-minute winner against Sheffield United on August 21 sending the travelling Huddersfield fans into rapture as Colwill celebrated his first professional goal. Clearly the trust that is being shown in him by manager Carlos Corberan - who previously worked under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds United -as well as having the chance to train under Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea before his move was agreed has played a big part in his positive start to the campaign. ""It (training under Tuchel)definitely gave me confidence,"" Colwill admits. ""It showed that Chelsea trust me, and being with the first team helped me ahead of coming to Huddersfield. ""Along with completing the loan move early in the window, it helped me to settle down and be comfortable quicker, which has shown on the pitch with me and my team-mates trusting each other so much. A post shared by Levi Samuels Colwill (@levicolwill) ""On the pitch, how we play and the intensity on the pitch is so different to academy football. It took me a few weeks to get used to it and I am still learning. ""The manager Carlos Corberan made a brave choice because, as an 18-year-old coming to the Championship at centre-half from Chelsea, it may have led to everyone asking questions, saying:'Is he just getting the chance because he came from a big club?' ""I needed to prove myself, but for him to trust me and bring me in, all I can say is thank you for trusting me. To have played so many games so far at the start of the season, I just thank him again."" From impersonating Steven Gerrard to impressing Thomas Tuchel üí™Levi Colwill is following in John Terry's footsteps üîµ pic.twitter.com/FVBBCYUIp3 On his winner at Bramall Lane, he adds: ""To have scored that goal was the best feeling I have ever had in my life. Everyone was celebrating, smiling and being so happy. I was just blessed."" Fans and team-mates have been delighted with his form on the pitch thus far, with central defensive partner Naby Sarr saying in a recent press conference that ""Colwill looks like he's been playing professionally for 10 years already, and he's only 18! ""He has everything to play for, he'll be a big player."" Comfortable in possession while strong both in the tackle and in the air, Colwill has it all to excel as a modern centre-back, while he has also earned the respect of his peers with his respectful character and work-rate. A post shared by Levi Samuels Colwill (@levicolwill) He has also showcased the leadership abilities that have seen some Chelsea fans lable him 'the new John Terry', though it is one of Terry's former England team-mates who he idolised during those days playing alongside Musiala in Southampton. ""Growing up, it was always Steven Gerrard who I loved seeing and how he used to lead,"" he reveals. ""I was amazed by him and I used to have his pictures up in my room. ""I always used to copy him before training or even in matches. I would dress in the same boots as him. ""I looked up to him.I wasn't a centralmidfielder, but I wanted his mentality."" Colwill is certainly well on the way to emulating Gerrard and Terry in representing the Three Lions somewhere down the line, though for now he remains focused on joining the group of Chelsea youngsters who have impressed at the John Smith's Stadium. Izzy Brown and Kasey Palmer both played key roles in Huddersfield's promotion to the Premier League in 2017, while Trevoh Chalobah also enjoyed a successful loan spell with the Terriers in 2019-20. Now it is Colwill's turn, and the early signs are promising as he aims to join his childhood friend at the top of the world game. ""If I keep working hard,"" he concludes, ""I know I can achieve what he's [Musiala's] done."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A Saudi Arabian-led consortium bought the club from Mike Ashley in October and promised to transform the Magpies into a side capable of competing with the Premier League and European elite. The appointment of Eddie Howe as manager and significant investment in players in January has already helped steer the club away from the relegation zone, but Shelvey says this is only the beginning. Shelvey is full of praise for the impact Howe has had since replacing Steve Bruce, with the former Bournemouth boss helping foster a strong team spirit. ‚ÄúI love life here, Newcastle is a great place to live. I usually only do three years then move on, but I‚Äôm settled,‚Äù he told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not sugar coat it, we needed to be taken over. Everyone at the club is pulling in the one direction - the camaraderie around the place is something I‚Äôve not seen before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a manager like this before. The first thing he did was hand everyone a sheet of paper to write down their wives' and kids' names, plus all our birthdays. He wants to know everything about everyone. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm his cup of tea and want to do everything to repay him. ""At some clubs you get the hump if you‚Äôre not playing. Players can toss training off at times, but at Newcastle the ones not playing are in training the next day while the others recover - they‚Äôre probably fitter than those who have played the previous day.‚Äù Asked about the club‚Äôs ambitions, the former Swansea and Liverpool midfielder said there was no limit to what they could achieve. ‚ÄúThis club will be massive. I‚Äôm talking PSG and Man City massive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take time, and it‚Äôs a building process, but Newcastle can go to the top. We just all need to be patient. All I want is to be a part of the process.‚Äù Shelvey has also expressed his determination to impress Howe enough to earn a new contract at St James‚Äô Park and play his part in the club's transformation. The 30-year-old, who joined Newcastle from Swansea in 2016, will enter the final 12 months of his contract next season. ‚ÄúI want to show the club that I warrant a couple more years,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd happily hold my hands up and say I don‚Äôt deserve to be here if I felt I can‚Äôt play at this top level any more, but I want to stay as long as I can and be part of it all.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Ouest-France has reported on a 28-year-old male being put behind bars after trying to pass himself off as a professional sportsman. That ruling was delivered by the criminal court of Lisieux (Calvados) on April 28, with a baffling episode being brought to a close by the relevant authorities. On December 14, 2021, the man in question attended a Coupe Gambardella match featuring PSG against a home-town side from Lisieux. Having decided to make that trip, an opportunity was snapped up to spend two nights in a Norman town hall. The problem was, the imposter did not want to pay and set about piecing together an elaborate scam. When checking out of the establishment in question, a man that reportedly already has 12 legal convictions to his name informed staff that he was a PSG player and that they should contact his agent in order for the bill to be settled. Once it became apparent that he had given a fake number and was not who he was making out to be, the hotel immediately filed a complaint for damages of ‚Ç¨227.40.

Ancelotti returned to Santiago Bernabeu for a second spell in charge of Madrid last summer, and has since managed to deliver the club's 35th La Liga title, along with the Supercopa de Espana. The Italian became the first manager to win a league title in all five of European major leagues after the Blancos' decisive 4-0 win over Espanyol on April 30, and is happy to continue in his current role for the foreseeable future. Ancelotti, who is under contract at the Bernabeu until 2024, intends to walk away from club management when his time at Madrid eventually ends. The 62-year-old hopes that won't be anytime soon, though, as he told Amazon Prime: ‚ÄúAfter Real, yes, I‚Äôll probably stop. ‚ÄúIf Real Madrid keep me here for ten years, I will coach for ten years. I would like to be with my grandchildren, go on vacation with my wife, there are so many things to do that I have left out and that I would like to do. ""Going to many places I‚Äôve never been. I‚Äôve never been to Australia. I have never been to Rio de Janeiro. Visit my sister more often. ‚ÄúUnfortunately you cannot do everything, and therefore the day I stop I will have all these things to do."" Milan, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also benefited from Ancelotti's talents on the touchline over the years, but he has yet to coach at international level. The Madrid boss would like to change that at some stage, and has expressed interest in working with Canada after their successful 2022 World Cup qualification bid. ‚ÄúYes, there would be a national team but now it‚Äôs premature,‚Äù Ancelotti added. ‚ÄúCertainly not for this World Cup. World Cup 2026, why not? Could be. Canada? I‚Äôd love to, sure. Canada did very well.‚Äù Ancelotti is currently preparing his side for a Champions League semi-final second leg clash with Manchester City at the Bernabeu, where they will aim to overturn a 4-3 aggregate deficit. Karim Benzema scored twice at the Etihad Stadium to give the Blancos a fighting chance of reaching the final, taking his overall tally in this season's competition to 14 goals from 10 appearances. The Frenchman was also integral to Madrid's La Liga triumph and has been touted as the leading contender for the next Ballon d'Or award, which Ancelotti believes he would fully deserve. ""Benzema has solved many games for us, he has been decisive this season,"" he said. ""At the moment he is one of the most famous players in the world and he maintains a great humility, and I believe that this is his strength. ‚ÄúHe is not winning only for Benzema, behind there is the strong structure of a strong club, and the quality of a high-level squad. He will win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

108,https://www.goal.com/en/news/premier-league-clubs-napoli-lazio-race-nice-wonderkid/blt7e0eece764ebe672,Premier League clubs join Napoli & Lazio in race for Nice wonderkid Flavius Daniliuc,"Nice youngster Flavius Daniliuc is attracting interest from a number of clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, GOAL has learned, with Premier League teams joining Napoli and Lazio in tracking the talented defender. Interest in the versatile 21-year-old is predicted to build as his stock continues to soar, with a scramble for his signature set to be sparked at some stage. For now he is continuing to further his development in France, but the expectation is that a player schooled in the academy systems at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich will step up onto a more prominent stage at some point in the not too distant future. An ambitious prospect, who turned out as a midfield playmaker while with Spanish giants Real, took the decision to walk away from Bayern in the summer of 2020. He had been captain of the U19 side in Bavaria and was held in high regard by the Bundesliga heavyweights. A call was made to head for France in order to find more first-team opportunities, with that decision being vindicated by a meteoric rise to prominence. His potential has now been noted by leading sides from across Europe, with the Vienna-born starlet seemingly ready to take on a new challenge as he is already fluent in English, Spanish, German and Romanian ‚Äì the native language of his parents ‚Äì while also learning French. Daniliuc has already skippered Austria‚Äôs U21 team and is seemingly set to push for senior international recognition when current Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick takes the reins of that squad over the summer. The likes of Napoli, Lazio and impressed parties from England are mulling over moves for Daniliuc as he has slotted seamlessly into the fold at Nice. He moved to France in order to work under World Cup winner Patrick Vieira and took in 25 appearances across his debut season ‚Äì breaking through 50 outings for the club in the current campaign. 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£th Nice appearance for Flavius Daniliuc üî¥‚ö´Ô∏èThe üá¶üáπ youth international will start at right back against @girondins #OGCNice #FCGBOGCN pic.twitter.com/TututsJvb9 Christophe Galtier, who led Lille to the Ligue 1 title in 2020-21, has continued to bring the best out of Daniliuc when using him on the right of a four-man defensive unit. A highly-rated performer is, however, just as comfortable when figuring as a centre-half and appears to be treading a similar path to fellow countryman David Alaba ‚Äì who left Bayern for Real Madrid in 2021. He has caught the eye when lining up against some of the very best in the business, keeping Neymar very quiet during a meeting with Paris Saint-Germain last season, and is currently readying himself for a shot at major silverware on May 7 when Nice will face Nantes in the Coupe de France final.

The 28-year-old Black Star picked up an injury during Arsenal‚Äôs 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park Stadium on April 4 and he has gone ahead to miss five Premier League matches.  He missed the 2-1 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium, the 1-0 away defeat against Southampton, the 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the 3-1 victory against Manchester United at home, and the 2-1 away win against West Ham United.  In his absence, Arsenal have relied on Egypt international Mohamed Elneny, who has started in the last three matches where the Gunners have registered wins. While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has ruled out the player for the rest of the season, it seems Partey is not giving up yet.  On Monday, Arsenal‚Äôs official Twitter handle posted a video of defender Gabriel Magalhaes diving to head home a cross from Gabriel Martinelli for the winning goal against West Ham at London Stadium and Partey responded. üáßüá∑ Gabi x Gabi üáßüá∑#WHUARS pic.twitter.com/pq690RT5Cn ‚ÄúTom X Tom [Takehiro Tomiyasu] soon.‚Äù  His statement was also in response to defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, who returned from injury in the game against West Ham, and an indication he will play with him before the season ends.  Ahead of Arsenal‚Äôs trip to face West Ham, Arteta admitted the absence of Partey was affecting his plans for the team.  ‚ÄúThe stats are there and they are unquestionable,‚Äù Arteta told Daily Mail. ‚ÄúThe win rate when Thomas is there is higher. It is something that is not good for us because in the last two seasons he has not been there as much as we want.  ‚ÄúWe need him to play in that role on his own, with the quality he brings and the experience that he brings. And the fact he brings things that are unique that we want.  ‚ÄúThen we can accommodate players in other positions that for them are more relevant and can determine games in the way that we can. ‚ÄúOtherwise we have to consider and improve with the players we have by using them in a different way, changing formation, and finding ways to compensate.‚Äù  Arsenal, who are sitting fourth on the 20-team table with 63 points from 34 matches, will face Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Chiesa initially joined Juve on loan in October 2020 as they agreed to pay Fiorentina a loan fee of ‚Ç¨10m for two seasons with the right of redemption in 2023. The final deal also included an obligation to buy if certain conditions were met, including achieving Champions League qualification for 2022-23, and the Bianconeri have now confirmed the 24-year-old has been bought outright. Juve have confirmed in an official press release that they will pay Chiesa's full transfer fee in instalments over the next three years, and could end up paying a total of ‚Ç¨50m (¬£42m/$53m) including add-ons if he hits certain individual targets. The talented attacker took to social media to express his delight after making his move to the Allianz Stadium permanent, writing on Instagram: ""To be continued..."" Chiesa has scored 18 goals in his first 61 appearances in all competitions for Juve, while also recording 14 assists. The Italy international has helped the club win two trophies so far, including last season's Coppa Italia title, but his 2021-22 campaign was cut short by injury. Chiesa suffered cruciate knee ligament damage in January and is not expected to return to action until much later in the year, with Juve yet to give a firm update on his recovery.

He is the man Jurgen Klopp highlighted as the potential danger for the second leg, and the Reds' coach was no doubt pleased to see that the Spain forward did not make the first game. ‚ÄúIt is not over, for the second game Gerard Moreno is back,‚Äù Klopp told reporters post-match on Merseyside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs half-time, no more, no less. ""How much work is left to do? The full work. Nothing has happened yet.‚Äù Without Moreno in the first leg, Villarreal‚Äôs plan did not work. They wanted to sit deep and shut down their opponents, to take a 0-0 draw or potentially more back to Spain. However, with Moreno absent, the ball did not stick upfront when they tried to clear it. The 30-year-old has a velvet touch that would have given his side some relief from Liverpool‚Äôs asphyxiating press. Pervis Estupinan‚Äôs own goal and Sadio Mane‚Äôs strike, in the space of two second-half minutes, helped Liverpool to a comfortable home victory. It was one which lured TalkSport broadcaster and former Chelsea player Jason Cundy into a broadside aimed at the Yellow Submarine, whom he accused of playing a ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù game. ""I don't know what I've just watched, but Villarreal are a disgrace,‚Äù he sneered. ‚ÄúThat is a disgrace. UEFA must be watching that and thinking, 'We are in big trouble'. ‚ÄúIf that's what's getting to the semi-final and facing English teams... Liverpool did not get out of second gear. It was shocking. Disgraceful. Liverpool are brilliant, but that was a disgrace to the Champions League.‚Äù Words which did not go unnoticed in Spain, with Villarreal determined to make Cundy eat them on Tuesday night. To do that, Moreno is vital. Born in Catalunya, the striker came through Villarreal‚Äôs youth teams and eventually made his first-team debut for the club in the 2014-15 campaign. The following season, he signed for Espanyol and spent three solid, if unspectacular seasons there. Villarreal brought him back in for ‚Ç¨20 million (¬£17.5m/$23.5m) and he began to show his quality on a regular basis. In the 2019-20 season, he netted 18 La Liga goals in 35 appearances, before scoring 23 in 33 the following year, along with seven goals in Europe to help take the Yellow Submarine to Europa League glory. Netting against Chelsea in the European Super Cup in August, he overtook Giuseppe Rossi to become Villarreal‚Äôs all-time top scorer, and currently has 95 goals for the club. Having made his international debut in 2019, he also helped Spain reach the Euro 2020 semi-finals last summer, and if his injury problems subside, should make Luis Enrique‚Äôs 2022 World Cup roster. Despite the immense quality he possesses, both to score and create goals, but also on the ball as a dribbler, Moreno has a low profile outside of Spain, without much hype or fanfare. That could change if he becomes the wrecking ball to Liverpool‚Äôs quadruple hopes, though. Juventus and Bayern Munich have, after all, already experienced how devastating Villarreal and Moreno can be. After a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain, the second leg against Juve was a tense 0-0 heading into the final 15 minutes. Enter Moreno. In the 78th minute he broke the deadlock from the penalty spot, with Pau Torres and Arnaut Danjuma adding further goals as Villarreal surged past the Italians. Moreno then impressed as his side beat Bayern 1-0 at home, and then set up Samu Chukwueze‚Äôs late goal at the Allianz Arena to send Villarreal through, against the odds. His absence at Anfield was a blow, although Villarreal coach Unai Emery is hopeful his team can turn the tables on Liverpool at home. ‚ÄúIn the semi-finals, the surprise factor that we could have had in the last 16 and quarter-finals had diluted,‚Äù admitted Emery after the first leg. ‚ÄúToday was a question of resisting defensively to have a chance (at home) and we did it in some ways because there it will be different, and there we will get more out of it. ‚ÄúWe know that we can compete with Liverpool but today we did not do it. In La Ceramica, we will try and make it so the game is completely different.‚Äù Moreno has 13 goals and six assists this season, down from the high standards established in previous years, but he has only made 26 appearances because of injury. When he does play, something happens. Moreno has formed a dynamic and exciting partnership with Danjuma, who often profits from clever interplay with the Spaniard. And with their talisman returning, Villarreal still believe they have a chance. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one good thing this team has it‚Äôs that it believes, and it believes the second leg will be different,‚Äù said goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. ‚ÄúWe have all the confidence in the world, if not we‚Äôd let them go through to the final right now. ""Tuesday will be a totally different game, I have no doubts this team will show up.‚Äù If Moreno does, and is in good enough condition, then Villarreal will too.

Greenwood has been out of the squad since January after the 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. With Greenwood out of the team, Man Utd have relied mostly on 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, with veteran Edinson Cavani and out-of-form Marcus Rashford struggling to provide the goals needed to ease the load on the Portuguese star's shoulders. ""We need at least two to give team more quality,"" Rangnick said. ""Modern strikers. ""Liverpool and Man City have five or six. Is Grealish a winger or striker? They are all strikers. ""We don‚Äôt have many. Mason Greenwood would have been but after West Ham he wasn't part of the squad."" Ronaldo has remained ever-present for the club, solidifying his spot as the team's top scorer with 24 goals in all competitions. Bruno Fernandes is second, having hit double-digits in the win over Brentford on Monday, with Greenwood still Man Utd's third-leading scorer this season despite being suspended for the second half of the season. Rashford sits fourth this season with five goals, level with winger Jadon Sancho. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Red Devils beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager, with the German set to step into a consultancy role at Old Trafford next term. The 63-year-old is confident that United can improve quickly as they near the end of a disappointing campaign that will see them miss out on silverware and a place in next season's Champions League. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. ""I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. ""If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic were two such players who will leave the club when their contracts expire at the end of the season. Mata, who has been with the club since 2014, put in a fine display in his final match at Old Trafford and the coach was pleased with the quality the pair added to the midfield. ""We played with Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic and that gave us some quality in midfield,"" Rangnick said. ""It was not too easy for Brentford to take the ball away from us. In the first half we played too many square and back passes but in general it was a good performance."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Speaking at a business conference in the United States, Infantino offered his remarks in response to a question about the safety standards and general conditions for workers in the country. Ithas been reportedthat thousands of migrant workers have died during the construction of stadiums in Qatar in recent years, while a recent report by Amnesty International called work practices in the country ""forced labour"". ""My parents emigrated from Italy to Switzerland. Not so far, but still. When you give work to someone, even in hard conditions, you give him dignity and pride,"" he said, according to the AP. Earlier this year, Infantino suggested that a biennial World Cup could stop African migrants from ""dying in the sea"" in a controversial speech at the Assembly of the Council of Europe. ‚ÄúWe need to find ways to include the whole world [in football] to give hope to Africans so that they don‚Äôt need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea,"" he said. ‚ÄúWe need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We will discuss it.‚Äù Infantino later apologised for those remarks, claiming his words were ""misinterpreted and taken out of context"". Several national teams have staged protests against the holding of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, citing alleged abuse of workers, although none that have qualified have said they would boycott the event. Last month, Dutch coach Louis van Gaal called it ""ridiculous"" that Qatar could host a World Cup. ‚ÄúWe are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there,"" he said. ""That's bullsh*t, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA."" England manager Gareth Southgate also weighed in, saying ""there are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas"" while questioning Qatar's stance on LGBTQ+ issues. In response, 2022 World Cup CEO Nasser Al Khater fired back: ""Somebody with a lot of influence, such as Southgate, somebody with a big audience that listens to what he says, ought to pick his words very carefully.""

Due to ongoing conflict has resulted in Russian representatives being forced out of competition yet again.

It would be a surprise if a commanding centre-half from Manchester United and Everton‚Äôs first-choice goalkeeper are the men to lose their spots with the Three Lions. Maguire became the most expensive defender on the planet when making an ¬£80 million ($98m) move to Old Trafford over the summer, while Pickford is Britain‚Äôs costliest shot-stopper. Their quality remains without question, even during the struggle for domestic and international form that they are both enduring. With that in mind, the likes of Tottenham full-back Danny Rose and Toffees centre-back Michael Keane could be in greater danger of slipping down the pecking order. Shearer feels changes are required on the back of a disappointing Euro 2020 qualifying defeat to the Czech Republic, with the ex-England striker telling The Sun ahead of a meeting with Bulgaria: ‚ÄúYou could make a case for Friday‚Äôs team being a surpriseas four of the back five are going through a tough spell. ‚ÄúJordan Pickford and Michael Keane with Everton, Harry Maguire with Manchester United and Danny Rose with Tottenham. ‚ÄúYou look at their form and their club results and they weren‚Äôt exactly bouncing going into the international break. ‚ÄúPerhaps you would like to think they could go in fresh and look at it as an opportunity but clearly they didn‚Äôt do that. ‚ÄúI fully expect changes at the back and maybe even in the formation. ‚ÄúGareth started with a 4-2-3-1 but changed it soon enough when it clearly wasn‚Äôt working. But I think he‚Äôs still searching for what he feels is the right system and personnel to fill it.‚Äù A 2-1 reversal against the Czechs has seen an England team which reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Nations League face uncomfortable questions for the first time in a while. Shearer says that is to be expected, but believes positivity can be returned to the ranks. A man with 30 goals for the Three Lions to his name, added: ‚ÄúNo one has labelled the new England team ‚Äògreat‚Äô but we are certainly better than we showed on Friday. ‚ÄúThankfully, they have the chance to put it right straight away in Bulgaria and secure qualification for the Euros. ‚ÄúWhen you lose ‚Äî and play that badly ‚Äî you want a game immediately after and they‚Äôve got that. ‚ÄúEveryone is allowed a below-par performance from time to time but it‚Äôs how you react. ‚ÄúOf course Friday‚Äôs performance is going to be criticised and scrutinised but you‚Äôre playing for England, you should expect that. ‚ÄúAnd what they should also expect is more changes from Southgate. When you‚Äôve played like that, barely any of the team can argue if they are dropped for the next match.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The shot stopper made headlines again for a blunder that allowed Crystal Palace to equalise against Everton in Saturday's Premier League match. The Toffees went on to win 3-1, but Pickford admitted his disappointment after the game, describing the error as ""disgusting"". Pickford, 25, has been criticised for high-profile mistakes since he impressed at the last World Cup with England. And the shot stopper says it feels like fans and the media hate Three Lions players, calling out Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville for some of his comments. ""I think the press and everybody, the punters -look at Gary Neville - they just want to come for England players,"" he said. ""Everyone gets stick. That‚Äôs part of being an England player. You have to live with it, you‚Äôve got to learn. ""You just keep it away from your head as the only person who can sort things out is yourself, on the pitch and in training.

Pickford let a tame effort from Christian Benteke slip past him in the weekend clash, but recovered to pull off an impressive save to stop Palace from pulling level again later in the second half. And he is confident he will shake off the disappointment to get back on form. ""I think it just shows my mental character,"" he added. ""People probably doubt me week in, week out.

It could be that he heads back to Old Trafford this summer and seeks to oust theSpanish shot-stopper from the most demanding of roles. Another season-long stint at Bramall Lane will come to a close at the end of the 2019-20 campaign. Henderson has impressed again during a second spell with the Blades, having helped them to promotion into the Premier League last term. He has stated on a regular basis that his ambition is to nail down a starting berth with his parent club. That remains the 22-year-old‚Äôs ultimate target, although it remains to be seen when an opportunity for him to take the gloves in Manchester will present itself. Henderson told the Kelly & Wrighty Show: ‚ÄúThe big dream is to play for Manchester United one day. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had that dream throughout my life so until that‚Äôs accomplished I‚Äôll never think I‚Äôve made it. ‚ÄúEven if I play for them once I won‚Äôt think I‚Äôve made it.

He added: ‚Äú[I want to] get to 40 points firstand foremost to stay up [withSheffield United]. ‚ÄúIf we do that, win as many games as possible towards the end of the season and then going into the summer fight for the No.1 spot as much as I can. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be doing and hopefully I can make it happen.‚Äù The Blades have been a surprise package since rejoining English football‚Äôs elite. Chris Wilder, who has been earning plenty of plaudits, has his side sat sixth in the table with 36 points to their name. A relegation dogfight has been avoided by Henderson and Co., with it possible that a bid for European qualification could still be maintained. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

122,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-best-youth-teams-busby-babes/1t9ns8612cn401xzg7wqfn4mzj,'We knew we could beat any team' - How Chelsea built the best youth teams since the Busby Babes,"The Busby Babes and the Class of '92 are heralded as the two great youth sides of post-war English football. Twice in the space of 40 years Manchester United were able to bring together a group of players within their academystructures that would have the potential to dominate both domestically and abroad for over a decade. Between 1953-57, the likes of Sir Bobby Charlton and Duncan Edwards helped United win the FA Youth Cup on five successive occasions. Thirty-five years on from the fifth of those triumphs, players such as David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Nicky Buttemerged to help beat Crystal Palace in the final of the same competitionbefore becoming mainstays of Sir Alex Ferguson's all-conquering side. The Red Devils have continued to be successful in the Youth Cup, winning it in 1995, 2003 and 2011, but over the past 10 years one club have stood above all others in making success within the competition a habit. Since 2010, Chelsea have reached eight of the 10 FA Youth Cupfinals, winning seven of them whilematching the record of the Busby Babes in lifting the trophy on five successive occasions between 2014 and 2018. A ninth triumph in 11 years was not beyond the realms of possibility this season either, with the Blues having qualified for the semi-finals before Covid-19 brought a halt to football around the world. The roll of honour of those who have tasted success in the competition for Chelsea during the past decade is enviable. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Reece James, Andreas Christensen, Fikayo Tomori, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Billy Gilmour are all now part of the first-team squad in west London. Jeremie Boga, Nathan Ake, Ola Aina and Bertrand Traore have gone onto become regular starters for clubs in Europe's top five leagues. Marcin Bulka and Jonathan Panzo were snapped up by Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco respectively and have been backed to enjoy successful careers at the top level. Even those who are not household names, such as Tariq Lamptey at Brighton and Isaac Christie-Davies at Liverpool,are on the path towards potential Premier League opportunities at some stage. Chelsea's 3-2 win over Norwich City in August provided a neat bow on the 10-year project that has been undertaken at Chelsea. Goals from homegrown talents Mount and Abraham secured a Premier League victory for a Blues team managed by club legend Frank Lampard. The former midfielder has handed out eight first-team debuts to academy graduates this season in a change of policy that is helping highlight all the good work that has been undertaken at Cobham in recent times.  ""We had a couple of pints with Neil Bath [to celebrate],"" Lampard revealed following the game at Carrow Road as he hailed the club's head of youth development. Bath works alongside Jim Fraser as the figureheads of the club's academy, with Fraser taking the lead on talent identification and signing youngsters to the club. Below them, a swathe of coaches, analysts, sports scientists, psychologists, teachers and scouts work together to help ensure success. ""You go back through the decade and you see unrivalled and incredible success in the academy,"" Adi Viveash, who coached the club's Under-18s to two FA Youth Cup titles, toldGoal. ""Winning is incredible for a player's development. Especially at Chelsea because if you get in the team, you have to win."" Having won the Youth Cup in both 2010 and 2012 - the second of which came with Viveash as manager -Chelsea again reached the final in 2013, only to suffer a shock defeatto Norwich City. ""We went to Stamford Bridge and we won 4-2 on aggregate,"" Norwich academy graduate and now-Cardiff City wingerJosh Murphy told Goal. ""That doesn‚Äôt often happen in the Youth Cup. You see Chelsea won five times in a row. That just shows how good it was. It put many of my team on the map."" That loss to the Canaries lit a fire in Chelsea's academy, and after winning the trophy back with victory over Fulham in 2014, it would not be wrestled from their grip again until Liverpool's triumph in 2019. After a 3-2 defeat at Craven Cottage in the first leg six years ago, the Blues found themselves 3-2 down at half-time back at Stamford Bridge and staring a second successive final defeat in the face. But a goal from substitute Isak Ssewankambo in the 77th minute brought them back level on the night before two goals in the final nine minutes from Dominic Solanke secured a dramatic victory in front of over 13,000 fans. ""You had the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Andreas Christensen, Charly Musonda, Izzy Brown and Jeremie Boga in that team,"" midfielder Ruben Sammut, who now plays for Sunderland,recalled when speaking to Goal. ""It was probably the best academy team we have had on paper. ""It was amazing to be able to train and play with those players. I am proud to say I grew up with that calibre of player. That was great. These are experiences I will take where I go now. I won the Youth League and Youth Cup and I am very proud of it."" From there Manchester City were beaten finalists on three successive occasions, with the likes of Jadon Sancho, Phil Foden, Kelechi Iheanacho and Brahim Diazamong those forced to go home with runners-up medals. Abraham and Tomori played in both the 2015 and 2016 finals, with Mount also involved in the latter before going onto win it again a year later alongside the likes of Hudson-Odoi and James. ""My youth career just gave me confidence,"" Abraham told Goal. ""Knowing I could score goals ‚Äì it comes naturally. I just put it into every game I play, take chances and score goals. It helped give me that confidence I show now."" As well as success domestically, the Blues were also beginning to become a dominant force on the continent, winning the UEFA Youth League in both 2015 and 2016, with victoriesover Shakhtar Donetsk and Roma in the respective finals. It was the Youth Cup, though, that remained the prize most in the squad wanted to win.   ""The FA Youth Cup was always the big one for us and it is something you want to keep hold of,"" striker Ike Ugbo, who won the competition in2016 before scoring in bothlegs of the 2017 final, toldGoal. ""I think we always worked hard to achieve it. We were able to do that and keep the trophies."" Goalkeeper Nathan Baxter, who played alongside Ugbo in the 2016 triumph, agreed, tellingGoal: ""The FA Youth Cup matters.It helped me to play senior football at the age that I did because I had played pressured games in the youth team. Itmeantwhen I was on loan at every other team I went to, I could handle it."" Midfielder Mukhtar Ali, a winner in2015 and 2016, also recalls the internal pressure that came with continued success, with each playerkeen not to ensure they were not part ofthe side that failed to defend the trophy. ""We had seen all the older groups going for it and winning it,""  Ali told Goal. ""It was a thing from being young where we had a lot of eyes on us as a group because we had achieved a lot of things before that. So it was a little bit of pressure but a nice pressure. ""We knew we could beat any team. The second game in that run [in 2016] was Manchester United and we beat them 5-1. We just thought from there that we can definitely win it."" The crowning glory for the Chelsea academy came in 2018 when, under the tutelage of Jody Morris and Joe Edwards, the Blues' U18s claimed a domestic quadruple by winning the Premier League southern section, the national Premier League title, the Premier League Cup and the FA Youth Cup. The 7-1 aggregate win over Arsenal in the final of the latter saw Hudson-Odoi and James claim their second Youth Cup winners' medals while Gilmour started both games in midfield.   ""I won four trophies in one season. That was my best memory under Jody Morris,"" Clinton Mola, who came on as a substitute in the second leg at the Emirates Stadium, told Goal. ""The players that are playing with the Chelsea team that I played with likeHudson-Odoi,James andGilmour 100 per centdeserve to be there."" Many who have contributed to Chelsea's success at youth level over the past decade have been met with a roadblock when it comes to making the leap into the senior ranks. Despite the conveyor belt of silverware, morale waslow inside the club's academy after a succession of Lampard's predecessors struggled to find roles for the club's talented young players within their squads. The club's apparent lack of faith in their youth set-up was illustrated most starkly during the summer of 2017. Nathaniel Chalobah, who played and scored in the 2012 Youth Cup triumph and had been tipped as a future England midfielder from an early age, was sold to Watford for just ¬£5 million ($6.5m). In his place arrived Danny Drinkwater from Leicester City in a deal worth ¬£35m ($45m). Fortunately for those within the academy, attitudes have changed under Lampard, withMount arguably the player to have made the biggest impactthis season. The midfielder has gone from relative unknown to an England international in the space of two years working under the Blues boss at both Derby County and Chelsea. The 21-year-old used to travel 50 miles from his home in Portsmouth to train with Chelsea's youth sides despite having offers from more local teams, and opting for west London is a decision he does not regret,tellingGoal:""It was a tough decision [to join Chelsea] because you have to travel a lot but the best decision because the competition with the boys is so much higher.   ""I have to thank all the coaches in the academy from the beginning. Bob Osborne, Frank O'Brien, Micky Bill, Joe Edwards, Jody Morris, Adi Viveash. All the coaches in the academy and I think I missed a few, but they all give you different things, and you learn different things off them."" The latest to make the grade, meanwhile, is Scottish midfielder Gilmour. ""It is exciting,""  Gilmour told Goal.""The experience I am gaining is massive. When I came, it was Jody Morris in the Under-18s and Joe Edwards in the Under-23s, so when you go around there you can feel a bit more relaxed because you know Joe and Jody. Then whenLampard comes in,it is really good."" Viveash - the man who started the club's almost unprecedented run of Youth Cup victories - could not be happier, saying: ""My argument has always been with the coaches that there have been a lot of players good enough for many years. I am over the moon that they have Frank Lampard as manager."" While Lampard remains in charge of the first team, Chelsea's academy is the place to be in English football. Their run of successive Youth Cup triumphs may be over, but Chelsea can now boast of having aset-up that possesses both a track record of sustained success at youth level and a clear pathway into the senior ranks. Few, if any, can offer the same package. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Three Lions are readying themselves for friendly outings against Switzerland at Wembley on March 26 and a clash with Ivory Coast three days later. There are plenty of familiar names within Southgate‚Äôs ranks, with all of those included eager to impress as the countdown to World Cup 2022 continues. Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope, Aaron Ramsdale Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Conor Coady, Marc Guehi, Reece James, Harry Maguire, Tyrone Mings, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Ben White Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Declan Rice, James Ward-Prowse Forwards: Tammy Abraham, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Raheem Sterling Both Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho miss out on the England squad for friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø pic.twitter.com/HOBvNHYf8p Chelsea defender Reece James is included by Southgate despite only recently returning from a long-term injury, while Arsenal playmaker Emile Smith Rowe gets the nod once again as he battles for regular starting berths with the Gunners. His club colleague, Ben White, makes the cut among the defensive ranks but there is no place in that group for experienced Manchester City right-back Kyle Walker. Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse is recalled and Tammy Abraham‚Äôs fine form at Roma is recognised. Harry Maguire is called upon despite facing questions of his contribution at Manchester United, while Ben Chilwell and Kieran Trippier ‚Äì of Chelsea and Newcastle respectively ‚Äì are absent through injury. On his decision to not select Sancho, Southgate said: ""Because the other attacking players in the squad are slightly ahead of him at the moment. You can see the names ‚Äì Foden, Sterling, Saka, Smith-Rowe, Grealish. If you look at the seasons they've had... ""Jadon, over the last few weeks his performances have without doubt improved at Manchester United but it's an area of the field where we've got really big competition for places and at the moment we've got those guys slightly ahead."" Regarding Rashford's non-selection, Southgate added: ""He's in the same position as everybody else. Whether they're in the squad or not in the squad, they've all got to play well over the end of this season and particularly the beginning of next season. ""It's a difficult time for him, he's clearly not at his best. We know a lot about Marcus anyway and what he can bring to us. And hopefully he rediscovers that form that we know he's capable of.""

124,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-happened-rashford-man-utd-slump-symptom-no-identity/blt9d5ab900bee82eb4,What's happened to Rashford? Man Utd's star's slump a symptom of a club with no identity,"It is little wonder reports emerged last week that Marcus Rashford is seriously considering his future at Manchester United. Ralf Rangnick clearly has not taken to the England forward since arriving at Old Trafford in November, but the relationship between the two reached a new nadir in the Manchester derby, as Rashford was left on the bench ‚Äì relegated below Jesse Lingard in the pecking order and unable to get minutes even with Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani out injured. If Rashford's place in the starting line up on Saturday against Tottenham was an opportunity to reset, he hardly seized it with both hands. The 24-year-old touched the ball just 30 times, before being substituted in the 67th minute without a single shot, dribble, or key pass to his name. Rashford has arguably been in poor form for a year now, his trademark explosivity ‚Äì the instinctive, decisive movements in the final third ‚Äì disappearing as low confidence sees his energy drain away. He is now a hesitant player who too often drifts through matches, either playing the simple ball or trying too hard to get back into his manager‚Äôs good books. The confusion surrounding Rangnick‚Äôs role at the club, and indeed Rashford‚Äôs, cannot be helping. ‚ÄúWith Marcus Rashford, we have another player who I will insist and continuously be behind him and with him, to develop him,‚Äù Rangnick said in the build-up to the Man City game. ‚ÄúI will put all my energy into that, to help him to take the same pathway that other players did in the last three months.‚Äù Following up on these comments by shunning Rashford altogether can only have created more distrust in what is already a complicated dressing room. It is telling that some reports cite a source close to Rashford claiming the forward wants more clarity regarding the future of the club. To an extent, this is a message being sent to the United hierarchy; a call for more certainty over the club‚Äôs future and, perhaps, a not-so-subtle warning that Rangnick should not be the man in charge next season. Regardless of what these reports really means, there is every reason to be sympathetic with Rashford, who missed the first two months of the season through injury and ‚Äì having struggled, like so many others, to understand the Rangnick methodology ‚Äì has been in and out of the team ever since. Tactically, the main reason for Rashford‚Äôs steady decline is the lack of focus, clarity, and specialisation that has been paid to the player. This begins with the fact Rashford is yet to pin down a position of his own. In the first three months of 2022 alone he has played in six different positions, and four different formations. Rashford has become a jack of all trades and a master of none, which can only really be put down to the poor quality of coaching he has received in the past few years. We already know that little coaching took place during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's three-year reign. According to one report, Rashford, after spending a long time not knowing what the manager wanted from him, plucked up the courage to confront Solskjaer, only to be told to stop moaning. Before that, Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal asked Rashford to play in completely different ways, an issue that has plagued every senior United player who has survived this long. A lack of joined-up thinking in the boardroom means lurching from one tactical style to another, which for each individual means a new set of skills to learn or reprioritise. Most young players with Rashford‚Äôs talent would have been sculpted and honed in their early twenties; given detailed coaching to sharpen blunt aspects of their game and steady advice to nurture those aspects that come naturally. Instead, as a symbol of everything else at the club, Rashford was allowed to drift and drift. As for the latest man in the dugout, Rangnick‚Äôs desire for hard pressing and quick vertical football in the final third has seen Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga preferred. These two are sharper in their acceleration than Rashford, and tend to make quicker decisions, while Ronaldo has obviously kept Rashford out of the centre-forward position. In theory, Rashford ‚Äì at his best, at least ‚Äì should work in a Germanic system like Rangnick‚Äôs, and it should be noted that he might simply need a consistent run in the team in a single position. After all, his underlying numbers are not bad. According to FBRef, Rashford is hitting 0.58 goals and assists per 90, exactly in line with his career average. In fact, virtually across the board ‚Äì from defensive to creative stats ‚Äì Rashford is only very marginally down on his career averages. Trawling through the data, the only real exceptions are the ‚Äòprogressive distance‚Äô of his passing, down from 91.7 yards to 65.4 yards per 90, and his pass completion, down from 75.6% to 68.2%. Here, we are seeing the result of this increased hesitancy, as passes become shorter, more sideways, and less accurate. It paints a picture of a player withdrawing into himself as game-time diminishes. A solution is unlikely to be found this year, but with a new appointment in the summer there is the chance for a reset and an arm-around-the-shoulder approach ‚Äì something Rashford, a bonafide national treasure for his off-field activities, at the very least deserves. Trying to get the best out of Rashford is another reason for United to hire Mauricio Pochettino, who was reportedly interested in signing Rashford while Tottenham manager. Pochettino‚Äôs detailed coaching methods, coupled with his desire to play fast attacking football and his history of strong relationships with players, makes him a good fit for Rashford. Rashford needs a coach who believes in him, who knows what he wants from the player and gives him a consistent run in one position. He could also do with a manager who will actually coach him, bringing out those clinical instincts we saw from the United academy graduate when he first broke into the team. That player still exists, but like everyone else at Old Trafford over the last few years, Rashford has slowly become lost. It would be Manchester United‚Äôs failure, and a damning indictment of how the club has been run, if Rashford were to leave the club. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Three Lions saw their bid to end a 55-year wait for major international silverware come to an agonising and all-too-familiar close on Sunday when going down 3-2 on spot-kicks to Italy after a 1-1 draw at Wembley Stadium. Questions have been asked of how Gareth Southgate settled on his five takers, while racist abuse has been aimed in the direction of those who missed,but Bellingham is among those to have talked up the actions of a select few that stepped up under immense pressure. Bellingham, who made three appearances at Euro 2020,posted on Twitter: ""We win together and we lose together. ""So proud to have teammates with such top character. ""Takes huge b*llocks just to volunteer. ""As for the racism, hurtful but not surprising. Will never get bored of saying that more needs to be done. Educate and control the platforms!""

It will, understandably, take time for the disappointment of missing out after coming so close to fade for those that have starred across a memorable summer. There is, however, still plenty of potential for England to unlock and the hope is that another shot at glory will be taken in at the 2022 World Cup. Last night hurts. It‚Äôll hurt for a long time.

126,https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-or-ghana-whats-next-for-hudson-odoi-after-latest/3q5sbni3ovaw12wvr7eijp8kj,England or Ghana - What's next for Hudson-Odoi after latest Southgate snub?,"Callum Hudson-Odoi is enjoying somewhat of a resurgence at Chelsea and the attention will duly turn to where his international future lies. There remains a question mark over whether or not the winger can restart his England career or whether the Three Lions will lose him altogether. Despite having represented England‚Äôs seniors on three occasions ‚Äì and all three caps coming in competitive matches ‚Äì Hudson Odoi remains eligible for Ghana. A FIFAeligibility rule change in September 2020 means  players who have played no more than three senior competitive matches before the age of 21 are permitted to switch international allegiance  provided none of those matches came in a continental finals tournament or a World Cup. Gareth Southgate didn't call up the winger to his 25-man squad ahead of the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and San Marino in the November international break. The 20-year-old has justifiably been left out of recent England squads due to his fringe status under Thomas Tuchel at club level,  but there was a case to pick him this time around. Raheem Sterling has often found himself on the bench for his club but retains his place based on pastinternational performances. Meanwhile, Marcus Rashford has had just three starts this season since his return from a shoulder injury. Hudson-Odoi, in that timeframe, has started the last four Chelsea games with his side top of the Premier League, in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup and in a good position in their Champions League group. Southgate on Thursday explained his omission of Hudson-Odoi,  who has declined to participate with the under-21s,  while also name-checking the likes of Conor Gallagher, Marc Guehi, Emile Smith Rowe, Tino Livramento and Fikayo Tomori.  ""I had a good chat with Callum before last month‚Äôs get-together because it is difficult if you are a young player, you‚Äôve been with the senior team, he went back to play with the under-21s in the last cycle and then to go again in a second cycle, I can understand is a difficult challenge,"" when asked by  Goal. ""So, we would still like him to do that but he wants to back himself with his Chelsea form to get back into the seniors and I totally respect that. So, by not being in the under-21s he misses a bit of an opportunity to impress us and come across if we need players for training and those sorts of things. ""He has had a couple of good matches for Chelsea. I know Thomas is guarded about how much he goes with praise on that but it is good to see him back playing and playing more regularly at first-team level and he knows the challenge that‚Äôs ahead. ""But he knows also that we are constantly watching him and he is young and talented enough to mount a serious challenge as we move forward."" A post shared by Callum Hudson-Odoi (@calteck10) Southgate‚Äôs decision leaves some hope for Ghana, who are trying to poach Hudson-Odoi before it is too late. If he plays one more time for England, then Hudson-Odoi will be cap-tied but he stirred up excitement within his father's home nation by travelling there for his summer holiday. Although it is understood by  Goal  that he is currently very much committed to England, his head could be turned closer to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The winger's aim is to compete at the next major international tournament. Southgate's positive relationship with Hudson-Odoi buys time for England, with the manager having allowed Chelsea's No.20 to become the youngest-ever player in a competitive match for England on his debut. What works against Hudson-Odoi's chances of being selected however is his current reluctance to play with Lee Carsley's U21s. Having competed at the European Championship at that level last season, Hudson-Odoi now feels it isn‚Äôt doing much for his development to play age-group football. Minus that senior call-up, his focus is on impressing Tuchel who has not made it easy for his homegrown starlet.  Recent injuries and illnesses for Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount have re-opened the door to Hudson-Odoi at Chelsea. Having ""done a job for the team"",as Tuchel put it after playing him at wing-back,  he has since got a goal and two assists in his favoured left-wing role. Hudson-Odoi had lost a lot of confidence being out of the team and having torn his Achilles tendon, and  was at the centre of a distracting super-club tug-of-war between the Blues and Bayern Munich. But now he is back to taking people on, creating chances and building his match rhythm. Whether for club or country, Hudson-Odoi just wants to realise the potential he showed when he broke through at just 17. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

127,https://www.goal.com/en/news/king-kai-crowns-chelsea-world-champions-late-havertz-penalty/blt9a1721c93901123a,King Kai crowns Chelsea world champions as Havertz's late penalty ends Palmeiras' resistance,"Chelsea 2-1 Palmeiras (AET): Match Statistics Once again, Kai Havertz was the match-winner. On Saturday evening in Abu Dhabi, the man who scored the only goal in last May's Champions League final stepped up to take one of the most important penalties in his club's history, and cooly stroked the ball past Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton to claim the Club World Cup for the Blues. No wonder they call him King Kai. In less than a year, he's crowned Chelsea champions of both Europe and the world. Chelsea fans have long sung that they've won it all. But they hadn't until Havert's extra-time spot-kick at the 40,000 seater Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium. Finally, owner Roman Abramovich, who was in attendance, has got his hands on the Club World Cup trophy, making it 20 titles in 19 years of the Russian's rule. Chelsea will receive an estimated ¬£4m ($5m) for winning the FIFA-organised tournament but that will obviously mean little to a man that has spent over ¬£1 billion ($1.35bn) on players turning the Blues into world-beaters. CHELSEA ARE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD üíô pic.twitter.com/ePdPZ564PT Indeed, as well as Havertz, another big signing also played a pivotal role, with Romelu Lukaku opening the scoring early in the second half with his 10th goal of the season. However, Thiago Silva handled the ball in his own box in the 61st minute, allowing Raphael Veiga to level matters from 12 yards out. The winner came from another handball, as Chelsea's pressure finally told. By the time Havertz scored with three minutes of extra time remaining, manager Thomas Tuchel was on his third formation and had already used all five substitutes. His changes worked, just, meaning the German ‚Äì who arrived just before the game after recovering from Covid-19 ‚Äì has now won three cups since succeeding Frank Lampard at the helm just over a year ago. This latest triumph was as difficult as the final scoreline suggested, though. Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira brought up the massive difference in budgets before the game, telling reporters, ""[Chelsea] are a team that that has spent ¬£545m ($740m) to be in this competition. Palmeiras spent ¬£29m ($39m)."" However, he added, ""But I believe ‚Äì and my players believe."" Their fans clearly did, too. Chelsea's players had to deal an intense atmosphere but they proved their mettle in a deserved victory. The moment Chelsea won #ClubWC #CFC pic.twitter.com/5lpbLRDwqR N'Golo Kante can now boast of being a world champion for club and country, while Cesar Azpilicueta became the first Chelsea player to complete a clean sweep of honours. Antonio Rudiger was arguably man of the match, though, showing why the Blues are now willing to make him the highest-paid defender in the club's history. Tuchel and his players will now be targeting more silverware, with Chelsea set to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final later this month. The Blues' Premier League title challenge may have faltered over Christmas, but there's a belief behind the scenes that Tuchel can break the boom-and-bust cycle at Stamford Bridge, given his success and excellent working relationship with those behind the scenes. For example, he didn't complain when Chelsea refuse to sign another wing-back on a permanent transfer in January, despite Ben Chilwell being out for the rest of the season. Tuchel is a good fit for Chelsea. He understands how things work at the club and he has every chance of staying longer than the 18 months Chelsea managers average under Abramovich. Indeed, he's now provided his boss with the one trophy he was missing and there is an undeniable feeling that there are even more titles to come for Tuchel and his young side.

The 20-year-old Blues starlet picked up a rare starting appearance under the German during this weekend's 7-0 Premier League rout against Norwich, nabbing himself a first-half finish in the process. The England international, who has often been fielded as a right wingbackunder Tuchel, played a more advanced role against the Canaries.The managerhas admitted that the positional change is to help challenge him. ""I think he needs that,"" Tuchelstated.""For me, he needs that. These guys who are so full of quality hear sometimes a little bit too often how good they are. ""But you need to prove it, to show it and for the offensive guys it is easy ‚Äì just reach statistics and deliver assists and goals and this is what he does and what he needs to show. ""We are aware that we are maybe a bit unfair when we ask him to play too often as a right wingback where he cannot show his full potential. ""We are aware of that so it‚Äôs always a mix and at the moment we think we have found a way to push him to the limits and this can change from week to week."" With injuries to Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, the Cobham graduate - who has spent his entire careerat Stamford Bridge - took the most of the opportunity presented to shine up front. His early finish helped keep the ball rolling against Daniel Farke's struggling Canaries, and further enshrined Chelsea's place atop the summit of the Premier League as they look to back up last term's Champions League success. Hudson-Odoi could yet force his way back into a regular role, given the lengthof the spell on the sidelines several other players are facing. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Hudson-Odoi has made just two appearances in the Premier League this season, but his hopes of returning to the starting XI have been boosted by injuries in the Chelsea attack. Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Christian Pulisic have all been ruled out, meaning Hudson-Odoi could get the chance to build on his substitute appearance against Malmo in the Champions League this week. But Tuchel has denied that the Blues' upcoming run of fixtures could be the turning point for the 20-year-old winger. ""The only person who can decide this and answer this question is Callum,"" Tuchel told reporters. ""It‚Äôs as easy as that. Is there a turning point? OK, he needs to prove it. He needs to play the next 250 games on the highest level and then that was the turning point. But is it a turning point if he does a brilliant match tomorrow? No. ""It‚Äôs only a turning point if he makes it a turning point ‚Äì and only if he does not only do one good match, one good half, 60 good minutes, but if he does it consistently,‚Äù Tuchel added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as easy as that with every player.‚Äù ""Once you do this you will have more minutes. Once you have more minutes you will maybe look back and say: ‚ÄòThat was a turning point.‚Äô You need to fight for it. You need to deserve it. It must be a perfect fit in a perfect moment. Sometimes you need a bit of luck. But in the end the only person who can answer that question is Callum. And we will support him."" Lukaku is the latest to be taken out, having sustained an ankle injury in his side's Champions League win against Malmo. The Belgian striker was sent for scans on Thursday and could be out for three weeks. Meanwhile, Werner picked up a hamstring injury in the midweek clash and may be missing for several weeks. United States international Pulisic has been out for a month with an ankle problem. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

131,https://www.goal.com/en/news/world-cup-2022-group-of-death/blta1eb036400cd025f,What is the World Cup 2022 'Group of Death'?,"It is a tradition after every World Cup draw to pick through the pool pairings for the 'Group of Death' - the group made up of the four strongest teams. The horrifically tough pools of the past - such as Argentina, England, Sweden and Nigeria together in 2002 - are no longer so viable now that FIFA organises its pots via ranking rather than continental confederations. However, the draw for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has thrown up some tasty looking pools - but which is the toughest? Group A: Qatar, Ecuador, Netherlands, Senegal Group B: England, Iran, USA, Scotland/Wales/Ukraine Group C: Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland Group D: France, UAE/Australia/Peru, Denmark, Tunisia Group E: Spain, Costa Rica/New Zealand, Germany, Japan Group F: Belgium, Canada, Morocco, Croatia Group G: Brazil, Serbia, Switzerland, Cameroon Group H: Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay, South Korea It appears the trickiest group in Qatar is Group E, which features two former world champions from Europe and arguably Asia's strongest contender. Spain were world champions in 2010 while Germany were last winners in 2014, having taken the title on four occasions. However, both have suffered recent group stage exits, in 2014 and 2018 respectively. They must both be wary of Japan, who eased through their qualifying pool with a seven point gap over Australia, while Costa Rica and New Zealand - who must face in a play-off to decide who goes to Qatar - both have recent history of World Cup upsets. Costa Rica came through their own group of death in 2014 - featuring England, Italy and Uruguay - on a run to the quarter-finals, while New Zealand were unbeaten in their last World Cup, drawing all three pool matches in 2010.

133,https://www.goal.com/en/news/time-running-out-belgium-golden-generation-jordan-lukaku/1gc12qev233cf1fyl07gcvngp4,'Time running out for Belgium's 'golden generation'' - Jordan Lukaku reveals 2018 World Cup regret ahead of Euro 2020,"There is still a tinge of regret that Belgium lost to France at the semi-final stage of the 2018 World Cup, according to Red Devils international Jordan Lukaku. And as such, he believes that the upcoming European Championship may well be the last chance for glory for the country‚Äôs so-called ‚Äògolden generation‚Äô, led by Jordan‚Äôs brother Romelu, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne. Having upset Brazil in the quarter-finals in Russia, a fatigued Belgium side took on France who, thanks to a solitary Samuel Umtiti goal from a corner, eliminated Roberto Martinez‚Äôs side in the last four. Belgium did go on to win the third-place play-off against England and record their most impressive World Cup showing of all time, but it was an overall result that was so close to being truly historical. ""Everybody is still upset about losing to France at the World Cup,"" Lukaku tells Goal. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt surprised we beat Brazil, but I felt like France set up to stop us rather than go toe-to-toe with us. Of course, they had world-class players. ‚ÄúWe know we are good and can be great, but we need to go out and prove it by winning a title. If we had beaten France, I think we would have won (the World Cup), so it is a regret. ""You know that people are counting on you and it is a kind of pressure, but the term ‚Äògolden generation‚Äô comes more from fans and media. There might be more on this one now as the time may be running out on this group."" Lukaku, who has eight caps under his belt for Belgium, was part of the squad which reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 and has seen close-up the abilities of talismanic attackers Hazard and De Bruyne. ""Eden has so much ability. He leads the team without saying too much, he‚Äôs a technical or silent leader,‚Äù says Lukaku. ‚ÄúHe can carry a team on his back like he did at Chelsea and he did it with the national team. It was incredible.  ""Kevin [De Bruyne] is like that too. I have known about him for a long time because my brother has been facing him since a long time ago in the youth leagues in Belgium. I played against Kevin and he was just amazing.‚Äù Romelu Lukaku, meanwhile, has gone on to become the all-time top scorer for Belgium and will be key to any chance of success that they will have in the tournament. ""When we were kids we were competitive against each other,"" he adds. ""It is really special because my brother broke through and I had an opportunity to play for the first team after that. It‚Äôs a relief when you make it after so many years. ""We also wanted to help out our parents as we weren‚Äôt doing financially well in our family as kids. It was rough so we were motivated for more. It‚Äôs not normal to have two from a family make it.‚Äù Lukaku senior has scored 60 goals in 93 international appearances, and netted 30 goals in all competitions last season for Inter as they claimed a first Serie A title in more than a decade. ""I am so happy for him at Inter because he was chasing that title for so long,‚Äù says Jordan. ‚ÄúHe really wanted to be a champion again. ""I see how he works towards his goals so I was really happy for him. He wanted to end that winning streak of Juventus and that‚Äôs what they did.""   While his brother ranks among the world's best strikers, left-back Jordan is at an important crossroads in his career. He is entering the final year of his Lazio contract, where former manager Simone Inzaghi has departed and Maurizio Sarri will soon arrive. Lukaku, one year younger than his brother, returned on loan to hometown club Antwerp last season, but was unlucky to miss out on the national team squad for these finals. He came close to joining Rafa Benitez‚Äôs Newcastle in 2019, is plotting the next step of his career with Roc Nation and has attracted interest from a host of clubs. ""I have one year left so either I‚Äôll sign a new deal and stay at Lazio, or the club may accept an offer to sell me. If I go somewhere else, I am not too worried about it because that‚Äôs football. I‚Äôm ready for any challenge."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Lukaku, De Bruyne and Hazard - Belgium‚Äôs golden generation are coming of age","Samuel Umtiti stole a march on Marouane Fellaini at the near post and just like that it was all over. Roberto Martinez‚Äô Red Devils were going home, their 2018 World Cup ending in a gut-wrenching semi-final defeat. A tournament that had promised so much - not just for a golden generation, but perhaps the golden generation - had gone. Belgium had dominated possession throughout their clash in St Petersburg with 66%, but a single moment had cost them. It had been almost two years since Belgium had lost a match of any kind, and this one stung. ""It was a dead ball situation which was the difference,‚Äù lamented coach Roberto Martinez that evening at a World Cup that had seen almost half of its goals arrive from set pieces.  Nobody would return from Russia having scored more than their 16. Nobody ended with a better goal difference, nor managed more victories. None of that mattered after Belgium had allowed Umtiti to head home the only goal of the game. ‚ÄúThat is the type of detail that counts in the semi-final of the World Cup,‚Äù admitted Martinez. Belgium had attacked with verve and imagination from the first whistle of their first game in Russia, but football is a low-scoring game and eventual winners France got over the line by adopting the opposite approach, preferring a more pragmatic game which sought first to stifle the opposition. Belgium‚Äôs last 16 victory over reigning champions Portugal suggests Martinez and his players heeded the Umtiti lesson from three years ago. The players ‚Äúdid exactly what they needed to do in the game to win,‚Äù said Martinez after Thorgan Hazard settled the game in the first-half with his side‚Äôs only shot on goal in Seville. Belgium‚Äôs array of attacking stars were mostly peripheral: star striker Romelu Lukaku had the few touches of anyone who completed the 90 minutes, while Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Youri Tielemans created just one chance between them. Instead, the stars of the show were the ageing central defensive trio of Thomas Vermaelen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld as Belgium registered another clean sheet in a tournament that has seen their backline breached just once in four outings.   ‚ÄúThe DNA of the Belgian national football team will never change,‚Äù insisted Martinez ahead of his side‚Äôs quarter-final clash with Italy. ‚ÄúWe are a team that wants to be in possession, we want to be an attacking threat and we want to show the talent that we have to win games, but sometimes to win games you have to show another side that allows you to win.‚Äù Belgium arrived at this tournament with many doubting there was another side to their progressive, attacking approach. Those doubts were cast aside in Seville. Now they have shown another string to their bow, an ability to adapt to the demands of a game to instead sit back and play a more conservative, reactive game,and appear a fine bet for the title at +700, behind their next opponents, Italy. With so many of Europe‚Äôs big hitters having already exited Euro 2020, a versatile Belgium side look the team to beat.

The former Everton and Wigan Athletic boss is one of the names that has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Ronald Koeman, who has seen his position questioned following a disappointing start to the 2021-22 campaign. And while Martinez isa proud Catalan who was born in the region, he is solely concentrating on his role with Belgium, with the Red Devils facing France in the Nations League semi-final on October 7. ""In all honesty, I don‚Äôt spend much time thinking about my future,"" Martinez exclusivelytoldGoal. ""My career showsthat I don‚Äôt make plans to get to where I am now. I just go from project to project. You learn that you have to be committed today. ""In football, if you start thinkingyou just drop your performance and underachieve in what you do. In my case, I am very, very happy in what I am doing and I am just trying to achieve the next steps. ""In the end, if I have to arrive at a decision where there‚Äôs a doorI will just try to make the best decision for everyone.""  Martinez's side face France in the semi-final of the Nations League, with the winner taking on either Spain or Italy in the final. A potential meeting with the country of Martinez's birth is an exciting one, and the 48-year-old has been encouraged bythe Nations League format and its potential to set up clashes between some of Europe's top international sides. Discussing a possible showdownwith Spain, Martinez said: ""You never lose your roots. I am very, very proud of it and my family are from there. ""But you learn not to miss places and to find a home wherever you are with a happy environment. It is true that one of the strange things is thatmy first game as a national team coach was against Spain.   ""It really set the way that we were going to work from that point on. Now, we might have the opportunity to face each other which would be a reallyfascinatinggame. It just shows this competition really works. ""It brings teams like France, Spain and Italy into outstanding games with the opportunity of winning silverware. It really is quite special whatever way you want to look at it as a story for Belgium. ""If we play Spain, I grew up in Spain, and the other possible opponent isItaly,who stopped us in the Euros. Against France, we face the team that beat us at the semi-final of the World Cup. There‚Äôs a lot of stories and plans we need to make."" Spain head coach Luis Enrique is overseeing something of a transitional period, with many new faces - including Barcelona's 17-year-old talent Gavi - being introduced to the international set-up, and Martinez has been impressed with what he's seen. ""He‚Äôs (Luis Enrique) done really well,"" Martinez said of the former Barcelona boss.""I think he has a very clear way of working and how he wants his team to play. You can identify it through different players, different personnel. ""I thought their performance at the Euros was interesting. There were a lot of players with a lot of character and personality. They were able to get through the difficulties of the early games. ""They were very unlucky to lose to Italy in the manner that they did. It'svery impressive that we get these managers atinternational level thathave an identity on the pitch with all the different players that they use.""

A remarkable record for club and country has seen the burly Belgian record 255 efforts on domestic stages and a further 67 strikes at international level. He is a Premier League centurion, Serie A title winner and the all-time leading marksman for his nation, but Lukaku is eager to point out that he is about much more than hitting the back of the net. Lukaku has told UEFA's official website when asked about his biggest strengths: ‚ÄúThe way I‚Äôm built ‚Äì I‚Äôm quite big ‚Äì everybody thinks I‚Äôm a sort of target man: just holding up the ball and being a goal poacher. But I‚Äôve never played that way and I hate it. ‚ÄúMy biggest strength is that I‚Äôm dangerous when I‚Äôm facing towards the goal, because that‚Äôs when I rarely make wrong choices. ‚ÄúAfter I pass the ball, I know where I have to position myself in the box. I can do a bit of everything and in some games when I know there is a lot of space behind the defence, I play differently. ‚ÄúThe reason I‚Äôm so productive [in front of goal] is because I can do a bit of everything.‚Äù  Lukaku has worked hard to reach the level he currently enjoys, with Chelsea making him their ¬£98 million ($136m) club-record signing over the summer. Questions are being asked of whether the Blues are using him correctly, but there is no such debate with Belgium as Lukaku ‚Äì at just 28 years of age ‚Äì now has 100 caps to his name and is 34 goals clear at the top of his nation‚Äôs scoring charts. He added on that record, with his intention being to add to it during a bid for UEFA Nations League glory: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really begin scoring goals straight away for the national team. It took me some time. ‚ÄúBut once I had settled in, I knew I would have opportunities to score and that the other players would enable me to do so. And everyone else started to score goals as well, not just me: Eden [Hazard], Kevin [De Bruyne], Dries [Mertens]. ‚ÄúThat made me think that in attack, we have real top quality. And for me, it was like a sweet store: just constantly scoring goals. ‚ÄúAt some point, I stopped counting and just continued playing. And we also won our matches. That was the great achievement, you know: scoring and winning. ‚ÄúI really hate to lose, but scoring and still losing is awful as well. I‚Äôm glad that we managed to win so many of our matches, but in the end you really just want to win a trophy and that‚Äôs what truly motivates me.‚Äù Belgium are set to take on France in the semi-finals of the Nations League on Thursday, with the victors going on to face Spain or Euro 2020 winners Italy in the final.

A Golden Glove-winning 28-year-old has seen his technical ability talked up on a regular basis since completing a big-money move to the Etihad Stadium back in 2017. City have history when it comes to playing keepers outfield, with Stuart Pearcefamously bringing David James off the bench as a striker in a final day showdown with Middlesbrough in 2005, and Ederson says he would be up for following in the former England star's footsteps. Ederson has told CityTV when discussing James' cameo against Boro: ""If I were to go outfield like this, I would not ask to be a striker. ""I would prefer to play in the midfield. In Kevin's place! ""If I were to choose, if someone asked me to play, I would say: 'Take off De Bruyne and play me!' It would not change anything!""  The chances of Ederson filling an outfield role for City appear to be remote, with Pep Guardiola not the kind of coach to take unnecessary risks or make outlandish selection calls. It could, however, be that a South American star gets an opportunity to prove his worth from the spot at some stage. City have experienced plenty of penalty-taking struggles in recent years, with calls for Ederson to be given a chance mounting in intensity. He is one of the cleanest strikers of a ball on the Blues' books and, while giving little away when it comes to technique, continues to make no secret of the fact that he would relish a shot at goal from 12 yards. Ederson added when quizzed on how he would take a penalty: ""I don't know. It depends on the game, what the game brings. ""Of course the pressure is higher it it's 0-0. In a penalty shooutout as well. But if you're winning 3-0 and there's a penalty, the player is much more relaxed. ""But I don't know how I would take it. But I can't say anyway. I haven't taken a single one and I won't be giving hints for the opponents. I hope someday it happens and you will see."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

138,https://www.goal.com/en/news/eriksen-denmark-goal-warm-up-emotional-copenhagen-return/blt4ad10877edda8db9,Eriksen: Denmark goal 'just a warm-up' for emotional Copenhagen return,"Christian Eriksen has insisted that his goalscoring performance against the Netherlands was ""just a warm-up"" for his emotional return to Copenhagen with the Denmark national team. Eriksen came off the bench to a standing ovation in Denmark's friendly clash with the Netherlands on Saturday as he made his first appearance at international level since suffering his cardiac arrest on the pitch at Euro 2020. The 30-year-old sparked wild scenes of celebration by scoring shortly after his introduction but Denmark went on to lose 4-2, and he is already looking ahead to their next fixture against Serbia. Eriksen stopped breathing after collapsing during Denmark's first group-stage game of the European Championship against Finland at the Parken Stadium last June and, after being revived and taken to hospital for tests, he was fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The midfielder, who joined Brentford on a free transfer in January after leaving Inter, is now set to play at the same venue again in Denmark's latest friendly, which he says will hold greater significance than his run-out against the Netherlands. ""That will be even more special,"" Eriksen told Danish TV station Kanal 5. ""[Saturday's goal] was just a warm-up for Tuesday when I'll be running in exactly the place where it happened."" Eriksen could be in line to start against Serbia after his performance at Johan Cruyff ArenA over the weekend, with Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand in awe of the progress he has made over the last few months. ""I didn't expect that he could be so good so quickly,"" Hjulmand told reporters after the Netherlands game. ""He was running without any difficulty and he brought rhythm to the game. He was very calm. I really appreciate seeing him play.""

Eriksen made his Denmark return on Saturday, scoring with his first touch less than two minutes after coming on as a substitute, while creating numerous other chances. Describing the comeback as ""perfect"", the Brentford playmaker indicated that he feels comfortable back with his international team-mates and is ready to help at the 2022 World Cup. ‚ÄúI was pleased to show I can still play,"" Eriksen told Dutch TV. ""It feels like I‚Äôve never been away from the team. It was a bit emotional to be back in the national team but I‚Äôve hardly missed any games over the last 10 years so I‚Äôm like part of the family."" Can‚Äôt say how much I‚Äôve missed this feeling! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá©üá∞#ce10 pic.twitter.com/4QLOCs2UIu Speaking to Sky Sports, Eriksen added: ""I felt very welcome [by the Netherlands fans]. I've been here before [for Ajax] for many years so of course they know me, but it was a very heart-warming reception for sure. ""I was happy the ball came to me and of course, it was a lovely finish. To start the comeback in international football like this was the perfect way. ""I'm looking forward to playing at the Qatar World Cup but there are a lot of games in between and I'm focused on them."" Denmark head coach Kasper Hjulmand said that it was ""a pleasure"" to see the popular playmaker back on the pitch and revealed what he told the midfielder before sending him into the fray. ""I said, 'Enjoy it and welcome back',"" Hjulmand told Dutch broadcaster NOS.

The 30-year-old had made a return to professional football in February after signing for Premier League side Brentford, with his journey back to the pitch cheered on by well wishers. While Eriksen scored in the game against the Netherlands, Denmark still went on to lose the game 4-2. Denmark next play against Serbia on March 29.

The club has been hit with severe restrictions due to its association with Abramovich, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of the measures handed down by the UK government was a ban on ticket selling, which will cause the Blues' home ground to look rather empty for the Premier League clash. Under the terms of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich and Chelsea, the club has seen its ability to operate and trade reduced. One of the aspects affected is in matchday income, and specifically the sale of tickets following the restrictions. While season ticket holders are still permitted to attend, Chelsea were unable to sell any further places for this match or any of their following games. That means of the 40,000 seats available at Stamford Bridge, just over 32,000 were occupied for the London derby. 32,249 supporters in here with attendences reduced for sanctions. #CFC Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was caught by surprise by the ban, but urged those who would be attending to make up for the empty seats themselves. ""That is not an advantage because we want to play home matches and in general we want to play in front of a full stadium and the game is for the spectators and supporters. That's bad news, actually,"" the German told reporters. ""I was not aware of it. Maybe someone told me and I forgot it!Let's turn things around, maybe everyone (there) is aware of that and pushes a little bit more. We lack quantity but we should not lack quality of support.""

141,https://www.goal.com/en/news/rudiger-real-madrid-deal-chelsea-departure/blt2300242b4d5821bf,Rudiger in verbal agreement to join Real Madrid on lucrative four-year deal ahead of Chelsea departure,"Antonio Rudiger is close to joining Real Madrid after giving his word during advanced negotiations over a lucrative four-year contract. It is unclear exactly what the 29-year-old will earn but it will be a significant pay-rise to his current Chelsea contract and similar to the ¬£200,000-a-week offering from the west London outfit. It is expected the Spanish giants will get their man after Carlo Ancelotti instructed his club to restart talks after failed negotiations in December. The aim is to complete the talks in the next week after Rudiger got frustrated waiting for Chelsea's takeover to be completed. The sanctions on the Stamford Bridge club mean they can't renew contracts for any of their players and, despite Thomas Tuchel and other senior staff asking Rudiger to wait until the takeover is complete, he opted to explore one of the many offers on the table. Ironically, some close to the process believe an answer on a new owner could come this week. For Rudiger, he will choose Madrid over options that include Manchester United, Barcelona and Juventus, with PSG and Bayern Munich having also previously had negotiations with him. Los Blancos could wait until the end of the season to announce Rudiger after he gave his word to Tuchel that he will remain focused and professional until the end of the season. ""He has no doubts and has made no doubts about it, he will play until the end of the season with everything he has,"" Tuchel said after his side's 1-0 win over West Ham this weekend. ""This is what he did from day one, and it's what he will do until the last minute. I am 100 per cent sure."" Chelsea do not have the ability to sign players until the ownership situation is resolved. However, the scouting teams continue to operate and Sevilla's Jules Kounde will likely remain a target for whoever comes in. Chelsea tried to sign Kounde last summer but saw their offers repeatedly snubbed for the France international. They are also known to be admirers of Leicester City's Wesley Fofana but he has signed a new deal at King Power Stadium. Similarly, Barcelona's Ronald Araujo was briefly a target but Xavi's team feel they will successfully renew their young defender's deal. It is likely that Tuchel will want to sign two defenders to replace both Rudiger and Andreas Christensen who is expected to join Barcelona. That is unless Huddersfield Town loanee Levi Colwill can impress enough in pre-season to force his way into Tuchel's plans. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

142,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-mvp-rudiger-deserves-pay-rise-carabao-cup-winner/blt57f0384f7ece8989,Chelsea MVP Rudiger shows why he deserves pay rise with Carabao Cup winner at Spurs,"Tottenham 0-1 Chelsea: Match Statistics It's incredible how quickly things can turn around for a footballer. A year ago, Tottenham were one of a host of clubs looking to sign Antonio Rudiger after the Chelsea defender had fallen out of favour with then-manager Frank Lampard. Now, the German is Thomas Tuchel's ""aggressive leader"", the star performer in the Blues' backline. Rudiger is also a threat at the other end of the pitch, of course, as he proved once again on Wednesday night, netting the only goal of the game as Chelsea booked their place in the Carabao Cup final with a 1-0 victory at Tottenham that sealed a 3-0 aggregate success. However, a joyous night for the travelling fans was also tinged with anxiety. After all, there's every chance that their match-winner could quit the club at the end of the season. As it stands, Rudiger will be a free agent when his current Chelsea deal expires at the end of the season, meaning he is presently free to sign a pre-contract agreement with other clubs. What's even more worrying is that he's not short of suitors among Europe's elite. Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are particularly keen on Rudiger and have already made contact with his representatives to discuss a summer switch. How has it come to this? Why are Chelsea in danger of losing arguably their best player this season? Well, essentially it comes down to the fact that the Blues played hardball over Rudiger's wage demands, refusing to put him among the club's top earners. Chelsea advance to the Carabao Cup Final üëä pic.twitter.com/h1y6uLKUha For example, Timo Werner is presently on more than double Rudiger's estimated ¬£100,000-a-week contract. It's hardly surprising, then, that the 28-year-old is seeking a significant pay rise given his next deal is likely to be his last big one. He'll certainly feel he's done enough to earn a salary increase, given he's enjoying the best form of his career, as he admitted himself after the win in north London. Tuchel obviously needs no convincing of Rudiger's importance to his team and has made a personal plea for the former Roma man to extend his stay at Stamford Bridge. The situation remains unresolved but the uncertainty surrounding his future clearly hasn't affected his form. ""I don't feel Toni needs a lot of words, coffee talks or invitations for dinners or whatever. He is a top professional,"" Tuchel said last week. ""I trust the club 100 per cent, trust in the player and it is not a problematic situation for me. He is super reliable."" Indeed, Rudiger has racked up 2,550 minutes across 28 games this season, meaning he has seen more game time than any other Chelsea player in 2021-22. His value to the Blues cause cannot be overstated, then. Losing him for nothing would be a massive blow, given replacing him would prove incredibly expensive, given the likes of Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Sevilla's Jules Kounde would both cost more than ¬£50m ($69m). The hope, therefore, is that director Marina Granovskaia and, to a lesser extent, owner Roman Abramovich, realise how costly an error it would be to let Rudiger leave this summer. As he proved again against Spurs, Rudiger is Chelsea's most valuable player right now. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

143,https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-confident-bayern-munich-free-transfer-signing/blt8949149f7e6e342c,Barcelona confident of beating Bayern Munich to free transfer signing of Chelsea's Christensen,"Barcelona are aggressively pushing to win the race to sign Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich. The Catalan side, coached by Xavi, have offered Christensen a deal until 2027, with terms which are superior to those tabled by Bayern and Chelsea. The German champions were scheduled for talks with the 25-year-old's representative this week because they see him as an ideal replacement for Niklas Sule - after he signed a pre-contract to join Borussia Dortmund in the summer - but it is unclear whether they will still go ahead. The Blues had wanted to renew their Denmark international's contract, while the defender, who was signed at 16 from Brondby for ¬£500,000, also wanted to stay. However, talks broke down over agent's fees and signing-on bonuses, even after a ¬£140,000-a-week contract was verbally agreed. On one side, Chelsea sources described the players's camp as moving the goalposts. Meanwhile, on the other side, they believe that a lack of agreement on agent's fees meant that no such deal was agreed. It left talks in a deep freeze with the Blues furious, and Thomas Tuchel publicly criticising the player and gradually using him less. The desire to re-sign Christensen only came after Frank Lampard was sacked and the Dane improved his form under Tuchel. Before that, Chelsea had only offered him a one-year contract extension without a pay rise, until they saw the defender play a pivotal role in the run to winning the Champions League last season. Even though Christensen's final destination remains to be confirmed, the least likely option now seems to be a contract renewal in west London. The Stamford Bridge club are now in a vulnerable position, with Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta's contracts also expiring. The uncertainty created by Roman Abramovich putting the club up for sale has created a difficult atmosphere in which to renew contracts or sign new players. Although the Blues can operate within the revenue they receive, it remains unclear to new signings or current stars what direction the club will be moving in or who will be leading it on the board. Chelsea have made signing a central defender their number one priority this summer but have since seen target Wesley Fofana renew his contract with Leicester City until 2027. Furthermore, Sevilla's Jules Kounde and Barcelona's Ronald Araujo are targets but may now need convincing about where Chelsea will be after Abramovich. They are also targeting a host of youngsters to bolster their academy after a difficult season battling relegation in Premier League 2. One target that has recently emerged is Blackburn Rovers centre-back Ashley Phillips who is playing at Under-23s level despite only being 16 years old.

144,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-interview-did-chelsea-striker-really-attack-tuchel/blt6e08953b2d9bdf36,Lukaku interview: Did the Chelsea striker really attack Tuchel's tactics?,"On Thursday evening, excerpts from Sky Italia's sit-down interview with Romelu Lukaku began to appear online, gaining traction through a host of social media influencers. In some translations of the Chelsea forward's quotes from Italian into English, it appeared as if Lukaku was criticising Thomas Tuchel's tactics, provoking a backlash among many fans. Having seen their Premier League title hopes hit hard by injuries and illness in recent weeks, the last thing the club needed was a public spat between their star summer signing and their manager. However, as GOAL explains below, all wasn't as it initially seemed... The interview had been arranged with Sky Italia in order to allow Lukaku to fully explain the reasons behind his ¬£97.5 million ($136m) transfer from Inter to Chelsea, which sparked a bitter backlash at San Siro. The Belgian wanted to apologise for the nature of his departure and he did precisely that: ""I hope from the bottom of my heart that I can one day go back to Inter, not right at the end of my career but when I‚Äôm still at a good level so we can hopefully win more [trophies]."" However, Lukaku's desire to return to Inter caused less controversy than his reported take on Tuchel. Romelu Lukaku to @SkySport: ""Physically I am fine. But I'm NOT happy with the situation at Chelsea. Tuchel has chosen to play with another system - I won't give up, I'll be professional. I am not happy with the situation but I am professional - and I can't give up now"". üîµ #CFC pic.twitter.com/KGNoJ10cwp However, the quotes that first appeared on social media were not as harsh as the words that actually came out of Lukaku's mouth. ""I‚Äôm not happy with the situation and that‚Äôs only natural,""he told Sky Italia as per Patrick Kendrick, one of Europe's top translators.""The head coach has decided to play a different system and I mustn‚Äôt let up, I need to keep working hard and be professional. ""I‚Äôm not happy with the situation but I‚Äôm a grafter and I mustn‚Äôt let up."" Then there was the unfortunate timing. In-person interviews aren't currently allowed in the Premier League due to rapid increase of Covid-19 cases across the United Kingdom, so the date of the recording immediately became a talking point and, as it turned out, the Sky Italia exclusive had actually been filmed three weeks ago. At that time, Lukaku was still being eased back into first-team action after an ankle injury, which would explain his frustration with his then-lack of game time. After all, the striker is now back in the starting line-up having also recovered from Covid-19 and has scored in his last two games. It doesn't sound good, but it could well have been filmed pre-him getting COVID. It changes the tone. Around then, Lukaku and Tuchel have both spoke openly about the player's frustration at being held back after injury. Also, #CFC were less in 'crisis' mode. https://t.co/Q1JSYLQ2Me And, after netting in his comeback against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, Lukaku told ESPN Brasil: ""Me and the coach, we had a couple of conversations about whatever he wanted from me. ""Obviously, I told him I‚Äôm multidimensional. It‚Äôs just about having a bit of clarity about how he wants to use me. And whatever he wants from me."" Still, even accounting for the fact that Lukaku's relationship with Tuchel has clearly improved since the interview, it must be said that his comments were clumsy at best. The talk of returning to Inter was clearly an attempt to repair his relationship with fans still upset by his exit. However, publicly expressing his unhappiness with Tuchel's tactics, even in such a mild manner, was always going to cause controversy. Tuchel has found it hard to get the best out of Lukaku this season for various reasons. Last season's Champions League win was founded upon intense pressing off the ball, which is not exactly the 28-year-old's forte. There's also an issue with Lukaku preferring a more counterattacking style, given the Blues prefer to hoard possession. However, the Belgium international turned the game after coming on at Villa Park and also opened the scoring in the 1-1 draw with Brighton on Wednesday night, suggesting that the tide is starting to turn. So, Tuchel really could have done without this social media storm. He was feeling frustrated enough as it was, telling Amazon Prime after the Brighton game ""Everything is against us!"" Still, when the German faced the media on Friday morning, he appeared perfectly relaxed, explaining that while the timing of the interview was hardly ideal, he didn't view it as a major problem. Tuchel on Lukaku's interview: ""Yes, we don't like it. It brings noise we don't need. It is not helpful but we don't want to make more of it than it actually is. It is very easy to take lines out of context, make headlines."" #CFC ""We don't like it, of course, because it brings noise that we don't need and is not helpful,"" Tuchel told reporters.""But on the other side, we don't want to make more out of it than it actually is. You know very well how it is: it's very easy to take lines out of context, to shorten lines to make headlines, then realise later it's not so bad or what he meant. ""I don't feel [that he is] unhappy. If you'd asked me yesterday morning, I would have said that I feel the exact opposite. ""That's why I would say it's a surprise but I am the wrong person to ask. If there is something to discuss, it's behind closed doors, for sure."" Despite the commotion caused, Lukaku is still expected to lead the line in Sunday's must-win Premier League showdown with third-placed Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Furthermore, while there have been reports in Italy of the attacker returning to Inter on loan during the January transfer window, there is no chance of that happening. Indeed, Chelsea are adamant that Lukaku is not for sale and they will be hoping that with Tuchel having drawn a line under the episode, everyone involved can now quickly move on and work together on getting Chelsea's title bid back on track.

The announcement came just an hour before kick-off at Kenilworth Road and it seemed as if one shock exit was going to be quickly followed by another, as first-half goals from Reece Burke and Harry Cornick gave the hosts a 2-1 half-time lead over the reigning European and world champions. However, Werner turned the fifth-round tie on its head after the break, latching onto Ruben Loftus-Cheek's long ball to net his first goal in eight games before teeing up Romelu Lukaku for a late winner. ""Timo played very well,"" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel told reporters after the game. ""I am happy about that and the fact that Romelu got his goal. That is why we left them on the pitch. ""These matches are, at the moment, the most important matches for them, even if they think they should have played this match or that match."" It was certainly an important outing for Werner. The 25-year-old has been afforded fewer minutes than any of Chelsea's other senior attacking players this season, so this was a rare chance to shine. For much of the match, he really struggled to make an impact, but his goal changed everything. ""I am happy that I made my goal and an assist,"" he told BBC Sport afterwards.""Itried to help the team as much as I could to win the game and this is what we did today."" Timo Werner came through with a goal and two assists ü•∂ pic.twitter.com/xbTJT35cnQ Whether his second-half showing could also prove a turning point in his Chelsea career remains to be seen. The ¬£47.5 million signing from RB Leipzig has become increasingly frustrated with his lack of game time and has been considering his options ahead of the summer transfer window. Werner's representatives are due to meet with Chelsea officials in the coming weeks to better understand Tuchel's plans for their client before deciding on their next move. If those talks don't end well, the forward might seriously consider a move to Borussia Dortmund, who are keen on bringing Werner back to Germany, which would certainly appeal to a player that GOAL understands has struggled to settle in London. Of course, Werner's weekly wage of ¬£250,000 ($335,000) could prove problematic, given it's highly unlikely that Dortmund would be willing to match such a salary. Any deal could hinge on Dortmund's ongoing pursuit of Karim Adeyemi. If their talks with RB Salzburg collapse, a move for Werner becomes far more likely but the transfer might require Chelsea to pay a portion of his wages if the attacker refuses to take a significant pay cut. So, even though Werner proved decisive at Luton, there remains a major question mark over his future at Stamford Bridge. After all, in 76 appearances for Chelsea, he has still only contributed 19 goals and 18 assists. Those figures justify Tuchel's refusal to pick him on a regular basis. Werner was one of Abramovich's last big-money signings and there is still a chance that he could soon follow the Russian out of the exit door. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

146,https://www.goal.com/en/news/abramovich-unable-sell-chelsea-uk-government-freezes-russian/blt643e1b699a6c8f99,Chelsea owner Abramovich hit with sanctions by UK government as sale of Blues put in doubt,"The sale of Chelsea is now up in the air as the UK government imposed sanctions on Roman Abramovich, with the Russian billionaire's assets now frozen. Abramovich had announced his intention to sell the London-based Premier League club last week. Despite there being plenty of interest, however, the sanctions now mean that the Blues face an uncertain future. Abramovich has been penalised as part of the British government's sanctions on numerous high-profile Russians who have ties to president Vladimir Putin, who ordered the recent invasion of Ukraine. HM Treasury's Office of Financial Sanctions released a statement on Thursday which, in part, reads: ""Roman Arkadyevich ABRAMOVICH (hereafter ABRAMOVICH) is a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch. ""ABRAMOVICH is associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom ABRAMOVICH has had a close relationship for decades. ""This association has included obtaining a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the Government of Russia. ""This includes tax breaks received by companies linked to ABRAMOVICH, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and the contracts received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup. ""Therefore, ABRAMOVICH has received preferential treatment and concessions from Putin and the Government of Russia."" Chelsea are now in limbo, with Abramovich having hoped to sell the Stamford Bridge club before the sanctions were imposed. GOAL has learned that the club can still be sold, however, provided none of the proceeds go to Abramovich. Meanwhile, culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said that Chelsea will be issued with a ""special licence"" which means all football-related activities, such as Thursday's clash with Norwich, can go ahead. However, the club cannot sell tickets for matches, meaning only season ticket holders will be able to attend games in person. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson released a statement following the news, which reads: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin‚Äôs vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today‚Äôs sanctions are the latest step in the UK‚Äôs unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. ""We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.""

Roman Abramovich has put the Londoners up for sale after almost two decades in charge, amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The current owner is looking to sell as soon as possible, with a Saudi-backed group and others also in the running. Businessmen Wyss and Boehly lead the consortium which is looking to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. Wyss, a Swiss national, revealed his interest in the club in an interview with Blick last week. ""Abramovich is one of Putin's closest advisers and friends.Like all other oligarchs, he is also in a panic.Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England.He also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly.I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich,"" he explained. ""I have to wait four to five days now.Abramovich is currently asking far too much.You know, Chelsea owe him ¬£2 billion.But Chelsea has no money.Means: Those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. ""As of today, we don't know the exact selling price.I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners.But I have to examine the general conditions first.But what I can already say: I'm definitely not doing something like this alone.If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors."" Alongside Wyss is Boehly, who also has an interest in Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and is the founder and CEO of Eldridge Industries in his native United States. As mentioned above, both Abramovich and the Premier League are keen to see a deal tied up as soon as possible. ‚ÄúThe sooner the sale process completes, the sooner everyone has certainty,"" Premier League chairman Richard Masters affirmed to Masters the Financial Times Business of Football Summit recently. ‚ÄúThe quickest any deal has taken is 10 days. That‚Äôs not to say that deal can‚Äôt be beaten but it would normally take a number of weeks and it all depends on the complexity of the deal. ""Provided the information is easily accessible, easily understandable and were given all the right answers it can be done relatively quickly. If the owner is sanctioned by the UK, I don‚Äôt think it will work.‚Äù As well as the Saudi consortium and Wyss and Boehly, Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrakhas also been linked with a takeover, but the Swiss-American bid is believed be likeliest to prosper at this stage.

148,https://www.goal.com/en/news/abramovich-sanctions-rudiger-azpilicueta-chelsea-transfer/blt44370a7d611de200,"What do Abramovich sanctions mean for Rudiger, Azpilicueta and Chelsea's transfer targets?","Chelsea have a number of expiring player contracts that could be impacted by the sanctions imposed on club owner Roman Abramovich by the United Kingdom government. It was announced on Thursday that the 55-year-old has been hit with an asset freeze and travel ban because of his ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is overseeing the ongoing invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Indeed, the UK government released a statement claiming that Abramovich is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who has ""had a close relationship [with Putin] for decades"". As a result of the sanctions, Abramovich's attempts to sell Chelsea have been thrown into doubt, as they mean that neither he nor the Russian Federation can benefit from the sale. The day-to-day running of the club will also be immediately affected, while there are also likely to be serious repercussions on the club's transfer activity... It has been made clear from publicly released documents that Chelsea will not be able to offer any of their players contract extensions. In the case of captain Cesar Azpilicueta, whose deal expires this summer, the Blues may be able to find a loophole by using a one-year extension clause that was first revealed by GOAL. Thursday's news will have hardly affected Andreas Christensen's thinking either, given he was already set to leave this summer, with the Dane on the verge of agreeing a free transfer to Barcelona - even though Bayern Munich are still trying to persuade the centre-half to move to the Allianz Arena instead. However, it now seems certain that Antonio Rudiger will also leave for nothing at the end of the season. The Germany international had been in talks with the club over becoming the highest-paid defender in Chelsea's history and was looking increasingly likely to stay in west London. However, the negotiations were put on hold even before Abramovich was formally sanctioned, as the Russian had already announced his desire to sell the club. Now, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Juventus are all likely to renew their interest in Rudiger, who has been free since January to sign a pre-contract agreement with another team. As things stand, Chelsea would not be in a position to take up their ¬£30 million ($41m) option to buy Saul Niguez, who is on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid. However, even before the sanctions, it was felt that the Spain international would return to Wanda Metropolitano for next season, with the Blues already planning to integrate Crystal Palace loanee Conor Gallagher into the senior squad instead. Furthermore, GOAL understands that Atleti were also keen for Saul to return to Madrid, believing that he has benefited from his temporary stay in England. Outside of the first-team picture, Danny Drinkwater, Charly Musonda, George McEachran, Jake Clarke-Salter, Thierno Ballo and Xavier Simons are all into the final few months of their contracts. Chelsea have no interest in keeping any of those players bar Simons, who has significant long-term potential having made his first team debut this season under Thomas Tuchel. However, as first revealed by GOAL, the likes of Watford, Southampton, Brighton and Norwich are all attempting to sign the 19-year-old midfielder. Although he has yet to respond to the Abramovich sanctions, manager Thomas Tuchel spoke about how the proposed sale of the club has effectively frozen all talks around contract renewals. ""Does it have an effect on the players? Maybe,"" he said ahead of the Premier League trip to Norwich. ""We have to ask the players. ""On the club, I don‚Äôt know. Right now, it is still March‚Ä¶ We have some time. Of course, there are some situations we want to have resolved but we couldn't. It is not an ideal situation."" Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea were set to be very active in the transfer market, with the club planning a 'one in, one out' recruitment policy. The priority was bringing in new defenders, given so many members of the current backline will be out of contract at the end of the season. They were looking to sign Sevilla's Jules Kounde or Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo to go straight into the starting line-up, as well as Blackburn's promising young centre-back Ashley Phillips. However, they had also identified midfield targets, such as West Ham's Declan Rice and Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni. As it stands, though, Chelsea are not in a position to make any progress whatsoever with any of those proposed deals until the ownership situation at Stamford Bridge is resolved.

An enigmatic character, Abramovich's billions have been the chief reason for the Blues' rise from outsiders to perennial challengers, as the London outfit transformed into one of the biggest clubs in England. In the early days of his investment into the club, the Russian was a regular spectator at Stamford Bridge and, despite becoming less visible at games in recent years, he remains tightly involvedin the background, acting as a guiding force. But Chelsea is not his only business interest and he has shown himself to have an interest in a diversity of industries. However, he has come under scrutiny recently as he attempts to renew his UK visa. When it comes to high-earning football club owners there is always plenty of intrigue, so Goal takes a look at Abramovich's net worth, what businesses he has, the luxury yachts and more. It is difficult to say exactly how much Abramovich earns a year, with reportsonlinesuggesting that hehas earned billions in recent years through his various business interests. If true, that means he could be earning millions of dollars a month or, to put it into a different perspective, hundreds every minute.  Amassing the sort of incredible wealth that Abramovich has requires a lot of business acumen and he has turned his hand to a wide variety of industries, famously transforming himself from a modest rubber duck salesman into one of the most recognisable oil barons in the world following the break up of the Soviet Union. Of course, he is best known in the public's imagination as the enigmaticbillionaire owner of Premier League club Chelsea,having taken over the Stamford Bridge outfit from Ken Bates in the summer of 2003. He has pumped billions into the club during his 15 years at the helm and that investment has helped themto win 17 trophies in that time, including five league titles as well as the Champions League. However, the chief source of his wealth nowadays is the mining industry, where he has major interests in a number of companies. The 51-year-old is the owner of the steel-making company Evraz, as well as owning stakes in Norilsk Nickel, which is the second largest nickel producing company in the world. According to the world renowned American business magazineForbes, Abramovich's net worth in May 2018 was $11.6 billion, which works out at roughly ¬£8.6bn or ‚Ç¨9.8bn. That makes him the 11th richest Russian in the world and the 140th richest person in the entire world. The net worth figure tends to fluctuate, but itis roughly the same according to other sources, withthe Sunday Times Rich List 2018 indicating that Abramovich's net worth stood at ¬£9.3bn ($12.4bn/‚Ç¨10.5bn). While that sort of wealth is undoubtedly eyewatering, it is interesting to note that it is actually much lower than it had been.A decade earlier, in 2008, the Russian's net worth, perForbes, was a remarkable $23.5bn (around ‚Ç¨15.4bn or ¬£11.8bn based on historical exchange rates), which was the most the businessman has ever been worth. In May 2018 it emerged that Abramovich was experiencing difficulties with the British government regarding his application for a new visa. Some initial reports appeared to suggest that he had been denied a renewal, but subsequent reports established that his application was actually still under consideration. The Financial Timeshas reported that the Russian's 'investor visa' is thought to have expired in April and, according to the paper, his application for renewal is subject to ""extra procedural checks"" becausehe is applying from Russia, rather than the UK. Such checks are likely look closely into the sources of an applicant's wealth. As a result of the UK government's desire to conduct more thorough checks on such applications, it follows that there will be natural delays, but it is not clear how long it will take. Of course, to put things into context, the entire scenario is occurring during a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between the British and Russian governments.   Billionaires tend to be known for their extravagance and Abramovich is no different, despite his ostensibly muted demeanour. One of his biggest indulgences is the luxury yacht Eclipse, which, at 162.5 metres in length,isthe world's second largest privately owned yacht. Abramovich is thought to have paid $500m for the vessel in 2010 and, back then it was the largest yacht in the world. It has since been surpassed by the Azzam. As you'd imagine, the Eclipse is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including swimming pools, guest cabins, hot tubs and helicopter pads, with a crew of around 70 on board. For security purposes, it also has a missile detection system, a submarine and is also said to be kitted out with an 'anti-paparazzi' photo shield system. Abramovic has developed a love of luxury yachts and has owned a number of smaller vessels in the past. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The former Paris Saint-Germain boss took the reins midway through last season from club legend Frank Lampard and masterminded a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for the Blues, capped with Champions League glory. Abramovich is set to sell the club amid the escalation of the Ukraine-Russia crisis, with rumours circling that Tuchel could follow him and instead head to Manchester United as Ralf Rangnick's successor - but the coach has brushed off such talk. ""I hope I made it very clear that I am very happy where I am,"" Tuchel said. ""My first talks were with Marina [Granovskaia] and Petr [Cech] and still my talks are with these two, who are the representatives and most decisive people in the club apart from the owner. ""I was involved with them and I enjoyed it and for me it was, until today, a perfect fit and I hope it will stay like this. I see for me personally no reason to enter any thoughts even of losing that. ""It is not finished here, by far not finished and it just started and is so promising, we have a strong group and a strong club."" The German has quickly written his name in club history and stressed his happiness, adding: ""Sometimes in life and in professional life you need the luck to enter an environment where you feel yourself comfortable and everybody else feels comfortable with you. ""In the moment I feel this is the case and I appreciate that a lot and I am not keen, not at all, to change."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues strengthened their hold on third place with a 1-0 win at Selhurst Park, thanks to Hakim Ziyech's 89th minute strike. But Lukaku once more failed to impress, or indeed even make himself noticed out on the pitch in south London. The ex-Inter man recorded the first touch of the afternoon on Saturday, kicking off for Chelsea to get proceedings underway. 2 - Romelu Lukaku had just two touches of the ball in the first half against Crystal Palace, with one of those being the first pass of the game from kick-off. Ghosted. pic.twitter.com/lS4zCe3FQp But that was about all Chelsea fans saw of him in a dire opening 45 minutes for the Belgian, who mustered just one more touch before the half-time whistle blew. The second half was hardly any better and he finished the match having had contact with the ball on just seven occasions, one of which was that kick-off - fewer than any Premier League player since Opta data started being recorded (2003-04). 7 - Romelu Lukaku had just seven touches against Crystal Palace, the fewest in a single Premier League game for a player with 90+ minutes played since this data is available in full for the competition (2003-04). One of those touches was from kick-off in the first half. Quiet. Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge to great fanfare over the summer, having proved crucial in Inter's successful bid to reclaim the Serie A title from Juventus for the first time in 10 years. But his second spell at Chelsea has so far fallen well short of expectations following his reported club record ¬£97.5 million move. The Belgian managed 24 Serie A goals last term but has netted just five times in 17 Premier League games this time round, while he also provoked the wrath of the Chelsea support with an explosive Sky Sport Italia interview in December in which he admitted misgivings over manager Thomas Tuchel's methods and that he had never wanted to leave Inter in the first place. Questioned over Lukaku's dismal display on Saturday, Tuchel told reporters: ""I'm not so sure if I have a good answer. I don't know what it says. ""It says he was obviously not involved and could not make a point today. I am not sure if it says so much about us in general."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

152,https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His ¬£2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a ¬£1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old ‚Äì who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance ‚Äì has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I‚Äôve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don‚Äôt mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss ‚Äì who is said to be worth ¬£4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes ‚Äì has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: ‚ÄúAbramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him ¬£2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. ‚ÄúAs of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.‚Äù The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of ¬£4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted ‚ÄúI wish to explore this, Chelsea‚Äù when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: ‚ÄúChelsea for sale, ¬£3bn. Let's buy it.‚Äù McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his ¬£8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding ‚Äì a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction ‚Äì Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: ‚ÄúI think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.‚Äù GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben‚Äôs father and uncle ‚Äì who form part of a ¬£12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a ¬£300m ($391m) takeover at St James‚Äô Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than ¬£1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich‚Äôs last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a ¬£20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe ‚Äì who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‚ÄúThere was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. ‚ÄúThe issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.‚Äù Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin ‚Äì the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over ¬£20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just ¬£140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured ‚Äì with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a ¬£3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

153,https://www.goal.com/en/news/boehly-led-ownership-consortium-now-preferred-chelsea-bidder-but-/blt30c8d1ac1dfd9786,"Boehly-led consortium set to become Chelsea owners, but Jim Ratcliffe not ruled out","Chelsea have decided that a Todd Boehly-led group of investors is the preferred bidder to take over the club from owner Roman Abramovich, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government. Boehly, who co-owns the Los Angeles Dodgers in the United States, is now set to become the Blues' owner with voting rights split among other investors, and he sees his bid 66 per cent backed by Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm. Still, the club, which is expected to fetch a world record-breaking fee for a sports team after a bidding war between various parties, could yet see another entity such as Jim Ratcliffe win out - though GOAL understands that's unlikely at this stage. Boehly runs 60 per cent of the $6 billion valued investment firm Eldridge Industries from which he runs most of his investments, except for the Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers which are private investments. In 2019, Boehly had a ¬£2.2 billion bid rejected by Abramovich for Chelsea. He followed that up with an interview in Bloomberg where he stated his interest in getting involved in Premier League football. ‚ÄúFootball is the biggest sport in the world,‚Äù Boehly insisted. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe American football can get to use the word ‚Äòfootball‚Äô because to me that word should be football. The fact is it is still the best product in the world. It‚Äôs 90 minutes so it has a great timeline. The passion that the fans have for the activity and the sport and the teams is unparalleled. So when you start to think about what you‚Äôre trying to build with these teams is, you‚Äôre really trying to A, win and B, be part of the community.‚Äù One of his investments is in Fortnite, the supremely popular video game. He is estimated to have a personal net worth ¬£3.3 billion ($4.4bn). His last-minute ¬£4.25 billion bid (which comprises a ¬£1.75 billion investment over 10 years, plus ¬£2.5 billion to a ""charitable trust"" likely to be related to the war in Ukraine) came as a surprise late in the process on Friday morning. It changes the landscape of the process which is run by New York investment bank Raine Group. It's unclear whether the bid will be allowed as the process has been designed to narrow down the options and it has missed several deadlines. A statement read: ""Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for ¬£4.25bn. ¬£2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with ¬£1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. ""This is a British bid, for a British club. ""We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending ¬£1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world‚Äôs greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs games. ""And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. ""We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game ‚Äì not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason. ""No further comment will be made from Sir Jim or INEOS during the bidding process."" The private equity firm Clearlake Capital is thought to be stumping up around 50 per cent of the bid to buy Chelsea. Alongside him is his long-term business partner Hansjorg Wyss, the Swiss billionaire who first announced that Abramovich was selling Chelsea. The Dodgers' principle owner Mark Walter is part of the group alongside British investor Jonathan Goldstein. Advising the bid are prominent Chelsea supporters Danny Finkelstein, who is a conservative member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a marketing executive. The Chelsea supporting former British politican George Osborne is advising the bid through his firm Robey Warshaw, with Goldman Sachs also working in an advisory role. Any prospective bidder has been asked to guarantee a minimum of ¬£1 billion further investment over 10 years which would go towards the stadium, women's and academy teams. Along with the costs of buying the club, it would raise the overall financial commitment of the project to between ¬£3.5 billion and ¬£4 billion. Like the other potential options, the new Blues owners have promised investment into all areas of the club and to work on the stadium. Architects Jane Marie Smith and David Hickey, the latter who is the former project director for Abramovich‚Äôs now-cancelled 60,000-seat redevelopment, are being consulted about reviving plans for Stamford Bridge. The Premier League will conduct an owners and directors test on the group that is expected to take roughly two weeks. Once they've gained approval, the UK government will handle the money from the sale and issue an operating licence that frees up the club from the restrictions of sanctions. It will allow Chelsea to renew contracts, make signings and sell players - along with running their club shop and selling tickets to new customers for matches. It will also cut out Abramovich from the club and end a 19-year ownership period that saw the Blues win 21 trophies. The money will be frozen or given to charity with that stage yet to be fully thrashed out. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The England international saw one of his uprights struck by a shot from Kai Havertz during the second half on Merseyside, with a full-length dive seeing him get nowhere near that strike. He was, however, to bounce back to his feet and fall away towards his other post as Azpilicueta sought to rattle home a rebound for the visitors.

""Our character and team spirit drove us on today and with the fans behind us like they were it was incredible. Now is about today, we will enjoy it, but come next week we will be focused on the next games. ""I worked hard all week. It is rewarding when you make the saves to help the team out as they help you out as well. It is a team effort and that was my job. ""We know their quality, they are Champions League winners and we got the feeling at Goodison that with hard work and dedication we would get the result. ""The fans are very passionate. To get that buzz on the bus coming in it touches you. We have still got five games, we will take them as they come."" Asked about Pickford's save from Azpilicueta, Toffees captain Seamus Coleman said: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class and we see that on a daily basis in training and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class. ""I have been here a long time and never been in this situation but never felt like I did coming into the stadium today - the flares and genunine passion in grown men's faces singing the Everton songs, if that doesnt touch you as players you mgiht as well hang up the boots."" Pickford headed into a meeting with Chelsea on Sunday boasting just five clean sheets to his name from 30 Premier League appearances. He was, however, fully aware of how important it would be for Everton to shut out the top-four hopefuls on home soil. Toffees fans did their bit before kick-off in a passionate show of support outside Goodison, with the plan being to inspire those taking to the field. Richarlison fired Everton in front against Chelsea early in the second half, following a mistake by Azpilicueta, before Pickford got in on the act by frustrating Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs side at the other end of the field.

The USMNT international has struggled for regular action under Thomas Tuchel this season, with just 17 of his 34 appearances in all competitions so far being from the start. He was once again on the bench against Everton on Sunday despite scoring a late winner as a substitute against West Ham last weekend. Pulisic did make it onto the pitch at Goodison Park, replacing Timo Werner after 68 minutes, though he could not prevent a 1-0 defeat against the Toffees. Taking to Twitter after that game, Pulisic senior, Mark Pulisic, tweeted and then deleted: ‚ÄúThe sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London.‚Ä¶ puts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boy‚Ä¶big six months ahead.‚Äù Pulisic told Tuchel he ‚Äúalways wanted to be on the pitch‚Äù after his late winner against the Hammers last weekend, so to find himself on the bench once more at Goodison is likely to have been a huge disappointment. Despite being a talismanic presence for his country, Pulisic struggles to command a regular starting spot for the Blues. He has made just 10 starts in the Premier League this season, with his cameo at Goodison his eighth appearance off the bench. Pulisic‚Äôs last start in a Premier League fixture came against Burnley on March 5, when he also found the target in a 4-0 win. His father‚Äôs tweet suggests frustration at the forward‚Äôs predicament is rising, though whether it will lead to a push for a summer move remains to be seen.

The Blues headed to Goodison Park for their latest Premier League fixture aware that victory over their relegation-haunted opponents would cement a standing inside the top four and start to rebuild confidence during an inconsistent run. They were, however, to suffer a shock setback following a solitary strike from Richarlison, with Tuchel deciding not to introduce ¬£98 million ($123m) frontman Lukaku when his side needed attacking inspiration during the second half on Merseyside. Chelsea did make three changes against the Toffees, with Italy international midfielder Jorginho forced off at the break. From there, Tuchel opted to introduce Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech when hunting an equaliser and told reporters afterwards when quizzed on why Lukaku remained rooted to the bench: ‚ÄúBecause we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.‚Äù ""Thanks for that"" üòÖ pic.twitter.com/lTO9aOla9h After drawing a blank at Everton, Chelsea have now found the target just twice across their last three Premier League outings.

Asked about a lack of firepower, the German said: ‚ÄúIf there is something I can do I will try it but if I knew about it I would have done it before. ‚ÄúFor me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game, more open and fluid, finally scored late and conceded straight away. For me it is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistake and that gives us the chance to score late. ‚ÄúIf you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.‚Äù Chelsea, who have seen Lukaku fail to register a Premier League goal since December 29, will be back in action next weekend when playing host to Wolves.

The 34-year-old has been in impressive form in recent weeks, scoring eight and assisting three in his last seven games, so it is no surprise manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been desperate to keep him. The news he has agreed to stay is a boost to Solskjaer, who sees the Uruguayan as a mentor to others in the squad as well as being an asset for his goal contributions. ‚ÄúOver the season, I have developed a great affection for the club and everything that it represents,"" Cavani  told  the club's official website.""I feel a deep bond with my team-mates and the staff who work behind the scenes here. ‚ÄúThey give me extra motivation every day and I know that together we can achieve special things. From the very first moment that I arrived I felt the confidence of the manager.As a player, this belief gives you the prefect opportunity to play your best football and I want to thank him for that. ‚ÄúI have been touched with how much the supporters have wanted me to stay and I will give everything to bring them happiness and joy with my performances on the field. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not yet been able to play in front of the Old Trafford crowd and that is something that I cannot wait to do.‚Äù The United manager has made it clear for a long time that he wanted the forward to stay and is understandably delighted he has committed to another year. He said: ‚ÄúI said when Edinson signed that he would bring energy, power and leadership to this group and I haven‚Äôt been proved wrong. He has been everything I thought he would be and more. ‚ÄúAs coaches, we knew about his goalscoring record. However, it is his personality that has brought so much to this squad -he has a winning mentality and has an unequivocal attitude to everything he does. ‚ÄúEdinson is one of the last to leave the training ground and sets the tone for the upcoming youngsters with his approach to his profession every single day. ‚ÄúI have always wanted him to stay and experience the way our fans will respond to him as a player and this means he will hopefully get that opportunity.‚Äù Cavani has 15 goals for United this season, with nine of those coming in the league. While he has had impressive performances throughout the campaign, he has reallystepped up in the last month where he has managed eight goals and three assists in his last seven appearances. It‚Äôs great news for Solskjaer and United that Cavani has decided to stay for another year and even better news for the fans who have yet to see him perform in person. While his goal contributions have been key, it is his experience that is invaluable and he can be seen coaching Mason Greenwood in games, advising him on his positions and when to run. United have been lacking a natural No.9 for a long time and the veteran has filled that void perfectly. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A highly-rated product of the Old Trafford academy system has become the top-scoring teenager in the club's history in the Premier League, with a 16th strike recorded in a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. The Red Devils' all-time leading marksman, Rooney, now sits second on that list, with Greenwood determined to ensure that a notable bar is raised out of reach of others before he celebrates his20th birthday on October 1. Greenwood told MUTV of a record-setting strike and topping a legend: ""I just knew that he [Tyrone Mings] was coming tight to you in the box, so if you get a little movement then you can get half a yard. I finished it well, I'm happy with my goal. ""Hopefully there are many more to come. I'll try and keep scoring goals so no one else can come and break the record in the future! I‚Äôm happy scoring goals."" Greenwood hit 17 goals across all competitions last season - in what was a breakthrough campaign for him - with 10 of those efforts coming in thetop flight. He is up to 11 in the current campaign and believes there is more to come as important lessons are taken from those around him, including 34-year-old frontman Edinson Cavani - who could be sticking around on a new contract.  ""You always know what he‚Äôs going to do but you still can‚Äôt seem to stop him,"" Greenwood said of his vastly-experienced team-mate. ""It‚Äôs nice to watch him off the bench. It‚Äôs the movement, everyone knows he can do it but it still seems they‚Äôre not able to stop him. ""We‚Äôre all learning off him, me, Rashy [Marcus Rashford], Amad [Diallo]... we‚Äôre all looking up to him."" The efforts of Greenwood and Cavani are helping to put United in contention for a top-four finish and Europa League glory. An impressive record on the road, which has delivered no Premier League defeats this season, is aiding that cause, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be keen to see his side buck a trend that has left them having to stage stirring fightbacks on a regular basis. Greenwood added, with the Red Devils conceding first again at Villa: ""We‚Äôve got a little bit of a bad habit.It‚Äôs not so bad if we come and get the three points; it‚Äôs just a wake-up call when they score. ""We know we can come back second half and get the three points. We need to work on it and not give little goals away in the first half so we don‚Äôt have to come back from behind.""

GOAL confirmed the Portugal captain would not be in the squad for the clash that United ultimately lost 4-1, with questions having been raised over whether he was actually injured. Head coach Ralf Rangnick had explained that Ronaldo was struggling with a hip flexor issue, but some were unconvinced by the German's official line. Indeed, former Red Devil Roy Keane expressed his scepticism before the match, telling Sky Sports: ‚ÄúWe talk about Ronaldo being some sort of machine, he's very rarely injured and then every now and again he comes out with something like that and says hip flexor. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt add up to me.‚Äù Ronaldo's sister then caused further controversy by liking an Instagram post that claimed the attacker was not injured or ill but actually 100 per cent fit, amid rumours that he had flown to Portugal on his private jet. It now appears that Rangnick was telling the truth the whole time, however, with Ronaldo having posted an image of himself training in full United gear. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner wrote: ‚ÄúHard work towards a strong recovery. Eager to get back on the pitch and help the team.‚Äù United's main goal this season is to finish in the top four of the Premier League, with the Old Trafford outfit currently sitting in fifth, one point behind Arsenal who have three games in hand. Next up for United is a visit from in-form Tottenham on Saturday, with Spurs having nine goals across their previous two top-flight matches. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The 37-year-old was not even at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday to witness another demoralising setback for the Red Devils at the hands of Premier League title-chasing neighbours, with a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner reportedly flying back to his homeland. Interim United boss Ralf Rangnick claimed that Ronaldo had been left out of his plans after picking up a hip problem, but there has been plenty of speculation to suggest that he was overlooked in what has become a frustrating first season back at Old Trafford for an all-time great. A post from a Ronaldo fan account posted prior to a meeting between the red and blue halves of Manchester read: ‚ÄúCristiano Ronaldo is not injured and is not sick. The man is 100%. ‚ÄúGood morning to you who, like me, are sad and angry because Rangnick decided to ruin our Sunday by taking CR7 out of the derby against Manchester City simply for tactical reasons, to defend himself more in the game.‚Äù Said post was subsequently liked by Ronaldo‚Äôs sister Katia Aveiro in what is considered to be a nod towards a superstar performer being omitted for other reasons. Rangnick told reporters before and after a heavy defeat for his side against City that Ronaldo was nursing an injury. He said: ‚ÄúI have to believe my medical department, our doctor came to see me Friday morning before training and said Cristiano could not train because of some problems with his hip flexor and the same Saturday.‚Äù Former United captain Roy Keane was, however, among those to question the official line coming out of United before a ball had been kicked in the latest instalment of a long-running derby feud. The ex-Red Devils midfielder told Sky Sports when asked if there was something more to Ronaldo‚Äôs absence than a slight knock: ‚ÄúThere seems to be. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like it when the manager talks about this hip flexor, I don‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúWe talk about Ronaldo being some sort of machine, he's very rarely injured and then every now and again he comes out with something like that and says hip flexor. It doesn‚Äôt add up to me.‚Äù With Edinson Cavani also ruled out for United against City, and with Marcus Rashford only named on the bench, Rangnick opted to start with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in attacking roles. That plan backfired as, despite holding their own for long periods in the first half, the Red Devils slipped to a heavy defeat which has put a serious dent in the club‚Äôs top-four ambitions. United sit fifth in the Premier League table as things stand, one point behind fourth-placed Arsenal but with the Gunners holding three games in hand and with a chasing pack behind them still within touching distance.

Speculation regarding a potential move away from Old Trafford for an all-time great has been bubbling away for some time, with those rumours coming to the boil after a supposed injury ruled the talismanic figure out of a derby date with Manchester City. Rather than support his team-mates at the Etihad Stadium in what turned out to be a humbling 4-1 defeat, Ronaldo headed to his homeland for some mid-season rest and relaxation and saw serious questions asked of why he was absent and how long a second stint with the Red Devils will last. Quizzed on Ronaldo‚Äôs fitness ahead of a home date with Tottenham on Saturday, Rangnick ‚Äì who claimed the 37-year-old was nursing a hip complaint heading into a meeting with City ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúHe resumed training yesterday, trained the whole day yesterday, he trained well like the rest of the day. I would have thought he would be available tomorrow.‚Äù The German tactician, who is only occupying United‚Äôs dugout until the end of the season, was then pressed on whether Ronaldo appears disillusioned with life at a club they are struggling to chase down a top-four finish in 2021-22. Rangnick said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve not asked him if he‚Äôs happy. For me it‚Äôs important he‚Äôs fit again. We will see with which formation and line up we will play tomorrow.‚Äù He added on Ronaldo‚Äôs trip to Portugal which generated more unwelcome headlines and questions of his commitment to a collective cause: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to look back, it doesn‚Äôt make sense at all to go through it all ago. He and Edi [Cavni] are both back in training and are both available for tomorrow.‚Äù Ronaldo signed a two-year contract when returning to United in the summer of 2021 and has hit 15 goals through 30 appearances this season, but it remains to be seen whether a lucrative agreement in Manchester will be honoured by all parties.

The 26-year-old has fallen down the pecking order with the Premier League heavyweights, with just two top-flight starts for the Red Devils taken in this season. With five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line and Edinson Cavani providing an experienced alternative in a central striking berth, Martial is ready to take on a new challenge elsewhere. Philippe Lamboley, executive director of USFA Management, told Sky Sports News: ‚ÄúAnthony wishes to leave the club in January. ‚ÄúHe just needs to play. He doesn‚Äôt want to stay in January and I will speak to the club soon.‚Äù Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United in January, his agent has revealed üëã pic.twitter.com/hQjHLHhsiV  Martial joined United from Monaco in September 2015, becoming the most expensive teenager in world football at the time. A bright start was enjoyed to life in England, as he netted on his debut against Liverpool and registered 17 goals across his debut campaign. Productivity started to dip from that point, though, with Martial often asked to fill a wide attacking role rather than a spot down the middle. He eventually got his wish in 2019 when, following the departure of Romelu Lukaku to Inter, he was handed the No.9 shirt at Old Trafford for a second time ‚Äì having initially given it up to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2016. Martial found the target on 23 occasions with that shirt on his back, with a new personal best recorded, but he started to slip back out of favour again. Ronaldo‚Äôs return to English football in the summer of 2021 has proved to be the final straw for the ambitious Frenchman, with a lack of minutes leading him to start exploring other options. Martial does still have three years left to run on his current contract, which means that United will be able to demand a sizeable fee from any suitors.

The Netherlands international midfielder completed a move to Old Trafford in the summer of 2020 despite the Red Devils already boasting plenty of options in his area of the field. Game time for the 24-year-old has proved hard to come by, with Ince questioning why those calling the shots at Unitedcontinue to tell a fringe player that he has a role to play. Former United star Ince told the Kelly and Wrighty Show of Van de Beek and his troubled time in England: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to buy a player, a top player from Ajax, the first thing I‚Äôm going to say is, ‚ÄòAm I going to play? Where do you see me fitting in, within the system, within the team?‚Äô ‚ÄúAs a manager you have two choices ‚Äì you can either tell the truth or not tell the truth. From what I‚Äôm seeing for the last year and a half, he‚Äôs not told Donny the truth, he hasn‚Äôt had any game time. He‚Äôs got ¬£35 million sitting on the bench. ‚ÄúI can hold my hands up if I‚Äôm on the bench and the team are winning and playing well. You can‚Äôt tell me that Fred and [Scott] McTominay are playing well week in and week out, and even [Paul] Pogba because they‚Äôre not. ‚ÄúBut he seems to play them all the time, and I‚Äôm sitting there watching them play, I would be livid. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been professional, he‚Äôs done everything by the book. Ole‚Äôs come out saying he‚Äôs in my plans, obviously he‚Äôs just blatantly lying, he has to move in January for the good of his career.‚Äù  Van de Beek knew that he was going to face a battle for minutes when leaving Ajax for Old Trafford. He is competing with Fred, McTominay, Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Bruno Fernandes and Juan Mata for a starting spot under Solskjaer. United handed Van de Beek 36 appearances across all competitions last season, but only four of those were Premier League starts. He has seen just five minutes of top-flight football in 2021-22 and was hauled off at half-time during his only Champions League outing of the current campaign ‚Äì in a 2-1 defeat to Young Boys. His last appearance came on September 22 in a Carabao Cup defeat to West Ham, with frustration starting to boil over for a man that has been heavily linked with the likes of Everton and Newcastle ahead of the January transfer window.

164,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-fernandes-rashford-casualties-rangnick-regime/blt9a04228bd44e73ea,Will Man Utd stars Fernandes and Rashford be the first casualties of the Rangnick regime?,"Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs regime is four Premier League games old and everyone has been patiently waiting for it to click. Three meetings with relegation-threatened sides seemed like the perfect opportunity for the German to stamp his authority on the squad and get things back under control at Old Trafford, after the chaos caused by the sudden slump under previous manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, aside from the opening 25 minutes against Crystal Palace, it hasn‚Äôt been the dream beginning many were expecting. The performances against Norwich and Newcastle left a lot to be desired and while the display against Burnley was far from perfect, it was an improvement, undeniable step in the right direction. ‚ÄúOffensively, that was the best performance so far,‚Äù Rangnick told reporters. ‚ÄúThe whole team performance was a lot better. I was pleased with the performance of our wingers. Jadon [Sancho] did well.‚Äù It wasn't only United's best attacking performance since he took charge last month; it was their best of the season. They attempted 18 shots and had six on target ‚Äì significant increases on their 2021-22 averages (13.7 shots; 4.9 on target). Encouraging numbers for those who started against the Clarets at Old Trafford, but what does that clear improvement mean for those who were left out? The two most notable absentees were Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. The Portugal international was serving a one-game suspension, after he picked up his fifth yellow card of the campaign in the draw at Newcastle, but, in truth, it would have been a fair reflection of his recent displays if he'd been told by his manager to sit out Thursday night‚Äôs game anyway. By his own high standards Fernandes has set for himself since arriving just under two years ago, he has been off the pace this season. After 18 league games last term, he had already racked up 11 goals and seven assists. At the same stage this year, he is on five league goals and just three assists. On the whole, though, his performances just haven‚Äôt been as good. His pass average per league game is down from 57 last season to 51 in 2021-22. He also topped the chart for losing possession against Newcastle, with Rashford a close second. The front four in the 4-2-2-2 formation Rangnick fielded in that game just didn‚Äôt click. Is that because Fernandes was asked to play in a position that isn‚Äôt his best? He has thrived as a No.10 for the past two years, deployed as the team's creative hub. He is not a wide player, but that is exactly the role he is asked to fulfil in a 4-2-2-2, and also the 4-2-4 which United played against Burnley. Fernandes cut a frustrated figure as he aimlessly chased down balls at St James‚Äô Park and he was banned for the Burnley game after being booked for dissent. Indeed, Fernandes was one of the ""whingebags"" former United full-back Gary Neville referred to in his match analysis on Sky Sports. Rangnick‚Äôs hand was obviously forced when it came to playing without Fernandes but one wonders if the performance against Burnley will make the manager wonder whether he can really accomodate a No.10 in his preferred set-up. ‚ÄúIt was the right players in the right position,‚Äù the German pointed out. ""For me, it was important to have every player in his best possible position, which is why we decided to play Jadon from the left and Mason from the right, with the two strikers up front.‚Äù Sancho and Greenwood added width to the attack, and the link-up with Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo caused problems. So, where does that leave Rashford? The England international hasn‚Äôt been terrible this season but his form since returning from a lengthy injury lay-off has been underwhelming. He has scored just twice in 10 Premier League appearances, his average passes per game tally is down from 32 to 20 compared, and he has just one assist to his name. There is certainly room for improvement. The good news for Rashford is that Rangnick has already admitted that he will not be able to persist with his 70-year-old strike force of Cavani and Ronaldo for every game. So, Rashford's chances will come, in every sense, so it's up to him to take them. It's a similar story with Fernandes, who will no doubt start against Wolves on Monday evening. United still need to improve at the back but if Rangnick feels that he has now found the right formula from an attacking perspective, then Rashford and Bruno both need to up their games in order to avoid becoming the first high-profile casualties of the Rangnick regime.

Ronaldo completed arguably the biggest transfer of 2021 when he rejoined United from Juventus for ¬£20 million ($27m) in August. The 36-year-old has since proven that he has lost none of his sharpness in front of goal by finding the net 14 times in 21 appearances, but the Red Devils have not been nearly as consistent as a collective, which he admits has been a source of major frustration. Ronaldo took to social media to reflect on another stellar year that also saw him round off his time at Juve with two more domestic trophies before taking home the Golden Boot for Portugal at the European Championships. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner is demanding far more from his United team-mates in the second half of the season, though, as he wrote on Instagram: ""2021 is coming to an end and it was far from being an easy year, despite my 47 goals scored across all competitions. ""At Juventus, I was proud to win the Italian Cup and the Italian Supercup, and become the Serie A Top Scorer. For Portugal, becoming the Euro Top Scorer was also a high point this year. And of course, my return to Old Trafford will always be one of the most iconic moments in my career. ""But I‚Äôm not happy with what we are achieving in Man United. None of us are happy, I‚Äôm sure of that. We know that we have to work harder, play better and deliver way more than we are delivering right now. ""Let‚Äôs make this New Year‚Äôs Eve a turning point of the season! Let‚Äôs embrace 2022 with a higher spirit and a stronger mentality. Let‚Äôs take us above and beyond, let‚Äôs reach for the stars and put this club right where it belongs! Join us, we‚Äôre counting on all of you! ""Happy New Year and see you soon!"" With the additions of Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho in the summer transfer window, the Red Devils initially looked well placed to challenge for the title at the start of the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United started brightly but quickly faded, suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of Liverpool, Manchester City and Watford, with Solskjaer ultimately paying the price with his job. Ralf Rangnick has now taken the managerial reins on an interim basis, and has overseen three wins and two draws from his first five games at the helm, with Wolves up next on Monday. A 3-1 victory against Burnley last time out, during which Ronaldo netted his eighth Premier League goal of the campaign, served to raise fresh optimism, but United now have a real fight on their hands to finish in the top four. An early exit in the Carabao Cup saw another chance for silverware fall by the wayside, but supporters will hope that Ronaldo and Co. can go all the way in either the Champions League or FA Cup as Rangnick continues to try and mould the squad in his own image.

United forked out a world record fee of ¬£80 million ($108m) to sign Maguire from Leicester in August 2019, and less than six months later, he replaced Ashley Young as captain following the full-back's move to Inter. Maguire has faced extra scrutiny ever since, and seems to have buckled under that pressure this season as the Red Devils have fallen to sixth in the Premier League table, leading to widespread calls for the armband to be passed on. Ferdinand, who was never made United's official captain but deputised regularly during his 12-year career at Old Trafford, has suggested that Maguire was too inexperienced to take on such a big responsibility. Asked whether the 28-year-old would have been dropped from the starting XI by now if he wasn't captain, the former Red Devils defender told Vibe with Five: ""The fact that he has had the armband has given him that grace. Which it would do. I think he was given it too early. ""It‚Äôs a hard enough job coming into Manchester United, getting your feet under the table and starting to feel comfortable as it is without the added pressure of being captain. ""Being captain is a massive responsibility, there is history that goes with it, a big weight on your shoulders. ""You need to experience being there for a period of time to carry that weight. It was more important for Maguire to come in and concentrate on becoming a Manchester United mainstay than being captain."" While Maguire is only halfway through his third season with United, De Gea has now been at the club for over a decade and has Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup winners' medals to his name. Ferdinand has suggested that if interim boss Ralf Ragnick were to pass the captaincy burden onto De Gea it would ease the pressure on Maguire, with the squad currently preparing for a must-win home game against Wolves on Monday. ""The thing you can counter that [Maguire criticism] with is that there weren‚Äôt many captains at the club - who else are they going to pick?"" he added. ""David de Gea would have been my choice because of the time he‚Äôs been there and he knows what it takes to win. ""This is all with hindsight but you have to got to think about these times that might come with someone like Harry Maguire, new at the club in that sense. And that added pressure is weighing on him heavily at the moment.""  Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Lingard returned to United in June after a successful six-month loan spell at West Ham, where he scored nine goals in 16 Premier League games to help David Moyes' side qualify for the Europa League. Moyes openly admitted that the Hammers were eager to sign the 28-year-old on a permanent deal, but they failed to do so before the summer deadline, and his assistant has suggested that the midfielder made the wrong choice over his future. Pearce believes Lingard could end up making a U-turn when the transfer market reopens due to the fact his considerable talents are being wasted at Old Trafford. ""He's missed the opportunity to leave United in this transfer window,"" the West Ham coach has told talkSPORT. ""He can reassess his situation come January once again and decide whether there‚Äôs an opportunity to move clubs. He holds the cards, Jesse. ""The most important thing for him at the moment is his football. He's playing the odd game for United and also playing extremely well for England - and those performances for England might help him get in the United side. ""I think he‚Äôs too good a player to be sat on the outside of it not playing and he‚Äôs at an age where he needs to be playing."" Lingard has featuredin 211 games across all competitions for United since making his debut back in 2011, scoring 33 goals while also setting up another 20 for his team-mates. However, the England international's sole appearance for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side so far this term came from the bench, and he currently finds himself behind the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Paul Pogba and Fred in the midfield pecking order. Lingard was selected for Gareth Southgate's latest Three Lions squad despite a lack of regular minutes at club level, and scored twice in a 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Andorra at the weekend to send a statement ahead of his return to Old Trafford. He will hope to earn a place in Solskjaer's lineup for a home fixture against Newcastle on Sunday, but if he continues to play a bit-part role, West Ham could emerge as an attractive option again, particularly given the fact he is now less than 10 months away from the expiration of his contract.

The pair were among the Magpies' top transfer targets in the January window, but both ended up staying at their respective clubs. Despite Newcastle's failure to land them, Staveley said the players were eager to make the switch. She told The Athletic: ""We were 19th going into the window. So we had that, an illiquid market, and the complexity of Covid-19, which meant clubs didn‚Äôt want to sell because they didn‚Äôt know where their squads would end up. ""We had to encourage players ‚Äì ‚Äòwe‚Äôll be a safe place for you, we‚Äôll deliver and grow‚Äô. Some desperately wanted to come to us, like Sven [Botman], who still does very much and has talked very openly about that. ""Coming through all that showed us we can do it, that we can stick to our plan and if we get criticised on the last day for: ‚ÄòOh, you‚Äôre going after Jesse [Lingard]‚Äô, well, Jesse wanted to come to us. ""We did everything. We never stopped. From the start to the finish, we did not stop working."" While Eddie Howe's team missed out on two top targets, they did sign Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, Chris Wood from Burnley, Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid and Brighton's Dan Burn. They also brought in Matt Targett on loan from Aston Villa for the rest of the season. Newcastle are currently 17th in the Premier League table and two points above the relegation zone. They are looking to boost their hopes of survival on Saturday when they take on Brentford away. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

No deal was done in the last window, despite West Ham being interested in landing their former loanee on a permanent basis, and the talented 28-year-old now faces fierce competition for places in the Red Devils' ranks. He has been getting opportunities this season, with a match-winning effort against the Hammers last time out coming on the back of a costly Champions League mistake in defeat to Young Boys, but Neville believes a creative playmaker is deserving of a more regular role somewhere. Nevilletold Sky Sports: ""I still maintain he should've left but he will have his moments. I was happy to see how he bounced back after what happened in Europe in midweek. ""To bounce back and score the winner is a fantastic moment for him. He's got good character, he's a very good player and I feel he should be playing 40-45 games a season. ""He won't get that at United in terms of 90-minute starts but he's one of those players that I do feel United will benefit from having. I just thought for Jesse himself, he should've left. United could be a better team with someone like Lingard in it."" Lingard appears to have no regrets at passing up another opportunity to head through the exits, with his sights locked on bringing a five-year wait for major silverware to a close in 2021-22. With his late strike against West Ham seeing United to a 2-1 victory and 13 points from five Premier League games, Lingard told MUTV of ambition on the red half of Manchester: ""You‚Äôve got to always start well and make a statement to the rest of the teams and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing. ""The main aim is to obviously win a trophy this season and I think we‚Äôve got the squad depth to do that. The talent, everyone‚Äôs hungry to play and everyone‚Äôs working hard in training to get in that matchday squad. ""Everyone‚Äôs always ready to play, so the subs have got to be ready to make a difference. ""They‚Äôre always tough games against West Ham and to play them back to back is a little bit different, but we‚Äôll go into that game full of confidence."" He added on his muted celebration against the Hammers, who helped to get his career back on track last season: ""They supported me in the loan spell and gave me a great reception, so it was only right to pay them back.""  While Lingard's goal proved to be the difference at the London Stadium, there were many more twists to an intriguing plot. West Ham had taken the lead on home soil through Said Benrahma, only to see the evergreen Cristiano Ronaldo peg them back. Lingard's telling contribution came in the 89th minute, but there was still time after that for Luke Shaw to concede a penalty, Mark Noble to be introduced off the bench to take a spot-kick and David de Gea to save it as a thrilling contest was closed out. On seeing the Spain international goalkeeper save his first penalty in 41 attempts, Lingard said: ""David‚Äôs always been a great penalty stopper and we had confidence in him and we trusted him to make the save, which he did. ""There‚Äôs been a real togetherness and everyone‚Äôs playing for each other; we‚Äôre playing to win games and playing for our fans and staff, so everyone‚Äôs ready to play."" United will be back in action on Wednesday when facing West Ham again in the third round of the Carabao Cup. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

In a match that was vital to the club's hopes of securing Champions League football for next season, Man Utd came undone as they fell 3-1 to Arsenal, another contender in the hunt for a top-four place. With the loss, Man Utd have lost three of their last four Premier League matches, with Scholes revealing that the atmosphere around the club has deteriorated. ""It's an absolute mess. It's a disaster of a dressing room,"" Scholes said on DAZN. ""I had a quick chat with Jesse the other day. I'm sure he won't mind me saying: that dressing room is a disaster."" It's been a difficult year at Old Trafford, with neither Ole Gunnar Solskhaer nor Ralf Rangnick able to steer the club in the right direction. As things stand, Man Utd sit sixth in the Premier League with there still being a possibility that the club misses out on European football altogether for next season. Man Utd are now six points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand in fourth place, while Tottenham sit fifth, three points ahead of the Red Devils despite playing two fewer games.

David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have all failed to rekindle former glories, while Ralf Rangnick is now preparing to pass a managerial baton to Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022. Champions League football is unlikely to be agenda for the incoming Dutch coach, with another backwards step being taken on the field at Old Trafford, but are the Red Devils heading towards their worst finish in the modern era? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Manchester United's worst Premier League campaign came in 2013-14 ‚Äì in the immediate aftermath of Ferguson‚Äôs departure. The Red Devils finished that season, which saw Moyes dismissed in the April after just 10 months at the helm, in seventh spot and with just 64 points to their name. They suffered 12 defeats through 38 games ‚Äì another unwanted record in the Premier League era ‚Äì and collected 19 wins. Rank Season Points Position 1 2013-14 64 7th =2 2015-16 66 5th =2 2018-19 66 6th =2 2019-20 66 3rd United would finish inside the top four just once across the following three seasons, with point tallies in the 60s becoming an alarmingly common theme. Since that rather disastrous showing under Moyes, with Ryan Giggs taking charge on an interim basis in the wake of his departure, the Red Devils have finished with 66 points on three occasions. David Moyes' six-year contract at Manchester United would have ended today... üìùThe worst Premier League appointment ever?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/pXSIA0ysXr That return was only good enough for a fifth-placed standing under Van Gaal in 2015-16, although he did deliver FA Cup glory, while a further step backwards into sixth was taken in 2018-19 as Mourinho stumbled out of the blocks and Solskjaer wobbled on the back of an initial honeymoon period. Champions League qualification was secured with 66 points in 2019-20, as a Norwegian Treble winner saw his side into third spot, and United can do no better than hit that mark again in the present. With four games remaining in their 2021-22 campaign ‚Äì against Chelsea, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace ‚Äì Rangnick‚Äôs men sit sixth on 54 points with 12 left to play for, meaning that they may yet post a new club-record low.

Their best showing to date came in the second year of the Premier League in 1993-94, with back-to-back title triumphs wrapped up as an Eric Cantona-inspired side collected 92 points while also going on to lift the FA Cup as part of a memorable double. A year on from going one better in completing a historic Treble, the Red Devils cemented their standing as top dogs in English football by accumulating 91 points in 1999-2000, with a club-record 28 victories collected along the way while also suffering just three defeats and plundering 97 goals. Ferguson‚Äôs men broke back into the 90s a decade later, in 2008-09, and saw their defence breached just 24 times that season as they also savoured League Cup glory. Three other campaigns, including Ferguson‚Äôs farewell tour, delivered 89-point hauls, with a final tally of 75 ‚Äì on two occasions ‚Äì as low as an all-time coaching great sunk in the wake of a rebranding of the English top-flight in 1992.

Questions have been asked of whether a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner is starting to see his powers wane at 37 years of age, with his presence ‚Äì along with 23 goals ‚Äì unable to inspire an inconsistent Red Devils side to a top-four finish or major silverware in 2021-22. There have been suggestions that he could move on in the summer, but Foster sees no sign of a legendary figure slowing down and believes a standing as the greatest ever will be enhanced further as he plays on for ‚Äúanother year or two at least‚Äù. Foster, who is currently on the books at Watford, once played alongside Ronaldo at Old Trafford and believes his record-setting career places him slightly ahead of Argentine icon Messi in the GOAT stakes, telling The Mirror: ‚ÄúThe level is high as you like. For a 37-year-old, he is an absolute specimen. He is still rapid. He is just one of those who is a natural goalscorer. ‚ÄúFor me, in that eternal Messi v Ronaldo debate, he is still number one for me. ‚ÄúI think even this season people are completely mad that they think he is finished. He's not finished. Look how many goals he has scored, that's incredible. ‚ÄúFor anybody, that is a fantastic season, but because it is Ronaldo, people expect 30, 40, 50 goals. No - he is playing in a team that is not firing on all cylinders so you are not going to score that many goals anyway, but for people to say that he is finished, no chance mate. ‚ÄúHe is good to go still for another year or two at least.‚Äù Cristiano Ronaldo is the first player to score 100 league goals in La Liga and the Premier League üêê pic.twitter.com/mOddMcsk6n Ronaldo signed a two-year contract with United when making an emotional return to English football in the summer of 2021. There are still 12 months left to run on that agreement, but there has been talk of a veteran frontman taking his considerable skill set elsewhere for 2022-23. A retracing of steps to Real Madrid has been speculated on for a man that previously broke countless records in the Spanish capital, while there has been plenty of discussion regarding a fresh start in MLS. Ronaldo has offered no indication that he is readying himself for a new challenge, but a lack of Champions League football with the Red Devils may see his head turned.

Ibrahimovic joined United on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, reuniting with former Inter boss Jose Mourinho, who he had previously played under at San Siro in 2008-09. The Swede quickly became a cult figure at Old Trafford as he helped the Red Devils win a domestictreble in his first season at the club, after initially telling Cantona that he was aiming to surpass the Frenchman's own stellar legacy. Cantona is widely regarded as one of the finest players in United's history, having inspired their run to four Premier League titles in five seasons between 1992 and 1997, but Ibrahimovic has now revealed that he rejected the suggestion he would have to play in his shadow. The 40-year-old, who is currently taking in a second spell at AC Milan, told Italian broadcaster   Le lene   while out celebrating his birthday at the weekend: ""One day Cantona said to me: 'You cannot be the king of Manchester, you will have to be content with being the prince'. ""And I replied: 'But I'm not interested in becoming king, I want to be the god of Manchester'."" Cantona scored  82   goals  in  185appearances  for the Red Devils in total, winning nine trophies, while also picking up the 1993-94 PFA Players' Player of the Year award. Ibrahimovic, meanwhileonly spent two seasons at Old Trafford, the second of which was disrupted by a serious knee injury, but he managed to record  29 goals  in  53 appearances  while securing Europa League, League Cup and Community Shield honours. Ibrahimovic rejoined Milan in January 2020 after a successful stint in MLS with the LA Galaxy, and has since played a key role in helping the Rossoneri emerge as a major force inSerie A. The veteran forward is currently out of action with an Achilles issue  , but is optimistic that he will return to the pitch soon after the international break. ""Yes, it is better, only small problems but they are solved,"" Ibrahimovic said when quizzed on his fitness. ""I feel young, another year has passed and I'm just waiting to get back on the pitch."" Pressed on Milan's chances of winning Serie A this term, he added:""Who wins the Scudetto? What team does Zlatan play for...Milan? Then Milan.""

The former Manchester United man is still going strong in Italy, defying his age as he continues to play a crucial role for his side. The striker's career spans over 20 years and it seems he has no plans to end his time in professional football anytime soon. According to UEFA, Ibrahimovic said: ""The future is yet to be written. I don't plan. Let's see what happens. ""I don't want to regret stopping football and then saying that I could continue to play football because then I'd regret it for the rest of my life, seeing that I could have continued. ""I want to play as long as I can. The reality is I'll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I'm still playing. ""I know one day it will stop and I won't have that adrenaline anymore. This is a problem for every football player because you have adrenaline when you play football. ""That adrenaline, you will never get in doing something else because we are programmed. Every day we do the same thing. ""We wake up, we prepare, we train, we eat, and we rest. The next day, it's the same thing. For 20 years, you do these things, and you get adrenaline from them. ""So when suddenly you stop, you don't have this agenda, you don't get the adrenaline anymore. And when it stops, you have to take it from there and begin from zero and start something new."" The Swede has struggled with injuries this season but still managed to make 22 appearances across all competitions, scoring eight goals and grabbing two assists. His total record in Milan, including his first spell, stands at 154 appearances with 92 goals and 34 assists, so it's easy to see why he's loved at the club. Ibrahimovic's long career has seen him become a journeyman of sorts as he's played for a host of Europe's top clubs including PSG, Inter, Ajax, Juventus and Barcelona.

175,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-declares-himself-the-greatest-ever-mls-player-i/blt65c1cd38a32794b3,Ibrahimovic declares himself the greatest ever MLS player: 'I was still too alive',"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has declared himself the ‚Äúbest player to ever play in MLS‚Äù and claimed he was ‚Äútoo good for the whole competition‚Äù during his two-year spell with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Ibrahimovic scored 53 goals in 58 appearances for the Galaxy over two seasons between 2018 and 2019 before returning to Milan in Serie A. Despite leaving Galaxy empty handed, with the club failing to make the play-offs in 2018 before losing in the Western Conference semi-finals the following year, Ibrahimovic still thinks his impact warrants him the number one position. Ibrahimovic joined the Galaxy in March 2018 after his contract at Manchester United was terminated early. The then 36-year-old had only just returned from a serious knee injury the previous November and says the move across the Atlantic helped him regain full match fitness. ""I'm very happy. I'm very thankful for MLS because they gave me the chance to feel alive.‚Äù He told ESPN. ‚ÄúBut the problem was I was still too alive. So I was too good for the whole competition. That is what I showed. And I'm the best ever to play in MLS and that is not me having ego or trying to show off now. That is true. ""And when I was there, I enjoyed [it]. I had a good time. And I like the way they were working, the way they were doing the marketing stuff. ""And I think [playing in MLS] was the best way for me to come back after my injury. I was in the best condition ever. And I'm very proud I played for the MLS, because they were saying to me the stadiums are pretty empty when you play in that. ""There was no empty stadiums when I was playing. It was even overbooked, so I cannot complain, and I'm very happy I was there."" Ibrahimovic is still playing at the highest level despite being the age of 40, though injuries have limited him to 24 appearances for Milan in all competitions so far this season. His contract expires in the summer and there had been speculation he could retire - something he emphatically denied earlier this month. When quizzed on his future, the former Sweden striker did not rule out a return to the United States, either as a player or following in David Beckham‚Äôs footsteps and buying a franchise of his own. ""You never know - maybe one day I'll come back,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""So to show them how, to give them a reminder what real football is. ""So it's for two years. They get to see what real football is and I think they will never see something like that before. Maybe I come back and have my own club -- you'll never know.""

Trophies have been collected by a modern day great on a regular basis over the course of a stunning career that has seen him spend time with the likes of Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and AC Milan. There will come a day when he has to head into retirement, but when will his boots by hung up and for how much longer could he continue playing at the top level? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The self-proclaimed ‚ÄòGod‚Äô of football has never shied away from the fact that he intends to prolong his career for as long as possible. With a competitive fire burning as bright as ever within an evergreen frontman, there is no need for him to consider walking away from a profession that has made him a living legend. Zlatan at 40.So many iconic moments üòé pic.twitter.com/yRaFJlFOVV Ibrahimovic has collected league titles in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, while also claiming domestic cup honours in many of his various landing spots ‚Äì including in England when at Old Trafford. He has registered over 500 goals at club level, with time also spent in the United States with the LA Galaxy, while the target has been found on a record-setting 62 occasions while earning 121 caps for his country. As he has been showing no sign of slowing down, netting 36 times for Milan since rejoining them in December 2019, no fixed date has been set for his retirement. Niggling injuries have started to become more frequent, with knee problems holding him back in 2021-22, and Rossoneri boss Stefano Pioli has said of Ibrahimovic‚Äôs future plans as he works on rolling 12-month contracts at San Siro: ""Everyone can have physical problems, he is dealing with a knee issue now. We hope he can return before the end of the season. ""As for his future, I don‚Äôt think something has changed. I am sure he will make the best choice, and we‚Äôll back him regardless of what he decides."" Unsurprisingly, Ibrahimovic has responded to suggestions that he may be considering retirement in typically bold fashion, with the Swede posting a video on social media that shows he has lost none of his touch. He said: ""I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you."" I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you pic.twitter.com/481mnOGG2W Having made over 850 appearances on the domestic stage and well over 100 in the international arena, Ibrahimovic could be forgiven for allowing his attention to drift towards what may come next for him. He is, however, someone who has perfected the art of keeping focus locked on the present, and he is not about to change his ways. The veteran forward has admitted that the thought of having to stop playing football does scare him. He has said: ""I do feel a slight sense of panic at the prospect of retirement. ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time. ""I know the adrenaline I feel at the moment will never be the same. We are programmed to wake up, go to training, return home and rest.

He has said: ""I won‚Äôt quit until I have won something with this Milan side."" Ibrahimovic has also stated that ""the reality is I‚Äôll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I‚Äôm still playing."" He has gone on to say: ""Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. I‚Äôm not ready to smoke a cigar yet."" The world has been warned, Ibrahimovic is going nowhere any time soon and will only walk away on his own terms when there is nothing left for him to achieve. As mentioned, Ibrahimovic has collected trophies and medals just about everywhere he has been - including many individual ones such as Golden Boots and Player of the Year prizes - with his mere presence helping to raise collective standards within any squad he graces.

The Portuguese turned in a star performance against Norwich earlier this month and was one of the brighter performers in the Red Devils' loss to Arsenal last time out, as the club limps towards the end of a disappointing campaign. It has been far from an ideal homecoming for the Portuguese to his former club, and questions have been asked whether he will remain in Ten Hag's plans once the Ajax boss arrives - but three-time Ballon d'Or winner Van Basten believes he can stake his place safely. ""If Ronaldo carries on playing like he did last week [against Norwich] and scores two or three goals in a match on a regular basis, there is no need to take him out of the team,"" Van Basten told The Rondo Show. ""Ronaldo is a player who does his own thing, but as long as he delivers, you have to give him a place in the team. Ten Hag will take into account that he cannot ask the same things physically from Cristiano Ronaldo that he will be asking of an 18-year-old. ""Of course Ronaldo will need to work hard ‚Äì but I am sure he will work hard because I can see Ten Hag having an influence on him to get him to play how he wants."" Elsewhere, Van Basten warned that Ten Hag must not fall foul of the intense media cycle that follows United through their ups and downs, stressing that he needs to keep a laser-like focus on the task at hand. ""I will give Erik one piece of advice: don‚Äôt listen to the media when you start there,"" he added. ""He will have such a massive focus on his own job, on his work on the training ground and on the team. And when he does that, I am sure he can change everything at United.""

178,https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-man-utd-ronaldo-stay-ten-hag/blt8c291346b5082693,Rangnick accepts Manchester United rely on Ronaldo but remains unsure if he wants to stay and play for Ten Hag,"Manchester United have been reliant on Cristiano Ronaldo this season, admits interim manager Ralf Rangnick, however, he is still not sure if the veteran forward will be with the club next season. Ronaldo rode to United's rescue again on Thursday, scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Chelsea to keep alive their Premier League top-four hopes. There is uncertainty around Ronaldo amid the imminent change in the dugout at Old Trafford, and Rangnick cannot give firm assurances at this stage about the club's talisman. Asked by reporters after the match if United had become reliant on the 37-year-old, Rangnick indicated they did as he said: ""We go through the list of names that are missing since the West Ham game. You realise, that we have all the offensive players on the pitch, the only one on the bench was Juan Mata."" Ronaldo is the only United player to hit double figures for goals this season, his 23 in all competitions more than double that of any other man in the squad. Bruno Fernandes is second with nine. Rangnick, however, moved to defend his team, and said: ""We have to be still fair with the players. We had quite a few other players scoring goals, I remember my first 10 games and we had 10 different goalscorers. It is how many opportunities can we create and how many goalscorers we have available. ""If you compare our players with the ones Chelsea had, the bench with the one Chelsea had. This is not an excuse but it is an explanation. ""Yes, right now, we very much rely on Cristiano, he also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession. There has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers for sure."" Rangnick is moving away from the manager's seat next season, switching to a consultancy role - which it appears he will now do alongside coaching the Austria men's national team. He is being replaced as United manager by Erik ten Hag, leaving Ronaldo's status at the club more uncertain, and Rangnick refused to speculate on what the new man in charge will decide. Rangnick said: ""This is something that we should speak between Erik and the board and myself. Cristiano has another year of contract, it is also important to find out what he wants, if he wants to stay. ""Again, I haven't spoken to Erik so far so it doesn't make sense to speak about it right now."" While uncertainty blows around him, Ronaldo on the pitch was United's hero again as his equaliser earned them an important point against Chelsea on Thursday as they chase Champions League qualification. Ronaldo wrote on Instagram afterwards: ""Thanks for the support in Old Trafford tonight. As always, our fans were amazing in their effort to help the team.""

The five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner signed a two-year contract when making an emotional return to Old Trafford in 2021. He has hit 23 goals across his first season back in England, but those exploits have not been enough to deliver a top-four finish or major silverware, meaning that the all-time great may decide at 37 years of age to fulfil his ambitions elsewhere ‚Äì with a possible retracing of steps to Real Madrid being speculated on. Former Red Devils striker Berbatov told Betfair of a player he spent the 2008-09 campaign playing alongside at United: ‚ÄúRonaldo is doing incredibly well for his age with the way he plays and the goals he scores. To have so many Premier League goals in a season at his age is an incredible achievement. He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. ‚ÄúHis game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important. ‚ÄúHe has one more year at United, which is a good thing in my opinion, and now it is down to him whether he stays or leaves. I'd be glad to see him stay and of course things depend on the new manager and on what Ronaldo wants. He is an icon in football and when you are like that your opinion matters. Real Madrid want Cristiano Ronaldo to return to the club this summer ü§Ø[The Mirror] pic.twitter.com/JkD8pbPZ6k ‚ÄúI'd be happy to see him stay and continue scoring as well as helping the players around him. If he decides to go, obviously you can not blame him. When you are used to playing Champions League football every year of your career and then you don't have it, it's tough to accept. ‚ÄúHis performances this season show how well he is taking care of himself. He will want to play as long as he can and show that the impossible is possible. He has proven that he can still do it at 37 in the Premier League, he likes to prove people wrong and I'm pretty sure that he will want to continue doing that and play a few more years. ‚ÄúWhen he stops it will be a sad day for football because he's one of the true greats. That day comes for everyone.‚Äù Ronaldo has played Champions League football of some kind in every season of his senior career to date. He has not always graced the group stage and beyond of that competition, but even his 2002-03 campaign at Sporting saw him figure in a qualifying clash with Inter. Since then, he has gone on to become the all-time leading goalscorer on the elite European stage ‚Äì finding the target on 140 occasions through 183 appearances ‚Äì and has savoured continental glory on five occasions. The first of those successes came during a first spell with United in 2008, with the other four taken in during a record-breaking stint at Real Madrid between 2013-14 and 2017-18.

The German has overseen a mixed tenure since succeeding Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on an interim basis until the end of the season, with the Red Devils set for another barren campaign in terms of silverware at Old Trafford. Now, however, their coach has detailed what his successor will be looking for come the summer, adding that it will be players who wish to improve their game that will be the biggest boon to their hopes. ""It's obvious that something needs to be changed, something needs to be rebuilt in the summer,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports. ""The team could do with some more highly-talented, hungry players who really want to develop their own careers. ""I don't think it should be that much about signing big names. I wouldn't mind big names! But for me it's important about being competitive, hungry, seeing a move to a club - and I have always believed this - not only as a big contract, a big-name club, but the next logical step in his career. ""If this happens, then you have a completely different level of motivation, aspiration, inspiration to play for whatever club that is. That should be the major target for the summer transfer window."" In seeking to prove his point, the German mooted towards one of United's biggest rivals, observing that they have delivered an intelligent model of recruitment and growth when it has come to picking up their key targets over the past half-decade or so. ""Look at Liverpool,"" he added. ""When Jurgen Klopp came there five-and-a-half years ago it was early in the season, but they still finished eighth in the Premier League with a point average of about 1.6. ""If you compare the line-up from that final to now, they added top signings in almost every transfer window. Players for whom that move would've been the next step - Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane, Mo Salah. ""It shows it's possible, but you need to have both the quality and process of recruitment and players plus the best possible manager."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Swedish starlet teed up a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr for the first of his three goals against the Canaries at Old Trafford, with an all-time great netting a timely hat-trick in a Premier League fixture that the Red Devils had to win. Elanga joined in with an iconic celebration against the Canaries, with Ronaldo happy to share the limelight as part of a double act rather than have it all to himself ‚Äì a situation he has grown accustomed to down the years. Elanga has told United‚Äôs official website of fluffing his lines somewhat when trying to emulate a talismanic team-mate: ‚ÄúThat was an exciting time, the double SIUUU! ‚ÄúI didn't expect it.

The 29-year-old lasted just an hour of a European showpiece in Porto before being forced from the field following a collision with Antonio Rudiger. He suffered nose and eye injuries, with fears raised regarding his involvement at this summer's European Championship, but a quick operation has him ready for international duty. Belgium boss Martinez has told reporters when offering an update on De Bruyne: ""It went very well, very positively. We are looking forward to Monday when he will join our squad. ""That small intervention was necessary with a view to the long term. He will not need a long recovery. ""The operation only took 20 minutes. The medical staff is satisfied with the result. De Bruyne is now doing well, that's all.""  The Red Devils have one more pre-Euros friendly to take in against Croatia on Sunday. They are then due to open their quest for continental glory against Russia on June 12, before going on to face Denmark and Finland in their other Group B fixtures. Martinez's men were held to a 1-1 draw by Greece in their last outing, with there acknowledgment from within a star-studded camp that standards need to be raised. ""We have to show that we have taken a step forward in the preparation,"" Martinez added. ""We are facing a strong team, with a lot of experience and technical qualities in midfield.

The Blues restored domestic dominance at a canter after overcoming a slow start to hit their stride around the turn of the year, with a 12-point lead held over the chasing pack when passing the finishing post. Guardiola has now captured three top-flight crowns in the space of four years, with the Catalan coach once again confirming his standing as one of the very best in the business. Upon revealing their pick for a prestigious prize, the Premier League has said on its official website: ""Guardiola wins the award for a third time in his managerial career, having also claimed it in his two previous title-winning campaigns, 2017-18 and 2018-19. ""The Spaniard made history this season as his Man City side became the first team to win the title after being as low as eighth on Christmas Day, masterminding a 15-match winning run to take the PL Trophy back off Liverpool. ""He matches the three Manager of the Season awards earned by Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho, with only Sir Alex Ferguson having won it on more occasions, with 11. Those three men are also the only managers in PL history who can match Guardiola's three title wins."" ü•á Records broken and another #PL title claimed üèÜCongratulations to Pep Guardiola, your 2020/21 @BarclaysFooty Manager of the Season#PLAwards pic.twitter.com/XWplFWvvZi Having restored City to the loftiest of perches, Guardiola was the obvious choice to scoop a top coaching gong. Others caught the eye, though, in 2020-21, with Leeds United, West Ham, Leicester and Manchester United seeing their efforts recognised. The Premier League added on those that Guardiola edged out: ""The 50-year-old beat fellow nominees Marcelo Bielsa, David Moyes, Brendan Rodgers and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the season award after votes from the public were combined with those of a panel of football experts to decide the winner. ""He becomes the third 2020-21 season awards winner from Man City, after Ruben Dias was voted the EA SPORTS Player of the Season and Liam Delap named the PL2 Player of the Season."" While Guardiola was able to capture another Premier League crown, and a fourth successive Carabao Cup in 2021, European glory once again proved elusive. City did make the Champions League final, but were edged out 1-0 by Chelsea in Porto. Righting that wrong will remain a top target for Guardiola next season, with a new contract committed to in Manchester that is set to take him through to 2023.

Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side finished the season as Premier League champions and Carabao Cup winners and also reached the final of the Champions League for the first time in the club‚Äôs history. However, the season ended in disappointment with the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea and Al Mubarak says this is the moment to show they can push onto the next level. ‚ÄúOne of the things I‚Äôve learned over the years is you constantly need to bring new talent into the team, refresh and particularly when you‚Äôre at a high level, on the top,‚Äù Al Mubarak said. ‚ÄúHaving won the league, it is not the time to sit back and be content. That would actually be your biggest mistake. This is the time to send a strong message that there‚Äôs no contentment, that you‚Äôre not satisfied with just winning the league.‚Äù City have already lost two players, with Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia out of contract at the end of the season and on their way to Barcelona. Despite being successful without striker for much of the season, Al Mubarak said it was one of the positions where they will strengthen in the summer. The chairman did not put any names forward, but Tottenham‚Äôs Harry Kane is a striker that the club are understood to be interested in. Al Mubarak also confirmed that there will other newfaces, with a focus on quality rather than quantity. ‚ÄúWe lost a very important legend in Sergio Aguero, [they are] very hard shoes to fill but I‚Äôm confident we will find the right player to fill those shoes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are other areas within the team that obviously need investment, not too many. It‚Äôs not about numbers it‚Äôs about quality. ‚ÄúThe squad is a phenomenal squad, you don‚Äôt win the Premier League and reach the Champions League final if you don‚Äôt have an incredible squad and we have that.

Hot favourites to advance to a last-four clash against Bayern Munich before kick-off, Pep Guardiola's men were shocked as Lyon went through with a 3-1 victory in Lisbon. Moussa Dembele proved the hero for the Frenchman with two late goals after Maxwel Cornet opened the scoring, while City were left to lament Raheem Sterling's terrible miss with the net gaping at 2-1 down. De Bruyne's 69th-minute strike proved insufficient for the Premier League club, who once more fell short in Europe; and now he is only looking forward to a reunion with his wife and unborn child. ""I need to go home because my wife is expecting - I need something to focus on,"" the Belgium international toldBT Sportafter the final whistle in Lisbon. ""It's a different year, same stuff. First half wasn't good enough. Second half we played really well. Came back 1-1 and had couple of chances. It was then 2-1 and 3-1. ""The second half we played well had them under pressure. We were more offensive. Even at 2-1 if Ras (Raheem Sterling) scores the goal it's 2-2. They made it 3-1 and the game's over. ""Lyon didn't really create but we need to learn."" City boss Guardiola once more failed to make a mark on the Champions League, with his record of never reaching the final with either Bayern or the Citizens after winning the competition twice at Barcelona still intact. Pep's men are still yet to make it to the last four after five attempts and like De Bruyne, he is already looking forward to a break as the 2019-20 season finally comes to a close for the club. ""We are disappointed. We now go on holidays. Then we have to lift the players when they return to the club again,"" Pep explained toBT Sport. ""Sometimes you have to break the[barrier to the semis].

De Bruyne was body-checked by Antonio Rudiger after attempting a give-and-go with Riyad Mahrez early in the second half, and eventually had to leave the pitch after being assessed by City's medical staff. The Belgian midfielder, who was left with a visibly swollen eye, couldn't contain his emotions ashe made his way down the tunnel, with Pep Guardiola's men ultimately going on to lose 1-0 at Estadio Do Dragao in his absence. De Bruyne has revealed the full extent of his injuries via social media, telling his followers on Twitter:""Hi guys, just got back from the hospital. My diagnosis is acute nose bone fracture and left orbital fracture. ""I feel okay now. Still disappointed about yesterday obviously but we will be back."" City were favourites heading into the final after wrapping up their third Premier League title under Guardiola in comfortable fashion, but the Spaniard raised more than a few eyebrows by opting to leave out defensive midfield duo Rodri and Fernandinho. That decision proved costly as theManchester outfit were overrun in the middle of the park, with Timo Werner guilty of missing two gilt-edge chances before Kai Havertz slotted home the opening goal in the 42nd minute. De Bruyne toiled in vain to try and spark City into life, but his night was cut short midway through the second period after his collision with Rudiger. Guardiola subsequently brought on Fernandinho and threw Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero upfront, but the Blues managed to stand firm at the back and clinch the second European Cup success in their history. De Bruyne could now be a doubt for Belgium's Euro 2020 campaign depending on how his recovery goes, having struggled with niggling fitness issues throughout his latest campaign at City. The 29-year-old sat out 11 games in all competitions due to injury, but still managed to rack up 40 appearances for the club in total, scoring 10 goals and laying on 18 assists. De Bruyne will now likely be unavailable for Belgium's warm-up games against Greece and Croatia over the next eight days, with Roberto Martinez's side set to opentheir European Championship group stage schedule with a clash against Russia on June 12.

City will take a narrow 1-0 lead to Wanda Metropolitano after a frustrating first leg at Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night that saw them struggle to break down Atletico's stubborn rearguard. De Bruyne's 70th-minute strike ended up being the difference between the two sides, but he expressed his frustration over the visitors' set-up after the final whistle. ""Teams play very defensively [against us] but today, for the first time, I see a team playing 5-5-0,"" the Belgium international told TNT Sports. ""No strikers. So it's very hard to find the spaces."" De Bruyne added: ""In the second half we had more chances and luckily we scored one, but we also didn't give anything away and in that aspect, we played a really good game."" City boss Pep Guardiola echoed the midfielder's sentiments in his post-match press conference, adding: ""We sensed that they would play 5-3-2, then they adjusted and they became 5-5. ""In prehistory, today and in a hundred thousand years it is very difficult to attack a 5-5, there are no spaces."" Atletico didn't record a single shot at goal over the course of the 90 minutes as the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Joao Felix spent most of the evening pressing while City dominated possession. Savic shone in the heart of Diego Simeone's defence, and felt their gameplan was successful despite the defeat. ‚ÄúWe never like to lose.We're not happy because we lost, but in the end it's not a bad result, we played atCity's home and they didn't have so many clear chances,"" the Atletico centre-half told Movistar. ""They had possession but I think we lacked a bit of legs in the final third, we had some attacks withGriezmannorJoaothat we could have finished better.I'm calm because we have 90 minutes left in our stadium."" Savic also promised that Atletico will be more adventurous in the return leg as they seek to turn the contest around and reach the last four. ‚ÄúWhen you defend so low it's not easy to get out, we had two or three [counter-attacks] that we could have done better with, but we lacked legs,"" he said.

And as heads hit pillows on Sunday evening, Manchester City will still hold the slenderest of leads at the top of the Premier League table. But the defending champions might yet come to rue the chance they missed to kill the title race once and for all. They remain a point clear of Liverpool at the summit of English football and it is not inconceivable that they will hold that advantage until the last day of the season. But when Riyad Mahrez broke through deep in injury time, with only Alisson to beat, he had the chance to put a huge puncture in Liverpool's title hopes. After twice coming back, there would have been no time and no third opportunity for Jurgen Klopp's side, but City's top scorer could only loop his effort over the bar, leaving one of the most thrilling title races in years to live on. ""It's a great chance,"" admitted Kevin De Bruyne to Sky Sports at full-time. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in it's a wonder goal. ""It was hard. To be fair I think we played excellent. The way we played was very good and we should score more. It is what it is. It was a great game. ""I think it should [be more before half-time] but we were still winning. The way the second half started is the disappointment. I think we played great and created enough chances to win the game."" What a way to stay exactly where they were at kick-off - a 90 minutes of breathless, brilliant football that is already an instant classic. A match between the best two teams in England - for many the best in the world - and they delivered like they always do. A clash where the tensions will have been felt around the planet, let alone in the electric atmosphere of the Etihad Stadium. In the stands, they lived every second of it, just as they did in the dugouts. One minute, Pep Guardiola was stood two yards on the pitch trying to get his message across to his players. The next he was discarding his jacket in frustration at letting Liverpool snatch an equaliser. Jurgen Klopp was not much calmer to his right, punching the air with every tackle, turning in despair at every missed opportunity. But the two managers have only themselves to blame. Only Guardiola and Klopp could go into a game with everything on the line and give everything for a victory. Who else but Guardiola would leave Aymeric Laporte and Kyle Walker isolated against the twin threat of Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane in the opening minutes? And who would trust a goalkeeper as ridiculously calm as Ederson to let the ball drift onto his own goal-line under pressure from Diogo Jota before playing a simple three-yard pass? And, in turn, who would allow Thiago to play short square passes in his own six-yard box with five City attackers within striking distance? And who would chase a win in the final minutes at the Etihad knowing a defeat could almost destroy their chances of winning the title? From the opening minutes it was pulsating. Gabriel Jesus, Guardiola's wildcard choice for this big game, setting up Raheem Sterling, but his shot was blocked by a sprawling Alisson. But just seconds later, City were ahead. De Bruyne, always a player for the big occasion, was alert to Bernardo Silva's quickly-taken free kick before firing in a low shot that deflected off Joel Matip on its way past Alisson. Forget about City taking their usual control, though. These two sides are too good to exceed that for too long. Jota had levelled inside 13 minutes, before Jesus put the home side back ahead in the 36th minute with City creating the better chances. It was more of the same in the second half, with Mane equalising inside a minute before both sides went toe-to-toe and punch-buy-punch until the very final seconds. Guardiola and Klopp embraced enthusiastically at full-time, and the football world finally could draw breath. A game that was so good that it would probably be worth doing all over again next week. As luck would have it, these two meet at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Another classic awaits! Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

189,https://www.goal.com/en/news/simeone-would-tell-us-to-wind-big-teams-up-ex-atletico-man/blta7f5f0b7a8da2a6e,'Simeone would tell us to wind big teams up' - Ex-Atletico man Trippier praises former boss but rejects 'dark arts' label,"Ex-Atletico Madrid star Kieran Trippier revealed that he thoroughly enjoyed his time working under Diego Simeone in the Spanish capital. Trippier moved to Atletico from Tottenham in 2019 and spent two and a half seasons in La Liga before returning to the Premier League with Newcastle United at the start of the year. Simeone has received criticism in some circles for his apparently negative style of play, but his former charge is still a huge admirer of the Argentine. ""I loved playing for Simeone and thriving off defending,"" Trippier told BT Sport ahead of Atletico's Champions League quarter-final decider against Manchester City on Wednesday. ""I improved massively playing for him. He is a special guy. Many people watch the odd game, but in La Liga they play totally different football. ""Against the top teams you need to be more defensive minded. It's not fair talking about the dark arts and him. When we used to play Liverpool and Chelsea he would tell us to get in their faces and wind them up. They want to wind players up. ""From minute one he will be asking for yellow cards from the touchline and the players will be winding up others. He wants players to get around the ref. Savic will be the big one tonight, he will be in Man City's faces."" Already an established England international - and Champions League finalist - during his time with Tottenham, Trippier's move to Atletico Madrid helped take him to another level under Simeone's astute guidance. The full-back made 86 appearances in all competitions and proved a key part of the team that beat out Real Madrid and Barcelona to take the 2020-21 Liga title, the Argentine's second with the Colchoneros.

The Belgium star committed to a new deal with the Premier League side last month, extending his stay until 2025. But the 29-year-old says he took an in-depth look at the direction Pep Guardiola's side are going before signing on the dotted line. ""Me and my people around me, we just wanted to reflect on how the team is looking forward for the future,"" De Bruyne told Sky Sports. ""So it was mostly based on how the team was set up for the future, comparing with other teams, based on age, contracts... Then how I was helping the team going forward. ""It was not really comparing all the things money-wise, it was just looking at how the team was set up and what is for me the best decision to make. Not that I really needed any help in that, it's more getting the confirmation of what I already thought. It was a nice analysis to look at."" The attacking midfielder hadnot shown much interest in statistics about performances before he saw the detailed picture about the structure of the City team. ""I think sometimes, for me, statistics are a little bit too much. Especially as a midfield player, you can do so many good things that are not viewed on a stats sheet,"" he added. ""I know a lot of people are that way, in comparing people, but I don't really care. I did this stuff basically to look at team structure, team setup for the future. ""It's part of life now. It's way different to 10, 15 years ago when everything was just viewed by the eye and everybody did the eye test and that was it, 'he played good, he played not good' and that was it."" City are closing in on the Premier League title as they sit 13 points clear of Manchester United. Guardiola's team will host Chelsea on Saturday in a rehearsal of the Champions League final, which will be played on May 29. Victory against the Blues in Istanbul will see City secure a treble of trophies, having already won the Carabao Cup last month. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

191,https://www.goal.com/en/news/kevin-is-back-de-bruyne-will-keep-his-cool-for-man-city-as/blt8cf63fb3826d8cdb,Kevin is back! De Bruyne will keep his cool for Man City as the title race heats up,"Kevin De Bruyne has been known to lose his temper on the pitch. There was that infamous ""Let Me Talk"" rant when he tried to speak to the referee during Manchester City's 2-1 victory over Napoli in 2017. But when the pressure is really on, he's one of the calmest, most calculated players around - and that's just what Pep Guardiola needs as the title race heats up. Liverpool are breathing down City's necks, cutting the deficit at the top of the Premier League table to just three points before the kick-off of a must-win Manchester derby - an arena for cool heads. And in De Bruyne, City have one of the best footballing brains in the game, with an instinctive knowledge of how to pull apart a Man Utd side that was starting to believe after losing just once in their previous 20 matches. United had no answers on how to cope with City's sharp passing and intelligent movement in a one-sided match and they had given up long before VAR overturned an offside decision when Riyad Mahrez had smashed in a fourth. From early in the afternoon, De Bruyne had placed himself perfectly between United's lines and they simply didn't have the ability or awareness to stop him. Playing behind Scott McTominay and Fred and ahead of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire, United were clueless in how to curtail his influence. That he scored the opening goals in a 4-1 victory over United is indicative of the way that City share them around but also a reflection of his enduring appetite. When Bernardo Silva pulled back a low cross, De Bruyne had shaken off any sense of a marker to steer the ball through Maguire's legs. After Jadon Sancho's superb equaliser, he was again in the right place when the ball dropped loose to smash in a second. The goals were exclamation marks to an all-round performance that Ralf Rangnick must desperately want his United players to aspire to. De Bruyne's range of passing is well known and he delivered countless balls around the pitch to stretch the visitors out of shape. Surrounded by willing runners in Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Mahrez and Silva, United were unable to stop the wave of attacks. Of course there was a customary assist, although Mahrez deserves the majority of the credit for his controlled volley from De Bruyne's corner. Finally substituted in the 80th minute, he had still been chasing the ball in his own half long after Bruno Fernandes and United's forwards had given in. ""Kevin is back,"" Guardiola enthused. ""After the injuries, he was struggling for rhythm, but now he is scoring goals, playing with power. ""He is one of the top players in the world, but he still runs and works hard, I'm so proud of this guy.""  Make no mistake, United were such a potentially dangerous opponent that even Jurgen Klopp could admit to being a fan of Liverpool's deadliest rivals for 90 minutes. But the way the team that had won their last three Premier League games at the Etihad were swept aside will give a new energy to a squad that is expecting to win every match between now and the end of the season to hold off Liverpool's challenge. There are tough tests to come. Liverpool, obviously, when they visit the Etihad in April, but there are other difficult matches starting with Crystal Palace next Monday. But this is a reminder of just how unstoppable City at their best can be. ""It's about winning game-by-game,"" De Bruyne said. ""They [Liverpool] won yesterday but we responded in the right way. ""Sometimes we don't get the result but we always play the right way and we will fight until the end of the season."" De Bruyne has been here before - that famous 2019 season when City were pushed to the final game of the campaign before seeing off the Reds by a point. If they are to do it again, they will need to keep their cool. Not many do it better than De Bruyne. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

192,https://www.goal.com/en/news/not-a-good-manager-man-city-boss-guardiola-spiky-serene/bltdb6c3e09bc8c037a,'I was not a good manager' - How Man City boss Guardiola went from spiky to serene under pressure,"For such a monumental fortnight, there has been something remarkably serene about Pep Guardiola's public appearances recently. With a daunting run of fixtures against Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Atletico Madrid again and Liverpool again, that has the power to define Manchester City's season, it would be understandable if any interviews and press conferences were business-like. Particularly as the City boss has occasionally been spiky in the past in similar circumstances. However, despite the pressure of big games following big games, Guardiola more relaxed this time around, at least outwardly, making jokes or mischievously deflecting attention away from the serious matters. A question about Manchester United target Erik Ten Hag being his potential successor at the Etihad Stadium saw him quip: ""Do you want me to leave?"" On overthinking Champions League matches, his tongue-in-cheek reply was: ""I love to overthink and create stupid tactics."" And against a notoriously hostile Madrid media, Guardiola was more reserved but did offer one playful comment over Diego Simeone's ultra-defensive tactics. ""In pre-history, today and in a 100,000 years, it is very difficult to attack a 5-5,"" he said. ""There are no spaces."" When the heat is on, Kevin De Bruyne stays ice-cold üßä pic.twitter.com/z2ch82q7sR Of course, such press-room tactics have served to defuse the tension surrounding City's intimidating, make-or-break run-in, as well as transmitting a sense of calm to the dressing room. Ahead of the international break, City drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace after passing up a number of golden opportunities in front of goal that they would normally have taken. Guardiola conceded that his side had grown anxious as the game wore on, even though they had stuck to their usual tactical strategy, meaning they continued to create chances. In this week's 1-0 win over Atletico in the first leg of their quarter-final tie, openings were always going to be a premium and it was important that his players kept their cool. The already infamous 5-5-0 system employed by Simeone was virtually impregnable, with City failing to have a shot on target in the first half. However, after one free-kick on the edge of the box, Phil Foden finally crafted an opportunity for Kevin De Bruyne, with a clever turn and pass, and the Belgian kept his composure to slide the ball under Jan Oblak. Aside from their defending, Atletico's notorious ""dark arts"" also tried to derail Guardiola's masterplan with one example the way in which defenders targeted Jack Grealish as someone they could wind up. Atletico Madrid wouldn't stop playing with Jack Grealish's hair üò¨ pic.twitter.com/xcviqJmtj2 Sime Vrsaljko and Stefan Savic pulled his hair and Angel Correa blasted the ball at him from close range, and while Guardiola stepped in to break up the melee that followed, he warned his players that they cannot be drawn into petty arguments. Now comes Liverpool on Sunday, when the stakes will be higher than ever. Given both sides' ability to go on devastating winning streaks, it's possible that whoever finishes the game on top of the Premier League will not be caught. For a coach like Guardiola, who prepares and analyses his opponent in astonishing detail, this fortnight could be punishing. At previous clubs Barcelona and Bayern Munich, he would stay up until the early hours with his coaches, fretting over decisions and specific tactics. The pressure in Germany to deliver the Champions League was huge, while in Spain he gave so much to the role that he eventually took a year out of the game to recover from the ordeal. In one of the most revealing moments of City's Amazon documentary, meanwhile, Guardiola looked concerned when he and his staff discussed the threat of Liverpool's front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Four years on, Jurgen Klopp's side has only got stronger. Liverpool really found another one üò≥ pic.twitter.com/ar8wUCRFih But Guardiola is also older, turning 51 in January, and is trying to be kinder to himself, attempting to lower the stress he puts himself under before big matches. He recently confessed that it didn't come naturally, but that he has leant on calming influences around him, believing it will make him a better coach. ""I'm learning to be more patient, before I was too anxious, I was not a good manager,"" he told Sky Sports in March. ""Now, I'm better, I'm more patient. ""[The process] is so difficult because it is unnatural based on who I am, but I have people close to me that help me to be calmer. To see things like sometimes I couldn't see it."" It doesn't mean that any of the desire has been lost or the expectations on his players has been diminished. The City players will know that they will have to deliver on Sunday and that their discipline and understanding will have to be perfect. And once the game kicks off, there will be the usual wild gestures coming from the City dugout as Guardiola directs his players. The intensity will be there, but Guardiola will hope it will be accompanied by a calculated composure. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

193,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-the-premier-leagues-longest-unbeaten-record/llbau5ob6ggz1wbtn9f4f408l,What is the Premier League's longest unbeaten record?,"When you think of ""unbeaten"" and ""Premier League"", your thoughts might immediately be drawn to Arsenal's incredible title-winning campaign in 2003-04. The Gunners went an entire season without falling to defeat that year as the Premier League title was secured in style. They are the only side to have won the English top-flight crown without suffering a single setback ‚Äì hence the 'Invincibles' tag ‚Äì and though their streak remains the longest on record, others have come close to matching it. Under Arsene Wenger, Arsenal currently hold the record for the longest unbeaten Premier League run with 49 games in 2003-04. Other managers have tried to piece together an Invincibles season of their own, but all have ultimately failed. The best ever Premier League team is ____________#OnThisDay in 2004 Arsenal became invincible ü§©üíØ pic.twitter.com/EWd72DGe3Y Expectations were high for Pep Guardiola's 2017-18 Manchester City side, who appeared to steamroll over just about everyone until they paid a visit to Liverpool in January and lost 4-3, ending their dreams of an unbeaten run (they had a streak of 30 games). City ended up winning the league that season with 100 points, but not without two defeats (to Liverpool and Manchester United) blotting their copybook. Chelsea, under Jose Mourinho, managed a 40-game unbeaten run through October 2005, followed by Arsenal's 30 matches through October 2002. Liverpool became just the fourth team to record 30 straight unbeaten games in the Premier League following their victory over Crystal Palace in November 2019, in a run that started after their loss against Manchester City in January 2019. But Jurgen Klopp's side's streak ended on February 29, 2020 after a shock 3-0 loss against relegation battlers Watford. It should come as no surprise to find that Jose Mourinho figures prominently at the top of the Premier League charts when it comes to making a fortress out of a home. The Portuguese built his reputation on the sturdiest of foundations, with solidity at the back allowing those further up the field to flourish. Few visitors to Stamford Bridge during his time as Chelsea manager found a solution to the many challenges that the Blues posed. Between March 2004 and October 2008, an 86-game unbeaten run was enjoyed by the west London heavyweights in their own backyard. That remarkable sequence took in reigns from four managers ‚Äì Claudio Ranieri, Mourinho, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari ‚Äì with Arsenal‚Äôs ‚ÄòInvincibles‚Äô the last team to beat Chelsea before a Xabi Alonso winner for Liverpool finally brought the Blues back down to earth. Liverpool enjoyed a similar run of their own that also included a Premier League title triumph as they went 68 games without coming unstuck on Merseyside between April 2017 and January 2021. A title-winning era for Manchester City also makes the top five of longest unbeaten home runs, while Sir Alex Ferguson boasts two entries from his legendary stint as Manchester United manager. Date of run Team Matches unbeaten February 2004 - October 2008 Chelsea 86 April 2017 - January 2021 Liverpool 68 December 2010 - December 2012 Manchester City 37 December 1998 - December 2000 Manchester United 36 December 1994 - November 1996 Manchester United 35 Given how inconsistent Manchester United have been in more recent times, since Sir Alex Ferguson headed off into retirement back in 2013, they can take heart from boasting the Premier League‚Äôs longest unbeaten away run. They would, of course, swap that record in a heartbeat for a long-awaited piece of silverware, but positives need to be taken at Old Trafford in any form. Man Utd set the record for longest unbeaten away run in English Football League history üôå28 away games unbeaten. pic.twitter.com/BPTgePGJPO Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was the man to oversee another entry in the history books for the Red Devils, with the 1999 Treble winner guiding his side through 29 games on the road without coming unstuck between February 2020 and October 2021. That run was ended by a disappointing 4-2 reversal at Leicester and Solskjaer was out of a job by the end of November. Arsenal‚Äôs fabled ‚ÄòInvincibles‚Äô went 27 matches without suffering any kind of travel sickness between April 2003 and October 2004 ‚Äì when Wayne Rooney ended their 49-game unbeaten run in the top flight. The Gunners also completed the entire 2001-02 season without suffering an away defeat, while Liverpool went 13 months without losing on the road when chasing down a first Premier League title and Chelsea made it through 20 games in the first of their post-Mourinho eras.

194,https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-to-brazil-national-team-no-contact-for-tite/bltaf72dd7d3f2581a0,Guardiola to Brazil national team? No contact for Tite successor made but Spaniard well-liked by Selecao,"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) has not approached Pep Guardiola about succeeding Tite as their national team coach, GOAL can confirm. Marca reported this week that the Selecao have reached out to the Manchester City coach and are willing to pay him around ¬£10 million per year to take over at the helm when Tite leaves his post. Tite is set to step down from his position after the World Cup in Qatar later this year and the nation's governing body is looking for his replacement. GOAL can confirm that no formal contact has been made with Guardiola so far. At the moment, the CBF are merely evaluating the available candidates to take his place. There will be no disussion of Tite's successor before the World Cup takes place as the Selecao are concentrating fully on challenging for the title in Qatar. However, Guardiola is one of the preferred candidates of former CBF president Rogerio Caboclo. Plus, current president Ednaldo Rodrigues is not against hiring a foreign coach to succeed Tete. Guardiola suggested he would rather not take over as Brazil coach when asked by TNT Sports. ""Brazil has very good Brazilian coaches who have to coach the national team,"" Guardiola said. ""There are very good Brazilian coaches. Debate closed."" Tite will end his reign as Brazil coach at the end of the year following the World Cup in Qatar. The 60-year-old, who took charge of the national team in 2016, has recently been linked with a move to Arsenal to replace Mikel Arteta. But the former midfielder has dismissed such suggestions, saying: ""I apologise to Arsenal, but that information [that I was interested in the job] did not come from us and there is absolutely nothing to it. ""At a time of so much 'fake news', information that is not true makes me sad and I hope that this is corrected."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

195,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fear-foden-man-city-star-emerged-as-europe-finest-young/blteb14e9d5ea27ee07,Fear Foden: How Man City star emerged as Europe's finest young playmaker,"There was something reminiscent of that infamous house-burning meme at the end of Manchester City's Champions League victory over Atletico Madrid. As a mass brawl broke out on the pitch during the quarter-final second leg, and Diego Simeone tried to pull his players back from the disorder, Phil Foden gave a mischievous grin to his bench as the chaos he had caused raged on in the background. Suffering a bandaged head and battered ankles, Atleti had done everything to bully the danger man into submission but the City forward just kept bringing it back to them. And when Felipe clipped him for one last time, earning a second yellow card, Foden rolled off the pitch and back on again and the home side lost all composure. He may be fresh-faced and have the style and sophistication of a graduate brought through the Pep Guardiola finishing school, but he's a street fighter at heart. The roads of Stockport may not share the romance and intrigue of learning football on the rough barrios of Buenos Aires, but you still have to show your heart and battle for the ball before you can show your magic. And Foden is just as comfortable playing in the streets of South Manchester as the elegant surroundings of the Etihad Stadium and only had to be stopped doing so after an edict from the club warning that he was risking an injury. Atleti had tried to break him too. In the first leg, they switched off for a couple of seconds and he found the space to play a pass for Kevin De Bruyne to score what would be the only goal and winner. Simeone was determined not to allow him to do it a second time which is why he sent out his bruising henchmen to stop him by any means. Felipe started with a reckless challenge from behind that required Foden to have a concussion test before his defensive partner Stefan Savic stepped in, trying to intimidate him with an off-the-ball shoulder charge and a volley of comments. The 21-year-old kept coming back and while it wasn't the sort of performance City wanted, it was the one that was called for. ""It actually wasn‚Äôt good what we did but it didn‚Äôt have to be,"" Kevin De Bruyne said. ""Sometimes you have these games where it wasn‚Äôt a football game in the end. ""We had to cope with the circumstances and we were a little bit lucky with it sometimes. But sometimes it goes that way."" It was a typically selfless performance from Foden, who put his body on the line for the good of the team, just as he has sacrificed himself all season. Without an orthodox striker following the failed summer move for Tottenham's Harry Kane, Guardiola has had to come up with a system to make the most of his midfielders. Often it's been Foden who's been thrust into the role, playing with his back to goal and two centre-backs nipping at his legs rather than in his more comfortable position as a number eight or wide forward.  That he has been so effective shows his quality; that he continues to do it shows his desire. A boyhood City fan, Foden will do whatever is required to be able to wear the shirt even though his long-term future is elsewhere on the pitch - next season he will probably have the more menacing presence of Erling Haaland in front of him. But for now he remains one of City's biggest attacking threats and will frighten Real Madrid just as much as he did their city neighbours. Foden in some ways represents the progress of the club in Europe with Guardiola saying they lacked experience when he first joined. As the club has grown to regulars in the latter stages, reaching the last four for a second successive season, so too has the player. Foden was a raw 16-year-old when he first made City's substitutes bench for a Champions League clash with Celtic. A year later he made his debut away at a freezing Shakhtar Donetsk and last season he set up Riyad Mahrez for the goal against Paris Saint-Germain that sent City to the final. ""It‚Äôs an honour to be here as always in the semi-finals - Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, in the list of history in Europe, they‚Äôve been there many times,"" Guardiola said ahead of the first leg on Tuesday night. ""We are there, we expect to be there so it's an honour to be here. Two games, tomorrow the first and we see next week."" City no longer have an inferiority complex about coming up against the best in Europe. And Foden has become the leader with no fear of facing anyone.

197,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-champions-league-exit-no-surprise-nagelsmann-knows-/blt19143c51245e9eff,Nagelsmann is kidding himself - Bayern Munich's embarrassing Champions League exit should come as no surprise,"It was approaching an hour after the final whistle had blown at the Allianz Arena and Julian Nagelsmann had still not appeared for his post-match press conference. In the time that had passed, Villarreal had managed to spend time celebrating their famous Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich with their fans in the upper tier of the stadium, retreated to the dressing room for more partying, before again appearing on the pitch to the joy of their travelling supporters. Man of the Match Raul Albiol had been part of the revelry, but had also found the time to hold his own press conference after marshalling a superb defensive display by Unai Emery's side. Nagelsmann, though, had not been seen. When he did eventually appear in the press conference room, he looked decidedly grim but composed. ""I think we lost the tie in the first leg,"" he explained.""If you look at our performance today - tactically good by the way, defensively and offensively - it puts the first leg in a worse light."" The Bayern boss would later go on to describe his team's display as being ""very good"", but it is hard not to think that he is kidding himself; trying to put on a brave face and pass this failure off as being the result of bad luck. In reality, this was not a performance to be proud of, nor one that came as a great shock given the Bavarians' recent form. Tuesday's 1-1 draw means that since beating RB Leipzig on February 5, Bayern have won just six of their last 12 games - an appalling run for a team that has been so dominant both domestically and in Europe. Despite dominating the game in terms of possession and territory, their expected goals (xG) total against Villarreal was 1.58. The only times it has been worse since the winter break were the first leg in Spain and Saturday's narrow win over relegation-threatened Augsburg. Bayern may have a more talented squad than Villarreal, who currently sit seventh in La Liga, but they showed little creativity when trying to break their visitors down, and instead found themselves sending almost endless crosses into the box. In total, they attempted 39 crosses in the match, few of which resulted in meaningful attempts on goal. They managed just four shots on target across the 90 minutes, with many of their efforts coming from distance. They had some moments, with Kingsley Coman causing problems with his dribbling while Robert Lewandowski's finish for the opening goal on the night was excellent, but on the whole they lacked the ideas to get through the yellow wall that Villarreal presented them with. And some of the blame for that has to be shouldered by Nagelsmann. The 34-year-old has regularly spoken of his players not being at their ""peak"" in recent weeks, but it is becoming clear that the peak of Nagelsmann's first season in charge came back in the early weeks of winter. When Bayern were playing well under the ex-RB Leipzig boss, the key for them in an attacking sense came down the left-hand side, with Alphonso Davies and Leroy Sane combining to devastating effect. The 3-2-3-2 formation that Nagelsmann unveiled for the first time on Tuesday would, in theory, have been perfect for that duo, but circumstances meant that neither were on the left-hand side against Villarreal. Davies was on the bench as he continues his recovery from the heart problem that ruled him out of action for over two months, while Sane was shunted out to right in the hope that a change of position could resurrect his season after an alarming drop in form. That Nagelsmann would try such a system in the most important game of the season without the players he needed to make it work either available to start or playing at the required level is concerning, but hopefully something he can learn from. In truth, other more senior players failed to turn up on the night. Joshua Kimmich lacked his usual presence in central midfield, while Thomas Muller and Lewandowski's connection seemed to be off, and not for the first time in recent weeks. It was also telling that Nagelsmann waited until the 82nd minute to make a substitution, introducing Serge Gnabry from the bench in a sign that he is neither happy with the form of the ex-Arsenal man, nor the strength in depth of his squad. That is a problem that may get worse before it gets better. Gnabry is one of a host of players whose contract has just one more year to run on it, and GOAL has learned that the winger is contemplating his future amid interest from Real Madrid and Liverpool. Lewandowski is also out of contract in 2023, and while Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn insisted ahead of kick-off on Tuesday that the European Golden Shoe frontrunner is ""definitely"" staying at Bayern this summer, results such as this one on the biggest stage could prove decisive as the Poland international weighs up his future options. And so while Bayern have all but wrapped up a 10th successive Bundesliga title, that will be the only trophy they win in 2022, having already been dumped out of the DFB-Pokal in embarrassing fashion by Borussia Monchengladbach, who beat them 5-0 in the second round. That result came as a shock at the time, but Bayern's European exit was far more predictable, even if few from outside Munich saw it coming. Nagelsmann will have plenty more time to reflect on what went wrong, but one thing is for certain: nothing about Bayern's elimination was ""good"".

A late Samuel Chukwueze strike earned Villarreal a 2-1 aggregate victory against the Bundesliga champions to send them into the semi-finals of the competition. Villarreal's players celebrated wildly in the dressing room after the final whistle, with their joy captured on camera as they danced and sang. ¬°¬°ùêãùêéùêÇùêîùêëùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄùêÄ!!¬øA qui√©n le gustar√≠a estar de fiesta en este vestuario üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?#UCL pic.twitter.com/lrFTabg6IN The footage posted on Villarreal's Twitter page, shows manager Unai Emery welcoming his players back into the changing room with huge hugs and big smiles.

199,https://www.goal.com/en/news/villarreal-parejo-bayern-munich-disrespect-champions-league/blt94a7e54c66e54587,Villarreal's Parejo slams Bayern Munich 'disrespect' which provided motivation for Champions League win,"""Disrespectful"" comments from Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann inspired Villarreal to cause a major Champions League upset, according to Dani Parejo. Parejo was part of the Villarreal team who earned a 2-1 aggregate victory over the Bundesliga champions to dump them out of the competition at the quarter-final stage. Comments made by Nagelsmann prior to the first leg irked the Liga side, says Parejo, and were used by the underdogs in order to fire them to the semi-finals. Speaking to Movistar+ after drawing 1-1 in Munich in the second leg on Tuesday night in order to progress, Parejo said: ""Nagelsmann said he wanted to decide the tie in the first leg. ""I think he disrespected Villarreal and football. Sometimes when you spit up, it falls on your face."" Having beaten Bayern Munich 1-0 in the first leg at home, but having also spurned several chances to make the scoreline more comfortable, Villarreal had to defend stoutly in Munich on Tuesday night. Bayern equalised in the tie in the second half through Robert Lewandowski, but rather than find the winner most expected, the Germans were stunned in the 88th minute when Samuel Chukwueze scored a breakaway goal to decide the game. Parejo was not the only Villarreal player to criticise Bayern and Nagelsmann afterwards, with striker Gerard Moreno telling reporters: ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie, and all these comments serve as motivation for us. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.
