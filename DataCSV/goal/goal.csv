It was just before midnight, and it had not been a good day. Having led at half-time, Liverpool had lost, painfully, to Sevilla in the final of the Europa League, their 3-1 defeat ensuring another trophyless season for the men from Anfield. Henderson himself had not even made it off the bench. Having rushed back from a knee injury to feature, the captain watched on as Jurgen Klopp instead turned to Divock Origi, Joe Allen and Christian Benteke in a fruitless attempt to turn the tide. Back at the hotel, the plan was to switch off, to try and force some sleep and hide from the disappointment and the bitterness. “To not see anybody and get my head down,” as he put it. Klopp had other ideas. “You’ve got 10 minutes,” the manager told his players and staff. “And then I want you all back down here in the bar. All of you.” Henderson was reluctant - “It was the last thing I wanted, to be honest” - but he and his team-mates obliged. And as the minutes passed, the pain slowly began to subside. Soon there were smiles and there was laughter. Perspective had been restored, positivity had returned. Some time in the early hours, Klopp grabbed a microphone. “We are Liverpool, tra-la-la-la-la,” he sang, urging the rest to join in. They did. Defiance in Switzerland. It was daylight before the last of the stragglers headed to their rooms. Almost six years on, Henderson looks back on that impromptu party and recognises its significance. “I will always remember it,” he told reporters before Liverpool’s victory over Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final last week. “The manager was different, his mentality was different. It felt as if he knew it was the start of something to come.” Klopp had been as saddened as anyone by what had happened in St Jakob Park, cutting a forlorn figure as his side fell apart in the second half. But in his post-match press conference, he would deliver one of the most prescient quotes of his Liverpool reign. ""Someday,” he told reporters, “everybody will say that Basel was a very decisive moment for the wonderful future of Liverpool FC.” Much has changed since then, of course. Only four of Liverpool’s 18-man squad - Henderson, Origi, James Milner and Roberto Firmino - remain, and the Reds have long moved past the Europa League as a point of reference. If they finish the job against Villarreal on Tuesday, they will contest their third Champions League final in five seasons. Klopp has built an incredible side, and plenty of its origins can be traced back to Basel, and the lessons learned at the hands of Unai Emery and Sevilla. It was the manner of that defeat, for example, which convinced Klopp of the need to add serious attacking speed and a more flexible, physical kind of midfielder. He signed both Sadio Mane and Gini Wijnaldum, as well as Joel Matip, that summer, and offloaded no fewer than 15 players, including four of his 18-man squad in Basel. He had arrived on Merseyside convinced that the team he had inherited from Brendan Rodgers was a good one, but had quickly realised there were deep-rooted issues in terms of confidence and mentality. As he told his players in one memorable meeting: “nobody likes this team, not even ourselves.” Changing that mindset was already high on the agenda, but even more so after Sevilla, whose comeback opened up all of the scars Liverpool would rather have kept hidden. Put under pressure, they folded, losing their lead, their composure, their belief and finally the game. Even Klopp was criticised, spending much of the second-half attempting to whip up the crowd as his substitutions and tactical tweaks had minimal effect. “The first thing you have to do when you look at the man in the mirror is criticise yourself,” he admitted afterwards. “I can improve a lot.” He also promised that Liverpool would “use this experience together”, that they would learn and grow and improve. They did. Within 12 months they were back in the Champions League, their side then evolving further with the arrivals of Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, as well as the perfectly-timed emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold. They have not looked back since, nailing their recruitment and growing into one of the two best teams in Europe, and perhaps the best in Reds history. The fact there is even a discussion is remarkable, given the greats that have gone before. If May goes as well as February, March and April did, this side could end up with everything they could ever wish for - FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League, to go with the Carabao Cup they won earlier this year. In their way this week, of course, is a familiar foe. Emery hurt them with Sevilla and he could hurt them again with Villarreal, even if Liverpool looked a cut above when securing a 2-0 first leg lead at Anfield last Wednesday. A red-hot atmosphere is expected at the Estadio de la Ceramica. Villarreal have little to lose and everything to gain, and know the first goal, whenever it should arrive, would put them right back in the tie. Even if they get it, though, do not expect Liverpool to panic. Not this team. The world has changed since Basel. And Klopp and his side have their eye on Paris this time around.

A product of the Red Devils’ famed academy system will see his contract expire in the summer, meaning that he will move on and sever ties with the club that gave him a big break and paved the way for international recognition with England to be enjoyed. Lingard will be walking away without taking in another appearance on home soil, with Ralf Rangnick opting to leave the 29-year-old midfielder as an unused substitute in a 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford – United’s final outing in front of their own supporters in the 2021-22 campaign. Louie Scott has posted in a passionate message on Instagram: “20 years of blood, sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year. “Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” It appeared at one stage as though Lingard would leave Old Trafford before the current campaign got underway, having spent the second half of last season impressing on loan at West Ham. The Hammers were eager to do a permanent deal, while Newcastle expressed interest in January, but the Red Devils refused to sanction a sale and made a bit-part player in their plans see out his contract. He has taken in 22 appearances across all competitions for United this term, but only two of those have been Premier League starts. Alternative options have continued to be favoured despite struggles for consistency leaving the Red Devils without a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League, with Europa League football in 2022-23 the best that they can hope for. Many have questioned why Lingard has been used so sparingly, and why exits were blocked off in the winter transfer window, with club legend Paul Scholes telling talkSPORT: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

2,https://www.goal.com/en/news/gerard-moreno-villarreal-klopp-fearing-champions-league/bltd921e1e30cc76f98,Gerard Moreno: Why Villarreal’s leading light has Klopp fearing an unlikely Champions League comeback,"Villarreal may have been comprehensively outperformed by Liverpool in their Champions League semi-final first leg, but excitement in the tiny Spanish city remains high ahead of the return fixture. Part of the reason for that, as well as for some optimism, is that Gerard Moreno may well be back on Tuesday. The forward missed the 2-0 defeat at Anfield last week with a hamstring problem, but may force the issue to appear against the Reds at La Ceramica. He is the man Jurgen Klopp highlighted as the potential danger for the second leg, and the Reds' coach was no doubt pleased to see that the Spain forward did not make the first game. “It is not over, for the second game Gerard Moreno is back,” Klopp told reporters post-match on Merseyside. “It’s half-time, no more, no less. ""How much work is left to do? The full work. Nothing has happened yet.” Without Moreno in the first leg, Villarreal’s plan did not work. They wanted to sit deep and shut down their opponents, to take a 0-0 draw or potentially more back to Spain. However, with Moreno absent, the ball did not stick upfront when they tried to clear it. The 30-year-old has a velvet touch that would have given his side some relief from Liverpool’s asphyxiating press. Pervis Estupinan’s own goal and Sadio Mane’s strike, in the space of two second-half minutes, helped Liverpool to a comfortable home victory. It was one which lured TalkSport broadcaster and former Chelsea player Jason Cundy into a broadside aimed at the Yellow Submarine, whom he accused of playing a “disgraceful” game. ""I don't know what I've just watched, but Villarreal are a disgrace,” he sneered. “That is a disgrace. UEFA must be watching that and thinking, 'We are in big trouble'. “If that's what's getting to the semi-final and facing English teams... Liverpool did not get out of second gear. It was shocking. Disgraceful. Liverpool are brilliant, but that was a disgrace to the Champions League.” Words which did not go unnoticed in Spain, with Villarreal determined to make Cundy eat them on Tuesday night. To do that, Moreno is vital. Born in Catalunya, the striker came through Villarreal’s youth teams and eventually made his first-team debut for the club in the 2014-15 campaign. The following season, he signed for Espanyol and spent three solid, if unspectacular seasons there. Villarreal brought him back in for €20 million (£17.5m/$23.5m) and he began to show his quality on a regular basis. In the 2019-20 season, he netted 18 La Liga goals in 35 appearances, before scoring 23 in 33 the following year, along with seven goals in Europe to help take the Yellow Submarine to Europa League glory. Netting against Chelsea in the European Super Cup in August, he overtook Giuseppe Rossi to become Villarreal’s all-time top scorer, and currently has 95 goals for the club. Having made his international debut in 2019, he also helped Spain reach the Euro 2020 semi-finals last summer, and if his injury problems subside, should make Luis Enrique’s 2022 World Cup roster. Despite the immense quality he possesses, both to score and create goals, but also on the ball as a dribbler, Moreno has a low profile outside of Spain, without much hype or fanfare. That could change if he becomes the wrecking ball to Liverpool’s quadruple hopes, though. Juventus and Bayern Munich have, after all, already experienced how devastating Villarreal and Moreno can be. After a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain, the second leg against Juve was a tense 0-0 heading into the final 15 minutes. Enter Moreno. In the 78th minute he broke the deadlock from the penalty spot, with Pau Torres and Arnaut Danjuma adding further goals as Villarreal surged past the Italians. Moreno then impressed as his side beat Bayern 1-0 at home, and then set up Samu Chukwueze’s late goal at the Allianz Arena to send Villarreal through, against the odds. His absence at Anfield was a blow, although Villarreal coach Unai Emery is hopeful his team can turn the tables on Liverpool at home. “In the semi-finals, the surprise factor that we could have had in the last 16 and quarter-finals had diluted,” admitted Emery after the first leg. “Today was a question of resisting defensively to have a chance (at home) and we did it in some ways because there it will be different, and there we will get more out of it. “We know that we can compete with Liverpool but today we did not do it. In La Ceramica, we will try and make it so the game is completely different.” Moreno has 13 goals and six assists this season, down from the high standards established in previous years, but he has only made 26 appearances because of injury. When he does play, something happens. Moreno has formed a dynamic and exciting partnership with Danjuma, who often profits from clever interplay with the Spaniard. And with their talisman returning, Villarreal still believe they have a chance. “If there’s one good thing this team has it’s that it believes, and it believes the second leg will be different,” said goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. “We have all the confidence in the world, if not we’d let them go through to the final right now. ""Tuesday will be a totally different game, I have no doubts this team will show up.” If Moreno does, and is in good enough condition, then Villarreal will too.

He has done his best to make that possible in the current campaign, after securing an emotional return to English football, but a 24-goal haul has failed to inspire a top-four finish or deliver major silverware. There have been rumours of a five-time Ballon d’Or mulling over a move elsewhere as the Red Devils struggle to replicate their success of the not too distant past, but Ronaldo has suggested that he is ready to form part of another rebuild under incoming manager Erik ten Hag. An all-time great signed a two-year contract when rejoining United from Juventus in the summer of 2021. He stated at that stage that he may be tempted to stay on beyond 2023, with his latest post on Instagram offering no indication that he is considering an imminent change of scenery. After finding the target from the penalty spot in a 3-0 victory over Brentford, Ronaldo said on social media: “Once again, great support from the stands. “Let’s take this opportunity of our last game of the season at Old Trafford to thank our amazing supporters, who endured a difficult season by our side and never abandoned us. “Thanks, guys. Your support means the world to us and our goal is to become better everyday, so that we can achieve what we all want: glory for Man. United!” United’s struggles for consistency in the Premier League this season have contributed significantly to the questions being asked of Ronaldo’s ongoing presence. He has graced a Champions League stage of some description in every single one of his senior campaigns to date, with that run stretching back to his early days at Sporting. As he is now 37 years of age and approaching the end of a remarkable career, Ronaldo would have been eager to remain at the highest level for as long as possible. A top-four finish is realistically now beyond United, as they could suffer their worst ever finish in the Premier League, but continental qualification remains on the agenda. The Red Devils sit sixth in the table at present and appear to be well on course to add Europa League football to their schedule for 2022-23. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Fernandes opened the scoring for the Red Devils as they beat Brentford 3-0 in their final home game of the campaign. United are expected to fall short of booking a place in the Champions League this season, as they sit five points behind fourth-place Arsenal with just two games left to play - the Gunners and fellow challengers Tottenham have two games in hand. The midfielder now has 10 Premier League goals to his name for the season, but says he would rather lift silverware with the club than boost his statistics. ""It is a long time since I scored,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Obviously I am happy but those numbers don't count for me. I want to get numbers with trophies and not with goals."" While the 27-year-old was pleased with his team's display against Brentford, he admitted that they have underwhelmed this season. ""Last game of the season at home, we wanted to give a good result and good performance,"" he said. ""We know our standard has not been the same as we expect but last game of the season we finish well at home. Now we have more games to go so focus on those. ""We know that we always have to give something. The fans have been amazing supporting us. ""We know that our season has not been at the level it should be but there is nothing we can do now but finish in the best way possible, win games and after think of the next season.""

5,https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-sold-summer-chelsea-nightmare-no-sign-ending/bltc6088ba258162b62,No way back: Lukaku must be sold this summer as Chelsea nightmare shows no sign of ending,"In the moments after Thomas Tuchel had made his final substitutions of the afternoon at Goodison Park, the broadcasters picked out Romelu Lukaku sitting on the Chelsea bench. Motionless and expressionless, the Belgium international could only watch on, knowing he would not be involved against his former club, Everton. Though Chelsea found themselves 1-0 down against the relegation-threatened Toffees after Richarlison had opened the scoring early in the second half, Tuchel decided against calling upon his £100 million ($136m) club-record signing in his pursuit of an equaliser. Instead he threw on Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech, the wide forwards joining fellow substitute Mateo Kovacic on the pitch after the midfielder replaced Jorginho at half time. Neither Pulisic or Ziyech could muster much in their 30 minutes on the pitch, however, as Chelsea slipped to a third defeat in their last six Premier League matches. pic.twitter.com/A7qdaI0OBU ""We had to take Jorgi off and I only had three changes,"" was Tuchel's short explanation of leaving Lukaku in reserve when speaking to reporters post-match, though such an excuse would hardly have been believable at the start of season. After triumphantly leading Inter to the Scudetto in 2021, the reigning Serie A Player of the Year was expected to be a difference-maker for a Chelsea side when they faced deep, low blocks, as they did on Sunday. Instead, he is nothing more than a bit-part player at Stamford Bridge. Of Lukaku's last nine appearances, only one has come from the start, while he is yet to score a league goal in 2022. The last time he completed 90 minutes came all the way back in February, in the infamous game against Crystal Palace that saw him break the record for the fewest touches recorded by an outfield player in a Premier League game (seven) since Opta records began. Kai Havertz replaced him in the line up following that game at Selhurst Park, and scored eight in 12 games to justify his selection, but the Germany international has gone off the boil of late, failing to score in his last six. He was clearly rattled against Everton by Yerry Mina's attempts to wind him up, and throwing on the more experienced and physically imposing Lukaku might have been the way for Tuchel to go. But instead he kept his tracksuit on, the £325,000 wage he earned over the past seven days done so solely in training sessions. That is not a sustainable place for Chelsea to be in, particularly given their ownership situation, and their relationship with Lukaku is one they need to get out of sooner rather than later. A parting of ways this summer would be the best for all parties, too, with GOAL having learned that the player is unhappy with his lack of game time under Tuchel and is exploring other options. A return to Inter has been touted in many quarters as his preferred option in Serie A. Lukaku's preference, however, would be to remain at Chelsea and make his second spell at the club more successful than his first, but he ultimately wants the support from the coaching staff to allow him to flourish. That seems unlikely to be forthcoming while Tuchel remains in charge, though, with the German coach unwilling to adapt his style of football to incorporate Lukaku. Selling Lukaku so soon after he returned to the club would be a bitter pill for Chelsea to swallow, and they would only receive a fraction of what they paid for the 28-year-old if they were to sell this summer. But with the situation unlikely to change in Chelsea's final five games of the season, the time has come for a difficult decision to be made. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Speaking at a business conference in the United States, Infantino offered his remarks in response to a question about the safety standards and general conditions for workers in the country. Ithas been reportedthat thousands of migrant workers have died during the construction of stadiums in Qatar in recent years, while a recent report by Amnesty International called work practices in the country ""forced labour"". ""My parents emigrated from Italy to Switzerland. Not so far, but still. When you give work to someone, even in hard conditions, you give him dignity and pride,"" he said, according to the AP. Earlier this year, Infantino suggested that a biennial World Cup could stop African migrants from ""dying in the sea"" in a controversial speech at the Assembly of the Council of Europe. “We need to find ways to include the whole world [in football] to give hope to Africans so that they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea,"" he said. “We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We will discuss it.” Infantino later apologised for those remarks, claiming his words were ""misinterpreted and taken out of context"". Several national teams have staged protests against the holding of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, citing alleged abuse of workers, although none that have qualified have said they would boycott the event. Last month, Dutch coach Louis van Gaal called it ""ridiculous"" that Qatar could host a World Cup. “We are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there,"" he said. ""That's bullsh*t, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA."" England manager Gareth Southgate also weighed in, saying ""there are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas"" while questioning Qatar's stance on LGBTQ+ issues. In response, 2022 World Cup CEO Nasser Al Khater fired back: ""Somebody with a lot of influence, such as Southgate, somebody with a big audience that listens to what he says, ought to pick his words very carefully.""

The Liverpool forward fluffed his lines from the spot, as the Pharaohs saw their Qatar 2022 dreams dashed in Dakar, and there had been calls for the second leg of a heavyweight African encounter to be replayed. World football’s governing body has not taken things that far, with Senegal still heading to a global showpiece in the Middle East later this year, but sanctions are being put in place. FIFA has fined Senegal’s football federation 175,000 Swiss francs as a result of the fan disorder which marred an otherwise memorable evening for the Lions of Teranga. That decision has been made after seeing Salah forced to take a penalty while blinding green lights were shone in his direction. FIFA’s disciplinary panel has also looked into a pitch invasion from Senegal supporters after Sadio Mane converted the decisive spot-kick in their shootout with Egypt. An offensive banner has also been investigated, with Senegalese authorities accused of “failure to ensure that law and order are maintained in the stadium”. A combination of all those misdemeanours has resulted in the Senegal national team being ordered to play one future fixture behind closed doors. No Mohamed Salah at the 2022 World Cup 😩 pic.twitter.com/DRVQcnFfkk FIFA’s disciplinary committee has been ruling on a number of other similar instances that have occurred in World Cup qualifying games played since the turn of the year. Nigeria, after being eliminated in a play-off clash of their own against Ghana, are also facing a one-game stadium closure as a result of disgruntled supporters invading the field in Abuja, while their FA has been stung with a fine of 150,000 Swiss francs. A penalty of 125,000 Swiss francs has been imposed on Congo and 100,000 on Lebanon, with both also seeing their terraces closed for one game, while discrimination by fans at home matches involving Chile and Colombia has resulted in fines of 95,000 and 55,000 Swiss francs respectively being handed out to the South American nations.

The Serbia international has been linked with the Red Devils for some time, with eye-catching performances in Italy hinting at a potential big-money transfer to the Premier League. It was claimed that former Chelsea striker Kezman, who now represents his fellow Serbian, was in discussions with Man Utd and Ligue 1 heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain over a summer switch with Old Trafford emerging as a favoured destination. It was reported by Foot01 that Kezman had said of the interest shown in Milinkovic-Savic: “Sergej has no shortage of offers for the summer market. “We are currently talking to Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain. He is focused on the season finale with Lazio, but Sergej wants to go to Manchester United.” The Red Devils are in the market for another combative midfielder, with West Ham star Declan Rice emerging as a top target. It may be that Milinkovic-Savic is another option being considered by a club preparing to welcome Dutch coach Erik ten Hag into their dugout at the end of the season, but rumours of formal discussions being held have been rubbished. Kezman told Tuttojuve: “It's fake news. I have never given interviews in the last period, some journalists are really incredible! “I'm very angry, it is a lack of respect towards me, towards Sergej and Lazio.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

9,https://www.goal.com/en/news/premier-league-clubs-napoli-lazio-race-nice-wonderkid/blt7e0eece764ebe672,Premier League clubs join Napoli & Lazio in race for Nice wonderkid Flavius Daniliuc,"Nice youngster Flavius Daniliuc is attracting interest from a number of clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, GOAL has learned, with Premier League teams joining Napoli and Lazio in tracking the talented defender. Interest in the versatile 21-year-old is predicted to build as his stock continues to soar, with a scramble for his signature set to be sparked at some stage. For now he is continuing to further his development in France, but the expectation is that a player schooled in the academy systems at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich will step up onto a more prominent stage at some point in the not too distant future. An ambitious prospect, who turned out as a midfield playmaker while with Spanish giants Real, took the decision to walk away from Bayern in the summer of 2020. He had been captain of the U19 side in Bavaria and was held in high regard by the Bundesliga heavyweights. A call was made to head for France in order to find more first-team opportunities, with that decision being vindicated by a meteoric rise to prominence. His potential has now been noted by leading sides from across Europe, with the Vienna-born starlet seemingly ready to take on a new challenge as he is already fluent in English, Spanish, German and Romanian – the native language of his parents – while also learning French. Daniliuc has already skippered Austria’s U21 team and is seemingly set to push for senior international recognition when current Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick takes the reins of that squad over the summer. The likes of Napoli, Lazio and impressed parties from England are mulling over moves for Daniliuc as he has slotted seamlessly into the fold at Nice. He moved to France in order to work under World Cup winner Patrick Vieira and took in 25 appearances across his debut season – breaking through 50 outings for the club in the current campaign. 5️⃣0️⃣th Nice appearance for Flavius Daniliuc 🔴⚫️The 🇦🇹 youth international will start at right back against @girondins #OGCNice #FCGBOGCN pic.twitter.com/TututsJvb9 Christophe Galtier, who led Lille to the Ligue 1 title in 2020-21, has continued to bring the best out of Daniliuc when using him on the right of a four-man defensive unit. A highly-rated performer is, however, just as comfortable when figuring as a centre-half and appears to be treading a similar path to fellow countryman David Alaba – who left Bayern for Real Madrid in 2021. He has caught the eye when lining up against some of the very best in the business, keeping Neymar very quiet during a meeting with Paris Saint-Germain last season, and is currently readying himself for a shot at major silverware on May 7 when Nice will face Nantes in the Coupe de France final.

But this summer, Van Nistelrooy will make the step up to take charge of the senior side in Eindhoven, replacing the outgoing Roger Schmidt after a season in charge of Jong PSV in the second tier of Dutch football. Given his playing career, the 45-year-old will be expected to particularly oversee improvements in attack, though there is a chance he will first have to rebuild his forward line. Cody Gakpo is expected to move on, with a host of Europe's biggest clubs - including Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich - having been linked with the 22-year-old winger. At the start of the season, the same thing was expected for Noni Madueke, but injuries have hampered the England youth international in 2021-22, meaning the Premier League and Bundesliga clubs that are keen on the forward may well decide to look elsewhere, at least for now. Regardless, Van Nistelrooy is going to require reinforcements, one of which could be the teenager that has lit up his own side this term. With just a single game of Jong PSV's season to play, Johan Bakayoko can already boast a record of 17 goals and 11 assists for the team in 2021-22, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 85.4 minutes in the second division. Madueke, is that you? 🧐De 18-jarige Johan Bakayoko steelt de show bij Jong PSV tegen Almere City: twee assists en een goal ✨#JPSALM pic.twitter.com/G5Cj5p0psn Given he only managed a solitary strike and three assists in 19 appearances at that level last season, that is quite some improvement from the Belgium youth international, and one which Van Nistelrooy has played a key role in. ""You can see that he has power and also a good shot,"" Van Nistelrooy told ESPN in January. ""He plays such controlled football that you forget that he is only 18. ""If he continues to invest so much in what he does, he is a boy who is on the right track to join the first team at the end of the season."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That step has not quite materialised, however, with the 19-year-old having made just two appearances off the bench for PSV's senior side thus far, but that is likely to change once Van Nistelrooy takes the reins. PSV certainly envisaged him becoming a first-team player when they tempted him to join the club from Anderlecht in 2019, with Bakayoko having previously spent time at Club Brugge and Mechelen. His first two seasons with the club, though, suggested that he may be some distance off that level, and that following Madueke's path of starring for the youth sides before making an impact on the Eredivisie was unlikely. The club, though, saw things differently, and in the summer of 2021 offered the teenager a new four-year contract, which Bakayoko signed while donned in a white suit and red bowtie. ""Now it's up to me to prove that I can put up the numbers required of me,"" he said at the time. ""I want to be more decisive in terms of my stats, and I've been talking to the coaches about doing that."" He has been a man of his word, honing his finishing ability under Van Nistelrooy's watchful eye, though he is much more than a player who puts the ball in the net. Naturally left-footed, he generally plays from the right-hand side, using his speed and close control to cause nightmares for opposing full-backs before cutting inside to either score or create chances for his team-mates. With six, he has the most goals from outside the penalty area in the Dutch second tier, with his decision making in terms of when to try his luck and when to look for help much improved from previous years. ""At the beginning of 2021, Johan was not doing well,"" his agent, Gerard Witters, told Het Nieuwsblad. ""But after he got his new contract, everything changed. ""He started to boost his stats and his recent games were phenomenal. The club has told me that Johan is already better than they initially thought he would be. ""Before he sometimes played like a crazy dog. He had great qualities and was very explosive, but he produced poor crosses and took shots when they were not the best option. ""Now he knows a lot more what he's going to do and defenders can't stop him anymore, despite the fact that he always does the same movement (cutting inside).” Bakayoko's form has been particularly good since the season's winter break, with his confidence spiking after he netted four times against VVV-Venlo in January. More recently, he came off the bench for the final 33 minutes against FC Eindhoven and scored twice before assisting PSV's third goal in a game that looked to be heading for a draw until the youngster's introduction. Now the challenge becomes replicating those performances against the best teams in the land, with PSV hopeful of yet again challenging Ajax for the title after their back-and-forth race this season. His history with Van Nistelrooy should certainly help in that respect, and if the legendary striker is to succeed as a coach, then he will hope that he can soon rely on his young charge to lead the way.

Net worth, Chelsea bid & which sports teams he owns","Several candidates emerged as potential new owners at Chelsea once Roman Abramovich announced that he would be selling the club, but Todd Boehly appears set to inherit the reins at Stamford Bridge as a consortium he heads up become the preferred bidders at Stamford Bridge. A new era for the Blues is being ushered in, with a Russian billionaire that has been at the helm since 2003 preparing to walk away after seeing his assets frozen by the UK government. Change has not been quick to implement in west London, with a protracted takeover saga seeing a number of interested parties enter the fray, but Boehly has emerged as a leading contender to take ownership of the Premier League heavyweights – which begs the question: Who is he? GOAL takes a look... Boehly is an American businessman, philanthropist and investor who went to school in Bethesda, Maryland before moving to England to study at the London School of Economics. From there he spent time working at Citibank and CS First in Boston before moving on to Guggenheim Partners in 2001. He launched that firm’s credit investing business and would go on to become president of the company. In 2013 he fronted a deal between Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers to create SportsNet LA – a network that broadcasts all things related to the baseball franchise. Two years later, in 2015, Boehly pooled some of the assets he collected at Guggenheim – including The Hollywood Reporters, Dick Clark Productions and Security Benefit – to found Eldridge Industries, a holding company that owns stakes in roughly 80 finance, media, sports, real estate and technology businesses. A Todd Boehly-led consortium is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government 🔵 pic.twitter.com/js0XF0qWhJ The 46-year-old is, according to Forbes, worth around £3.6 billion ($4.5bn). He previously made a play for Chelsea back in 2019, with an offer in the region of £2.2bn ($2.8bn) being knocked back. Boehly is the co-owner of seven-time MLB World Series winners the Los Angeles Dodgers – who last captured the grandest prize in baseball back in 2020. He also owns stakes in 17-time NBA champions the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Sparks women’s basketball team. His latest bid for power at Stamford Bridge has seen Boehly team up with fellow Dodgers co-owner Mark Walters, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital – with that consortium boasting some serious spending power between them. Premier League 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆Champions League 🏆🏆 Club World Cup 🏆 FA Cup 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 Europa League 🏆🏆 EFL Cup 🏆🏆🏆 UEFA Super Cup 🏆 Community Shield 🏆🏆 Chelsea won 21 trophies in 19 years under Roman Abramovich's ownership 🔵 pic.twitter.com/pXL3OFMY8p Boehly has seemingly fended off all rival interest in Chelsea - including a late bid from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s wealthiest man – to put himself in pole position to complete a takeover before the end of May. Blues supporters will be eager to see a long-running saga, which has presented plenty of challenges on and off the field, brought to a close as soon as possible, while they will also be pleased to hear that a potential new owner has ambitious plans for his various sporting ventures. Boehly said while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in LA: “There’s nothing like sports to excite passion. And if you have passion, then you have people who care about things. “And if you have people who care about things, you have great opportunity. And really, it’s about curating that experience, that access, that opportunity. “For example, we’ll have four million people coming out to Dodger Stadium this year. So, our goal is to give them the best possible experience. We still have the most affordable tickets in the league basically, for a stadium that’s full regularly. “In some sports like the NFL, they share all the media money. In baseball, you’re really a derivative of your local market. “The Premier League’s similar. If you look at the way it works, to be one of the big brands, you have a structural advantage. And for us, we’re always looking for structural advantages.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The 28-year-old Black Star picked up an injury during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park Stadium on April 4 and he has gone ahead to miss five Premier League matches.  He missed the 2-1 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium, the 1-0 away defeat against Southampton, the 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the 3-1 victory against Manchester United at home, and the 2-1 away win against West Ham United.  In his absence, Arsenal have relied on Egypt international Mohamed Elneny, who has started in the last three matches where the Gunners have registered wins. While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has ruled out the player for the rest of the season, it seems Partey is not giving up yet.  On Monday, Arsenal’s official Twitter handle posted a video of defender Gabriel Magalhaes diving to head home a cross from Gabriel Martinelli for the winning goal against West Ham at London Stadium and Partey responded. 🇧🇷 Gabi x Gabi 🇧🇷#WHUARS pic.twitter.com/pq690RT5Cn “Tom X Tom [Takehiro Tomiyasu] soon.”  His statement was also in response to defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, who returned from injury in the game against West Ham, and an indication he will play with him before the season ends.  Ahead of Arsenal’s trip to face West Ham, Arteta admitted the absence of Partey was affecting his plans for the team.  “The stats are there and they are unquestionable,” Arteta told Daily Mail. “The win rate when Thomas is there is higher. It is something that is not good for us because in the last two seasons he has not been there as much as we want.  “We need him to play in that role on his own, with the quality he brings and the experience that he brings. And the fact he brings things that are unique that we want.  “Then we can accommodate players in other positions that for them are more relevant and can determine games in the way that we can. “Otherwise we have to consider and improve with the players we have by using them in a different way, changing formation, and finding ways to compensate.”  Arsenal, who are sitting fourth on the 20-team table with 63 points from 34 matches, will face Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Chiesa initially joined Juve on loan in October 2020 as they agreed to pay Fiorentina a loan fee of €10m for two seasons with the right of redemption in 2023. The final deal also included an obligation to buy if certain conditions were met, including achieving Champions League qualification for 2022-23, and the Bianconeri have now confirmed the 24-year-old has been bought outright. Juve have confirmed in an official press release that they will pay Chiesa's full transfer fee in instalments over the next three years, and could end up paying a total of €50m (£42m/$53m) including add-ons if he hits certain individual targets. The talented attacker took to social media to express his delight after making his move to the Allianz Stadium permanent, writing on Instagram: ""To be continued..."" Chiesa has scored 18 goals in his first 61 appearances in all competitions for Juve, while also recording 14 assists. The Italy international has helped the club win two trophies so far, including last season's Coppa Italia title, but his 2021-22 campaign was cut short by injury. Chiesa suffered cruciate knee ligament damage in January and is not expected to return to action until much later in the year, with Juve yet to give a firm update on his recovery.

The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them. Player Selection odds Jordan Pickford 1/12 Aaron Ramsdale 1/10 Nick Pope 4/9 Sam Johnstone 2/1 Jack Butland 5/1 Etienne Green 20/1 Alex McCarthy 25/1 Freddie Woodman 28/1 Fraser Forster 33/1 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗲.

Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development. Player Selection odds Harry Maguire 1/20 John Stones 1/20 Ben Chilwell 1/16 Luke Shaw 1/12 Kyle Walker 1/8 Ben White 1/3 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1/3 Reece James 4/11 Kieran Trippier 7/4 Tyrone Mings 2/1 Conor Coady 2/1 Fikayo Tomori 3/1 Eric Dier 7/2 Joe Gomez 7/2 Marc Guehi 7/2 Trevoh Chalobah 7/2 Tariq Lamptey 4/1 Well… About time 😅 an absolute dream to score my first England goal 🦁 well done boys! Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup. Player Selection odds Declan Rice 1/20 Jude Bellingham 1/20 Mason Mount 1/20 Phil Foden 1/20 Jack Grealish 1/16 Bukayo Saka 1/10 Jordan Henderson 1/3 Kalvin Phillips 1/3 Emile Smith Rowe Evens Conor Gallagher 7/4 James Ward-Prowse 11/4 Jesse Lingard 11/4 Curtis Jones 4/1 Harvey Barnes 4/1 Harvey Elliott 4/1 James Maddison 4/1 Oliver Skipp 4/1 Ruben Loftus-Cheek 5/1 Dele Alli 6/1 Jacob Ramsey 6/1 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 10/1 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️Harry Kane is now @England's joint-highest goalscorer in major tournaments (EUROs, #WorldCup), alongside @GaryLineker on 10 goals pic.twitter.com/8uyw6EBXbY Given that he is captain of the Three Lions and a man well on course to chase down Wayne Rooney’s all-time record goal haul for his country, it may come as a surprise to find that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not top of the market when it comes to attacking calls. He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it The 2022 World Cup in Qatar will get under way on November 21, with superstar performers from across the planet readying themselves for a shot at global glory in the Middle East. France, after emerging victorious on Russian soil back in 2018, will be the defending champions, but a number of nations have their sights set on knocking Les Bleus from the loftiest of perches. In total, 32 countries will compete for the ultimate prize on football’s grandest stage, but who are favourites to go all the way and which of the outsiders could spring a surprise? GOAL takes a look… Brazil may not have savoured World Cup glory since 2002, but they are five-time winners and currently boast the strength in depth - with the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Junior and Alisson at their disposal - to make them 9/2 (5.50) favourites in Qatar. Holders France are another of those that are well fancied to mount a serious challenge for the ultimate prize, with a star-studded squad that includes Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba knowing what it takes to emerge victorious, and Didier Deschamps' side are available at 11/2 (6.50). England made their way to the semi-finals in 2018, before reaching a final on home soil at Euro 2020, and the Three Lions are also 11/2 (6.50) to bring a 56-year wait for international success to a close. Just behind them at 8/1 (9.00) are 2010 winners Spain, who have an exciting young squad at their disposal, while Argentina – who are hoping to see Lionel Messi land the one major honour that has so far eluded him in a remarkable career - are priced at 9/1 (10.00) just ahead of perennial challengers Germany at 11/1 (12.00). Belgium, who have slipped from the top of the FIFA world rankings, may feel that 2022 presents their golden generation – with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard still going strong – with a last shot at international honours, but they are priced at 12/1 (13.00). Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal - who came through the play-offs - are another of those available at 12/1 (13.00), alongside a Netherlands team that are bursting with potential. Denmark, who have welcomed Christian Eriksen back into their ranks following his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, are considered to be 28/1 (29.00) shots for what would be a stunning and very emotional triumph. Croatia reached the final in 2018, as Luka Modric closed in on Ballon d’Or glory, but are 50/1 (51.00) to go one better four years on. Uruguay – who still have the vast experience and considerable goal threat of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez in their ranks – are also available at 50/1 (51.00), with Switzerland and reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions Senegal priced at 80/1 (81.00). The United States, with youthful exuberance on their side, are not expected to figure in the final shake-up as they sit at 100/1 (101.00), with a Poland squad led by prolific Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski priced at 125/1 (126.00). There are a number of teams at 150/1 (151.00), including Mexico and Canada, while hosts Qatar have drifted out to 350/1 (351.00) as they become serious long shots on home soil.

Fulham remain strong favourites to savour title glory in their first season back in the second tier following relegation, while Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest are among those pushing hard for places in the Premier League. GOAL has all you need to know about the favourites to lift the Championship trophy, as well as those teams making a strong bid to be rubbing shoulders with English football's elite in 2022-23. Having spent two of their last three seasons in the Premier League, and with promotion already confirmed, Fulham are now priced at 1/500 (1.0)to secure another instant return by winning this year's Championship. Marco Silva inherited a squad that boasts a number of players that represented the Cottagers in the Premier League last season, and that top-flight calibre - along with a few notable additions - has allowed them to start pulling clear of their fellow second-tier frontrunners. Despite having not lifted this trophy since 2001, the 2018 and 2020 play-off winners look a strong bet to rejoin English football's elite as champions this time around. After last season's heart-breaking play-off semi-final defeat to Brentford, Bournemouth are 50/1 (51.0) to make absolutely sure of a return to the Premier League by clinching top spot. Having left Fulham to move to the Vitality Stadium in the summer of 2021, Scott Parker has his current charges ranked as the closest challengers to his former club, but everyone outside of west London appears to be playing for second place. With Fulham already preparing for a return to the big time and Bournemouth highly tipped at 1/6 (1.17), Nottingham Forest have become the value bet at 4/5 (1.8) as Steve Cooper seeks to wake a sleeping giant of English football from the deepest of slumbers. The former Swansea City boss has made a remarkable impact at the City Ground since succeeding Chris Hughton and has the Reds looking to return to the top flight for the first time in the 21st century. Luton Town have exceeded all expectations to sit fifth with only two games left on their schedule, while the same can be said for Huddersfield Town - who occupy fourth spot - and they are both priced at 9/2 (5.5) to bounce their way back into the big time. Sheffield United are attempting to yo-yo into the Premier League at the first time of asking and remain very much in the mix at 11/4 (3.75), but Middlesbrough have been pushed out to 10/1 (11.0) despite benefiting from the ability of former Blades boss Chris Wilder to master the Championship following his appointment in early November. Millwall are desperately clinging to the coattails of the top six-chasing pack, but they will require favours from others on the final day of the regular season in order to secure tickets to the play-off lottery and are priced at 500/1 (501.0) as a result.

United snapped Ibrahimovic up on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, and he enjoyed a fruitful debut campaign at Old Trafford, scoring 28 goals across 46 appearances. The Swede's impressive form in the final third helped the Red Devils secure a Europa League and League Cup double, and although his second campaign was blighted by injury, he still looks back on his experience in English football fondly. The 40-year-old, who is now taking in a second spell at Milan, believes he also managed to silence a fair few doubters by proving that he could deliver in the Premier League. ""I had fun,"" Ibrahimovic told ESPN when quizzed on his United career. ""I really enjoyed because when I came, everybody was against it. And then in England, they didn't like me. ""All these haters, after three months, they started to like me, I didn't like them anymore. ""I like people when they hate you because then they bring out the better of you. I had fun. [It] is a great competition, [an] amazing atmosphere. ""And I'm happy I played for United, which I think is the best team in England. And I think it was the right choice to go to Manchester United. ""I think I came in a good moment. Because it's easy to come to a club when the success is already there. It's more difficult when you come and the challenge is different. ""And then if you manage to have a success, you're part of the story. So the fans were great to me. And I really enjoyed [it]. A lot of things happened."" 🗣 Zlatan Ibrahimovic to l’Equipe: “Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. “I’m not ready to smoke a cigar yet.” pic.twitter.com/GfHoip3FbZ Ibrahimovic eventually left Old Trafford in March 2018 before joining the LA Galaxy, and spent two years in MLS soccer before returning to Europe. Milan brought the Sweden international back to the club in January 2020 and he has since scored 33 Serie A goals, including eight in the current campaign. Ibrahimovic has played a key role in transforming the Rossoneri back into title contenders, but even if the 2021-22 season ends in Scudetto glory, he is not planning to walk off into the sunset. ""I want to play as long as I can,"" he told UEFA in March. ""The reality is I'll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I'm still playing.""

Greenwood has been out of the squad since January after the 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. With Greenwood out of the team, Man Utd have relied mostly on 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, with veteran Edinson Cavani and out-of-form Marcus Rashford struggling to provide the goals needed to ease the load on the Portuguese star's shoulders. ""We need at least two to give team more quality,"" Rangnick said. ""Modern strikers. ""Liverpool and Man City have five or six. Is Grealish a winger or striker? They are all strikers. ""We don’t have many. Mason Greenwood would have been but after West Ham he wasn't part of the squad."" Ronaldo has remained ever-present for the club, solidifying his spot as the team's top scorer with 24 goals in all competitions. Bruno Fernandes is second, having hit double-digits in the win over Brentford on Monday, with Greenwood still Man Utd's third-leading scorer this season despite being suspended for the second half of the season. Rashford sits fourth this season with five goals, level with winger Jadon Sancho. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Red Devils beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager, with the German set to step into a consultancy role at Old Trafford next term. The 63-year-old is confident that United can improve quickly as they near the end of a disappointing campaign that will see them miss out on silverware and a place in next season's Champions League. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. ""I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. ""If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic were two such players who will leave the club when their contracts expire at the end of the season. Mata, who has been with the club since 2014, put in a fine display in his final match at Old Trafford and the coach was pleased with the quality the pair added to the midfield. ""We played with Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic and that gave us some quality in midfield,"" Rangnick said. ""It was not too easy for Brentford to take the ball away from us. In the first half we played too many square and back passes but in general it was a good performance."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Red Devils are set to finish the 2021-22 campaign without a trophy and will miss out on a place in next season's Champions League. But Rangnick is confident the Old Trafford side will bounce back after enduring a disappointing year, as he believes the team has ""great potential"". “This season has clearly been a very difficult one for everyone at the club, and from the short time I have been here I can see how much everyone is hurting,"" he said in his programme notes ahead of Monday's clash against Brentford. “There have been some good moments, but we never built enough positive momentum to allow our confidence to increase and ultimately we were unable to rescue the season. “I want to be clear, though: this is not the fall of Manchester United; this is a stumble along the way and, when you stumble, you have to think quickly and clearly to regain your balance so you can carry on moving forward. “That is the position we are in as a club and if we have clarity in our actions from now on, we can make some big steps in the right direction. “As I have said publicly, the steps that we need to take as a club are fairly clear. We have had a lot of discussions internally and know what has to happen. “We need to be smart and decisive in our actions around the club, and we have started the process by making a very exciting managerial appointment with Erik ten Hag. When he arrives from Ajax next month, he joins a fantastic institution with great pedigree and, most importantly, great potential."" After the clash against Brentford at Old Trafford, United will travel to Brighton for their penultimate Premier League match of the season.

That was all it took to turn a sticky night into a spectacular one for Liverpool. They’re not there yet, but Jurgen Klopp’s side are now overwhelming favourites to reach their third Champions League final in five seasons, after seeing off Villarreal 2-0 in their semi-final, first leg at Anfield on Wednesday night. Quick-fire strikes from Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane did the damage for the Reds, who, for 45 minutes, had looked as if they might find Villarreal’s ‘Yellow Wall’ as puzzling and as frustrating as Juventus and Bayern Munich had before them. Those two giants had fallen, but it would be a surprise if Liverpool were to go the same way now, even if they still have to finish the job in Spain next week. This was a convincing, dominant performance from Klopp’s men, who still have that unprecedented quadruple firmly within their sights. Unai Emery sent his side to annoy, but the gulf in quality between the two sides was evident throughout. Liverpool’s biggest annoyance, in fact, will be that they didn’t finish the tie here. They certainly had the chances to do so. That nutmeg assist from Mohamed Salah 😈 pic.twitter.com/gT0xK3luwS In the end, a two-goal cushion will do them. It came courtesy of a piece of good fortune, Henderson’s clipped cross from the right drifting over the head of Geronimo Rulli, the Villarreal goalkeeper, and into the net, and from a piece of elite attacking quality, Mo Salah finding the perfect pass for Mane, who found the perfect finish for 2-0. Emery’s side looked shell-shocked. They had conceded only two goals in four games against Juve and Bayern, but suddenly they had shipped two in the blink of an eye, Liverpool’s relentless intensity too much even for a team designed to, in the words of their manager, “suffer without the ball” for long periods. They certainly did that here. Liverpool had almost three-quarters possession, took 19 shots and forced 10 corners. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk spent more time in the Villarreal half than in their own, while Alisson Becker was a spectator for the most part. Safe to say, it wasn’t the ding-dong we saw at the Etihad on Tuesday night. African players with the most Champions League knockout goals:Sadio Mane - 14 🇸🇳Didier Drogba - 14 🇨🇮 pic.twitter.com/kPz25Lg9mL The result, though, is what is important, and Liverpool will certainly be backed to finish the job in six days’ time, even if they must first negotiate a tricky Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. They had all the quality here, the tone set by Thiago Alcantara’s probing and Luis Diaz’s pressing. What a pair of signings those two are turning out to be, players of pedigree and desire and class. Throw in Mane, who again led the line superbly, and Salah, who didn’t score but created havoc with Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right, and you have a potent combination. The night finished as it had started, with The Beatles playing on the Anfield PA system. It was ‘Yellow Submarine’ before kick-off, a nice touch given the opposition, but it was a different tune being belted out by the end. ‘I Feel Fine’ has become the soundtrack to Liverpool’s season, and no wonder. They're so glad, that Jurgen is a red, and come the end of next month, these fans, and this team, could have everything they ever dreamed of. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Liverpool's quadruple bid off to perfect start with epic Carabao Cup victory","Match statistics: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (10-11 pens.) The day began with tears for the injured Thiago Alcantara, but there were only smiles at the end for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup trophy used to be a permanent fixture at Anfield, and it is back in the Reds’ possession once more. The first leg of a potential quadruple is in the bag, for Jurgen Klopp and his team. They and their fans went through hell to get there, mind. This will go down as one of the most incredible football matches - never mind finals - in living memory. Where do you even begin to unravel what we witnessed here today at Wembley? It took 120 minutes and 22 penalties to settle it. But when Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, sent his spot-kick into orbit at around 7.20pm, Liverpool could finally celebrate. And boy did they. SCENES!!! 🤯Kepa Arrizabalaga misses the 22nd penalty after being subbed on for the shoot-out! 😨 pic.twitter.com/yLIOIQWdUD KEPA MISSED IT 🤯LIVERPOOL ARE CHAMPIONS 🏆 pic.twitter.com/zCcEccrgnQ Kepa had been brought specifically for the shootout, his job to save penalties rather than take them. But the Spain international, a specialist, could do nothing as, one by one, Liverpool’s stars held their nerve from 12 yards. Caoimhin Kelleher was the 11th Red to do so, burying his penalty with aplomb. What a day this was for the Irishman, the deputy for Alisson Becker who did not put a foot, or a hand, wrong throughout. Kepa’s miss sparked wild scenes. Red smoke filled the north London air as the pyrotechnics were unleashed. Klopp, his staff and his players sprinted to Kelleher, who celebrated in front of the Liverpool supporters as the Wembley DJ played ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Who says the Carabao Cup doesn’t matter, eh? There was nothing to separate the sides in the two league meetings earlier this year, and this was just as tight a contest, if not tighter. At times, it bordered on farcical. Chelsea had three goals disallowed and Liverpool one. VAR played its part, and so did the two goalkeepers. Kelleher made big saves from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku, while Edouard Mendy made an incredible one to deny Sadio Mane. The Senegal star was the Man Of The Match by a mile, and he was not even there for the conclusion. Chance after chance came and went. Mo Salah clean through, denied on the line by Thiago Silva. Mason Mount hit the post and missed another good opportunity. Mendy denied Virgil van Dijk and Luis Diaz. It was relentless, breathless, almost dangerously intense. Lord only knows what Klopp and Thomas Tuchel went through on the touchline. They embraced during the first half, and shared a nice moment when Kepa blazed his penalty over, but their heart-rate cannot have dropped below 130bpm here. And so Liverpool have ‘their’ trophy back. This is the ninth time they have lifted the League Cup, and only two of those have been settled in 90 minutes. They really are the marathon men in this competition, aren’t they? There is still plenty of running to do this season, mind. They enjoyed themselves here, but they know that there could be so much more to come. Manchester City are in their sights in the Premier League, and they will fancy their chances of going deep in both the Champions League and the FA Cup, too. That is for tomorrow, though. Today, it is time to celebrate. Klopp did. He danced a jig to Dua Lipa in front of his adoring fans. Kelleher could barely contain himself, Harvey Elliott grabbed a flare, the passion written all over his teenage face. James Milner, the oldest member of the squad, smiled like it was his first time. Joel Matip grinned and bounced, Van Dijk waved a corner flag around. It was carnage. A fitting climax, you could say. Liverpool Football Club are doing what they do. They are gathering cups again. One suspects there will be more to come this season, as well. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Lingard returned to United in June after a successful six-month loan spell at West Ham, where he scored nine goals in 16 Premier League games to help David Moyes' side qualify for the Europa League. Moyes openly admitted that the Hammers were eager to sign the 28-year-old on a permanent deal, but they failed to do so before the summer deadline, and his assistant has suggested that the midfielder made the wrong choice over his future. Pearce believes Lingard could end up making a U-turn when the transfer market reopens due to the fact his considerable talents are being wasted at Old Trafford. ""He's missed the opportunity to leave United in this transfer window,"" the West Ham coach has told talkSPORT. ""He can reassess his situation come January once again and decide whether there’s an opportunity to move clubs. He holds the cards, Jesse. ""The most important thing for him at the moment is his football. He's playing the odd game for United and also playing extremely well for England - and those performances for England might help him get in the United side. ""I think he’s too good a player to be sat on the outside of it not playing and he’s at an age where he needs to be playing."" Lingard has featuredin 211 games across all competitions for United since making his debut back in 2011, scoring 33 goals while also setting up another 20 for his team-mates. However, the England international's sole appearance for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side so far this term came from the bench, and he currently finds himself behind the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Paul Pogba and Fred in the midfield pecking order. Lingard was selected for Gareth Southgate's latest Three Lions squad despite a lack of regular minutes at club level, and scored twice in a 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Andorra at the weekend to send a statement ahead of his return to Old Trafford. He will hope to earn a place in Solskjaer's lineup for a home fixture against Newcastle on Sunday, but if he continues to play a bit-part role, West Ham could emerge as an attractive option again, particularly given the fact he is now less than 10 months away from the expiration of his contract.

The pair were among the Magpies' top transfer targets in the January window, but both ended up staying at their respective clubs. Despite Newcastle's failure to land them, Staveley said the players were eager to make the switch. She told The Athletic: ""We were 19th going into the window. So we had that, an illiquid market, and the complexity of Covid-19, which meant clubs didn’t want to sell because they didn’t know where their squads would end up. ""We had to encourage players – ‘we’ll be a safe place for you, we’ll deliver and grow’. Some desperately wanted to come to us, like Sven [Botman], who still does very much and has talked very openly about that. ""Coming through all that showed us we can do it, that we can stick to our plan and if we get criticised on the last day for: ‘Oh, you’re going after Jesse [Lingard]’, well, Jesse wanted to come to us. ""We did everything. We never stopped. From the start to the finish, we did not stop working."" While Eddie Howe's team missed out on two top targets, they did sign Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, Chris Wood from Burnley, Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid and Brighton's Dan Burn. They also brought in Matt Targett on loan from Aston Villa for the rest of the season. Newcastle are currently 17th in the Premier League table and two points above the relegation zone. They are looking to boost their hopes of survival on Saturday when they take on Brentford away. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

No deal was done in the last window, despite West Ham being interested in landing their former loanee on a permanent basis, and the talented 28-year-old now faces fierce competition for places in the Red Devils' ranks. He has been getting opportunities this season, with a match-winning effort against the Hammers last time out coming on the back of a costly Champions League mistake in defeat to Young Boys, but Neville believes a creative playmaker is deserving of a more regular role somewhere. Nevilletold Sky Sports: ""I still maintain he should've left but he will have his moments. I was happy to see how he bounced back after what happened in Europe in midweek. ""To bounce back and score the winner is a fantastic moment for him. He's got good character, he's a very good player and I feel he should be playing 40-45 games a season. ""He won't get that at United in terms of 90-minute starts but he's one of those players that I do feel United will benefit from having. I just thought for Jesse himself, he should've left. United could be a better team with someone like Lingard in it."" Lingard appears to have no regrets at passing up another opportunity to head through the exits, with his sights locked on bringing a five-year wait for major silverware to a close in 2021-22. With his late strike against West Ham seeing United to a 2-1 victory and 13 points from five Premier League games, Lingard told MUTV of ambition on the red half of Manchester: ""You’ve got to always start well and make a statement to the rest of the teams and that’s what we’ve been doing. ""The main aim is to obviously win a trophy this season and I think we’ve got the squad depth to do that. The talent, everyone’s hungry to play and everyone’s working hard in training to get in that matchday squad. ""Everyone’s always ready to play, so the subs have got to be ready to make a difference. ""They’re always tough games against West Ham and to play them back to back is a little bit different, but we’ll go into that game full of confidence."" He added on his muted celebration against the Hammers, who helped to get his career back on track last season: ""They supported me in the loan spell and gave me a great reception, so it was only right to pay them back.""  While Lingard's goal proved to be the difference at the London Stadium, there were many more twists to an intriguing plot. West Ham had taken the lead on home soil through Said Benrahma, only to see the evergreen Cristiano Ronaldo peg them back. Lingard's telling contribution came in the 89th minute, but there was still time after that for Luke Shaw to concede a penalty, Mark Noble to be introduced off the bench to take a spot-kick and David de Gea to save it as a thrilling contest was closed out. On seeing the Spain international goalkeeper save his first penalty in 41 attempts, Lingard said: ""David’s always been a great penalty stopper and we had confidence in him and we trusted him to make the save, which he did. ""There’s been a real togetherness and everyone’s playing for each other; we’re playing to win games and playing for our fans and staff, so everyone’s ready to play."" United will be back in action on Wednesday when facing West Ham again in the third round of the Carabao Cup. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

In a match that was vital to the club's hopes of securing Champions League football for next season, Man Utd came undone as they fell 3-1 to Arsenal, another contender in the hunt for a top-four place. With the loss, Man Utd have lost three of their last four Premier League matches, with Scholes revealing that the atmosphere around the club has deteriorated. ""It's an absolute mess.

David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have all failed to rekindle former glories, while Ralf Rangnick is now preparing to pass a managerial baton to Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022. Champions League football is unlikely to be agenda for the incoming Dutch coach, with another backwards step being taken on the field at Old Trafford, but are the Red Devils heading towards their worst finish in the modern era? GOAL takes a look… Manchester United's worst Premier League campaign came in 2013-14 – in the immediate aftermath of Ferguson’s departure. The Red Devils finished that season, which saw Moyes dismissed in the April after just 10 months at the helm, in seventh spot and with just 64 points to their name. They suffered 12 defeats through 38 games – another unwanted record in the Premier League era – and collected 19 wins. Rank Season Points Position 1 2013-14 64 7th =2 2015-16 66 5th =2 2018-19 66 6th =2 2019-20 66 3rd United would finish inside the top four just once across the following three seasons, with point tallies in the 60s becoming an alarmingly common theme. Since that rather disastrous showing under Moyes, with Ryan Giggs taking charge on an interim basis in the wake of his departure, the Red Devils have finished with 66 points on three occasions. David Moyes' six-year contract at Manchester United would have ended today... 📝The worst Premier League appointment ever?! 🤦‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/pXSIA0ysXr That return was only good enough for a fifth-placed standing under Van Gaal in 2015-16, although he did deliver FA Cup glory, while a further step backwards into sixth was taken in 2018-19 as Mourinho stumbled out of the blocks and Solskjaer wobbled on the back of an initial honeymoon period. Champions League qualification was secured with 66 points in 2019-20, as a Norwegian Treble winner saw his side into third spot, and United can do no better than hit that mark again in the present. With four games remaining in their 2021-22 campaign – against Chelsea, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace – Rangnick’s men sit sixth on 54 points with 12 left to play for, meaning that they may yet post a new club-record low. Rank Season Points Position 1 1993-94 92 1st 2 1999-00 91 1st 3 2008-09 90 1st =4 2006-07 89 1st =4 2011-12 89 2nd =4 2012-13 89 1st While United have found the going tough of late, they have plenty of happy memories to fall back on. Their best showing to date came in the second year of the Premier League in 1993-94, with back-to-back title triumphs wrapped up as an Eric Cantona-inspired side collected 92 points while also going on to lift the FA Cup as part of a memorable double. A year on from going one better in completing a historic Treble, the Red Devils cemented their standing as top dogs in English football by accumulating 91 points in 1999-2000, with a club-record 28 victories collected along the way while also suffering just three defeats and plundering 97 goals. Ferguson’s men broke back into the 90s a decade later, in 2008-09, and saw their defence breached just 24 times that season as they also savoured League Cup glory. Three other campaigns, including Ferguson’s farewell tour, delivered 89-point hauls, with a final tally of 75 – on two occasions – as low as an all-time coaching great sunk in the wake of a rebranding of the English top-flight in 1992.

Questions have been asked of whether a five-time Ballon d’Or winner is starting to see his powers wane at 37 years of age, with his presence – along with 23 goals – unable to inspire an inconsistent Red Devils side to a top-four finish or major silverware in 2021-22. There have been suggestions that he could move on in the summer, but Foster sees no sign of a legendary figure slowing down and believes a standing as the greatest ever will be enhanced further as he plays on for “another year or two at least”. Foster, who is currently on the books at Watford, once played alongside Ronaldo at Old Trafford and believes his record-setting career places him slightly ahead of Argentine icon Messi in the GOAT stakes, telling The Mirror: “The level is high as you like. For a 37-year-old, he is an absolute specimen. He is still rapid. He is just one of those who is a natural goalscorer. “For me, in that eternal Messi v Ronaldo debate, he is still number one for me. “I think even this season people are completely mad that they think he is finished. He's not finished. Look how many goals he has scored, that's incredible. “For anybody, that is a fantastic season, but because it is Ronaldo, people expect 30, 40, 50 goals. No - he is playing in a team that is not firing on all cylinders so you are not going to score that many goals anyway, but for people to say that he is finished, no chance mate. “He is good to go still for another year or two at least.” Cristiano Ronaldo is the first player to score 100 league goals in La Liga and the Premier League 🐐 pic.twitter.com/mOddMcsk6n Ronaldo signed a two-year contract with United when making an emotional return to English football in the summer of 2021. There are still 12 months left to run on that agreement, but there has been talk of a veteran frontman taking his considerable skill set elsewhere for 2022-23. A retracing of steps to Real Madrid has been speculated on for a man that previously broke countless records in the Spanish capital, while there has been plenty of discussion regarding a fresh start in MLS. Ronaldo has offered no indication that he is readying himself for a new challenge, but a lack of Champions League football with the Red Devils may see his head turned.

A Portuguese superstar at Old Trafford has faced questions of his value to a collective cause in 2021-22, but has still plundered 23 goals to keep an inconsistent outfit in the hunt for European qualification. There have been suggestions that he will walk away from the final year of a lucrative contract once the current campaign comes to a close, but interim boss Rangnick – who will be sticking around as a consultant while also taking the reins of the Austria national team – is reluctant to be drawn on whether a five-time Ballon d’Or winner will still be a United player in 2022-23. When that question was put to Rangnick by Sky Sports ahead of a Premier League clash with Brentford, the German tactician said: “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. “He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious.” Cristiano Ronaldo has scored eight of Manchester United’s last nine goals in the Premier League 🇵🇹 pic.twitter.com/SIg3HZulUk Rangick is yet to discuss Ronaldo with Ten Hag, with no talks of any kind having taken place between United’s head coaches of the present and future. Quizzed on whether he has spoken with a man seeing out the current campaign at Eredivisie title hopefuls Ajax, Rangnick said: “I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! “He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that.” Transfer plans need to be drawn up by United at some stage over the coming weeks, with it important that they do not leave themselves playing catch-up when another window swings open. Investment over recent years has delivered little return, as the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have shown how it should be done, but Rangnick believes the gap to arch-rivals can be closed sooner than many people think. He has said of recruitment by the Red Devils: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The talented teenager, who has already broken into the full Argentina squad, made his Premier League bow off the bench in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford – as he came on to partner Cristiano Ronaldo in attack during the close stages of that game. His intention is to see many more minutes over the coming years, as Erik ten Hag prepares to inherit first-team reins from Ralf Rangnick, but for now his focus is locked on catching the eye at youth level – with a prominent role played for United’s U18 side this season in their run to the FA Youth Cup final. Having stepped back down from the senior fold for now, Garnacho was among the goals on Sunday during a clash with Liverpool. Alejandro Garnacho's goal against Liverpool U23s pic.twitter.com/wC1qLy7LLl He figured against the Reds as part of a side that also included Alvaro Fernandez and Hannibal Mejbri, with United continuing to see highly-rated talent drop off a fabled conveyor belt. Garnacho’s strike against Liverpool further highlighted why he is held in such high regard, as he raced through on goal to finish with aplomb. The Red Devils would go on to lose the game 3-1, but that is all part of a steep learning curve for a Madrid-born youngster that is now rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi with club and country. Garnacho is understandably delighted at enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22 and has posted on social media: “Incredible moment making my debut at 17 years old for Manchester United in the Premier League at the Theatre of Dreams. “I can’t put into words what I’m feeling right now, I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was 4 years old. “I would like to thank everyone at the club for giving me this opportunity, my family for always being there for me, my friends and all the fans for their constant support. The hard work continues in order to have more nights like these. And remember guys, Dreams really do come true.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Blues strengthened their hold on third place with a 1-0 win at Selhurst Park, thanks to Hakim Ziyech's 89th minute strike. But Lukaku once more failed to impress, or indeed even make himself noticed out on the pitch in south London. The ex-Inter man recorded the first touch of the afternoon on Saturday, kicking off for Chelsea to get proceedings underway. 2 - Romelu Lukaku had just two touches of the ball in the first half against Crystal Palace, with one of those being the first pass of the game from kick-off. Ghosted. pic.twitter.com/lS4zCe3FQp But that was about all Chelsea fans saw of him in a dire opening 45 minutes for the Belgian, who mustered just one more touch before the half-time whistle blew. The second half was hardly any better and he finished the match having had contact with the ball on just seven occasions, one of which was that kick-off - fewer than any Premier League player since Opta data started being recorded (2003-04). 7 - Romelu Lukaku had just seven touches against Crystal Palace, the fewest in a single Premier League game for a player with 90+ minutes played since this data is available in full for the competition (2003-04). One of those touches was from kick-off in the first half. Quiet. Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge to great fanfare over the summer, having proved crucial in Inter's successful bid to reclaim the Serie A title from Juventus for the first time in 10 years. But his second spell at Chelsea has so far fallen well short of expectations following his reported club record £97.5 million move. The Belgian managed 24 Serie A goals last term but has netted just five times in 17 Premier League games this time round, while he also provoked the wrath of the Chelsea support with an explosive Sky Sport Italia interview in December in which he admitted misgivings over manager Thomas Tuchel's methods and that he had never wanted to leave Inter in the first place. Questioned over Lukaku's dismal display on Saturday, Tuchel told reporters: ""I'm not so sure if I have a good answer. I don't know what it says. ""It says he was obviously not involved and could not make a point today. I am not sure if it says so much about us in general."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The human rights organisation has documented the experiences of 34 employees from eight private security companies as they continue to cast an eye over goings on in the Middle East during the build up to a major international tournament. It found that migrant workers are being forced into shifts for months or even years on end without a day off, in a clear breach of Qatari law, with a number of the business involved tied to projects at World Cup venues or events such as the 2020 Club World Cup and 2021 FIFA Arab Cup. Amnesty has said in a statement released on the organisation’s official website: “Security guards in Qatar are working in conditions which amount to forced labour, including on projects linked to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Amnesty International has found. In a new report, 'They think that we're machines', the organization documented the experiences of 34 current or former employees of eight private security companies in Qatar. “The security guards, all migrant workers, described routinely working 12 hours a day, seven days a week – often for months or even years on end without a day off. Most said their employers refused to respect the weekly rest day which is required by Qatari law, and workers who took their day off anyway faced being punished with arbitrary wage deductions. One man described his first year in Qatar as ‘survival of the fittest’.” Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, has added: “The abuses we uncovered can all be traced back to the massive power imbalance that still exists between employers and migrant workers in Qatar, indicating that there are still major gaps in the authorities’ enforcement of labour laws. Many of the security guards we spoke to knew their employers were breaking the law but felt powerless to challenge them. Physically and emotionally exhausted, workers kept reporting for duty under threat of financial penalties – or worse, contract termination or deportation. “Despite the progress Qatar has made in recent years, our research suggests that abuses in the private security sector – which will be increasingly in demand during the World Cup – remain systematic and structural. Employers are still exploiting their workers in plain sight, and the Qatari authorities must take urgent measures to protect workers and hold abusers accountable. “With the World Cup just months away, FIFA must focus on doing more to prevent abuses in the inherently perilous private security sector, or see the tournament further marred by abuse. “More broadly, FIFA must also use its leverage to pressure Qatar to better implement its reforms and enforce its laws. Time is fast running out – if better practices are not established now, abuses will continue long after fans have gone home.” World football’s governing body has said, after agreeing to meet with Amnesty when human rights concerns were raised regarding working conditions in Qatar: “FIFA does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the World Cup.” It added: “Following inspections during the Club World Cup and Arab Cup, contractors that failed to comply with the required standards were identified and the issues found addressed on the spot.” The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), who were appointed by FIFA as World Cup organisers, have said of their decision not to renew contracts with two companies: “Unfortunately, three companies were found to be non-compliant across a number of areas during the 2020 Club World Cup and 2021 Arab Cup. “These violations were completely unacceptable and led to a range of measures being enforced, including placing contractors on a watch-list or black-list to avoid them working on future projects - including the Fifa World Cup - before reporting [them] to the Ministry of Labour.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Infantino has been pushing his hotly-debated Future of Football project for many months now, with former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger leading the initiative that has proposed the staging of a World Cup every two years rather than four. The plans have been widely rejected by European and political organisations, but Infantino remains undeterred and is now claiming that the change is crucial for the future of the game in African countries. Infantino has risked a backlash by suggesting that doubling the frequency of the World Cup could prevent African migrants from risking their lives to gain entry into Europe in search of ""opportunities"". The 51-year-old told the parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg: “This topic is not about whether we want a World Cupevery two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football. “If we think about the rest of the world and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings. Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams. We cannot say to the rest of the world 'give us your money, but watch us on TV'. We need to include them. “We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea. “We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We discuss it.” Following a backlash against his comments, Infantino later released a statement claiming that his words - which were recorded live and quoted at length by many media outlets - were taken out of context. He said: “Given that certain remarks made by me before the Council of Europe earlier today appear to have been misinterpreted and taken out of context, I wish to clarify that, in my speech, my more general message was that everyone in a decision-making position has a responsibility to help improve the situation of people around the world. ""If there are more opportunities available, including in Africa, but certainly not limited to that continent, this should allow people to take these opportunities in their own countries. ""This was a general comment, which was not directly related to the possibility of playing a FIFA World Cup every two years."" Infantino, Wenger and former FIFA president Sepp Blatter have all spoken passionately about the potential benefits of holding the World Cup on a more regular basis, but their plans have not been well received by the football community. The Football Supporters Europe [FSE] organisation has declared ""we do not want or need more World Cups"" while UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has warned that European football's main governing body and CONMEBOL could boycott future tournaments. A number of active footballers have also spoken out to condemn the proposal, including Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""You hear that they want to put a European Championship and a World Cup every year,"" he told Sky Sports in October. ""When will we get a rest? Never.So, in the end, top players will get injured all the time and that's the end of it. ""It's something that should be much better and better-taken care of. We're not robots.""

It was announced in December 2010 that the competition would be held in Qatar, sparking outrage across the football world. Reports that thousands of migrant workers have died during construction of stadiums in Qatar, as well as the country's human rights abuses and concerns about the safety of LGBT fans, have resulted in calls for the country to be stripped of the tournament. Many players and coaches have spoken out against the decision to play the World Cup in Qatar, and Netherlands boss Van Gaal is the latest to express his anger. ""I have already mentioned it in previous press conferences. I think it's ridiculous that the World Cup is there,"" he told reporters on Monday. “We are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there. That's bullshit, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA. ""Why do you think I'm not on any committee at FIFA or UEFA with my expertise? Because I have always opposed these kinds of organizations. ""I can say that in Qatar later, but that won't help the world get rid of this problem."" Many players and national teams have already publicly criticised the decision to give Qatar the World Cup. Last year, Norway, Netherlands and Germany protested Qatar's human rights recordbefore World Cup qualifying matches by wearing t-shirts with slogans onto the field. Meanwhile, Germany midfielder Toni Kroos said last March that it was ""wrong"" to give the country the hosting rights. FIFA met with representatives of Amnesty International last week in Zurich to discuss ""the situation of migrant workers in Qatar"".

Qatar were controversially handed the rights to host the 2022 World Cup back in 2010, with the country's poor human rights record subsequently highlighted amid accusations that migrant workers have been mistreated during structural preparations for the tournament. A number of high profile figures in the game have spoken out, including Southgate, who has expressed concern over the safety of travelling supporters. “I think I’m quite clear on the areas of concern about this tournament,”the England manager said earlier this month. “The building of the stadiums was the first, and there’s nothing we can do about that now. They’re built. ""There are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas. “Then there are the issues that potentially threaten our fans when they travel: the rights of women and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in particular. ""It would be horrible to think some of our fans feel they can’t go because they feel threatened or they’re worried about their safety. So there needs to be some clarity and some better communication that they are going to be safe, because they’re not feeling that.” Al Khater, the chief executive of this year's World Cup, has now come out to question the validity of Southgate's opinions while also defending the conditions for workers in Qatar. ""My question would be, who from the England squad has come to Qatar? My question to the coach is, has he been to Qatar? Is he basing his opinions and his public statements on what he has read?"" Al Khater has told Sky Sports. ""Because it is kind of an issue if you're basing your opinions and you are very vocal about that based on things you have read. Somebody with a lot of influence, such as Southgate, somebody with a big audience that listens to what he says, ought to pick his words very carefully. ""And I think that before making statements like that, when it comes to the workers, he needs to come here and speak to workers and understand what workers get out of being here. ""There are isolated cases, those are the cases that make it to the media, however, I can assure him that if he comes here and speaks to the majority of the workers, they will tell you how they put their children through university, they will tell you how they've built their houses for them and their families. ""And these are the stories that nobody hears, so I look forward to welcoming him here, I look forward to meeting him at the draw and he can listen to my opinion, he does not have to believe it, but at least he needs to go that far to understand different opinions and different cultures. ""No country is perfect, let's get that right and I do not think anybody can claim that, so if somebody is coming and claiming they are a perfect country, they need to really take a look at themselves."" Al Khater added on the suggestion that LGBT groups may not feel safe in Qatar: ""People need to understand Qatar is the safest country in the Middle East, it is the second safest country in the world. ""People will feel safe here. We have our culture, we have our norms, what we ask of them is to respect it. What that means is, whether you are a gay couple, whether you are a heterosexual couple, we have the same norms, we look at it the same way. ""So, all we ask is for people to be respectful, like we are respectful when we travel around the world, and basically just to observe these cultural differences. Basically what it means is public displays of affection is frowned upon, that is simply it."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Football’s world governing body has suggested a biennial competition as part of a revamp of the current calendar. However, the proposal has met with significant opposition from those who question how it would fit in to an already-busy football schedule. Speaking at the Global Soccer Awards, where he was named Best Men’s Player of The Year, PSG striker Mbappe said: “World Cup, every two years? I can’t say if it’s right or wrong. “It’s something unique that happens every four years. Playing it every two years would become a normal competition. “We already play 60 games a year. We are happy to play, but when it’s too much it is too much. If you want to have quality you have to allow the players to rest.” Mbappe is the latest name to comment on what is becoming an increasingly divisive issue in football. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who is FIFA’s head of global development, has backed the idea. The Frenchman says the plans would mean fewer qualifying games and international breaks during the season and more high-stakes knockout matches, which he says is what the fans want. However, the plans have been met with some opposition, most notably from the European and South American governing bodies UEFA and CONMEBOL. Both bodies have publicly opposed FIFA's plans for more regular World Cups, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin expressing ""grave concerns"" about the proposals earlier this year. Earlier this month the two organisations revealed plans for South American teams to join the Nations League from 2024, which appears to directly conflict with FIFA’s plans.

This was done with the country's sweltering summer temperatures in mind, with the winter climate set to be slightly cooler for players. But how will the 2022 World Cup impact the Premier League schedule, especially with the league's festive season being one of the busiest times of the season? Goal takes a look. The World Cup will take place betweenNovember 21,2022andDecember 18, 2022. The tournament will take place in Qatar. The 2022 World Cup is the first iteration of the tournament to be held in the winter, as opposed to the traditional summer months, due to the overwhelming heat in Qatar that would make it difficult for players. It was decided that the competition would be moved to December, owing to the cooler temperatures, but this means that European club schedules will be greatly impacted. The Premier League has confirmed that a break of six weeks will take place to accommodate for the 2022 World Cup. Players representing their countrywill be unavailable for club duty inorder to be in Qatar for six weeks. The break will begin on November 14, 2022 and end on December 26, 2022 (Boxing Day), eight days after the World Cup final in Qatar on December 18. The final weekend of the 2022-23 Premier League season will be played on May 28, 2023, six days later than when the 2021-22 campaign is set to finish. Usually, the Premier League season begins mid-August and concludes in mid-May. Reports suggest that the Championship will also be paused throughout the World Cup, but their break will not be as long as the Premier League's. League One and League Two are both still expected to continue. Following the conclusion of the World Cup, participating players are expected to reintegrate themselves into domestic club action almost immediately. Any kind of schedule change will be even more of a headache for the Premier League, as the festive period is already traditionally the busiest time of the season, with an abundance of midweek games. The likes of La Liga, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 are likely to follow the same plan. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Egypt missed out on a place at Qatar 2022 after losing on penalties to Senegal in their play-off tie, just over a month after being beaten in the same fashion by the Lions in the Afcon final. However, the second leg was overshadowed by the actions of a number of the home supporters before, during and after the game, with Salah receiving the brunt of the abuse. Egypt's team bus was left with a smashed windscreen after fans threw objects at the vehicle before its arrival at Senegal's new 50,000 capacity stadium. Salah, meanwhile, was targeted by lasers from the stands as he stepped up to take his decisive penalty in the shootout, which he ultimately blazed over the bar. The Liverpool star was also pelted with objects while being escorted off the pitch by security and the Egyptian football association claimed that racist banners had been held up in a subsequent statement confirming that they had filed a complaint to FIFA. Gamal Allam, the head of the Egyptian FA, has now revealed that their complaint included a request to replay the match. ""Hani Abu Rida, Hassan Mustafa and the Egyptian officials in the African and International Federations must intervene to support the Egyptian team,"" Allam said, as quoted by Youm7 Sport. “I am on my way to Qatar to attend the FIFA Congress on Thursday afternoon. We asked to meet FIFA President Gianni Infantino as well as Patrice Motsepe, President of the Confederation of African Football. ""We asked for a replay of the match because the match was held in a strange atmosphere, and if we had lost in normal circumstances, we would have congratulated Senegal. ""We will present what happened to the disciplinary committee in the Federation and await a response. There are many things that happened with us in the match. Our players were attacked. ""Mohamed Salah had the most share of the Senegalese fans' attack on him, which tried to intimidate the players as well, and we asked that the board of directors be on the bench of the matchbut they refused."" Carlos Queiroz resigned as Egypt head coach after the game, but Allam says his future remains up in the air until a final decision is made on whether the result stands or not. ""If it is decided to replay the Senegal match, there will be no room to talk about Queiroz's position until the match ends,and we will resolve his position if the match is not repeated,"" the Egypt chief added.

Reasons for FIFA requests explained,"When the final five places available to African nations at World Cup 2022 were dished out, Egypt and Algeria were among those to be left empty-handed. Both had made their way to the CAF play-offs, but suffered painful setbacks in two-legged encounters to leave them among those being forced to watch on from afar when the global showpiece heads to Qatar. Neither country is accepting their fate without a fight, though, with both lodging appeals to FIFA in which replays of their most recent fixtures are being demanded. Why is that the case and what will happen next? GOAL takes a look… Egypt were the first to lodge an official complaint with FIFA after suffering more penalty shootout pain against Senegal – with that setback coming on the back of an Africa Cup of Nations final defeat to the same opponents. The Pharaohs had entered the second leg of a heavyweight encounter holding a narrow 1-0 lead, but conceded a fourth-minute own goal of the tie as the contest eventually went all the way to spot-kicks. Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah had several lasers aimed at his face when preparing to step up from 12 yards – with his effort eventually sailing high over the crossbar – while Egypt’s team bus was attacked prior to the game and racist banners were displayed inside and outside of the stadium. A statement from the Egyptian FA read: “The Egyptian Football Association have lodged a formal complaint against its Senegalese counterpart to the match observer, the security official, CAF, and FIFA, before the start of the match between the two teams. “The Egyptian team was subjected to racism after the appearance of offensive banners in the stands aimed at the players, specifically Mohamed Salah. “Moreover, the Senegalese fans terrorised the Egyptian players by throwing bottles and stones at them during the warm-up, as well as attacking the Egyptian team bus, which caused glass shattering and some injuries, which was documented with pictures and videos attached to the complaint.” On the same evening, Algeria also missed out on qualification for World Cup 2022 by the narrowest of margins. They had also led into the second leg of their clash with Cameroon, but saw Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting restore parity before Islam Slimani had two goals disallowed. Ahmed Touba thought he had booked tickets to Qatar when netting in extra-time, but Karl Toko-Ekambi found the target in the fourth minute of stoppage-time to send the Indomitable Lions through. Samuel Eto'o's reaction after Cameroon qualified for the World Cup in the 124th minute 🇨🇲😍 pic.twitter.com/tNB4ghymMJ Algeria were also left feeling wronged, particularly by the match officials on display, and sent an appeal of their own to world football’s governing body. Their statement read: “FAF officially lodges an appeal with FIFA against the scandalous arbitration which distorted the result of the match. “We are determined to use all the legally permitted votes to have their rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration.” Egypt and Algeria are yet to receive an official response to their appeals, with FIFA still mulling things over. It is expected that definitive decisions will be made by the end of April, with everybody needing to know where they stand. The draw for the finals in Qatar has already been made, with group-stage fixtures being lined up. Senegal are due to face the host nation, Ecuador and the Netherlands in their section, while Cameroon have been pooled with Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia. No Mohamed Salah at the 2022 World Cup 😩 pic.twitter.com/DRVQcnFfkk If no alterations are made to that schedule, then the likes of Salah – who is already 29 years of age – will have to wait until the World Cup heads to North and Central America in 2026 for their next opportunity to rub shoulders with the global elite.

Salah was caught on video in the Egypt dressing room speaking in frank terms with his team-mates. “I told the players before the second match that I am proud to play with them and they are among the best I have played with,"" he explained. “I played for some time with the previous generation, with Wael Gomaa and Mohamed Abu Trika, then Abdullah Al-Saeed and his generation, but I'm happy with the current generation. “I am proud to play with you and it was an honour for me, and what happened cannot be interfered with by anyone because for the second time it is a penalty shootout (after the AFCON final). ""There is not much I can say but it has been an honour to play with you, whether I will be in the national team after that or not."" Egyptian Minister of Sports, Ashraf Sobhi, however, interrupted him, saying: ""You will be there."" The game against Senegal, that saw Salah miss a penalty in the shoot-out, was marred with controversy, with Egypt having since requested the game be replayed citing racism and abuse from the crowd. Salah in particular was targeted, with lasers having been shone in his face before he blazed his penalty over the bar, while he had to be protected by security staff as missiles were pelted in his direction as he attempted to leave the pitch after the game. While Salah's international future may be up in the air, he remains a hero both for Egypt and in Liverpool, where a new mural was unveiled for the star.

The 29-year-old is yet to renew his contract with the Reds but his agent is currently negotiating with the club to have him stay at Anfield, with a big-money four-year deal rumoured to be on offer. Sobhi has revealed he personally told Salah, whose deal at the club is set to expire in 2023, to leave Liverpool after Egypt’s defeat to Senegal in their 2022 World Cup play-off. “I met with Mohamed Salah at the airport after the end of the Senegal match and the failure to reach the World Cup finals and said to him to forget what happened and focus on what’s next,” Sobhi told Egyptian radio on Monday as quoted by The Metro. “I have advised him to continue his journey at a club other than Liverpool, but his direction now is to renew his contract with Liverpool. ""There are campaigns against Salah directed by some to bring him down, but I asked him not to pay attention to them.” Ahead of Liverpool's Champions League away clash against Benfica on Tuesday, manager Jurgen Klopp said Salah’s representatives are currently locked in negotiations with the club regarding his contract. “I am happy because there is nothing new to say, it is good. The decisive parties are talking to each other and that is all I need,” Klopp told reporters. On Salah’s form, which has seen him not score from open play since the  3-1 win over relegation-threatened Norwich City, Klopp said: “He [Salah] might not have scored in open play, I don’t know that is not important, for me his performance level is important, how he brings players together, when he gets the ball two or three players come to him, he could make better decisions but it is a tough gig, Africa for him and Sadio [Mane], but it is completely normal in a season. “We see him every day in training and it is nothing to worry about. These players will not come to me and ask for a break so I have to pick the moment.” While Salah has so far in this season managed 20 Premier League goals from 28 appearances, he has also notched eight goals in the Champions League campaign.

Transfer talk has surrounded the Serbia international for some time, with his reputation having been enhanced during a productive spell in the Italian capital. At just 24 years of age, there is considered to still be plenty of potential to be unlocked in his game. United are reported to have expressed an interest in buying into that development, with a big-money move to Old Trafford being mooted. Another Premier League window has, however, swung shut with no deal done and Milinkovic-Savic insists he never considered a switch to be on the cards. He told Sport Plus: “You’ll never hear me say that I want to leave Lazio. “I never mentioned a possible transfer to Manchester United, it was just a newspaper story. “The situation doesn’t weigh on me because I know there’s still time for a possible transfer. “If something has to happen, it will. There hasn’t been anything until now and we’re moving forward.”  Milinkovic-Savic recenty told Serbian media outlet Espreso that he was pleased to see the latest round of rumours brought to a close. He said: “The Premier League transfer window is shut, so theManchester Unitedstory is finished. “I wasn’t irritated by everything that was written in the papers, because my mind was concentrated on preparing for the new season in the best possible way. “I am where I am and I want for nothing at Lazio. “I don’t think much about the transfer market. All sorts of things were written about me, but I know where my mind is and who I have a contract with.” Lazio have Milinkovic-Savic tied to a long-term contract through to the end of the 2022-23 season. With that deal in place they are under no pressure to sell, but club president Claudio Lotito conceded earlier this summer that there may come a day when his hand is forced. He said when quizzed on a prized asset: “If an important offer arrives, it is only right the club take it into consideration.” Windows are still open across Europe, but there will be no approaches from the Premier League to fend off until at least January as English top flight clubs have seen their market shut down for 2019.

The Swedish starlet teed up a five-time Ballon d’Or for the first of his three goals against the Canaries at Old Trafford, with an all-time great netting a timely hat-trick in a Premier League fixture that the Red Devils had to win. Elanga joined in with an iconic celebration against the Canaries, with Ronaldo happy to share the limelight as part of a double act rather than have it all to himself – a situation he has grown accustomed to down the years. Elanga has told United’s official website of fluffing his lines somewhat when trying to emulate a talismanic team-mate: “That was an exciting time, the double SIUUU! “I didn't expect it. He said: 'Let's do it'. I said: 'Fair enough' but, if you see in the video, I didn't really get into the air properly! But I managed to do it anyway and it was a special moment. “He is someone I look up to and speak to and ask for advice and stuff. He is a special player to work with.” The 20-year-old forward added on earning the trust of Ronaldo after providing him with another assist: “We spoke about it the day before actually. How we were going to work in terms of pressing. “If you get an opportunity, to look up. If he gets an opportunity, to look up for me, as I'll be in the box or he will be in the box.” Anthony Elanga got the last word 🤫 pic.twitter.com/FV1zfF4RAk Elanga is enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22, with 24 appearances taken in across all competitions. He has recorded three goals, having made his senior bow last season, and is looking to make the most of an opportunity to work alongside Ronaldo on a daily basis “You can see his record and the amount of goals he's scored. I think it's 100 in the Premier League,” Elanga said of partnering a record-breaking colleague in United’s attack. “He knows what it takes to get to the top so it's more than right to just speak to someone like that. And, yeah, we have a chat the day before or even during a game. You might see us in the warm-up. “He'll speak to me and [Jadon] Sancho together about what we can do in the game, to affect the games, and it's important to have someone like that in the team.” United will be back in Premier League action on Monday when playing host to Brentford.

Rice has earned a reputation as one of the top midfielders in English football over the past few years, helping West Ham emerge as top-four contenders in the process. The 23-year-old's stellar performances have not gone unnoticed, with United and Chelsea both reportedly eager to bring him onto their books this summer, but Ferdinand doesn't think Old Trafford would be the best place for him to continue his development. West Ham are only two points behind sixth-placed United in the Premier League at the moment, and still have a game in hand, while they are also competing in the Europa League semi-finals. Ferdinand doesn't think the Red Devils would be much of a step up for Rice at the moment, with Erik ten Hag set to begin a rebuilding job at Old Trafford when he arrives from Ajax in the summer. ""Man Utd isn't the place to go right now. They're going through a massive transitional period,"" the former Hammers centre-half has told The Sun. ""For me personally, if I'm Rice, Man Utd is not a place that I'd be going. I'd wait a few years and see what Ten Hag does. Whether he can implement what he did at Ajax at Man Utd and get them looking more like a team that can challenge. ""Otherwise, what's the point in leaving West Ham to go somewhere you're not even challenging for a title. You're challenging to get into Europe. That's what West Ham are doing - challenging to get into the Champions League. ""We've got something to build on. He'd be in the same place at Man Utd and all it would come down to is the stature of the football club. ""As a footballer myself, I'm not going somewhere just because it's a bigger club. You've got everything at a club where you're loved and you're the main man. ""At Man Utd, you'll be one of many. Whereas, you can stay at West Ham and challenge for Europe and be the main man."" Ferdinand added: ""Me personally, I'd rather stay [than join United]. But if it was one of the teams that were fighting for the league, and they came up with the money, it would be hard for West Ham to keep him. ""Like I said, if he did go, as fans we'd appreciate what he has done for the club. He'd always be loved and classed as a legend. ""And if we got £100m-plus for him and it went back into the playing squad, then we can't grumble."" Speculation over Rice's future at West Ham is raging amid reports that he has rejected two lucrative contract extension offers, with his current deal due to expire in 2024. Moyes does not believe the midfielder will seek to move on at the end of the season, though, as he told reporters earlier this week: “I’ve said it [where I stand] and I think we have said what we think. “We like Dec and he’s got three-and-a-half years to go on his contract so I don’t think there is any big panic. “Maybe he just wants more money. People do turn down contracts. It is not unusual for players at clubs to turn down contracts, maybe it's a negotiation tactic.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

53,https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-same-level-maradona-pochettino-backs-psg-star/blt18292cb4db68873a,'Messi is on same level as Maradona' - Pochettino backs PSG star to silence critics next season,"Lionel Messi is ""on the same level"" as Diego Maradona, according to Mauricio Pochettino, who has backed the Paris Saint-Germain superstar to silence his critics next season. Messi cemented his status among football's all-time greats during his 17-year stay at Barcelona, where he won multiple La Liga and Champions League crowns while also becoming the club's record goalscorer. The diminutive forward was forced to leave at the end of his contract last summer amid the Blaugrana's well-documented financial crisis, and he was then snapped up by PSG on a free transfer, but has not been able to live up to his usual standards in his first year at Parc des Princes. Messi has been overshadowed by Kylian Mbappe throughout the 2021-22 campaign as he has struggled for consistency in the final third of the pitch, with some PSG fans even singling out the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner for boos and jeers after their Champions League round of 16 defeat to Real Madrid. With the Ligue 1 title already secured, Messi drew another blank during a 3-3 draw at Strasbourg on Friday, but Pochettino thinks he has been unfairly judged after a turbulent 12 months. The PSG boss has also compared the 34-year-old to the late Argentine icon Maradona, who inspired his country to World Cup glory in 1986. ""We’re not talking about an ordinary player, Messi is on the same level as Diego Maradona,"" Pochettino has told RMC Sport. ""It is clear that his move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain was a big change, in which an adaptation process was necessary. Certain circumstances didn’t allow him to feel as comfortable as he did at Barcelona where he’d spent 20 years. Where he had been the standard-bearer of the club. ""To judge Messi in this way is unfair. I have no doubts about his quality… Next season will be a completely different season for him. ""This has been a year of learning, and not only at the professional level in coming to Paris, in a new league and with new team-mates, but also at the level of family. This must be taken into account. It’s a major upheaval that can affect a player."" Messi missed the first few games of the 2021-22 season as he sought to build his fitness back up following Argentina's 2021 Copa America triumph and took time to find his feet when eventually introduced into Pochettino's line-up. The former Barca captain has appeared in a total of 31 games in all competitions for PSG to date, but has only managed to find the net nine times. Messi has, however, still proven to be a creative master in a slightly deeper role, as he has managed to provide 13 assists for his team-mates, and could yet improve his tallies in the club's final three games of the season against Troyes, Montpellier and Metz.

Arsenal signed Saliba from Saint Etienne for £27 million ($34m) in July 2019, and immediately sent him back to Stade Geoffroy-Guichard on loan. The Frenchman has since had two more loan spells away from Emirates Stadium, the latest of which saw him join Marseille for the duration of the 2021-22 campaign with the Gunners yet to hand him his competitive debut in English football. Henry has questioned Mikel Arteta's handling of Saliba, who he believes has proved his quality at Stade Velodrome over the past 10 months. ""They didn't even let him make a mistake,"" the Arsenal legend told Amazon Prime of his old club's treatment of Saliba. ""He left before an error. ""He didn't even have the chance to compete for his place. What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. ""Now he belongs to Arsenal, I don't know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. ""What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him.  Anyway, he responded well and that's the most important thing."" Saliba discussed his situation before Marseille's 3-0 home defeat to Lyon on Sunday, admitting he would welcome the chance to stay at Stade Velodrome beyond the end of the season. ""My wish is to finish well, to leave on a good note in case I don't come back anymore, but I try not to think too much about my future, otherwise I'm less focused on the games,"" the 21-year-old said. ""I'd be happy to come back here, no matter what. It's Marseille, it's my club."" Saliba is under contract at Arsenal until 2024, but is already excited over the prospect of playing Champions League football at Marseille next season, with the club currently sitting second in Ligue 1 with three fixtures remaining. ""The Champions League with OM? When you see the atmosphere in the Conference League or in Ligue 1, I can't even imagine what it would be like on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening,"" he said.

Van Nistelrooy was one of the finest strikers of his generation, scoring more than 300 goals in his career despite repeated battles with injury. He will now embark on his first senior coaching job at one of the Eredivisie's top sides. ""PSV has appointed 45-year-old former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy as their new manager on a 2025 contract to replace Roger Schmidt, who will leave his post at the end of the season when his contract ends,"" PSV explained in a statement published on the club's official website. ✔ PSV U19✔ Assistant coach @OnsOranje & PSV✔ Jong PSVReady for the next step: 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗣𝗦𝗩 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺. Van Nistelrooy said: “It has always been my dream to be head coach at PSV. “I’ve worked intensively with Toon Gerbrands, PSV’s current General Manager, the past few seasons. ""I was convinced I could pursue a professional coaching career and originally thought I needed one more year to gain experience. ""But sometimes things do go their way and you find out that life is not completely manageable. This is the right moment to take the next step.” Van Nistelrooy's ties with PSV go back a long way. The forward came to prominence at the club after smashing 77 goals in 90 games between 1998 and 2000, a record which helped them to back-to-back league titles and also prompted United to take him to Old Trafford. At United and later Madrid, the Dutchman added three Premier League and Liga crowns to his collection and also finished as the Champions League top scorer in three different seasons, though he never got his hands on the European crown. A serious knee injury in 2008 while playing for Madrid curtailed his career at the top level and Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots four years later after spells at Hamburg and PSV. He then turned his hand to coaching, spending time as Dick Advocaat's Netherlands assistant and most recently as part of the youth set-up at PSV. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

57,https://www.goal.com/en/news/vinicius-tobias-real-madrid-teenage-signing-brazil-alexander/blt851cb664e4627f8e,Vinicius Tobias: Real Madrid's new teenage signing could be Brazil's answer to Alexander-Arnold,"Dani Alves, Cafu, Carlos Alberto - when it comes to producing top-quality right-backs, few do it better than Brazil. The well, however, has run dry in recent years, so much so that despite being less than a month away from his 39th birthday, Alves is expected to be the Selecao's starter in the position for the 2022 World Cup. Quite who steps into the Barcelona star's shoes when he eventually hangs up his boots is anyone's guess right now, but there is hope that in a few years, the next top Brazilian right-back will be ready to pull on that famous yellow shirt. The player in question is Vinicius Tobias, who has been raising eyebrows for a number of years in his homeland, having come through the ranks at Internacional. The 18-year-old, who on April 1 completed a move to Real Madrid, appeared on the radars of Brazilian fans after helping the country's Under-15s win the South American Championship in 2019, with Vinicius scoring in the final victory over Argentina. He has since been likened to Trent Alexander-Arnold, in part because, like the Liverpool star, he started life as a central midfielder who has since been moved to the flank, but has been able to retain his playmaking abilities. Madrid are in desperate need of such a player within their first team, with Dani Carvajal having been exposed at times this season, particularly in the Champions League, while versatile duo Nacho and Lucas Vazquez are not natural right-backs despite having both filled in when Carvajal has been absent. There are high hopes at Madrid for 16-year-old Alejandro Jimenez, who is already a regular in the Blancos' U19s side, but with Bayern Munich sniffing around the Spain youth international, Vinicius has a real chance to nail down a starting role at Santiago Bernabeu for years to come. His road to the Spanish capital has, however, not been an easy one. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: At the age of just 12, Vinicius was forced to leave his mother's home in Sao Paulo and move over 1,100 kilometres (685 miles) south along Brazil's eastern coast to Porto Alegre, where he had been enrolled into Internacional's academy. He caught the eye of the club's scouts with his ability to take on opponents and drive into the penalty area from central midfield, as well as his vision of the game and tendency to always find team-mates with his passes. ""I was signed as a forward, but by 2017, I was playing as a midfielder,"" Vinicius told GloboEsporte when relaying the tale of his transition to right-back. ""Our full-back, Gustavo Bagatini, was injured and we didn't have another one. I asked the coach, Lucas Marchetti, for the chance to play there. It wasn't very difficult, but I still had a lot to learn."" Vinicius learned quickly, and he has never looked back, crowning his time at Internacional by helping the club win the Brazilian U20 Championship in 2021. “He is the typical Brazilian player, an athlete with technical abilities of a very high level,"" Joao Miguel, who coached Vinicius to that title, tells GOAL. ""The relationship between the ball and and him is great, while the ability he has to solve the problems of the game is also very high, as well as his understanding of the tactical issues of the game. “His physical attributes are very good, too, and he has good mental strength. He is a player who likes a duel and who enjoys the challenges of the game. ""So it is with huge happiness that he is already making his way abroad, where he will shine thanks to all of these skills."" Those skills led to interest from a number of top European clubs in Vinicius, with Real Madrid joined by Bayern Munich, Juventus and Atletico Madrid in monitoring the progress of the teenager. However, the race to sign Vinicius was won by Shakhtar Donetsk, who announced in July 2021 that they had agreed a €6 million (£5m/$7m) deal to bring the defender to Ukraine, with Vinicius set to arrive six months later. He left Internacional without ever having played a first-team match for his boyhood club, but he was instantly integrated into the Shakhtar senior squad, with whom he spent their mid-season training camp in Turkey, appearing in six friendlies. Those games look likely to be his only appearances for the club, however, with Vinicius one of a group of Brazilian players based in Ukraine who took to social media upon Russia's invasion of the country in a bid to find safe passage out of their adopted home. After a number of days, the youngster joined his compatriots in crossing the border out of Ukraine, before it was announced by FIFA that players from Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to move outside of the transfer window so as to further their careers. Aware of him from their previous interest, Madrid moved quickly to secure Vinicius' signature, signing him on an initial loan through to the end of the 2022-23 season, with the option to make the deal permanent for €17m (£14m/$18m) included. Though he has been through a lot since his arrival in Europe, Vinicius has settled well in Spain, and recently debuted for Real Madrid Castilla in the third tier of Spanish football. He has also trained with the first-team squad, though he is ineligible to play for them this season due to there already being three non-European Union players - Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Eder Militao - who play regularly in Carlo Ancelotti's side. Vinicius' time to step onto the Liga stage will come, however, even if he has to wait for his chance. It is something he is getting used to doing, but there is a belief that once he arrives into top-level football, he is unlikely to depart anytime soon. Brazil's long history of producing the world's top right-backs looks likely to continue. Additional reporting by Jorge Castro Picon.

58,https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabio-miretti-juventus-wonderkid-italian-de-bruyne/blt382083c5ac6e8ad8,Fabio Miretti: Juventus wonderkid aiming to become 'The Italian De Bruyne',"Italian football is in a strange place right now. Internationally, they boast the champions of Europe, but are still coming to terms with the Azzurri missing out on a second successive World Cup. At club level, meanwhile, Italy boast one of, if not the most competitive of Europe's top five leagues, but have had just one team – Atalanta – reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League in the past three seasons. Fans around the country, therefore, are hopeful that a new generation of Italian footballers can help lead both the national team and its most historic clubs back to the top of the world game. Though using youth football results as a means of predicting the future is a dangerous game, there have been some encouraging signs so far in 2022. Italy qualified with ease for the upcoming Under-19s European Championship, and will be considered one of the favourites to win the competition in Slovakia when it kicks-off in mid-June. Juventus, meanwhile, have become just the second Italian side to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League since its inception in 2013, and will face Benfica in Nyon on Friday for a place in the final. And one player at the heart of both those sides around whom there is plenty of excitement is midfielder Fabio Miretti. The 18-year-old has been with the Bianconeri for 11 years, and having made his first-team debut already this season, there is genuine belief that Miretti can go on to become a star at the Allianz Stadium. It was he who scored the opening goal for Juve as they beat Liverpool 2-0 in the Youth League quarter-finals, while he also netted in two of Italy's three elite-round qualifying matches to earn their spot at the Euros. Such decisive actions suggest he already has the mentality to succeed, and follow in the footsteps of his footballing idol, Kevin De Bruyne. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""What impresses me is his technique, but also his vision,"" Miretti told Tuttosport when discussing the Manchester City star. ""He always knows where to pass the ball. He is a champion, a complete midfielder in every aspect."" Miretti certainly displays plenty of those same traits in his own game, with the teenager most comfortable playing as a No.8 in either a midfield three or diamond formation. Can @JuventusFCYouth produce more of these slick moves in Friday's semi-final with Benfica?Watch #UYL action on https://t.co/9QkhwHwkXF 📺 ""Miretti has enormous football intelligence, excellent technical qualities and has grown a lot in how he covers the field, in terms of both intensity and stamina,"" Juventus U19s manager, Andrea Bonatti, told Tuttosport. ""He has creativity, goals and is a positive influence in the dressing room. He feels the pleasure of contributing towards his team-mates scoring and winning."" Miretti joined Juventus in 2011 after being spotted playing for Cuneo, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Turin. Torino were also keen on enrolling the youngster into their academy, but Miretti – who once refused to cut his blonde hair as a boy so he could look more like his hero, Pavel Nedved – chose Juve over their city rivals. Working his way through the various age-group sides, he began to appear on the radar of the Old Lady's more die-hard supporters as a 16-year-old, when he scored 16 goals and laid on six assists in 17 games for Juve's U17s side in 2019-20. He has since gone onto captain the Primavera (U19s) side while appearing regularly for Juventus U23s, who play in the third tier of Italian football. So far this season, he has three goals and four assists in Serie C. Having first caught the eye of Massimiliano Allegri during pre-season, Miretti made his first-team debut in December, when he came off the bench for the final minutes of Juve's Champions League win over Malmo. He followed that up with a Serie A debut in March, and it is expected that he will earn more chances in the final weeks of the season as Weston McKennie, Denis Zakaria and Arthur Melo spend time on the sidelines nursing injuries. Capable of playing any midfield role, Miretti has been taking advice from Manuel Locatelli when training as part of the senior squad, and there is hope that the pair will one day be the key pieces in the Juventus engine room. Miretti's commitment to his boyhood club was confirmed in January when he signed a new contract that will keep him with Juventus until 2026, in turn ending the hopes of clubs in the Bundesliga, Premier League and Ligue 1 of signing him as interest began to ramp up. Other Serie A clubs have also reached out to Juve to enquire about Miretti's potential availability, but the 36-time Italian champions are not yet ready to let one of their academy's prized assets leave, either on loan or permanently. Instead, they are hopeful that he can lead them to Youth League glory in the coming days, which in turn could be the catalyst for a new generation of Italian stars to emerge at the very top of the game.

59,https://www.goal.com/en/news/tom-rothe-borussia-dortmund-teenager-record-breaking/bltbcf6c9383928b761,Tom Rothe: Borussia Dortmund teenager breaking Bundesliga records,"""Not so bad."" That was Tom Rothe's assessment when he was shown a replay of his first professional goal by Sky Sports, the full-back heading in a corner to crown his Borussia Dortmund debut against Wolfsburg on April 16. The strike made Rothe the youngest player to ever find the net on their Bundesliga bow, doing so at the age of 17 years and 169 days - an achievement that is a bit more than just ""not so bad"". ""Tom did an excellent job,"" said Dortmund boss Marco Rose at full time. ""Of course, the goal gave him more self-confidence and even more security. ""For his age and the circumstances, he plays very calmly."" Though Rothe's surprise selection came in part due to injuries to Raphael Guerreiro and Thorgan Hazard. That he was chosen to start by Rose ahead of Germany international Nico Schulz highlights just how highly he is thought of at Signal-Iduna Park. Rothe's dream debut 😍 pic.twitter.com/fEKQwSGqNL ""Tom is brutally ambitious,"" Mike Tullberg, Dortmund's Under-19s manager, tells GOAL and SPOX. ""He has done the most training sessions with us, completes the most sprints, eats the healthiest food and has the best stamina. He's a top professional through and through."" Rothe has shone under Tullberg after joining Dortmund from St. Pauli in the summer of 2021, providing three goals and 11 assists across all competitions for the recently crowned U19 Bundesliga West champions. ""He's a great boy, but he should still be an U17s player and go to school,"" Tullberg continues. ""That's why you have to be careful with him that things don't go too fast."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That might be difficult after Rothe's headline-grabbing senior debut, with it likely he will now train with the first-team squad for a prolonged period for the first time since pre-season. That is not to say that he does not fit in, especially from a physical point of view, with his 6'3 (192cm) frame making him one of the taller members of the Dortmund squad. That physical stature is matched with excellent stamina and speed, while his game intelligence and quality in possession mark him out as the ideal modern full-back, even if players in his position are generally much shorter. ""He's strong in the air and his crosses are great,"" Tullberg details, while Rothe's diagonal passes from left to right have not gone unnoticed among those who have watched him regularly, as well as the calmness he shows both with and without the ball. He is versatile, too, having been deployed at times on the left-hand side of a back three, while being as comfortable playing as a left-back in a back four as he is when giving more licence to get forward as a wing-back. The senior coaching staff had been toying with promoting him to the first-team squad on a more regular basis in recent months, but were reluctant to disturb his education by constantly moving him between teams. At international level, meanwhile, Rothe has earned himself a promotion, after making his Germany U19s debut in March, as he appeared in three of their European Championship qualifiers. That is just the latest new experience for the 17-year-old, who has been away from his family for the first time over the course of his debut season at Dortmund having settled into a room at the club's boarding school at their training ground in Brackel. Rothe, though, has shown that he has the mentality to deal with such changes, even if there are improvements he can still make to his game. ""He still has a lot to learn,"" says Tullberg, citing Rothe's positional play and defensive tackles that need further work, while he still has to learn how to properly cover for his team-mates if they find themselves out of position. At Dortmund, though, they firmly believe that Rothe can overcome all these challenges and become a star of the first team. ""He's one of those players who you can say has what it takes to get to the top,"" Tullberg concludes. For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.

60,https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

61,https://www.goal.com/en/news/boehly-led-ownership-consortium-now-preferred-chelsea-bidder-but-/blt30c8d1ac1dfd9786,"Boehly-led consortium set to become Chelsea owners, but Jim Ratcliffe not ruled out","Chelsea have decided that a Todd Boehly-led group of investors is the preferred bidder to take over the club from owner Roman Abramovich, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government. Boehly, who co-owns the Los Angeles Dodgers in the United States, is now set to become the Blues' owner with voting rights split among other investors, and he sees his bid 66 per cent backed by Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm. Still, the club, which is expected to fetch a world record-breaking fee for a sports team after a bidding war between various parties, could yet see another entity such as Jim Ratcliffe win out - though GOAL understands that's unlikely at this stage. Boehly runs 60 per cent of the $6 billion valued investment firm Eldridge Industries from which he runs most of his investments, except for the Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers which are private investments. In 2019, Boehly had a £2.2 billion bid rejected by Abramovich for Chelsea. He followed that up with an interview in Bloomberg where he stated his interest in getting involved in Premier League football. “Football is the biggest sport in the world,” Boehly insisted. “I can’t believe American football can get to use the word ‘football’ because to me that word should be football. The fact is it is still the best product in the world. It’s 90 minutes so it has a great timeline. The passion that the fans have for the activity and the sport and the teams is unparalleled. So when you start to think about what you’re trying to build with these teams is, you’re really trying to A, win and B, be part of the community.” One of his investments is in Fortnite, the supremely popular video game. He is estimated to have a personal net worth £3.3 billion ($4.4bn). His last-minute £4.25 billion bid (which comprises a £1.75 billion investment over 10 years, plus £2.5 billion to a ""charitable trust"" likely to be related to the war in Ukraine) came as a surprise late in the process on Friday morning. It changes the landscape of the process which is run by New York investment bank Raine Group. It's unclear whether the bid will be allowed as the process has been designed to narrow down the options and it has missed several deadlines. A statement read: ""Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. ""This is a British bid, for a British club. ""We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. ""And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. ""We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason. ""No further comment will be made from Sir Jim or INEOS during the bidding process."" The private equity firm Clearlake Capital is thought to be stumping up around 50 per cent of the bid to buy Chelsea. Alongside him is his long-term business partner Hansjorg Wyss, the Swiss billionaire who first announced that Abramovich was selling Chelsea. The Dodgers' principle owner Mark Walter is part of the group alongside British investor Jonathan Goldstein. Advising the bid are prominent Chelsea supporters Danny Finkelstein, who is a conservative member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a marketing executive. The Chelsea supporting former British politican George Osborne is advising the bid through his firm Robey Warshaw, with Goldman Sachs also working in an advisory role. Any prospective bidder has been asked to guarantee a minimum of £1 billion further investment over 10 years which would go towards the stadium, women's and academy teams. Along with the costs of buying the club, it would raise the overall financial commitment of the project to between £3.5 billion and £4 billion. Like the other potential options, the new Blues owners have promised investment into all areas of the club and to work on the stadium. Architects Jane Marie Smith and David Hickey, the latter who is the former project director for Abramovich’s now-cancelled 60,000-seat redevelopment, are being consulted about reviving plans for Stamford Bridge. The Premier League will conduct an owners and directors test on the group that is expected to take roughly two weeks. Once they've gained approval, the UK government will handle the money from the sale and issue an operating licence that frees up the club from the restrictions of sanctions. It will allow Chelsea to renew contracts, make signings and sell players - along with running their club shop and selling tickets to new customers for matches. It will also cut out Abramovich from the club and end a 19-year ownership period that saw the Blues win 21 trophies. The money will be frozen or given to charity with that stage yet to be fully thrashed out. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

62,https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics. Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps. A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10. Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea. “Sanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea’s many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom’s brand 3, and its $72m (£55m) kit deal with Nike,” says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company. “While Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association. “Chelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships. “Nike’s deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club’s sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.” Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just £20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth £9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at £3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club. It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration. In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

63,https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiesa-injury-nightmare-juventus-transfer-problems/blt18c24820bd46d0fd,Chiesa injury adds to Juventus' transfer problems ahead of daunting Supercoppa showdown with Inter,"Three days on and it is still hard to know exactly what to make of Juventus' insane 4-3 victory at Roma, certainly from the visitors' perspective. Was it an anomaly or a turning point? The Bianconeri are still buzzing, of course. As captain Giorgio Chiellini admitted on Tuesday, it was the kind of win that ""gives you an adrenaline boost"". Marco Landucci had been on the Juventus bench in Rome and Allegri, who was forced to sit in the stands through suspension, was full of praise for his assistant coach, quipping on the eve of Wednesday's Supercoppa Italian showdown with Inter, ""He did really well. In fact, I thought about not turning up tomorrow!"" Landucci, though, will be happy to have his boss back alongside him in the dugout, having admitted that he ""lost five or six years of my life"" watching Juve come from 3-1 down to triumph at the Olimpico, despite the late concession of a penalty and loss of Matthijs de Ligt to a red card. Juve are now unbeaten in seven Serie A games and sit fifth in the standings, just three points behind Atalanta, though the fourth-placed Bergamaschi have played one game fewer. On the face of it, then, the Old Lady seems to have fully recovered from a shocking start to the season and is now perfectly primed to force her way back into the Champions League places. Doubts persist, though. After all, sometimes results can be misleading. Juventus have performed poorly for the majority of the season, and they had only scored 28 times in 20 matches going into Sunday's game. It must also be acknowledged that they were dire for more than an hour at the Stadio Olimpico. Allegri's introduction of Arthur and Alvaro Morata undoubtedly changed the game, and he undeniably deserves credit for his double substitution. Of course, his critics – and their numbers are increasing – would argue that the coach's conservatism has been responsible for Juve's poor productivity this term. They now hope that Allegri will see the benefits of playing Arthur in midfield alongside Manuel Locatelli and will abandon the 4-4-2 formation they deem embarrassingly outdated. Nobody is quite sure how the Tuscan will line his players up against Inter, though – not least because he will have to make do without some key men. Neither Alex Sandro nor Leonardo Bonucci are 100 per cent match fit, Danilo is injured, Juan Cuadrado and De Ligt are both suspended, while Wojciech Szczesny has not yet secured his Covid-19 Green Pass. Of greater significance, though, is the absence of Federico Chiesa. “Forza Federico”💪@GoalItalia pic.twitter.com/9jpYyxhNOl The Euro 2020 star suffered knee ligament damage in the first half of the Roma win and it has since been confirmed that his campaign is over. It is, as Chiellini pointed out, a devastating blow for not just Juve, but Italian football in general, with the winger now also ruled out of March's crucial World Cup play-offs. Even if the Azzurri were to make it to Qatar, there is no guarantee that Chiesa will be fit to feature there either. It is also unclear how Juve will react to his lengthy lay-off. At the very least, it is going to affect their January transfer plans, which were already shrouded in uncertainty because of Paulo Dybala, who was all set to sign an extension beyond the summer but is now set to be offered a new contract worth less than the €10 million (£8.3m/$11.3m) deal he had previously agreed with the club. As previously reported by GOAL, the Bianconeri are desperate to bring in a centre-forward and a central midfielder during the winter window, but they are being severely hampered by their financial issues. Consequently, the hope was that they could raise funds by cashing in on one of their few valuable assets deemed surplus to requirements by Allegri. Dejan Kulusevski was the most likely departure, given he has plenty of admirers in England. However, the versatile Sweden attacker is now the most obvious internal replacement for Chiesa. Allegri has, thus far, demonstrated a distinct lack of faith in Kulusevski, but even if he were to deem Federico Bernardeschi or Cuadrado better options out wide, it still seems unlikely that he would now sanction Kulusevski's sale. ""I talked to him [on Monday],"" Allegri revealed on the eve of the Supercoppa. ""He has great qualities and he can cover various roles. He's starting to understand Juve, as everyone needs to make a jump in quality on a mental level. ""Determination can change a player's career. It's also important that he finds the maturity required for playing certain games."" At the very least, Kulusevski's versatility should ensure he remains in Turin until the summer at least. Consequently, the chances of U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie being sacrificed in January have risen, particularly with Juve trying to figure out a way to bring in Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, who want €45m (£36m/$51m) for the Brazilian. The Bianconeri don't have the cash to make that deal happen right now but they could at least make space in their squad – and lower their wage bill in the process – by offloading Arthur, whom Arsenal are interested in taking on loan. Juve's priority, though, remains a centre-forward. Morata made a big impact at Roma, and Allegri insists the Spain striker is staying put despite agreeing personal terms with Barcelona, but Juve have no intention of taking up their option to buy the 29-year-old from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. Their top target remains Gianluca Scamacca, but the Old Lady is simply not in a position to meet Sassuolo's €40m (£33m/$45m) asking price, and there is no chance of the Neroverdi letting the striker leave on loan midway through the season. It is a similar story with Mauro Icardi. Paris Saint-Germain want either a permanent deal or an obligation to buy inserted into any temporary transfer of the ex-Inter captain. Liverpool super-sub Divock Origi and Manchester United's frustrated French forward Anthony Martial have also been repeatedly mentioned but, again, neither player is expected to leave on loan without at least some money being paid up front. The most likely outcome is a short-term solution, with Sky Sport Italia claiming that the Bianconeri have made contact with Zenit about signing Sardar Azmoun, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Allegri, for his part, insists that the squad will remain unchanged between now and the end of the month. He is merely focused on maintaining the momentum built up over the past six weeks by winning the first trophy of his second spell in Turin. ""We need to think game by game in order to reach those ahead of us [in the table],"" Allegri argued in his pre-match press conference, ""and next season we will see if we have done enough to get back fighting for the Scudetto."" Beating Inter will not be easy of course. The reigning Serie A champions and current league leaders are almost everything that Juve are not right now: prolific, solid and 100 per cent sure of themselves. Allegri himself acknowledges Inter are the strongest team in Italy, while Chiellini says he knew as far back as September that the title was theirs to lose. Juve, then, could be in for a long evening. But, at the very least, the Supercoppa should shed far more light on how much work the Old Lady has to do to get back to the summit of Serie A than last Sunday’s insanity at Stadio Olimpico.

64,https://www.goal.com/en/news/life-after-ronaldo-how-juventus-are-coping-without-cristiano/i7zn0g5c9t1t18qz0qiq6cfyx,Life after Ronaldo? How Juventus are coping without Cristiano,"It wasn’t Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus departure which shocked his former team-mates. It was the timing. It had been clear for months that the Portugal international wanted out. He repeatedly passed up opportunities to commit his future to the club, most amusingly when he lashed out at the media for reporting his desire to return to Real Madrid, even though one of his closest associates, Edu Aguirre of El Chiringuito, had sparked the speculation in typically over-the-top fashion live on Spanish television. Ronaldo claimed that such talk was “disrespectful to all of the clubs involved in these rumours, as well as to their players and staff”, and yet not once did he mention Juventus in a 286-word statement on social media. The writing had long been on the wall, of course. During Euro 2020, he would only say: ""Whether I stay at Juventus or leave, whatever happens will be for the best."" However, while there were – and are – obvious advantages to his eventual transfer to Manchester United for the Bianconeri, most notably from a financial perspective,his decision to leave fourdays before the close of the summer transfer window had a negative impact on his colleagues. As captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN, “Ronaldo left on August 27. It would have been better for us if he had left earlier.“We paid something for it, a little bit of a shock, we paid something for it in terms of points. If he had left earlier, we would have had time to prepare better.”  As it was, Ronaldo’s move to Manchester was confirmed a matter of hours beforeJuventus were beaten at home by Empoli in their second game of the new Serie A season. The international break presented coach Massimiliano Allegri, back at the helm after two years away, with a much-needed opportunity to take stock, but his still shell-shocked side were beaten again upon their return to action, at Napoli, and were then held to a draw at home by AC Milan. At the close of play on matchday four, the mighty Juventus were in the Serie A relegation zone.It was obvious that Ronaldo’s lethal finishing was being sorely missed - but it went beyond mere goals. For the previous three seasons, ever since the arrival of the prolific Portuguese from Real Madrid, Juve’s primary focus had become getting the very best out of their No.7. As centre-back Leonardo Bonucci said earlier this week, “the team played for [Ronaldo].” However, the Euro 2020 winner also acknowledged that the players were guilty of expecting miracles from Ronaldo whenever they found themselves in a tight spot. “We were all playing with a great champion and wanted him to do well,” Bonucci explained to reporters, “so perhaps we lost that desire to all suffer and sacrifice ourselves together, because we assumed he would sort it out."" Bonucci believes that Allegri has, at least, already addressed the attitude problem, arguing that the passion and resilience they have demonstrated in racking up six successive wins in all competitions proves that the players have rediscovered that ""Juve spirit that was there before Ronaldo’s arrival"". ""The coach has done really well to get that character and humility back,"" he enthused. “We all work together now to get the result."" Waking up with this energy! 🔋💪#ZenitJuve #JuveUCL pic.twitter.com/3RalE2ch1Y That Juvehave won their last four games 1-0 also suggests that Allegri has resolved the defensive issues which preceded his summer return. Before Manuel Locatelli scored the only goal in the derby against Torino at the start of this month, the Old Lady hadn’t kept a clean sheet in the league since the 3-0 defeat of Spezia on March 2. Of course, one of the principal reasons for Juve’s sudden stinginess is the fact that they are playing a more negative brand of football, often sitting deep against decent footballing sides in the hope of hitting their opponents on the break, or nicking a goal off a set-piece. Such an approach can only last so long. Juve, after all, are still playing catch-up in Serie A. They may be rapidly rising up the table but they are still only seventh, seven points behind Napoli.The onus is on them to close the gap and they will only be able to continue winning games if they add more goals to their game. Paulo Dybala’s return from injury for this weekend’s Derby d’Italia is, therefore, a most welcome boost. The Argentine remains Juve’s joint-top scorer in all competitions with three goals–even though he has missed five games through injury. It was Chiellini, remember, who tipped Dybala to take command of the Juve attack following Ronaldo’s exit.   And yet, for all of the financial and tactical conundrums that the Portuguese presented, the Bianconeri could always rely on him to score goals (Ronaldoalready has six in eight games for United). They can’t even rely on Dybala to stay fit. However, the hope is that his returnwill at least lighten the load on Federico Chiesa, who kickstarted Juve’s campaign with a virtuoso showing at Spezia on matchday five, while also netting the winner in their morale-boosting 1-0 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. The Italy winger still needs to add even more goals to his game but there is no denying his status as one of the best big-game players in the world right now – which obviously bodes well ahead of Sunday’s trip to San Siro. Of course, if Juve are to maintain their winning streak against free-scoring Inter, who have netted nearly twice as many goals as the Bianconeri in the league this season (23-12), they are likely to have to once again produce a heroic rearguard action. And that doesn’t just mean Chiellini & Co. doing their jobs. Allegri will need his infamously unreliable and unbalanced midfield to protect his back four and his forwards to defend from the front. Still, on the evidence of what we’ve seen in recent weeks, Bonucci may well be proven right: Ronaldo’s goals may be gone but Juve’s fighting spirit does at least seem to have returned.

65,https://www.goal.com/en/news/englands-no1-who-are-the-favourites-to-be-goalkeeper-for/nib2z3et77tl1lyqpqczvfac1,England's No.1: Who are the favourites to be goalkeeper for Euro 2021?,"Now that Euro 2020 has been pushed back to Euro 2021, England's dilemma over their goalkeeping situationhas been pushed firmly into the back seat. Gareth Southgate had been facing a difficult call over who would start between the posts for the Three Lions'opening group gameagainst Croatia on June 14. Now, those vying for the position will have some extra time to find their form and stake a claim to be England's No.1. For England’s disastrous campaign at Euro 2016,it was Joe Hart, Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster who made the cut -but none of the three were in the squad for the World Cup two years later. The gloves are there to be won – but who are the contenders to wear them? Everton goalkeeper Pickford is the favourite to start the first game, by virtue of being England’s current No.1. The 26-year-old now has well over 100 Premier League appearances under his belt, as well as 24 full international caps. Pickford won plaudits for his displays at the 2018 World Cup, and  was instrumental in the penalty shoot-out win over Colombia. However, his club form has been erratic in recent seasons. Southgate has faced calls to drop himafter a number of high-profile mistakes, and he is far from guaranteed the starting spot he might have expected to have at this point of his career. With 29 games played, Pickford has kept just six clean sheets in the Premier League this season. He recently hit back at criticism from pundits including Gary Neville, saying ""everyone hates you"" as an England player. Currently leading the Premier League clean sheets chart is Burnley’s Pope, and the 27-year-old may feelthe Euros are his opportunityto shine. The shot-stopper currently has just two senior international caps to his name, having found himself behind Pickford and Hart in the past. That relative inexperience may have hurt his chances, with Southgate perhaps unwilling to make such a big call on the cusp of an international tournament. Now, he has more time on his side. Regardless, he has inarguably been one of the stand-out performers in his position in the Premier League this season. Pope has also kept clean sheets on both of his England appearances to date – a 2-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in 2018, and a 4-0 thrashing of Kosovo in Europeanqualifying in November 2019. Henderson has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with Sheffield United this season, his first in the Premier League. On loan from Manchester United, Henderson has registered 10 clean sheets from 27 league games, and is many fans’ favourite to start at the Euros. There are currently questions around his club future, with  calls for him to replace the declining David de Gea at Old Traffordnext season. Such a move would help his chances, providing he continues to start regularly. Like Pope, his lack of caps mean it would be a surprise to see Southgate pick him to start over the more experienced Pickford. Henderson is yet to make his senior international debut, but should be expected to make the final squad to gain experience of an international tournament. A number of other goalkeepers have made a claim this season and could make the squad, though it would be a shock to see any of them play. Aaron Ramsdale  has broken into Bournemouth’s first team at the age of 21 and could be sent to gain experience, though the Cherries’ struggles are evidenced by his meagre tally of four clean sheets. Fraser Forster, who once looked like taking the No.1 shirt during his time at Southampton, is first-choice once again at Celtic and may be keen to add to his six caps to date. More experienced is the 36-year-old  Ben Foster, though he has a similar number of senior international appearances with eight. And despite Watford fighting relegation, he has more clean sheets to his name than De Gea, Ederson, Bernd Leno, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Rui Patricio – and Pickford. Alex McCarthy  of Southampton turned 30 at the end of last year and has been called up to the England squad on a number of occasions, though he only has one appearance to show for it. He played in a 3-0 win over the United States in November 2018, but is slipping off the radar as he battles with 24-year-old  Angus Gunn  for the goalkeeping position at Southampton.

66,https://www.goal.com/en/news/worlds-best-right-back-james-chelsea-champions-league/bltf2a1978fbe296900,The world's best right-back? James confirming his status as a Chelsea - and Champions League - superstar,"Reece James and the Champions League are striking up a special relationship, even if there have been some bumps along the way. He enjoyed one of his early breakout moments in the Chelsea team when he netted the equaliser for the Blues in their memorable 4-4 draw with Ajax in 2019, though what followed in Europe that season he would sooner forget. A 7-1 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich was humbling for James, who was run ragged by an emerging Alphonso Davies, highlighting the size of the step up he was needing to take having spent the previous season on loan in the Championship at Wigan Athletic. Fast-forward 12 months, and having been guided by Thomas Tuchel, James was lifting the European Cup in Porto having been one of the outstanding performers in Chelsea's win over Manchester City. Targeted by Pep Guardiola, James put in a supreme defensive display, highlighting the fact that he is more than just an attacking full-back who struggles when closer to his own goal. That is not to say that his attacking output has diminished, and on Tuesday he again showed himself to be a constant threat in the final third as he helped put Juventus to the sword at Stamford Bridge. The Champions League is the stage for the world's best players, and right now it is difficult to find anyone in better form or who is more well-rounded than James as a right-back. Reece James is an absolute joke! 🤭Another outstanding finish from the Chelsea star! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/iUdgv2XI8A REECE JAMES. 💥CHELSEA'S DEFENDERS HAVE NOW SCORED 16 GOALS THIS SEASON. UNREAL. 😳 pic.twitter.com/bKVZorYYES His arrowed strike across Wojciech Szczesny for Chelsea's second in their 4-0 win over the Bianconeri means he is now the Blues' outright top scorer this season with five goals, moving him ahead of £97.5 million ($136m) summer signing Romelu Lukaku, who has four. James also has five assists to his name, with there only one other Premier League player with at least five goals and five assists in all competitions so far in 2021-22: Mohamed Salah. The England international also played his part in the third goal of the night, showing deft control in box in the build-up to Callum Hudson-Odoi firing home, as well as the fourth, as his sensational cross-field ball helped create Timo Werner's stoppage-time strike. There will be staunch opposition to the take that James is the best right-back in the world on current form from Liverpool supporters who back Trent Alexander-Arnold, and there are certainly arguments that can be made for both players. But James' superior defensive abilities, as well his new-found eye for goal just gives him the edge, and that is an opinion that Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate seems to share if his selections over the past 12 months are been anything to go by. Despite all that, Tuchel was cautious to name James as the best in the world in his position when asked by GOAL during Monday's press conference, perhaps in a bid to keep the 21-year-old focused on getting even better. ""Right now he plays as a wing-back, and he does this at a very high level,"" the German coach said. ""I see no reason why we should get carried away by things like if he is the best in the world or the best in England or the best in Europe. ""If he plays, he needs to be the best version of himself. He is improving, he takes responsibility and it is needed. ""He is far from finished in his development. He is super young. He has all the potential to be a big and important player for Chelsea and he is on his way. ""I feel he is dedicated and hungry for more, and that is what we want."" James himself is a man of few words, but when asked by GOAL about his current form during the recent international break, he said: ""I would say this is the best that I have ever performed. Recent results and performances have shown that as well."" Before he met Tuchel, James was already an exceptional talent. He was the captain of Jody Morris' FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2018, and won the club's Academy Player of the Year award in the process. He followed that up by being nominated for EFL Team of the Season in his first year as a professional at Wigan, but he remained a rough diamond. Tuchel has polished that diamond, accentuating his physical and ball-striking gifts by simplifying James' game with clear instructions about what he can and cannot do in his system. It led to a baptism of fire for James last season, where he was in and out of the team, facing the brunt of Tuchel's tirades from the touchline. But along with his tactical improvements, he has added more mobility to his game, allowing him to be in positions to score more often, and turning him the complete wing-back. The world's best? Right now, it is difficult to argue against it. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Reason for Man Utd star's absence explained,"England will be in international friendly action against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, before then playing host to Ivory Coast on Tuesday, but Marcus Rashford will not be figuring in either of those fixtures. The Manchester United forward has represented his country on 46 occasions, scoring 12 goals, but will not be adding to his collection of Three Lions caps any time soon after being overlooked in the latest selection made by Gareth Southgate. Why has the Red Devils star been overlooked and could his place in plans being drawn up for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year be under threat? GOAL takes a look… The 24-year-old has been a regular for England since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2016, with appearances made at two European Championships – including a Euro 2020 final against Italy – the 2018 World Cup and UEFA Nations League finals. His domestic form has, however, dipped in the 2021-22 campaign – on the back of becoming an MBE for his charity work off the field – and Southgate is looking for a proven performer to rediscover a spark at Old Trafford before being welcomed back into the international arena.

He knows he is in a situation where he has not been getting in the United team consistently and he will be searching as much as anybody to get that form back. “We all believe he can be an asset for his club and for his country. “With one or two of our players in the past, who have had dips and come through them, you can say, 'look, they came through that, they responded well and became more strong and they showed the character needed'. “That is what he is going to have to prove now in the coming weeks and months. Nobody's career goes smoothly from start to finish and of course his rise from when he first broke into the team at United was incredible, really.” Southgate is right to suggest that Rashford needs to knuckle down at club level and work on becoming a first -team regular for Manchester United once more.

Only five goals, the most recent of which came on January 22 against West Ham, and two assists have been recorded across 26 appearances in all competitions and he has not turned out in the colours of his country since being introduced as an extra-time substitute late on in the Euro 2020 final – an outing in which he missed his penalty in a shootout defeat.

Hudson-Odoi represented England at every youth level from U16 to U21 before making his first senior international appearance in 2019. However, the 21-year-old has only been able to take his tally of caps to three since then and he was left out of Gareth Southgate's last Three Lions squad in November, leading to question marks over his future. Hudson-Odoi is also eligible to play for Ghana due to his heritage and, under current FIFA rules, any players that have played three or fewer international games before the age of 21 are allowed to switch allegiances if they choose to. The Chelsea winger has not featured for England in two-and-a-half years, but has now given the clearest indication yet that he remains determined to break into Southgate's squad. Speaking after the Blues' 2-1 win against Palmeiras in Abu Dhabi, Hudson-Odioi replied when asked whether he would commit his international future to the Three Lions and reject Ghana: “Hopefully. I don’t know. ""At the end of the day, we will wait until that time comes.” Hudson-Odoi also explained why he decided to snub a loan move away from Chelsea last summer amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund. The Blues' academy graduate, who recorded an assist for Lukaku's opener against Palmeiras, says he is relieved to have had the chance to revel in more success under Thomas Tuchel. “You want to win as much as possible with a club like this,” said Hudson-Odoi. “Our aim is always to win games and win as many as possible. ""If I went out in the summer I wouldn’t get opportunities to play like this and win trophies. I’m really delighted that I stayed and obviously I got the opportunity to play. ""For me I’ve just got to give it 120 per cent from minute one every single game.” Pressed on whether he can already be considered a Chelsea legend with Club World Cup and Champions League winners' medals now on his record, he added: “I don’t feel like a legend at all. I’m young, I’ve got a long way to go. I’m delighted to win trophies. ""You keep adding and adding to the cabinet and it’s nice. But you can’t say you’re a legend at 21.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Al Rihla translates to 'the journey' in Arabic, with the ball design drawing inspiration from Qatar's unique architecture, ""iconic"" boats and national flag. The Al Rihla is said to move quicker in the air than any of the previous World Cup balls and reportedly provides ""the highest level of accuracy and reliability on the field of play"". The 20 panels of the ball are included to help enhance aerodynamics, helping players improve the accuracy and swerve of their shots, while the product is made entirely from water-based inks and glues – a first for a World Cup model. Franziska Loeffelmann, design director in the football graphics and hardwear department at Adidas, has offered a summary of the key features. She said: “The game is getting faster, and as it speeds up, accuracy and flight stability becomes critically important. The new design allows the ball to maintain its speed significantly higher as it journeys through the air.” Tickets for World Cup 2022 first went on sale at fifa.com/tickets on January 22. The first phase of sales ran until March 29 and consisted of random sales selection draw and first come, first served periods. A second phase was opened after the finals draw on April 1 and operates in a similar fashion to the initial process. The third and final phase of tickets sales is the 'last-minute' one, which is purely run on a first come, first served basis and will extend through to the end of the tournament. All supporters planning on attending games at the World Cup finals are reminded by FIFA that “at the request of the Qatari authorities, all local and international fans must apply for a Hayya Card. Hayya Card is your entry permit to the State of Qatar and your stadium access (along with the match ticket). International fans will also need to confirm their accommodation plans.” Individual tickets are split up into four categories and the prices for each category - converted to British pounds from U.S. dollars - are shown below. Tickets from category four are only available to residents of Qatar. Match Cat 1 Cat 2 Cat 3 Cat 4 Opening match £472 £336 £231 £42 Group matches £168 £126 £53 £8 Round of 16 £210 £157 £73 £15 Quarter-finals £325 £220 £157 £63 Semi-finals £730 £503 £273 £105 Third place play-off £325 £231 £157 £63 Final £1,227 £766 £461 £157 As is always the case with World Cup finals, coverage in the UK will be split between the BBC and ITV. They struck another two-tournament deal with FIFA ahead of the 2018 event that covers television, radio and online coverage. Agreements put in place across the globe are reported to have netted world football’s governing body around $1.85bn ($1.41bn). In the United States, World Cup 2022 will be broadcast by Fox in English and Telemundo in Spanish. They wrestled rights away from ESPN and Univision ahead of the 2018 tournament and have a deal in place through to the end of the 2026 finals – which will be staged across America, Canada and Mexico. Who is going to win the World Cup? 🏆 pic.twitter.com/FgZdaz7YpG Brazil, who have reclaimed the number one spot on FIFA’s ranking chart, are the favourites at bet365 to savour World Cup glory in Qatar. The Selecao are five-time winners of the competition, but their last success came 20 years ago in Japan and South Korea. Defending champions France, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba at their disposal, are also highly fancied and push Brazil close at the top of a congested betting market. England, who reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and final of Euro 2020, have pieced together an exciting young squad that will believe they can bring 56 years of hurt to a close in 2022. Spain and Germany complete the top five of leading contenders for global glory, with Argentina – who are looking to land Lionel Messi his first crown – sitting just outside of that pack. Belgium’s so-called golden generation have failed to deliver tangible success when at the peak of their powers, and have work to do in order to earn favour with punters, while Portugal will feel that anything is possible with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks. The Netherlands are another dark horse that could go well if early momentum is established, but little is expected from the USMNT and Mexico as they are given triple-figure prices before a ball is kicked in anger. Unsurprisingly, seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi is a market leader when it comes to top scorer honours at World Cup 2022. The mercurial Argentine has endured a testing 2021-22 campaign after leaving Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, but remains a talisman for his country and still has plenty of magic left up his sleeve. Neymar and Antoine Griezmann, of Brazil and France respectively, are also being tipped to fill their boots when leading the line for two nations taking aim at the ultimate prize. England captain Harry Kane is looking to land back-to-back Golden Boots and tends to save his best for the big occasion, while Ronaldo can never be ruled out of any competition relating to acts of goal-scoring brilliance. In the Golden Ball stakes, 2014 winner Messi figures prominently once again. Neymar is also in that mix, as the man expected to lead Brazil’s charge, while Mbappe has been showing at PSG that he could be the next superstar to set world football alight. A number of singles will be released from the official FIFA World Cup 2022 Soundtrack. The first of those was revealed on April 1, with Hayya Hayya (Better Together) made available across multiple platforms. FIFA has said “the uplifting track, featuring Trinidad Cardona, Davido and Aisha, draws on R&B and reggae influences” as the organisation seeks to “connect with audiences worldwide through the shared passions of football and music”.

Another opportunity to land major silverware has passed the Red Devils by, with Roberto Martinez’s side only able to muster a fourth-place finish at the UEFA Nations League finals. They remain the No 1 side on the planet in the official rankings, but De Bruyne claims Belgium lack the depth required to secure tangible success. The Manchester City midfielder told HLNafter suffering a 2-1 defeat to Italy in the Nations League play-off: “We did well at times against some top teams and had many new faces who did more than a decent job today. “It’s good experience for them to be able to play against opponents of this calibre, but unfortunately we lost twice. With all due respect, playing against Estonia is not the same thing and these challenges are necessary for us to grow, both as individuals and as a team. He added: “With all due respect, we are ‘just’ Belgium. It’s a new generation, we were missing Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard today, so we have to be realistic about the team we have. Italy, France and Spain have 22 top players to choose from and we do not.”  Belgium have entered every major tournament since 2014 among the favourites,given they can all upon the talents of De Bruyne, Lukaku, Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Axel Witsel and Dries Mertens. They havehoweverprogressed beyond the quarter-final stage just once at the last four competitions, with a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup.

This time around, the playmaker's goal was scored in the same stadium in which he collapsed last summer, with his effort coming against Serbia. Eriksen was handed the captain's armband as he made an emotional return, with many of those present giving him a standing ovation. UK viewers can watch the goal below: ✨ A MOMENT OF MAGIC ✨Christian Eriksen scores an absolute beauty on his Denmark return! 🇩🇰❤️️ pic.twitter.com/Bo0e8egI9v US viewers can see the goal here: Christian Eriksen scoring at the Parken stadium, 290 days after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the very same pitch.Football. You can't write it.(via @espnplus) pic.twitter.com/g3PlrHO2Cf As can be seen, Eriksen picks up the ball on the edge of the box and was almost invited to shoot before he brilliantly curled his effort into Serbia's net. Denmark's clash with Serbia is one of their March friendlies as they look to build some momentum before some competitive football. The stadium they played in is the same one in which Eriksen suffered a shock cardiac arrest last summer and it was his first time back. The former Tottenham man had to have a defibrillator fitted and left Inter for Brentford to get his career back on track. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

73,https://www.goal.com/en/news/pepe-s-future-at-arsenal-questioned-after-failing-to-break/blta87e73eb55f00ab8,Pepe's future at Arsenal questioned after failing to break into Arteta's Premier League first XI for six months,"Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell has opined winger Nicolas Pepe has no future at the club and should consider leaving. The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international was a purchase for former Gunners manager Unai Emery in 2019. However, he has arguably not shown the value of the over £70 million the North London team paid French outfit Lille for his services.  The attacker has not started a Premier League match for the club in the last six months, and despite the Gunners playing 34 matches already, Pepe has featured just 17 times.  It has been rumoured that Mikel Arteta is willing to let him go at the end of the ongoing campaign despite the player having a contract that runs until June 2024.  ""It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him,"" Campbell told Football Insider.  ""You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again.  ""I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.""  Arsenal are favourites to finish in the Champions League places this season after a much-improved campaign.  They are currently placed fourth on the table with 63 points from the 34 games they have played. However, they are facing stiff competition from North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who are a position lower with 61 points.  Spurs have a tricky fixture away to Liverpool this weekend before hosting Arsenal in the London Derby. The Gunners will host Leeds United in their next English top-tier assignment scheduled for Sunday. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The English side have a two-goal advantage after the first leg at Anfield and will be targeting a favourable result to make it to the final.  Keita has already featured in eight matches in the competition this season, scoring one goal in the process. Last weekend, the Guinea midfielder scored the only goal of the match to hand his team maximum points in the Premier League away to Newcastle.  The German tactician is happy with the 27-year-old's form ahead of the game away to the Yellow Submarine.  ""Long may that [form] continue because that is crucial, that is key to everything,"" Klopp said in a presser ahead of Tuesday's game.  ""If you have the talent and the skill set of Naby Keita and you are not fit, then nobody sees it, that’s how it is. If you then come back not in the best possible shape, all these kinds of things, that’s normal physically.  ""The player was never in doubt, not for a second, because he’s outstanding. It’s good he is now available. It’s a good option, a very good option to have. Played at the weekend was obviously a really good game, so we’ll see how long we will use him tomorrow. A very good option.""  The German tactician insists he has an exceptional squad but went on to state that his team will also need luck to make it to the final.  ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again if we ever have a chance again to go to the final – you never know,"" Klopp continued.  ""We have an exceptional team here and nothing is [taken] for granted, you need luck in these moments, all these kind of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready – but we will.  ""We will be ready. We really wanted to be where we are and we want to go to the final. But if Villarreal is better than us and beats us with a result which qualifies them for the final, then congratulations and that's it. ""But between now and then, 95 or whoever knows how many minutes to play. I'm looking forward to it.""  After winning the League Cup, the Reds are chasing the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League titles. They trail Manchester City by one point with four games left in the league, while they face Chelsea in the FA Cup final. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Ibrahimovic joined United on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, reuniting with former Inter boss Jose Mourinho, who he had previously played under at San Siro in 2008-09. The Swede quickly became a cult figure at Old Trafford as he helped the Red Devils win a domestictreble in his first season at the club, after initially telling Cantona that he was aiming to surpass the Frenchman's own stellar legacy. Cantona is widely regarded as one of the finest players in United's history, having inspired their run to four Premier League titles in five seasons between 1992 and 1997, but Ibrahimovic has now revealed that he rejected the suggestion he would have to play in his shadow. The 40-year-old, who is currently taking in a second spell at AC Milan, told Italian broadcaster   Le lene   while out celebrating his birthday at the weekend: ""One day Cantona said to me: 'You cannot be the king of Manchester, you will have to be content with being the prince'. ""And I replied: 'But I'm not interested in becoming king, I want to be the god of Manchester'."" Cantona scored  82   goals  in  185appearances  for the Red Devils in total, winning nine trophies, while also picking up the 1993-94 PFA Players' Player of the Year award. Ibrahimovic, meanwhileonly spent two seasons at Old Trafford, the second of which was disrupted by a serious knee injury, but he managed to record  29 goals  in  53 appearances  while securing Europa League, League Cup and Community Shield honours. Ibrahimovic rejoined Milan in January 2020 after a successful stint in MLS with the LA Galaxy, and has since played a key role in helping the Rossoneri emerge as a major force inSerie A. The veteran forward is currently out of action with an Achilles issue  , but is optimistic that he will return to the pitch soon after the international break. ""Yes, it is better, only small problems but they are solved,"" Ibrahimovic said when quizzed on his fitness. ""I feel young, another year has passed and I'm just waiting to get back on the pitch."" Pressed on Milan's chances of winning Serie A this term, he added:""Who wins the Scudetto? What team does Zlatan play for...Milan? Then Milan.""

The former Manchester United man is still going strong in Italy, defying his age as he continues to play a crucial role for his side. The striker's career spans over 20 years and it seems he has no plans to end his time in professional football anytime soon. According to UEFA, Ibrahimovic said: ""The future is yet to be written. I don't plan. Let's see what happens. ""I don't want to regret stopping football and then saying that I could continue to play football because then I'd regret it for the rest of my life, seeing that I could have continued. ""I want to play as long as I can. The reality is I'll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I'm still playing. ""I know one day it will stop and I won't have that adrenaline anymore. This is a problem for every football player because you have adrenaline when you play football. ""That adrenaline, you will never get in doing something else because we are programmed. Every day we do the same thing. ""We wake up, we prepare, we train, we eat, and we rest. The next day, it's the same thing. For 20 years, you do these things, and you get adrenaline from them. ""So when suddenly you stop, you don't have this agenda, you don't get the adrenaline anymore. And when it stops, you have to take it from there and begin from zero and start something new."" The Swede has struggled with injuries this season but still managed to make 22 appearances across all competitions, scoring eight goals and grabbing two assists. His total record in Milan, including his first spell, stands at 154 appearances with 92 goals and 34 assists, so it's easy to see why he's loved at the club. Ibrahimovic's long career has seen him become a journeyman of sorts as he's played for a host of Europe's top clubs including PSG, Inter, Ajax, Juventus and Barcelona.

Many of his adversaries within the game were offended by the insinuation he was any way similar to Jerry Maguire, the fictional sports agent who comes to champion love (or 'kwan') over greed. However, his clients would always tell you the comparison was just; that he formed a special bond with each and every one of them. Such polarised opinions perfectly illustrated the way in which Raiola divided the football world. He will forever be remembered as one of its most controversial yet compelling characters, seemingly loved and loathed in equal measures, a self-styled super-agent doing right by clients, but wrong by clubs. The 54-year-old was born in Agri, Italy, but his parents emigrated to Netherlands when he was still an infant, settling in Haarlem. It was in this Dutch municipality that Raiola was raised before taking the first steps to becoming arguably the 'king of super-agents'. Raiola was a moderately talented player in his youth and he played for his local club before quitting the game at just 18. However, while he started studying law, he had not lost his passion for football, electing to take charge of the Haarlem youth team. pic.twitter.com/xuZWBNA62N Even at such a tender age, Raiola was a straight-talker with a distinct lack of respect for any figure of authority other than his restaurateur father. “The president of Haarlem came to eat with us every Friday,” he explained in an interview with Il Secolo XIX in 2011. “I was always telling him that he knew nothing about football. ""One day he takes me aside and says: ‘Listen, you try it.’ He appointed me sporting director.” Raiola, though, became frustrated by his inability to make what he believed were the requisite changes due to a lack of funds. However, with Dutch players very much in vogue in the mid-1980s, he saw that there was money to be made in selling his adopted nation’s top footballing talent to Italy, which was then the centre of the footballing universe. Raiola, having honed his skills as a mediator while working as a broker for Dutch businessmen with commercial interests in Italy, negotiated a deal with the players' union in the Netherlands that enabled him to represent all of the country’s footballers. His goal at this point was to establish a special working relationship with Napoli, “the club of my heart”. However, the deal collapsed. ""I called [then Partenopei president Corrado] Ferlaino and we started the collaboration,"" he later explained. ""I offered him [Dennis] Bergkamp for 700 million lire [€362,000]. He hesitated. Two years later [1993], he offered €14 million, but I gave the player to Inter."" With the Bergkamp deal, which also saw Wim Jonk join the Nerazzurri from Ajax, Raiola had established himself as a major player in Serie A, the deal coming as it did a year after Bryan Roy's successful switch from Amsterdam to Foggia. What was clear at this juncture was that Raiola was as adept at pleasing his clients as upsetting their clubs. Indeed, Ajax, who had profited substantially from Raiola-arranged deals during the early 1990s, were less enamoured with the way in which star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Juventus in 2004. Their ill-feeling only intensified two years later when the fallout from Calciopoli led to the release of the following recorded telephone exchanges between then Bianconeri managing director Luciano Moggi and Raiola: Moggi: ""You and Ibra continue to make trouble. Don't send him to training ..."" Raiola: ""Tomorrow, I'll keep the player at home all day; he won't show up for training. I then have an appointment with the directors of Ajax at noon, but I'll come at two ..."" Raiola's influence on players was also questioned by Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson during his club’s ultimately futile attempts to persuade former midfielder Paul Pogba to remain at Old Trafford in 2012. The Scot subsequently admitted that he and Raiola took an instant dislike to one another, saying they were like ""water and oil"". Raiola's relationship with Pep Guardiola was even worse, with the agent labelling the Catalan a ""coward"" and a ""dog"", and even suggesting that the former Barcelona boss should have been sent to a psychiatric hospital for not playing Ibrahimovic. Raiola also claimed that he ""went for"" Guardiola after the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley but was held back by then-AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. ""Lucky for Guardiola!"" Raiola quipped. In his eyes, his willingness to literally fight for his clients underlined his commitment to their cause, while he always insisted that he did not engineer transfers, but merely facilitated them. ""I think that when a player decides to leave a team he should leave,"" he reasoned. ""I have never made compromises; I work exclusively in the interest of my client. ""The players are my fortune and I have a great responsibility towards them.However, I have never carried out improper activity or activity that I, personally, do not think proper. ""The old agents favoured the interests of the club. For me, the player comes first.” And that is precisely why they continued to flock to him. From Ibrahimovic and Pogba to Erling Haaland and Gigi Donnarumma, Raiola remained arguably the most influential agent in football right up until his untimely death at the age of 54. Football agent Mino Raiola has passed away aged 54, his family have announced.RIP. pic.twitter.com/SdSKUoiJux There were always question marks over the size of his cuts, but that was part of a broader debate over the role of agents within the game. Whatever one's view of Raiola's role in transfers, there is no denying that this was a man with a unique way with words who knew not only to sell himself, but also his players. He spoke eight languages (Italian, Dutch, French, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and ""of course Neapolitan"") and had a particular flair for hyperbole. He memorably compared Pogba with a Salvador Dali painting and claimed that Ibrahimovic’s move to Paris Saint-Germain finally provided visitors to the French capital with something to see other than the Mona Lisa. For all his bombast, though, he rather humbly puts his impressive linguistic capabilities down to ""preparation, not intelligence"". Ultimately, there was a contradiction at the core of Raiola's work, and his character. He said he resolved problems. His detractors claimed that he created them. Perhaps the truth was somewhere in between – and perhaps utterly irrelevant because the bottom line is that Raiola made money. Both for his clients – and himself. ""We live in a cynical world,"" as Dicky Fox says in 'Jerry Maguire'. ""A cynical world. And we work in a business of tough competitors."" Raiola was undoubtedly one of the toughest competitors in his particular field, which probably also made him the best. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

80,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-declares-himself-the-greatest-ever-mls-player-i/blt65c1cd38a32794b3,Ibrahimovic declares himself the greatest ever MLS player: 'I was still too alive',"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has declared himself the “best player to ever play in MLS” and claimed he was “too good for the whole competition” during his two-year spell with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Ibrahimovic scored 53 goals in 58 appearances for the Galaxy over two seasons between 2018 and 2019 before returning to Milan in Serie A. Despite leaving Galaxy empty handed, with the club failing to make the play-offs in 2018 before losing in the Western Conference semi-finals the following year, Ibrahimovic still thinks his impact warrants him the number one position. Ibrahimovic joined the Galaxy in March 2018 after his contract at Manchester United was terminated early. The then 36-year-old had only just returned from a serious knee injury the previous November and says the move across the Atlantic helped him regain full match fitness. ""I'm very happy. I'm very thankful for MLS because they gave me the chance to feel alive.” He told ESPN. “But the problem was I was still too alive. So I was too good for the whole competition. That is what I showed. And I'm the best ever to play in MLS and that is not me having ego or trying to show off now. That is true. ""And when I was there, I enjoyed [it]. I had a good time. And I like the way they were working, the way they were doing the marketing stuff. ""And I think [playing in MLS] was the best way for me to come back after my injury. I was in the best condition ever. And I'm very proud I played for the MLS, because they were saying to me the stadiums are pretty empty when you play in that. ""There was no empty stadiums when I was playing. It was even overbooked, so I cannot complain, and I'm very happy I was there."" Ibrahimovic is still playing at the highest level despite being the age of 40, though injuries have limited him to 24 appearances for Milan in all competitions so far this season. His contract expires in the summer and there had been speculation he could retire - something he emphatically denied earlier this month. When quizzed on his future, the former Sweden striker did not rule out a return to the United States, either as a player or following in David Beckham’s footsteps and buying a franchise of his own. ""You never know - maybe one day I'll come back,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""So to show them how, to give them a reminder what real football is. ""So it's for two years. They get to see what real football is and I think they will never see something like that before. Maybe I come back and have my own club -- you'll never know.""

Trophies have been collected by a modern day great on a regular basis over the course of a stunning career that has seen him spend time with the likes of Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and AC Milan. There will come a day when he has to head into retirement, but when will his boots by hung up and for how much longer could he continue playing at the top level? GOAL takes a look… The self-proclaimed ‘God’ of football has never shied away from the fact that he intends to prolong his career for as long as possible. With a competitive fire burning as bright as ever within an evergreen frontman, there is no need for him to consider walking away from a profession that has made him a living legend. Zlatan at 40.So many iconic moments 😎 pic.twitter.com/yRaFJlFOVV Ibrahimovic has collected league titles in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, while also claiming domestic cup honours in many of his various landing spots – including in England when at Old Trafford. He has registered over 500 goals at club level, with time also spent in the United States with the LA Galaxy, while the target has been found on a record-setting 62 occasions while earning 121 caps for his country. As he has been showing no sign of slowing down, netting 36 times for Milan since rejoining them in December 2019, no fixed date has been set for his retirement. Niggling injuries have started to become more frequent, with knee problems holding him back in 2021-22, and Rossoneri boss Stefano Pioli has said of Ibrahimovic’s future plans as he works on rolling 12-month contracts at San Siro: ""Everyone can have physical problems, he is dealing with a knee issue now. We hope he can return before the end of the season. ""As for his future, I don’t think something has changed. I am sure he will make the best choice, and we’ll back him regardless of what he decides."" Unsurprisingly, Ibrahimovic has responded to suggestions that he may be considering retirement in typically bold fashion, with the Swede posting a video on social media that shows he has lost none of his touch. He said: ""I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you."" I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you pic.twitter.com/481mnOGG2W Having made over 850 appearances on the domestic stage and well over 100 in the international arena, Ibrahimovic could be forgiven for allowing his attention to drift towards what may come next for him. He is, however, someone who has perfected the art of keeping focus locked on the present, and he is not about to change his ways. The veteran forward has admitted that the thought of having to stop playing football does scare him. He has said: ""I do feel a slight sense of panic at the prospect of retirement. ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time. ""I know the adrenaline I feel at the moment will never be the same. We are programmed to wake up, go to training, return home and rest. ""This goes on for 20-25 years, but one day I will wake up and have nothing planned, and that will be a strange feeling."" HAPPY 40TH BIRTHDAY ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC 👑𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐲 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐨 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝. pic.twitter.com/rIzXd6HSjt As a proven winner that always demands the highest standards from himself and those him, Ibrahimovic has also been eager to point out that he is reluctant to call it a day before he has helped his current employers to snap a six-year barren run on the trophy front and an 11-year wait for Serie A title glory. He has said: ""I won’t quit until I have won something with this Milan side."" Ibrahimovic has also stated that ""the reality is I’ll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I’m still playing."" He has gone on to say: ""Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. I’m not ready to smoke a cigar yet."" The world has been warned, Ibrahimovic is going nowhere any time soon and will only walk away on his own terms when there is nothing left for him to achieve. As mentioned, Ibrahimovic has collected trophies and medals just about everywhere he has been - including many individual ones such as Golden Boots and Player of the Year prizes - with his mere presence helping to raise collective standards within any squad he graces. In total he has lifted 33 pieces of silverware, although the two Serie A titles he claimed while with Juventus were later revoked after the Calciopoli scandal.

The 20-year-old was first taken into custody on January 30 following the release of images and video online by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. He was released on bail on February 4, with United having already taken the decision by that point to suspend him “until further notice”. Investigations remain ongoing and it has now been revealed that Greenwood’s bail will be extended beyond April 30. A statement from the police reads: ""We are continuing to investigate a report made to us on Sunday 30 January of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. A 20-year-old man arrested that day on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman, and threats to kill, remains on bail. ""An application has been made to the courts to have his bail extended beyond Saturday 30 April, but the hearing isn't expected to be until mid-June. The suspect will remain on conditional bail until the date of the court hearing."" The hearing in question will not be held until the middle of June. Greenwood has not figured for United since a Premier League meeting with West Ham on January 22.

Another epic tussle for domestic supremacy is unfolding in the 2021-22 campaign, with two heavyweights of world football slugging it out for the right to be crowned kings of England. There is little to choose between them at present, with Man City delivering the perfect response to Liverpool’s 1-0 victory at Newcastle when they went to Leeds and claimed a convincing 4-0 win. Laporte has revealed Man City did go out of their way to watch Liverpool’s match at St James’ Park, but told the club’s official website: “It was very important to win (against Leeds) and we did it. We need to continue the same way. “We knew Liverpool had won earlier and they keep getting good results, so we had to do it as well. “I think we have been at a great level all season and today we managed to respond to the pressure with another solid performance. “Of course, we watch Liverpool games and results, but we only focus on ourselves and to make sure we do our job.” Manchester City go back above Liverpool after beating Leeds 4-0 🔝 pic.twitter.com/F2DPxgzUDY Both the Citizens and Reds have just five more Premier League fixtures this season.

84,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-prove-mettle-leeds-liverpool-title-race/blt99e0ed2b5f629890,Keep calm and carry on: Man City prove their mettle at Leeds to keep Liverpool at bay in title race,"Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Match Statistics Amid the chaos, Manchester City kept calm to keep their destiny in their own hands. At Elland Road on Saturday evening, Leeds United did everything they could to drag Pep Guardiola's side into a match of disarray and disorder; one that was just as crucial to their relegation battle as it was to City's Premier League title hopes. However, City know how to hold their nerve in high-pressure situations and, thanks to a 4-0 win which restored their one-point advantage over Liverpool at the top of the table, the English champions are now just four more victories away from retaining their title. Tuesday night's chaotic Champions League victory over Real Madrid was an extreme example of what can happen if you throw City out of their rhythm, with both sides exchanging punches like two heavyweight sluggers, and Guardiola is determined to stop it happening too often. Ruben Dias returned to the ground where he made his City debut in October 2020 and instantly pulled together a struggling defence – and reprised the role here alongside Aymeric Laporte. City's centre-back pairing provided City with the platform for their success, shutting down a passionate but toothless Leeds side who didn't manage a shot on target until the 89th minute. Still, the hosts gave their all from start to finish, and there were undeniably moments in the first half when City looked upset by the home side's physical approach. Bernardo Silva quarrelled with the home side's bench, Guardiola and Jack Grealish exchanged views over a hacked clearance, and Joao Cancelo almost recreated Seven Gerrard's infamous slip that cost Liverpool the 2014 title, before Ilkay Gundogan sprinted back to save his embarrassment. Manchester City go back above Liverpool after beating Leeds 4-0 🔝 pic.twitter.com/F2DPxgzUDY However, City were ultimately far too strong for their opponents, even though Guardiola rotated his squad ahead of the return to the Santiago Bernabeu, with Kevin De Bruyne and Silva missing as part of a calculated gamble. Raheem Sterling was recalled and danced through what looked like the floor of a school disco after Leeds fans covered the pitch with paper detritus, and he was unfortunate not to find the goal. On the other side, £100 million Jack Grealish sparkled sporadically in between being targeted by the fans and Leeds players. Stuart Dallas, caught him late with one challenge, but came off worse and unfortunately left the pitch on a stretcher. Again, though, it was the magic of Phil Foden that was the biggest threat. A certain starter in the Spanish capital, he moved to a more central role and pulled the strings and pulled the Leeds defence apart. He claimed two assists, the first with a driven free-kick that Rodri simply had to touch in to put City ahead. His second, and City's third, showcased why the No.8 position will be his long-term role, as he drove at the Leeds defence and played a beautifully-weighted pass for Gabriel Jesus to score his sixth goal in three games. Guardiola's instant reaction was to take Foden off and wrap him up for the huge second leg in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. The pressure may be building, but City show no signs of imploding.

Asmir Begovic is acutely aware of the significance of the situation. However, as someone forced to flee war-torn Yugoslavia during his childhood, the 34-year-old goalkeeper also has a real sense of perspective. ""It was a difficult time for my family and I think the more I grew up, the more I think about it differently because the first time we were refugees, I was only four years of age,"" he explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""With the pandemic and not a lot going on, I have had small glimpses in my brain, when something comes up, and I remember the travelling and the boats, and just trying to get to a safer environment. ""I get flashbacks every once in a while travelling in the car, too, not so much of when we had to leave Yugoslavia, but when we later had to leave Germany for Canada. That was difficult. ""We didn't have stability because we were on yearly visas and it was proving impossible to get renewed because our income wasn't enough. ""I remember that a lot more and, obviously, the impact that had on my family. These sorts of situations create a sense of unrest but also resilience and a sense of gratefulness for what you have today, which is a good life. ""It drives you to always do better and gives me a sense of fear of not ever wanting to go back."" Begovic, who was born in Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, freely admits that even today he struggles to process exactly what he went through. However, there's one thing he's 100 per cent clear on: the incredible sacrifices his parents made to give him the best possible childhood. ""Looking back, it's a combination of things you feel, but I think the biggest thing is the respect for my parents – that is huge. ""As you get older, you have responsibilities in life, and you become a parent yourself. But I could never imagine having to go through some of those situations now. ""Nobody felt sorry for us and you couldn't feel sorry for yourself. My parents worked multiple jobs and my dad gave up playing football to work as a delivery driver. ""My mum was working in restaurants and as a cleaner, then studied to be a nurse while also learning a new language. ""We got through it; my parents made huge sacrifices. When you're put in that situation, it is quite simple: you either stay or go. We left and they worked out everything as they went along."" As a kid ""with a funny German accent"" and a low level of English, Begovic initially found it difficult to settle in Canada. ""Luckily,"" he says, ""I was good at football and that helped me integrate. Of course, when you're younger, you don't overthink these things; you just kind of crack on."" Having continued to excel at football, making a name for himself as a promising young goalkeeper, Begovic eventually returned to Europe to join Portsmouth. However, because he was on a student visa, he couldn't play competitive fixtures. ""When I turned 18, I had to move to Belgium while paperwork was being sorted out,"" he explains. ""And it was to a club I never even heard of – La Louviere. It was also a club in crisis. ""Thankfully, Harry Redknapp came in [as manager of the Portsmouth senior side] and saw something in me. From there, you go to play against great Premier League clubs and play against great players, getting you into the national team. ""And it really was good for me going into the Bosnian national team because a lot of the guys were from refugee families like me, and maybe more German or French because of it. ""For me, it was like flirting with being Bosnian again after settling in the UK. I say it in my academies now: the biggest trait you need to make it as a footballer is resilience."" Begovic's story is certainly proof of that. Despite all of the difficulties he and his family went through, this is a footballer with over 450 professional appearances to his name. Fittingly, he is also now an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency and it pains him to see the human cost of conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""This role brings back difficult memories,"" he admits. ""No one likes to see people being displaced by wars. It is absolutely awful. ""These wars are just for people's egos. They are fighting over something that wasn't theirs in the first place. ""Nothing good will come of it, it is just suffering and people losing things or, worse, loved ones. ""I try to do what I can to give money to the UN, an unbelievable organisation, or by raising awareness and helping people live their dreams. ""I'd say to people to just be open-minded. These people would rather be getting on with their normal lives and now their lives have been turned upside down. ""Be open-minded, compassionate and helpful as possible. Overall, our society is okay but in these moments we can always do more."" Despite his commendable commitment to addressing the refugee crisis, Begovic also remains intent on doing what he can to help Everton beat the drop. ""I have been blessed to play football for a living and I want to do it as long as I can,"" he says. ""It has obviously been a difficult season for many different reasons. It is just about surviving and kicking on next season. ""We have got a great manager and staff who have achieved everything in the game you could imagine. I knew some of them from my Chelsea days. ""They are resilient people and we won't give up and stop fighting. We're trying our best and want to make the best of a difficult situation."" Just as Begovic has been doing his whole life.

A general meeting of the teams in the Ukrainian top-flight took place on Tuesday via video conference. The season had initially been on hold since December because of the winter break, which was supposed to end in February but the resumption was delayed because of the ongoing conflict.

Man Utd brought Ronaldo back to the club from Juventus in a £20 million ($25m) deal last summer, 13 years from his initial departure to Real Madrid. The 37-year-old has since been the Red Devils' main source of goals, netting 23 across all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign, and Dalot says he is also a great source of inspiration behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Speaking ahead of Man Utd's next Premier League game, against Brentford, the Portuguese defender told Sky Sports of Ronaldo: ""I'm sure I speak not just for me but he's been one of the most positive things about this season - to work with somebody who has his culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality and being close to him now, it's been very helpful for me and my career. ""I don't have any more compliments to give about the way he works, he's a fantastic human being as well. The numbers are there, the stats are there, so we're obviously very happy to have him here."" Dalot added on how the rest of the squad gets on with Ronaldo: ""He's a very friendly person. When he feels he has the trust of other people, he gives 100 per cent of himself to you. ""Everybody gets along with him here, everyone likes to have him around. It's always a big plus to have a player and a person like this in the changing room."" Dalot went on to discuss the appointment of Ten Hag, who will replace Ralf Rangnick in the Old Trafford dugout at the end of his final season with Ajax. The full-back is glad the squad has the clarity of a permanent boss to work with after Rangnick's six-month interim spell in charge, and feels Ten Hag has all the qualities to be successful in Manchester. ""I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he is a great manager - what he's done with Ajax is something outstanding,"" said Dalot. ""He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well. ""In our heads, it's going to be clear who the manager will be next season and that's good because we go for our break in our heads knowing who to expect. ""Then we will have time in pre-season to work together, get our ideas right and start the new season."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.
