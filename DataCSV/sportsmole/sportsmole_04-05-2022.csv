Barca will allegedly look to accelerate talks with Dembele over a new deal this month, with head coach Xavi keen for the Frenchman to commit his future to the Catalan giants. However, El Chiringuito journalist Dario Montero, via the Manchester Evening News, claims that Man United have made contact with Dembele's representatives and have tabled a contract offer worth between £8.4m and £12.5m. Paris Saint-Germain are also understood to have made a contract offer for Dembele, though they have proposed to pay the winger in the region of €17m (£14.3m). Dembele has started 15 of his 29 appearances for Barcelona across all competitions this season, scoring only twice and registering 11 assists.  ",positive

Despite his upturn in form, Jesus's future at the Etihad Stadium has come into question in recent weeks, with Arsenal believed to be interested in signing the Brazilian this summer. According to the Daily Mirror, City value Jesus at around £40m and the potential sale of the forward would help provide funds to recruit primary target Erling Braut Haaland. The Gunners are allegedly preparing to table a £35m offer for Jesus this summer, but the Citizens are holding out for at least £40m if they are to consider selling the former Palmeiras youngster. Jesus, who has just over 12 months remaining on his contract at the Etihad, has recorded 95 goals and 46 assists in 232 appearances for City across all competitions since joining the club in January 2017.

A consortium led by Boehly are also understood to have table a bid, with US merchant bank Raine Group set to make a final decision on who will purchase the club in the coming days. According to the Evening Standard, Ratcliffe believes he can hijack Boehly's bid after bypassing Raine in making an improved offer. A statement from INEOS read: ""This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. ""This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, Ten Hag has already identified a core group of first-team players who he believes he can trust at United going forward, and the 52-year-old intends to make at least three marquee summer signings. Club captain Harry Maguire, whose performances have come under fire throughout this campaign, has been studied by Ten Hag in recent weeks and the Dutchman intends to try and get the best of the £85m defender when he arrives at Old Trafford. Maguire has predominantly operated as a left-sided centre-back this season, but the report suggests that Ten Hag may look to recruit a left-footed defender and either shift the Englishman over to the right or use him in the middle of a back three. Meanwhile, the long-term futures of Marcus Rashford and Aaron Wan-Bissaka remains uncertain, with senior figures at the club questioning whether they would benefit from selling the former this summer. Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard are all set to leave United when their contracts expire in June, while the likes of Ajax duo Antony and Jurrien Timber as well as Benfica's Darwin Nunez and Villarreal's Pau Torres have all been linked with a switch to Old Trafford.

Liverpool were unusually disjointed and sloppy in the opening exchanges, but Jurgen Klopp's half-time team talk and Luis Diaz's introduction turned the second leg around. Diaz was on the scoresheet alongside Fabinho and Sadio Mane in the second leg to steer Liverpool to a 3-2 win, which saw them progress to their 10th Champions League final 5-2 on aggregate. Salah has already stepped foot onto the turf for two Champions League finals for Liverpool, but his 2018 meeting with Real Madrid saw him leave the field in tears after picking up an injury in a challenge from Sergio Ramos. Liverpool went on to lose the final 3-1 before beating Tottenham Hotspur in the showpiece event one year later, and Salah is out for revenge against Los Blancos four years on from that painful evening in Kyiv. © Reuters ""I want Madrid in the final. They beat us in a final already so let's play them again,"" Salah told BT Sport after Tuesday's thrilling comeback victory. ""It was tough in the first half, but at half time the gaffer spoke to us. He was talking and shouting! We spoke to each other. We are a top team so we knew we could strike back. It makes the win more exciting. ""After we won every single group game, that is when I thought 'we are going to win the Champions League.' You need to focus on your work, you need to set a goal in your mind and go from there."" Liverpool gave the ball away numerous times in the opening 45 minutes against a Villarreal side who showed much more purpose than in the first leg, and Trent Alexander-Arnold also admitted that the Reds never got going in the first half. ""We never played football that first half and didn't pick up any second balls. They played the game they wanted to and we allowed them to do that. Second half we came our and controlled the goal better. One bad half over two legs, we can concede that to get the job done,"" Alexander-Arnold told the broadcaster. ""We never seem to make these Champions League semi-finals easy for ourselves. Difficult, really difficult. We came here and they played very well first-half. We regrouped at half-time and got the game by the scruff of the neck. We did what we needed to do. © Reuters ""It is always nice to get the job done on Tuesday, We can watch the game tomorrow knowing we will be there. Either opponent deserves to get to the final."" Klopp's decision to swap Diogo Jota out for Diaz sparked new life into the Liverpool side, but the Reds boss affirmed that the former was not the ""problem"" for his side in a tepid first half. ""A massive impact [from Diaz] but I don't like this because the next story is Diogo Jota was the problem. Not true. We had 11 problems in the first half but we needed fresh legs. We were not ourselves,"" Klopp told the press. ""It is outstanding. We made it pretty tricky for ourselves but it is about how you react and adapt. Respect to Villarreal.

They will deserve it and we will face each other in Paris!"" Liverpool's 10th Champions League final will see them meet either Real Madrid or Manchester City, with Los Blancos down 4-3 heading into Wednesday's second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu.

However, Unai Emery's side came storming out of the blocks and had levelled the tie by half time courtesy of goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin in front of the home crowd. The Yellow Submarine could not keep up the intensity in the second 45, though, as Liverpool turned the game around through Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane to book their spot in the final. Villarreal started the second leg with a new-look frontline of Dia and Gerard Moreno due to Arnaut Danjuma's injury, and the former took just three minutes to break the deadlock after Etienne Capoue found the Senegalese attacker for a tap-in. Dani Parejo also fizzed an effort just wide of the post as Villarreal demonstrated an attacking bite that was absent in the first leg, while Liverpool endured a surprising period of sloppiness at La Ceramica. © Reuters Thiago Alcantara saw his effort in the 14th minute clip the bar but referee Danny Makkelie had already blown for a foul, and the official also waved away Villarreal penalty shouts when Alisson Becker collided with Giovani Lo Celso inside the area. Four minutes before the break, Villarreal's dominance turned into a two-goal lead through Coquelin, who caught Trent Alexander-Arnold unawares and headed home from Capoue's cross to level the tie on aggregate. Klopp responded to a disjointed and sloppy first half by bringing on Luis Diaz for Diogo Jota, and the Colombian attacker's introduction soon sparked new life into the Reds' XI. With 55 minutes gone, a long-range effort from Alexander-Arnold deflected off the knee of Coquelin onto the bar, and Thiago's effort following the corner fell kindly into the grasp of Geronimo Rulli. However, the Argentine goalkeeper - who was a shaky figure in the first leg - then allowed Fabinho's effort to trickle into the back of the net through his legs just after the hour mark as Liverpool took control of the tie again. The Merseyside giants retained possession much better in the second 45 and restored their two-goal aggregate lead not long after Fabinho's effort, as the effervescent Diaz was left in acres of space and had the easy task of heading home from Alexander-Arnold's cross. © Reuters Villarreal's defence simply stopped and watched Diaz ghost in and put Liverpool firmly in control, and the semi-final was dead and buried in the 74th minute following yet another mishap from Emery's goalkeeper. Rulli was caught in no man's land and lost out to Mane, who also dribbled his way past Juan Foyth and had the simple task of slotting home into an empty net to complete the Liverpool comeback. Substitute Curtis Jones very nearly got in on the act for Liverpool with 10 minutes to go, but Rulli got down well to save the midfielder's effort that time. Insult was soon added to injury for Villarreal as Capoue was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the Frenchman walked off to a standing ovation from the home crowd, who were in terrific voice all evening. Emery's men could not produce something spectacular in the final moments as Liverpool advanced to their 10th Champions League final to keep the quadruple dream alive. Either Real Madrid or Manchester City will now meet the Reds at the Stade de France on May 28, with Pep Guardiola's side travelling to the Santiago Bernabeu for Wednesday's battle with a 4-3 first-leg lead.

However, despite the two clubs being close in the standings, Bournemouth dominated the contest for large periods, particularly in the second half. When Jefferson Lerma sustained a hamstring injury, Scott Parker opted to introduce forward Kieffer Moore, rather than a like-for-like replacement in midfield, and that decision ultimately proved decisive. After Bournemouth had been awarded a free kick on the edge of the box, Philip Billing cleverly played the ball to Moore, who swept a first-time curling effort into the far bottom corner. Due to a number of stoppages, eight minutes of added-on time were signalled by the referee, and Forest goalkeeper Brice Samba almost scored in the closing seconds, sending a shot marginally off target from eight yards after coming up for a corner. Once the ball had cleared the crossbar, Bournemouth were left to celebrate securing another stint in the top flight, two years after they were relegated. Forest will now take their place in the playoffs, Steve Cooper's side needing to win against Hull City on Saturday to guarantee third position.

However, Burnley currently remain powerless in their attempts to keep Tarkowski beyond the summer, and Football Insider are reporting that Everton are looking into the possibility of bringing the defender to Goodison Park.

Nunez still has more than three years left to run on his contract with Benfica, but the Portuguese giants are unlikely to be able to keep hold of him during this summer's transfer window. A number of leading European clubs have been linked with the Uruguay international, with Man United believed to be among the favourites for his signature in the upcoming market. According to Almeida, Erik ten Hag's side are now closing in on a deal for the centre-forward, with the Premier League giants placing an offer of €80m (£67.4m) on the table. © Reuters Bayern Munich have also been strongly linked with the South American, but the Bundesliga champions have allegedly been priced out of a summer deal. Meanwhile, Manchester City appear to be focusing on a move for Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland, and Tottenham Hotspur are expected to keep hold of Harry Kane this summer, meaning that a move for a new centre-forward will not be a priority for the London club. Man United, though, will lose Edinson Cavani on a free transfer this summer, while the futures of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are also far from secure. Cristiano Ronaldo has enjoyed a brilliant scoring season on his return to Old Trafford, but the Portugal international could also be on the move during this summer's transfer window. As a result, the 20-time English champions might be in the market for a couple of new strikers ahead of next season, and Nunez is reportedly set to move to Old Trafford. © Reuters Nunez has scored 48 goals and registered 16 assists in 84 appearances for Benfica since making the move from Almeria in September 2020.

The Uruguayan struck three times in the group stage of the European Cup against Barcelona and Bayern Munich, while he netted against Ajax in the round of 16 before registering home and away in Benfica's 6-4 aggregate defeat to Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the competition. Eighteen of Nunez's 34 goals at club level this term have come when he has started through the middle, while he has netted 10 goals in five outings starting from the left, and his versatility makes him an attractive proposition for Man United, who beat Brentford 3-0 in their final home match of the season on Monday night.

The former Lyon man has spearheaded Real Madrid to the La Liga title with 26 goals in 30 domestic appearances, as well as striking a remarkable 14 times in 10 Champions League outings. Benzema's European strikes include back-to-back hat-tricks against Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, while he also headed home the goal against the Blues that clinched Real's semi-final spot. The 34-year-old's side were up against it in the first leg of their semi-final with a rampant Man City side, but his brace and Vinicius Junior's effort saw Real cut the deficit to 4-3 in an Etihad Stadium classic. Benzema firstly plucked a goal out of nowhere just after the half-hour mark before remaining unfazed to dink home a panenka penalty with 82 minutes gone following Aymeric Laporte's handball. © Reuters Nine of Benzema's 14 strikes in this season's Champions League have come in the knockout rounds, and he has already set a new record for the most goals by a Frenchman in a single Champions League campaign. Should Benzema find the back of the net once in Wednesday's second leg, he will equal Ronaldo's record of 10 goals in the knockout rounds of one Champions League season, and a brace would see him become the outright record holder. Ronaldo achieved the double-figure feat for Real in the 2016-17 season under Zinedine Zidane, which included a brace in the final against Juventus after he had previously failed to score in four of his side's group games. The Portuguese's record is not the only one on the line for Benzema, as only three players before him have ever scored in both legs of the quarter-finals and semi-finals in a single season. Ex-Real Madrid man Fernando Morientes was the first to do so during Monaco's run to the 2003-04 final, netting four times in four knockout games versus Los Blancos and Chelsea.

In total, Benzema has struck 42 goals and provided 13 assists for the La Liga champions this season - his best return at the club yet, and he needs just three more goals to move into second place in the Los Blancos all-time scoring charts.

Adeyemi has struck 17 goals in 26 league matches for the Austrian champions this term - putting him two clear of Giacomo Vrioni at the top of the goalscoring charts. The 20-year-old has also been no stranger to strong showings in Europe with three goals and two assists from eight Champions League games this season, contributing against Lille, Wolfsburg and Sevilla. Adeyemi's existing contract with Salzburg only has two years left to run, and he is expected to seek pastures new at the end of the current season amid growing interest in his services. © Reuters Liverpool were strongly linked with a move for Adeyemi at one point, but it now appears that Borussia Dortmund have won the race for the German's signature as they prepare to wave goodbye to Erling Braut Haaland. Manchester City and Real Madrid are seen as the two frontrunners for Haaland's signature, and Dortmund director Michael Zorc has hinted that the Norwegian will end up in the Premier League. Adeyemi is therefore set to follow in Haaland's footsteps to BVB after the 21-year-old also made the move to the Westfalenstadion from Salzburg, but according to Sport1 journalist Patrick Berger, United tried to hijack the move at the last minute. Berger claims that Man United were prepared to offer the 20-year-old a £150k-per-week salary to make the move to Old Trafford, but the three-cap Germany international has always prioritised a move to Dortmund, who have already qualified for the 2022-23 Champions League. Adeyemi will supposedly pen a five-year contract with the Bundesliga giants ""in the coming days"", forcing Man United to look elsewhere in their search for attacking reinforcements. © Reuters Current interim boss Ralf Rangnick expects to see ""two or three"" new strikers come to Old Trafford this summer, with several of United's current attacking names on the verge of leaving. Edinson Cavani has endured a dismal season with injuries and will leave when his deal expires, and the future of Marcus Rashford is still up in the air amid his paltry tally of four Premier League goals this season. Anthony Martial fell down the pecking order at Old Trafford and has also not done enough to warrant a permanent move to Sevilla with just one goal in 11 outings for Julen Lopetegui's side, and his future remains unclear. Darwin Nunez, Victor Osimhen and Lautaro Martinez have all been mentioned as possible summer targets, and Tottenham Hotspur's Steven Bergwijn recently opened the door to a move to Man United ahead of compatriot Erik ten Hag's arrival. Man United kept their fleeting hopes of Champions League football alive with a 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday, but they remain sixth in the table and are five points adrift of Arsenal having played two games more.

The Citizens have now won each of their last three Champions League meetings against Real Madrid, including the 4-2 aggregate victory in 2019-20 which saw City win 2-1 in both legs of their last-16 tie. Should the Premier League leaders come out on top in the Spanish capital, they would become only the third team in Champions League history to win four successive matches against Los Blancos, after Ajax between 1973 and 1995 and Bayern Munich between 2000 and 2002. City could also become just the fourth English side in European Cup/Champions League history to reach consecutive finals if they were to beat Real Madrid on aggregate, after Liverpool (1977 and 1978, 1984 and 1985, 2018 and 2019), Manchester United (2008 and 2009) and Nottingham Forest (1979 and 1980).

""The Real Madrid, interested, could position itself concretely in the coming weeks... To be continued."" Real Madrid are not short of midfield options at present having secured the signature of Eduardo Camavinga, while Luka Modric has also allegedly agreed to stay on for at least one more season. However, with Modric now approaching the final knockings of his career while Toni Kroos and Casemiro continue in their 30s, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti could plan for the future with 24-year-old Tielemans alongside Camavinga and Federico Valverde. Real are understood to have enquired about Tielemans's availability in the January transfer window but decided against a move when learning of the Belgium international's £50m price tag. Manchester United's midfield is also expected to undergo a major overhaul this summer, with Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba expected to depart as free agents at the end of their contracts. Tielemans is expected to be one of several targets on the Red Devils' wishlist this summer, with a recent report claiming that James Ward-Prowse was also being eyed up by Erik ten Hag. © Reuters Tielemans initially arrived on loan at the King Power Stadium for the second half of the 2018-19 season and was immediately snapped up on a permanent deal after providing three goals and five assists in those six months.

Tielemans's statistics this season include seven goals and four assists from 44 matches continentally and domestically, with six of those strikes coming in Premier League action.

Barcelona attempted to offload Dembele for a cut-price fee in the January transfer window to avoid losing the nine-figure man on a free this summer, with the 24-year-old also struggling for form and fitness in the early stages of the campaign. However, Dembele remained at the club and has since developed into one of Xavi's integral attackers, registering one goal and 11 assists in 17 La Liga matches during the 2021-22 season. A new contract for the ex-Borussia Dortmund man is now thought to be a realistic possibility, and Barca are understood to have held positive talks with their attacker over fresh terms. The Catalans' long-running financial problems could scupper their chances of tying Dembele down for longer, though, with journalist Toni Juanmarti claiming that PSG have tabled a €17m (£14.3m) offer to the Frenchman. © Reuters Les Parisiens are expected to wave goodbye to Angel Di Maria on a free transfer this summer, while Kylian Mbappe's future also remains up in the air as he runs down the final few weeks of his deal with the Ligue 1 champions. There is thought to be more optimism about the prospect of keeping Mbappe on the books at the Parc des Princes, but Dembele could be an option to replace the World Cup winner if Real Madrid do end up striking a deal for him. Juanmarti adds that PSG are still waiting for a response from Dembele and are keen to hear back from the Barcelona man within the next 20 days, otherwise they will move on to other targets. Agreeing a new contract with Barcelona is thought to be Dembele's priority, but the Catalans' latest contract offer supposedly still did not satisfy the Frenchman on the financial side of things. Blaugrana manager Xavi recently lauded Dembele as an ""example"" amid his contract saga, with Chelsea and Manchester United also previously linked with a move for the former Rennes youngster. © Reuters Since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in a £126m move in the summer of 2017, Dembele has gone on to make 146 appearances for the club in all competitions, posting identical statistics of 32 goals and 32 assists in that time.

Now, The Telegraph reports that Liverpool will consider selling Salah in the upcoming market if he fails to commit his future to the club, and he could be tempted by a move to PSG. The prospect of linking up with Lionel Messi and Neymar in a star-studded frontline could appeal to the 29-year-old, although PSG are thought to be prioritising a move for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele.

""My relationship with both players is great. If it's a positive sign for the boys then great, but I don't think this will be a decisive factor.

Cavani is due to spend the rest of the campaign at Old Trafford before leaving on a free transfer, but there have been suggestions that the Uruguay international could seek a move at the start of 2022.

However, the Daily Mirror reports that the Spaniard's brother Pere Guardiola has already held talks with City about extending his stay, and the club are growing increasingly confident that he will put pen to paper on a new two-year deal. The report adds that Guardiola still believes that he has unfinished business with the Citizens and he is willing to sign a new contract even if they win the Champions League this season. The future of Guardiola is also understood to have been discussed during negotiations with Erling Braut Haaland's representatives, with City ensuring that the 21-year-old striker that he will work under the Spanish boss should he decide to move to the Etihad this summer. Guardiola recently expressed how ""incredibly happy"" he is at City and that he has a strong relationship with the club's hierarchy, but he refused to be drawn on speculation over a new contract after Liverpool announced on Thursday that Jurgen Klopp extended his own deal until 2026.

Lage's side were at one point challenging for an unlikely Champions League berth, but a drop-off in form has left them outside of the European places in eighth position - three points adrift of West Ham United with a game in hand. Neves now only has two years left on his contract with the Molineux side, and failure to secure a continental spot for the 2022-23 season could tempt the Portugal international into a move elsewhere. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with a swoop for Neves, with the Red Devils understood to have recently sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Wolves. Despite the impending arrival of Franck Kessie from AC Milan on a free transfer, Barcelona are also thought to be keen to bring Neves to Catalonia as part of their summer overhaul. © Reuters While Lage has admitted that it may be difficult for Wolves to keep hold of Neves this summer, the Portuguese has insisted that the midfielder is worth at least £100m in the upcoming market. ""These days we need to be ready for everything. A player like this has a value of £100m. Anything can happen, not just with Ruben. If we want to improve we need the best guys at the best price,"" Lage told reporters at a press conference last week. As a result, Sport claims that Barcelona will therefore be priced out of a move for Neves, who they had initially identified as an ideal long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets. Busquets will celebrate his 34th birthday in July and still has one more year to run on his deal with the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are understandably planning for life without the Spaniard. The report adds that Barcelona are not closing the door on a move for Neves fully, with Wolves unable to play hardball in negotiations should the Portuguese continue to wind his contract down. Neves allegedly dreams of pulling on the Barcelona shirt, meanwhile, and agent Jorge Mendes's strong working relationship with the Catalan side could ultimately aid a bid for the former Porto youngster. © Reuters Neves arrived at Wolves in the summer of 2017 after rising through the ranks in Porto's youth system and immediately helped the club achieve promotion to the Premier League with six goals in 42 Championship matches in 2017-18. The lynchpin has gone on to make 208 appearances for the Molineux outfit in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 12 assists in that spell. Fifteen of those goals and eight assists have come in 138 Premier League appearances, and he has made the starting lineup on 27 occasions in the top flight this season. Neves had missed the start of April due to a knee injury but was fit enough to play the first 45 minutes of the weekend's 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion - Wolves' fourth defeat in five Premier League games. As well as Neves, Barcelona are also reported to be interested in Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler, but Los Che were recently forced to release a statement denying the existence of a €20m (£16.8m) transfer agreement between the two clubs.

According to the Daily Mirror, City value Jesus at around £40m and the potential sale of the forward would help provide funds to recruit primary target Erling Braut Haaland. The Gunners are allegedly preparing to table a £35m offer for Jesus this summer, but the Citizens are holding out for at least £40m if they are to consider selling the former Palmeiras youngster.

The Belgium international enjoyed a strong start with three goals in three Premier League games against Arsenal and Aston Villa but has since seen his fortunes take a turn for the worse in the capital. Lukaku also made a rod for his own back with the fans by admitting that he was pining for a return to San Siro last year, and he has since struggled to win over Thomas Tuchel. The 28-year-old's contract with the Blues still has another four years left to run, and the London club cannot conduct transfer business while sanctions on current owner Roman Abramovich remain in place. However, with optimism over a takeover happening before the market opens, Chelsea could attempt to recoup a fee for the out-of-favour striker in the summer. © Reuters AC Milan have been tipped to bring Lukaku back to Serie A as they plan for the future without Olivier Giroud and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, even though they have allegedly agreed a deal for Liverpool striker Divock Origi.

However, the Evening Standard now reports that Lukaku has no interest in a move to either team this summer and will snub any approaches made to him by Newcastle and Milan. The report adds that Chelsea are aware that very few clubs will be able to fork out Lukaku's asking price and mammoth salary, with Newcastle seen as one of the few realistic suitors. Furthermore, it is understood that takeover favourite Todd Boehly views current boss Tuchel as an integral part of his setup at Stamford Bridge, and the German has been loath to select Lukaku over Kai Havertz in recent weeks. © Reuters After failing to grasp his opportunity in a rare start against Arsenal last month, Lukaku has since been consigned to the bench and was an unused substitute in Sunday's defeat to former club Everton.

Furthermore, Lukaku has only made the first XI on 13 occasions in the current top-flight campaign, and his start against Arsenal was his first in the Premier League since his infamous seven-touch showing against Crystal Palace in February. Despite their ongoing financial problems, Inter would supposedly be willing to welcome Lukaku back to the club on loan, and the striker would jump at the chance to return to the Nerazzurri.

There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports News. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.""

However, the Dutch outfit are not in a position to reject a high offer for the attacker, with a recent report claiming that a bid in the region of £50m would be seriously considered. Ten Hag could potentially be handed as much as £200m to improve the Man United squad during this summer's transfer window, while the budget could be boosted by a number of outgoings. The Red Devils have struggled to fill the right-sided attacking spot in their side over the last few years, with Jadon Sancho largely playing off the left this season. © Reuters Man United are reportedly wary of signing Eredivisie-based players due to the struggles of Memphis Depay and Donny van de Beek at Old Trafford, but Ten Hag is believed to be keen to press ahead with a move for Antony.

Either Manchester City or Real Madrid will await Liverpool if they can avoid a calamitous collapse away from home, where they have enjoyed a strong set of results in Europe this season. Liverpool have endured daunting journeys to Porto, Benfica, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid and AC Milan's territory in the Champions League this term, but Klopp has seen his side come out on top on all five occasions. © Reuters The quadruple-chasing Merseyside giants have also scored at least two goals in each of those matches, and a European record is theirs for the taking against Villarreal this week. Should Liverpool advance to the final for a 10th time by winning the second leg, they will set a new record for a 100% streak away from home in the competition for the most games in a single campaign. The Reds' prospects of coming up trumps on Villarreal's turf seem relatively strong after Emery's side did not post a single shot on target in the first leg, but both Bayern Munich and Juventus have failed to win on the Yellow Submarine's turf so far this season. A 1-0 win away to Newcastle United at the weekend sees Liverpool enter the second leg on a four-game winning streak in all competitions, as well as a 12-game unbeaten run since that inconsequential last-16 second-leg loss to Inter Milan. Furthermore, no side has been able to hand Liverpool their first defeat of 2022 away from home yet, with Leicester City the last side to do so back in December 2021. © Reuters While the Liverpool team set out to break a European record on Tuesday, Mane is on the verge of equalling Frank Lampard's leading statistic of 15 Champions League knockout goals for an English club after his 14th such effort in the first leg. Klopp has confirmed that Liverpool will head into the second leg with a near fully-fit squad after Curtis Jones, Kostas Tsimikas and Divock Origi all overcame stomach bugs to train on Monday. However, Roberto Firmino continues to miss out with a foot injury, and Klopp was keen to stress to his players in his pre-match press conference that they may never get another opportunity to play in a Champions League semi-final again. With the EFL Cup already secured and an FA Cup final with Chelsea on the agenda, Liverpool have entered the first week of May having already come closer to winning the quadruple than any other English side before them.

However, Unai Emery's side came storming out of the blocks and had levelled the tie by half time courtesy of goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin in front of the home crowd. The Yellow Submarine could not keep up the intensity in the second 45, though, as Liverpool turned the game around through Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane to book their spot in the final. Villarreal started the second leg with a new-look frontline of Dia and Gerard Moreno due to Arnaut Danjuma's injury, and the former took just three minutes to break the deadlock after Etienne Capoue found the Senegalese attacker for a tap-in. Dani Parejo also fizzed an effort just wide of the post as Villarreal demonstrated an attacking bite that was absent in the first leg, while Liverpool endured a surprising period of sloppiness at La Ceramica. © Reuters Thiago Alcantara saw his effort in the 14th minute clip the bar but referee Danny Makkelie had already blown for a foul, and the official also waved away Villarreal penalty shouts when Alisson Becker collided with Giovani Lo Celso inside the area. Four minutes before the break, Villarreal's dominance turned into a two-goal lead through Coquelin, who caught Trent Alexander-Arnold unawares and headed home from Capoue's cross to level the tie on aggregate. Klopp responded to a disjointed and sloppy first half by bringing on Luis Diaz for Diogo Jota, and the Colombian attacker's introduction soon sparked new life into the Reds' XI. With 55 minutes gone, a long-range effort from Alexander-Arnold deflected off the knee of Coquelin onto the bar, and Thiago's effort following the corner fell kindly into the grasp of Geronimo Rulli. However, the Argentine goalkeeper - who was a shaky figure in the first leg - then allowed Fabinho's effort to trickle into the back of the net through his legs just after the hour mark as Liverpool took control of the tie again. The Merseyside giants retained possession much better in the second 45 and restored their two-goal aggregate lead not long after Fabinho's effort, as the effervescent Diaz was left in acres of space and had the easy task of heading home from Alexander-Arnold's cross. © Reuters Villarreal's defence simply stopped and watched Diaz ghost in and put Liverpool firmly in control, and the semi-final was dead and buried in the 74th minute following yet another mishap from Emery's goalkeeper. Rulli was caught in no man's land and lost out to Mane, who also dribbled his way past Juan Foyth and had the simple task of slotting home into an empty net to complete the Liverpool comeback. Substitute Curtis Jones very nearly got in on the act for Liverpool with 10 minutes to go, but Rulli got down well to save the midfielder's effort that time. Insult was soon added to injury for Villarreal as Capoue was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the Frenchman walked off to a standing ovation from the home crowd, who were in terrific voice all evening. Emery's men could not produce something spectacular in the final moments as Liverpool advanced to their 10th Champions League final to keep the quadruple dream alive. Either Real Madrid or Manchester City will now meet the Reds at the Stade de France on May 28, with Pep Guardiola's side travelling to the Santiago Bernabeu for Wednesday's battle with a 4-3 first-leg lead.

The report claims that the Gunners have been tracking Osimhen 'for many months', switching their attention to the Nigerian after missing out on a January deal for Dusan Vlahovic. The forward is allegedly 'aware' of interest from the Emirates Stadium, but Mikel Arteta's side will likely have to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League table in order to stand a chance of signing him. Arsenal are currently fourth in the table, two points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with four games left, as the North London rivals battle to secure a Champions League spot for next term. © Reuters Napoli are believed to be keen to keep hold of Osimhen but would consider offers in the region of £84m for a player that made the move to the Italian giants from Lille in June 2025. The Nigerian has scored 27 goals and registered nine assists in 59 appearances for his Serie A club in all competitions, following on from the 18 goals and six assists that he managed in 38 games for Lille. Osimhen scored four times and registered one assist in five Europa League appearances for Napoli this term, while he has struck 13 times and provided five assists in 24 Serie A outings. Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in the forward, although Los Blancos are prioritising a move for Kylian Mbappe, who is out of contract at Paris Saint-Germain next month. Arsenal, who have won their last three against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham United, will take on Leeds United, Tottenham, Newcastle United and Everton in their final four matches of the Premier League season, with a top-four spot in their hands.

The report adds that the former Germany boss has rebuffed offers from other clubs and nations as he holds out for the Real Madrid job, but he would expect a good degree of control over incomings and outgoings at the Bernabeu. Low departed his Germany post after Die Mannschaft's elimination in the last-16 of Euro 2020 to England, with the 62-year-old winning 125 of his 198 games in charge of the 2014 World Cup winners.

Alaba was withdrawn at half time of last week's first leg, the report claiming that a fibrillar rupture was the reason and what caused the Austria international to remain sidelined at the weekend.

David Alaba has been included in the squad, though, despite head coach Carlo Ancelotti claiming that the Austria international will not be involved due to a hamstring issue. ""I don't have any doubts. Alaba can't play,"" Ancelotti told reporters during his pre-match press conference. ""I don't have doubts, it will possibly be a long game too but it's not so important who starts as it is who finishes it. ""The defence system is the same. Alaba is an important player but Nacho's played very well this season. He's experienced and I'm sure he'll put on a good performance tomorrow."" © Reuters Despite seemingly being ruled out, the fact that Alaba has been named in the squad suggests that he could potentially be involved if required, but Nacho will start alongside Eder Militao in the middle of the defence. Mariano Diaz and Luka Jovic have both recently been on the sidelines with issues, but the pair are named in the squad and will provide back-up for Karim Benzema in the final third of the field. Marco Asensio and Rodrygo are also attacking options, but Federico Valverde is being tipped to start in a front three alongside Benzema and Vinicius Junior. Ancelotti has also confirmed that Casemiro, who was not involved in the first leg through injury, will start in the middle of midfield at Bernabeu. ""He'll help us a lot, his return is instrumental in our improvement defensively. Another thing we'll need is a collective commitment from everyone to move better, be more compact with one another. We have worked hard and long on our defence and hopefully will notice improvements tomorrow,"" said Ancelotti. © Reuters Real Madrid's team was much changed against Espanyol on Saturday with one eye on this match, but Los Blancos still managed to record a 4-0 victory to secure the title in style. Lucas Vazquez, Jesus Vallejo, Marcelo, Eduardo Camavinga, Dani Ceballos, Rodrygo, Mariano and Asensio are all expected to drop out of the starting side from the weekend fixture. Man City led 2-0, 3-1 and 4-2 in the first leg at Etihad Stadium, but Real Madrid answered back on each occasion to leave the tie delicately poised, with the English outfit holding a slender 4-3 advantage.

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23. The Dutchman has now made a total of 80 appearances in all competitions for the North London club, during which time he has scored eight goals and set up 10 more. In spite of his struggles at club level, Bergwijn came up with the goods for the Netherlands in March's international friendlies, bagging a brace against Denmark in a 4-2 win before also making the net ripple in a 1-1 draw with Germany.

Edinson Cavani is expected to leave as a free agent when his deal expires, and the 35-year-old is allegedly closing in on a return to South America with Boca Juniors. Meanwhile, Marcus Rashford's struggles for form and starts under Ralf Rangnick has seen the England international linked with a move elsewhere in the summer, but he could be handed a lifeline under new manager Erik ten Hag. Mason Greenwood remains suspended by the club following his arrest earlier in the year, but the Red Devils are due to welcome Martial back from his underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla this summer. © Reuters The 26-year-old's fortunes have not improved since he made the move to Julen Lopetegui's side on a temporary basis in the January window, registering just one goal and one assist in 11 games for the La Liga outfit. Martial also started a mere two Premier League games in the first half of the 2021-22 season, and he is expected to be one of the names on the chopping block amid reports of United readying a £12m payoff for the former Monaco man. However, Martial could now be used in a part-exchange deal for Martinez, according to Italian journalist Marco Barzaghi, who claims that the Red Devils are also willing to add £42m into the mix for the Argentine. After firing 17 goals and providing 10 assists in 38 Serie A matches en route to the Scudetto last season, Martinez has kept up his strong form under Simone Inzaghi with an identical number of strikes in 32 league matches so far this season. The 24-year-old has been persistently linked with moves to Barcelona, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur over the past couple of years but demonstrated his commitment to Inter by signing a new deal until 2026 back in the autumn. © Reuters Martinez and his representatives have always affirmed that the South American is happy with life at San Siro, and Barzaghi adds that Inter are not interested in welcoming Martial to the club this summer. Inzaghi's side would allegedly be open to a sale for straight cash given their recent financial turmoil, but Martinez's recent contract extension puts them in a strong position to demand a large fee. Furthermore, if Martinez was to head elsewhere in the summer transfer window, Manchester City and Liverpool are believed to be his favoured destinations rather than Old Trafford. Martinez's goal in Sunday's 2-1 victory over Udinese represented his 70th strike in 177 games for Inter since his 2018 arrival from Racing Club, with the reigning Italian champions two points adrift of AC Milan at the top of the standings with three games left to play. Martial, meanwhile, has scored 79 goals and set up 50 more in 269 games for Man United, but his existing contract at the Theatre of Dreams now has just over two years left to run.

Thirty-seven-year old Cristiano Ronaldo's contributions means that United are still in with a shot of the top four, though, with the Portuguese bagging 18 league goals in the current season.

Garnacho plied his trade in the Atletico Madrid youth ranks before making the switch to Man United in the summer of 2020, after which he scored seven goals in 17 league appearances for the Under-18s in his debut season. The 17-year-old's strong form continued with five goals and three assists in five FA Youth Cup appearances as the Red Devils' youngsters prepare to face Nottingham Forest in next week's final.

The 20-year-old has also been no stranger to strong showings in Europe with three goals and two assists from eight Champions League games this season, contributing against Lille, Wolfsburg and Sevilla. Adeyemi's existing contract with Salzburg only has two years left to run, and he is expected to seek pastures new at the end of the current season amid growing interest in his services. © Reuters Liverpool were strongly linked with a move for Adeyemi at one point, but it now appears that Borussia Dortmund have won the race for the German's signature as they prepare to wave goodbye to Erling Braut Haaland.

The Foxes were joint favourites for the competition with Napoli but both sit joint bottom of Group C with just a point after the Italian's 3-2 defeat to Spartak Moscow.  Leicester go to Moscow in October and Rodgers remains confident they can progress.  He told a press conference: ""It's very open, there are four games to go. Legia have made a good start but our aim is to qualify. We still have work to do.  ""We've got one point from two games but there is enough time to do that.  ""I'm disappointed with the result. We were too passive in the game in the first half. Then we had a couple of really good chances.  ""We didn't concede too much, we dominated the second half and were much more active. We had opportunities to get something from the game.  ""I've made the changes but it doesn't take away the importance from it. We have four more games to qualify. As a football club, we're new to the level.""  Rodgers made six changes from Saturday's 2-2 draw with Burnley with Jamie Vardy only coming off the bench for the final eight minutes.  Leicester's preparations started in embarrassing fashion when Kelechi Iheanacho was turned away by Polish border control because of problems with his travel documents on Wednesday.  It got worse as Emreli struck a first-half winner when he held off Daniel Amartey and drilled into the corner off the post.  Ayoze Perez dragged wide with just CezaryMiszta to beat as Leicester chased the game but they rarely looked like they had the energy and ingenuity to level.  The Foxes at least improved after the break and had plenty of possession but only Jannik Vestergaard's miscued header forced Miszta into action.  Indeed, Kasper Schmeichel needed to ensure Legia did not add a late second when he turned Lirim Kastrati's shot onto the post before Tomas Pekhart blazed over when the hosts caught Leicester on the break.  Emreli told uefa.com: ""My mum usually wants me to shoot as quickly as possible when I get the ball, so I don't think she will be fully satisfied because I kept the ball for some time.  ""We have six points after two games. You might think it's a dream, but it it's really happening.  ""There are no favourites anymore in football. Everything is in your head.

Said Benrahma grabbed a second in stoppage time to wrap up another victory.  It was a fitting result the day after West Ham unveiled a statue of Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore and Martin Peters – three of their 1965 European Cup Winners’ Cup-winning side who went on to lift the World Cup for England a year later – outside London Stadium.  Having defeated Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 in their Group H opener in Croatia two weeks ago, Moyes’ side are already in a strong position a third of the way through the stage.  The Hammers boss said: “The performance I wouldn’t put as high as some we’ve had this season, but we are still learning at this level. We did the job and we were worthy winners.  “It took a really well-worked goal and a good goal by Declan. He has stepped up, he has the ability to get forward and score goals and we are encouraging him to do that. It’s good that he’s got two in this competition already. West Ham United’s Said Benrahma (left) and Rapid Vienna’s Filip Stojkovic battle for the ball (Mike Egerton/PA) “He’s beginning to show a little bit more, I think he’s more than capable, and he’s got a great shot in him too. But overall he’s a really good, developing midfield player.”  It was a match West Ham were expected to win comfortably with their opponents struggling badly in the Austrian league this season, and both Rice and Craig Dawson hit the frame of the goal before they went ahead after half an hour.  Michail Antonio chested the ball down from Andriy Yarmolenko’s pass and raided down the left before crossing low for Rice, who had started the move on the halfway line before racing forward to tap into an empty net.  It was the first home goal for a West Ham player in Europe, qualifiers aside, since Frank Lampard wrapped up a 3-0 UEFA Cup win over Croatian side Osijek in 1999. Rapid Vienna fans take to the pitch to try to reach West Ham United fans during the match (Mike Egerton/PA) Sadly the goal prompted some rival fans, who had been throwing plastic bottles and winding each other up non-stop, to try to get to each other with police and stewards having to intervene.  That flare-up was quickly dealt with, although there was further trouble at the end, and even an altercation between supporter liaison staff from both clubs in the bowels of the stadium, with Rapid’s eventually being led off the premises.  Moyes added: “Look, we want to be a club playing regularly in Europe and we want to behave correctly.  “I don’t know who started it but we don’t want that reputation, we want to be seen as a club who can travel to Europe and everybody welcomes us. I was aware of some things being thrown.” A West Ham fan in the stands shouts at opposition fans after the final whistle (Mike Egerton/PA) West Ham had a let-off in the second half when German referee Tobias Stieler gave a penalty after Rapid sub Marco Grull went down under a non-challenge from Ben Johnson, with VAR correctly overturning the decision.  And Benrahma made sure it was goodnight Vienna when he cut inside and curled in the second in stoppage time.

Despite both teams sloppily gifting possession away in the opening exchanges, Arsenal made the breakthrough as Holding - deputising for the injured Ben White - headed home his first Premier League goal from Bukayo Saka's corner. However, Jarrod Bowen's deflected finish off the leg of Gabriel Magalhaes ensured that David Moyes's side would restore parity before half time, but the Brazilian defender soon went from zero to hero for Arsenal.

""In England you say 'win ugly', I think from my point of view today we won ugly, and I'm extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and show the character that they showed today,"" the Spaniard added. ""It's a massive win, under very difficult circumstances because we put ourselves in real problems, especially with our decision-making and in ball possessions, and the spaces we were attacking, and the timing of it and the efficiency of it. But the team showed huge character, not to give up, to continue trying to do the right things."" © Reuters The Gunners were dealt an early blow before the game as White missed out due to hamstring tightness, while Saka and Takehiro Tomiyasu both made the first XI - the latter starting for the first time since New Year's Day in the Premier League. Fears of further injuries were raised when the pair trudged off the field in the second half, but Arteta sought to alleviate any fears of long-term issues for the duo. ""Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to access him in the next few days to see how he is,"" Arteta told reporters. ""Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu is just that he had been out for so long and could not continue. Hopefully he's fine.""

It's crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that's play football."" Rice, who is also now a vital player for England, has netted once and provided four assists in 33 Premier League appearances for David Moyes's side during the 2021-22 campaign. © Reuters The midfielder has also played a leading role in West Ham's run to the semi-finals of the Europa League, scoring three times in nine appearances, and the Hammers will head to Eintracht Frankfurt later this week for the second leg of their semi-final. Manchester City and Liverpool have also been credited with an interest in Rice, who has scored 10 times and registered nine assists in 191 appearances for Moyes's side in all competitions. West Ham could ultimately price the midfielder out of a summer exit, though, with Man United already believed to be looking at cheaper alternatives to the former Chelsea youngster. The Red Devils will sign at least one new central midfielder this summer, as both Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba are preparing to leave the club in search of pastures new.

The report claims that the Portugal international is regarded as the ""ideal element"" to strengthen the Premier League side in that area of the pitch. Furthermore, it is claimed that an effort to sign the 26-year-old, who can also play at centre-back, will be launched before the end of May. Palhinha, who has also been linked with Wolverhampton Wanderers, has made 31 starts and five substitute appearances in all competitions this season.  ",positive

Modric is currently due to become a free agent at the end of the current season, but Los Blancos have always been expected to tie the Ballon d'Or winner down for at least one more year. Now, AS reports that Modric has now agreed to remain at the Bernabeu for at least another 12 months, and there is an option to extend his stay until 2024 based on his performances. The report adds that Modric could be offered a role in the management team at Real Madrid once he hangs up his boots, as he intends to end his playing days in the Spanish capital. Modric has now registered 31 goals and 70 assists in 430 appearances during his 10-year spell at Real, winning four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles and one Copa del Rey since arriving from Tottenham Hotspur.

Ten Hag, who will finish the season at Ajax before officially taking charge of Man United, is likely to be handed a healthy transfer budget this summer to improve the squad. Midfield is believed to be a priority area for the Dutchman, and according to The Sun, Ward-Prowse is wanted by the new manager in a £75m deal. The report, though, claims that Manchester City are also keen on the England international, so there could be a tug-of-war between the two Manchester giants in the upcoming market. © Reuters Declan Rice continues to be strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford, but West Ham United are believed to want £150m for the England international, which will likely price him out of a summer exit. The report claims that Man United, who are next in league action against Brentford on Monday night, want Ward-Prowse to play in a defensive midfield role next term. The 27-year-old has enjoyed an impressive campaign for Southampton, scoring 10 times and providing eight assists in 39 appearances in all competitions. Ward-Prowse only signed a new long-term deal at St Mary's last August, though, and with his current terms not due to expire until June 2026, the Saints are in a strong position to demand a high transfer fee. The midfielder has been with Southampton since the age of eight, progressing through the various youth teams before making his first-team debut in 2011. Ward-Prowse has since represented their first team on 361 occasions in all competitions, contributing 43 goals and 48 assists in the process.  Man City boss Pep Guardiola called the midfielder ""the best free-kick taker I have ever seen"" earlier this year, and the Citizens are in the market for a replacement for Fernandinho, which could lead to them targeting the Southampton academy product. Ten Hag is also believed to be keen to sign a new centre-back and two attackers during this summer's transfer window, but the club will almost certainly not be able to offer Champions League football to possible acquisitions next term. The Red Devils are currently down in sixth position in the Premier League table, five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand. Battling to secure a Europa League spot for next term, Man United will finish their 2021-22 league campaign with matches against Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace. The club's attention has already switched to next season, though, and Ten Hag will be tasked with improving a team that has lost 10 of their 35 league games this term, recording only 15 wins in the process.

According to El Nacional, Toni Kroos falls very much into that category after struggling at times this campaign, arguably producing performances which have sometimes undermined Real's other work. The report suggests that Perez wants to freshen up that area of the pitch and squad in general, resulting in his pursuit of Pogba and Tchouameni. Pogba will almost certainly be departing Old Trafford at the end of his contract in the summer, although there is known to be rival interest from Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain.

Ronaldo has 17 Premier League goals to his name this term, meanwhile, despite his team's struggles for much of the campaign. The Portugal international has a contract at Old Trafford until June 2023, with the option of a further year, but there remains widespread speculation surrounding his future, with Erik ten Hag's plans for the attacker unclear. Ten Hag is believed to be keen to sign a couple of forwards this summer, with Edinson Cavani on his way out, and the futures of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial up in the air. © Reuters Ronaldo might have to accept a rotational role at Man United next season in order to stay, and there have been claims that he could seek a move away, with the club unlikely to be in the Champions League unless something incredible happens in the final weeks of the campaign. According to The Mirror, Real Madrid are interested in re-signing the Portuguese, who became the club's all-time record goalscorer during his nine years at Bernabeu. The 37-year-old netted 450 goals and registered 132 assists in 438 appearances for Real Madrid before leaving to join Juventus, where he managed another 101 goals in 134 outings ahead of a sensational return to Man United last summer. The report claims that Los Blancos would only have to pay in the region of £10m to re-sign the Portuguese, who is believed to be open to moving back to Madrid at this stage of his career. Kylian Mbappe remains a leading target for Carlo Ancelotti's team, but Paris Saint-Germain are working to convince the France international to pen a new deal at the club. © Reuters Senior figures at Real Madrid allegedly believe that Ronaldo's guarantee of goals could help the club secure more silverware next season, and the Portuguese is believed to be keen to play into his 40s. Los Blancos secured this season's La Liga title with four matches to spare by thrashing Espanyol 4-0 on Saturday, and they will now switch their attention to the Champions League, preparing to face Manchester City in the second leg of their semi-final next week. Man United, on the other hand, are sixth in the Premier League table and facing Europa League football next term, having struggled for form during the 2021-22 campaign.

Romano claims that Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen is heading for Camp Nou on a free transfer this summer, while a breakthrough has been reached in contract discussions with Ronald Araujo, who is now preparing to sign a new deal. As a result, Barcelona will not be looking to bring another centre-back to the club despite being admirers of Rudiger. The 29-year-old is still currently unable to sign a new deal with Chelsea due to the sanctions placed on the English club's owner Roman Abramovich.

Chelsea have led the way, spending more than £200million in recent months, but United's only capture, to the chagrin of their army of supporters, has been Dutch midfielder Donny Van De Beek from Ajax. Edinson Cavani is highly likely to bolster Manchester United's forward line (Andrew Milligan/PA) Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has once again had to bear the brunt of criticism with United so far unable to strike deals for forward pair Jadon Sancho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona respectively.  Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.  United are highly likely to strengthen their forward line with the capture of veteran Uruguayan Edinson Cavani following his release by Paris St Germain, but other areas of concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may go unaddressed.  They had been linked with Gareth Bale before he ultimately plumped for a return to Spurs, where Alli seems to be surplus to requirements having not played in the top flight since their season-opening defeat to Everton.

Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.  Merseyside rivals Everton are bracing themselves for bids for Moise Kean, allegedly attracting interest from PSG and former club Juventus, but his departure could pave the way for Arkadiusz Milik to join the Toffees from Napoli.

Liverpool will also face Chelsea in the FA Cup final later this month, while they boast a 2-0 advantage over Villarreal heading into the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night. No English team has ever reached May 2 while still being in contention for four trophies, with Liverpool having now surpassed the previous record held by Chelsea. © Reuters The Blues made it to May 1 in the 2006-07 campaign, only to lose to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final to end their hopes of a clean sweep. Liverpool's charge will last until at least May 3, when they face Villarreal, and they are firm favourites to make it into a third Champions League final in five seasons. The latest Liverpool have previously been in the hunt for a quadruple in their 24 past attempts was February 20 in 1982-83, when they ended the season with the league title and League Cup. A quadruple has only been possible in England since the League Cup was introduced in 1960-61, with 15 different clubs having had the opportunity to achieve it during that time. In all, there have been 120 attempts at achieving the recognised quadruple, which involves a club winning the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League. As well as Liverpool this season and Chelsea in 2006-07, only three other clubs have ever made it beyond the end of March while still in contention for all four trophies. © Reuters Manchester United made it to April 19 in 2008-09, with their charge ending with defeat in the FA Cup semi-final that year. Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have twice seen their hopes end on April 17, meanwhile, losing in the Champions League quarter-final in 2018-19 and the FA Cup semi-final in 2020-21. Man City's class of 2018-19 are the only one of those sides to go on to scoop three trophies from that position, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup. The last European team to achieve a quadruple of their domestic title, two major domestic cups and the Champions League was Celtic in 1966-67, although that excludes clubs playing in a country without two domestic cups available to them. Liverpool would need to play seven more games in order to complete the first quadruple in English football history, starting with Tuesday's Champions League showdown against Villarreal and ending with a potential final against either Manchester City or Real Madrid.

Forest, who fielded seven young academy products in their side, saw Francisco Trincao and Morgan Gibbs-White put a cruel gloss on the final score, with goals in the 86th and 88th minute.  Following Premier League defeats to Leicester and Tottenham, it was Lage's first win since he took charge in the summer.  ""The dynamic pleased me. You need time to create the dynamic.

""You want to be patient, but not too much. You do not want to confuse that with moving the ball slowly. That is what I said at half-time. We needed more tempo.

""As soon as we saw their line-up, we knew it was going to be a tough night.  ""We had to rely on Ethan Horvath to make some excellent saves. Two of the goals were quite soft and, without those, it would have been a credible result for a side that included seven academy lads.  ""We were surprised at how strong the Wolves side was. It could have been a really hard night for these really young lads, but they acquitted themselves really well.  ""We held them for an hour.

As for Nottingham Forest, their woeful start to the season continued. They suffered their fourth successive defeat and are yet to pick up a point in the Sky Bet Championship this season. They sit rock bottom of the table.  O’Neill said: “We had to be patient. I thought we played well in the first half without creating as much as we could have done. The opposition defended well, defended deep. We had a lot to break down, but we were patient.  “The game naturally opens up a bit in the second half and I thought it was a terrific goal to win the game.  “We demonstrated that patience in our play. We didn’t get in a habit of throwing the ball forward quickly and we didn’t turn the game into a second-ball game. We were patient with our play and built the game well. There were some great performances.  “The two wing-backs have had really strong starts to the season, there’s no doubt about that. In that position and to be able to arrive at that moment and chip in with a goal is important. I think what’s pleasing is that both wing-backs are high at the same time and getting involved in the build-up,” the Stoke boss said.  “Tommy (Smith) has had a lot of influence on that side and combined well. What you need is a little bit of quality just at the right moment and I think Mario (Vrancic) provides that.  “Some of our moves in the game we were unlucky but it’s great to win the game like that and with a clean sheet,” he added.  “Josh (Tymon) is one I’m delighted to see him playing the way he is now. He was a boy that I felt was not in a great place, he had a difficult time – probably with the change of managers at the club.  “He was brought here as a young player when we were in the Premier League and had a lot of potential. He never lost what he had. What he has got now is his confidence and his belief has grown.  “We lost a goal against Swansea, we switched off when we were 3-0 ahead in the game and it would have been nice to get three or four clean sheets. But more importantly, when you have one, it’s important to go for the win.  “I always felt we had the capability to score. I felt in the second half there was relentless pressure, and we were camped in around the Forest goal and that showed real belief in how we are playing, then we eventually got the breakthrough.  “There’s a lot for us to be positive about, all the players we have brought to the club have been the right type. It looks like a happy squad. We’ve been delighted with the response after a very good pre-season.”  Forest boss Chris Hughton admitted his side are going through a “difficult” period but insists he understands the anger of the fans.  “What I think about is… we are going through a transitional period at the club,” he said. “We’ve had a pre-season where we’ve had most of the under-23s training with the squad, we’ve had injuries.  “We are going through a difficult period. It’s a transitional period.  “With this group, however we recruit, it will be a younger, development side.  “Around those changes, what I have to try to do is get results. At the minute, this is the only thing I’m thinking about.  “I understand the disappointment of the crowd. I’m as disappointed and as angry as any of them. This is my responsibility.  “My responsibility is to get results for this club and these supporters.  “With the help of recruitment, we’ll do the best we can.”   ",positive

Gnabry only has little over a year left to run on his contract with Bayern, though, and there has been a host of speculation surrounding his future over the last few months. Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with the Germany international, while Arsenal are also believed to be considering making an attempt to bring him back to the club. According to Bild, Bayern have offered the attacker the chance to double his salary to a figure in the region of £14m. The proposed new deal would place the German alongside Kingsley Coman and Leroy Sane in terms of the highest earners at Allianz Arena, but Gnabry allegedly does not view the wage packet as a priority. © Reuters The report claims that the forward does not currently feel valued by Bayern and is unsure whether he will be a key player for the club moving forward. Gnabry initially joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in 2011 but failed to become a first-team regular for the club, only making 18 appearances in all competitions before leaving for Werder Bremen. An impressive spell in Bremen led to Bayern signing him in 2017, and he has scored 63 goals and registered 40 assists in 169 appearances for the Munich giants during a successful spell. Arsenal could reportedly press ahead with a move for Gnabry if they manage to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League, which would bring Champions League football for next season.

Spurs are also said to be admirers of Gnabry, with a recent report claiming that the club were planning to make an approach during this summer's transfer window. Arsenal and Tottenham are currently battling for fourth spot in the Premier League table, with the former two points ahead of their capital rivals on the same number of games (33).

There is understood to be interest from clubs in Germany and France, although Ten Hag's possible arrival at Old Trafford could see Manchester United jump to the front of the queue. Ten Hag was in the stadium to watch Bergwijn score three times for Netherlands in games against Denmark and Germany during the recent international break, and has reportedly tried to sign him for Ajax in each of the last three transfer windows. Bergwijn recently hinted that he will assess his future in the summer due to a lack of playing time at Spurs. Ten Hag, meanwhile, is thought to want to bring the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice to Old Trafford should he take over, while coaches such as Robin van Persie, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag are among those to have been linked with a backroom role under the 52-year-old. Bergwijn has featured 27 times in all competitions for Spurs this season, including 20 in the Premier League, but only four of those league appearances have been from the start. Since joining Spurs from PSV in January 2020, he has scored eight goals and created 10 more in 78 appearances.  ",negative

""It's always better to make sure they're right. We'd only put players out if they'd trained and we thought they were fit and ready to play,"" the Scotsman added. ""I won't rush anybody back. We could do with some central defenders getting fit, but unfortunately that's the way it's been and we have to live with it. We're needing all hands on deck.

We could do with some players back, we've been quite short, but great credit to the players for how they've done to get to this stage.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Van Bronckhorst insisted that his side are capable of causing problems in the final third without Morelos – who is sidelined for the rest of the season after undergoing thigh surgery – and he believes that the Gers need to find 'another way' to score goals in the Colombian's absence. ""Yes, (we can cope without Morelos) well, we have to,"" the Dutchman said. ""We know that he is out for the remainder of the season. You have to do it another way. We have a big squad, with maybe other qualities than Morelos. We have to go with the squad we have now."" Van Bronckhorst was also questioned about Aaron Ramsey, who was dropped to the substitutes' bench after scoring in the Old Firm derby last weekend, and although the Welshman did not feature in Portugal, the Rangers boss revealed that it was a tactical decision not to call upon the midfielder.

Hopefully we can take it into the weekend.  “It was nice to come off the bench and score a few goals.”  Although Spurs were in early command, Mura, who were only formed in 2012, got back into the game after Ziga Kous scored the goal of his life and Spurs were looking fragile against the lowest ranked team in the competition.
