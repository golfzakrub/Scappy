Jota netted his 12th strike of the campaign in the 1-1 draw at home against Old Firm rivals Rangers last weekend. According to journalist Barry Anderson, Celtic are expected to activate the £6.3m buyout clause in Jota's deal, which will see the attacker move to Parkhead permanently this summer. The Portugal Under-21 international is understood to have informed his parent club Benfica that he wishes to remain in Glasgow and commit his future to Celtic. The prospect of playing Champions League football with Celtic next season is likely to have been a factor in Jota's decision, with the Hoops currently sitting six points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership with just three games remaining. Celtic are also understood to be working on a deal to recruit centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers on a permanent deal, and talks with Tottenham Hotspur are believed to be at an advanced stage.

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23. The Dutchman has now made a total of 80 appearances in all competitions for the North London club, during which time he has scored eight goals and set up 10 more. In spite of his struggles at club level, Bergwijn came up with the goods for the Netherlands in March's international friendlies, bagging a brace against Denmark in a 4-2 win before also making the net ripple in a 1-1 draw with Germany. The three-time Eredivisie champion remains under contract at Tottenham until the end of the 2024-25 campaign, and the Lilywhites may allegedly be prepared to consider offers of around £15m for the out-of-favour attacker this summer.

However, according to reports in Spain, the newly-crowned La Liga champions are given consideration to extending the Brazilian's deal by another 12 months. Although Marcelo is now very much second-choice behind Ferland Mendy, he is said to have told club officials of his preference to stay at Real.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Rangnick said: ""So far we haven't been able to speak. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man United back to where we need to be.

Lage's side were at one point challenging for an unlikely Champions League berth, but a drop-off in form has left them outside of the European places in eighth position - three points adrift of West Ham United with a game in hand. Neves now only has two years left on his contract with the Molineux side, and failure to secure a continental spot for the 2022-23 season could tempt the Portugal international into a move elsewhere. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with a swoop for Neves, with the Red Devils understood to have recently sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Wolves. Despite the impending arrival of Franck Kessie from AC Milan on a free transfer, Barcelona are also thought to be keen to bring Neves to Catalonia as part of their summer overhaul. © Reuters While Lage has admitted that it may be difficult for Wolves to keep hold of Neves this summer, the Portuguese has insisted that the midfielder is worth at least £100m in the upcoming market. ""These days we need to be ready for everything. A player like this has a value of £100m. Anything can happen, not just with Ruben. If we want to improve we need the best guys at the best price,"" Lage told reporters at a press conference last week. As a result, Sport claims that Barcelona will therefore be priced out of a move for Neves, who they had initially identified as an ideal long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets. Busquets will celebrate his 34th birthday in July and still has one more year to run on his deal with the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are understandably planning for life without the Spaniard. The report adds that Barcelona are not closing the door on a move for Neves fully, with Wolves unable to play hardball in negotiations should the Portuguese continue to wind his contract down. Neves allegedly dreams of pulling on the Barcelona shirt, meanwhile, and agent Jorge Mendes's strong working relationship with the Catalan side could ultimately aid a bid for the former Porto youngster. © Reuters Neves arrived at Wolves in the summer of 2017 after rising through the ranks in Porto's youth system and immediately helped the club achieve promotion to the Premier League with six goals in 42 Championship matches in 2017-18. The lynchpin has gone on to make 208 appearances for the Molineux outfit in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 12 assists in that spell. Fifteen of those goals and eight assists have come in 138 Premier League appearances, and he has made the starting lineup on 27 occasions in the top flight this season. Neves had missed the start of April due to a knee injury but was fit enough to play the first 45 minutes of the weekend's 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion - Wolves' fourth defeat in five Premier League games.

Postecoglou revealed in January that he is keen to see Carter-Vickers move to Parkhead permanently and suggested that Celtic recruited the centre-back with a long-term plan in mind.

Nkunku has starred for Leipzig during the 2021-22 campaign, scoring 30 goals and registering 20 assists in 47 appearances in all competitions. Man United continue to be strongly linked with the France international, with Ralf Rangnick believed to have recommended that the club sign him during this summer's transfer window. Rangnick will continue to lead the Red Devils on an interim basis for the remainder of the season before taking on a consultancy role, where he will be involved in recruitment. © Reuters However, according to Calciomercato, Man United will have strong competition from Milan for the signature of Nkunku in the upcoming market. The report claims that the attacker's agent Pini Zahavi is already working on an exit for his client this summer, and there are a number of clubs believed to be keen on his signature. The Serie A giants would have a significant budget this summer if their proposed Bahraini takeover is completed, with the club potentially spending as much as €300m (£249m) ahead of next season. Arsenal and Inter Milan have also been credited with an interest in Nkunku, who is capable of operating in a number of different positions in the final third of the field. Offers in the region of £52m would allegedly be considered by Leipzig, but Man United could potentially miss out on the chance to sign him, as they will almost certainly not be able to offer Champions League football during the 2022-23 campaign. © Reuters Nkunku has starred in the Bundesliga this season, scoring 17 goals and registering 15 assists in 31 appearances, while he netted seven times and provided two assists in six appearances in the group stage of the Champions League. The Frenchman has operated in a number of different positions for his German club this term, featuring off both the left and the right, in addition to playing through the middle. Nkunku only has little over two years left to run on his contract at Leipzig, meaning that the Bundesliga side are not in a strong position when it comes to his future, unless they can convince him to sign an extension. Man United interim head coach Ralf Rangnick recently said that two new forwards could arrive at Old Trafford during this summer's transfer window.

Said Benrahma grabbed a second in stoppage time to wrap up another victory.  It was a fitting result the day after West Ham unveiled a statue of Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore and Martin Peters – three of their 1965 European Cup Winners’ Cup-winning side who went on to lift the World Cup for England a year later – outside London Stadium.  Having defeated Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 in their Group H opener in Croatia two weeks ago, Moyes’ side are already in a strong position a third of the way through the stage.  The Hammers boss said: “The performance I wouldn’t put as high as some we’ve had this season, but we are still learning at this level. We did the job and we were worthy winners.  “It took a really well-worked goal and a good goal by Declan. He has stepped up, he has the ability to get forward and score goals and we are encouraging him to do that. It’s good that he’s got two in this competition already. West Ham United’s Said Benrahma (left) and Rapid Vienna’s Filip Stojkovic battle for the ball (Mike Egerton/PA) “He’s beginning to show a little bit more, I think he’s more than capable, and he’s got a great shot in him too. But overall he’s a really good, developing midfield player.”  It was a match West Ham were expected to win comfortably with their opponents struggling badly in the Austrian league this season, and both Rice and Craig Dawson hit the frame of the goal before they went ahead after half an hour.  Michail Antonio chested the ball down from Andriy Yarmolenko’s pass and raided down the left before crossing low for Rice, who had started the move on the halfway line before racing forward to tap into an empty net.  It was the first home goal for a West Ham player in Europe, qualifiers aside, since Frank Lampard wrapped up a 3-0 UEFA Cup win over Croatian side Osijek in 1999. Rapid Vienna fans take to the pitch to try to reach West Ham United fans during the match (Mike Egerton/PA) Sadly the goal prompted some rival fans, who had been throwing plastic bottles and winding each other up non-stop, to try to get to each other with police and stewards having to intervene.  That flare-up was quickly dealt with, although there was further trouble at the end, and even an altercation between supporter liaison staff from both clubs in the bowels of the stadium, with Rapid’s eventually being led off the premises.  Moyes added: “Look, we want to be a club playing regularly in Europe and we want to behave correctly.  “I don’t know who started it but we don’t want that reputation, we want to be seen as a club who can travel to Europe and everybody welcomes us. I was aware of some things being thrown.” A West Ham fan in the stands shouts at opposition fans after the final whistle (Mike Egerton/PA) West Ham had a let-off in the second half when German referee Tobias Stieler gave a penalty after Rapid sub Marco Grull went down under a non-challenge from Ben Johnson, with VAR correctly overturning the decision.  And Benrahma made sure it was goodnight Vienna when he cut inside and curled in the second in stoppage time.

Despite both teams sloppily gifting possession away in the opening exchanges, Arsenal made the breakthrough as Holding - deputising for the injured Ben White - headed home his first Premier League goal from Bukayo Saka's corner. However, Jarrod Bowen's deflected finish off the leg of Gabriel Magalhaes ensured that David Moyes's side would restore parity before half time, but the Brazilian defender soon went from zero to hero for Arsenal. Gabriel Martinelli's cross to the back stick met the head of an unmarked Gabriel, whose header proved too powerful for ex-Arsenal man Lukasz Fabianski to keep out in a 2-1 success for the North London club. © Reuters Arsenal have now maintained their two-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur with only four games left to play this season, and Arteta made sure Holding's contribution did not go unnoticed. ""I said to you guys, to good people, to good things happen and Rob is another great example, but now when he plays well to give him credit, especially when he doesn't play, the way he trains, the way he is amongst the team, he's just a phenomenal person and player to have around the team and today, when you ask him to come he's always ready to do something,"" Arteta said during his post-match press conference. ""Rob Holding is really good being Rob Holding and he needs to be really happy with what he's done today for the team."" Arsenal were far from their best throughout the contest at the London Stadium, but Arteta was pleased to see his side's character come to the fore in an ""ugly"" derby victory. ""In England you say 'win ugly', I think from my point of view today we won ugly, and I'm extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and show the character that they showed today,"" the Spaniard added. ""It's a massive win, under very difficult circumstances because we put ourselves in real problems, especially with our decision-making and in ball possessions, and the spaces we were attacking, and the timing of it and the efficiency of it. But the team showed huge character, not to give up, to continue trying to do the right things."" © Reuters The Gunners were dealt an early blow before the game as White missed out due to hamstring tightness, while Saka and Takehiro Tomiyasu both made the first XI - the latter starting for the first time since New Year's Day in the Premier League. Fears of further injuries were raised when the pair trudged off the field in the second half, but Arteta sought to alleviate any fears of long-term issues for the duo. ""Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to access him in the next few days to see how he is,"" Arteta told reporters. ""Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu is just that he had been out for so long and could not continue. Hopefully he's fine.""

Reports have suggested that an agreement has now been reached for the Dutchman to sign a four-year deal with Man United, while current boss Rangnick moves up into an advisory role. Confirmation of Ten Hag's appointment could allegedly arrive soon after Ajax's KNVB-Beker game against PSV Eindhoven on Sunday, and speculation has already started swirling regarding possible coaching appointments and signings early in his reign. The Daily Mail claims that Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn is one of the players on his radar, having held a long-standing interest in the 24-year-old. Ten Hag attempted to sign Bergwijn for Ajax during the January transfer window, only for Spurs to block the deal in the hope that the Netherlands international would help to secure Champions League qualification this season. However, the winger has since started just one Premier League game, falling behind January arrival Dejan Kulusevski in the pecking order courtesy of the Juventus loanee's prolific partnership with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The report claims that Tottenham would now be willing to let Bergwijn leave the club this summer, but only if their £20m asking price is met. There is understood to be interest from clubs in Germany and France, although Ten Hag's possible arrival at Old Trafford could see Manchester United jump to the front of the queue. Ten Hag was in the stadium to watch Bergwijn score three times for Netherlands in games against Denmark and Germany during the recent international break, and has reportedly tried to sign him for Ajax in each of the last three transfer windows. Bergwijn recently hinted that he will assess his future in the summer due to a lack of playing time at Spurs. Ten Hag, meanwhile, is thought to want to bring the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice to Old Trafford should he take over, while coaches such as Robin van Persie, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag are among those to have been linked with a backroom role under the 52-year-old. Bergwijn has featured 27 times in all competitions for Spurs this season, including 20 in the Premier League, but only four of those league appearances have been from the start. Since joining Spurs from PSV in January 2020, he has scored eight goals and created 10 more in 78 appearances.  ",negative

According to Calciomercato, Spurs are now prepared to entertain offers in the region of €18m (£15.02m) with Kulusevski expected to join on a permanent basis in the future.

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23.

However, according to Calciomercato, Juventus are also working on a deal for the South American, with the Old Lady determined to beat the 20-time English champions to his signature. Antony has been a key player for Ajax in the Eredivisie this term, scoring eight times and providing four assists in 23 appearances. © Reuters The forward also starred in the Champions League, scoring twice and providing four assists in seven appearances, and he has now represented the Dutch outfit on 79 occasions since arriving from Sao Paulo, scoring 22 goals and providing 20 assists in the process. Ajax will be reluctant to lose the Brazilian during this summer's transfer window, and he still has more than three years left to run on his contract in Amsterdam. However, the Dutch outfit are not in a position to reject a high offer for the attacker, with a recent report claiming that a bid in the region of £50m would be seriously considered. Ten Hag could potentially be handed as much as £200m to improve the Man United squad during this summer's transfer window, while the budget could be boosted by a number of outgoings.

The forward has been absent from Ajax's last four league games due to an ankle problem, and he is facing a battle to return before the end of the campaign. Antony has won the Eredivisie title and KNVB Cup since arriving in Amsterdam, and Ten Hag's side are currently seven points clear of second-placed PSV Eindhoven at the top of the Dutch league. Man United are unlikely to be able to offer Champions League football during the 2021-22 campaign, though, as they currently sit sixth in the Premier League table entering the final straight.

Gnabry only has little over a year left to run on his contract with Bayern, though, and there has been a host of speculation surrounding his future over the last few months. Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with the Germany international, while Arsenal are also believed to be considering making an attempt to bring him back to the club. According to Bild, Bayern have offered the attacker the chance to double his salary to a figure in the region of £14m. The proposed new deal would place the German alongside Kingsley Coman and Leroy Sane in terms of the highest earners at Allianz Arena, but Gnabry allegedly does not view the wage packet as a priority. © Reuters The report claims that the forward does not currently feel valued by Bayern and is unsure whether he will be a key player for the club moving forward. Gnabry initially joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in 2011 but failed to become a first-team regular for the club, only making 18 appearances in all competitions before leaving for Werder Bremen. An impressive spell in Bremen led to Bayern signing him in 2017, and he has scored 63 goals and registered 40 assists in 169 appearances for the Munich giants during a successful spell. Arsenal could reportedly press ahead with a move for Gnabry if they manage to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League, which would bring Champions League football for next season. The Gunners are believed to be preparing a busy summer window, with a deal for Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus already allegedly agreed, as both Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette could leave on free transfers, while the futures of a number of other players are in question. © Reuters Tottenham boss Antonio Conte, meanwhile, has reportedly told the North London club that he needs six new players during this summer's transfer window in order to compete next term. Spurs are also said to be admirers of Gnabry, with a recent report claiming that the club were planning to make an approach during this summer's transfer window. Arsenal and Tottenham are currently battling for fourth spot in the Premier League table, with the former two points ahead of their capital rivals on the same number of games (33). Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Gnabry, although the Spanish giants are thought to have other priorities, including Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe.  ",negative

Mbappe is therefore still set to leave as a free agent when his contract runs out at the end of the season, with Real Madrid still being persistently linked with a summer swoop for the World Cup winner. However, there is now understood to be more optimism about the prospect of Mbappe penning fresh terms with the Ligue 1 champions following talks between the club and the player's family. When asked during a press conference how confident he was about the club's chances of keeping Mbappe at this moment in time, Pochettino responded ""100%"", but the Argentine took those words back following his side's 3-3 draw with Strasbourg on Friday night, as well as a similar comment that he made regarding his own future at the club. © Reuters ""I'm very tired because it's hard to explain, but I tried. I only answered the question I was asked: 'Today, what percentage is there?' 'For me, 100 percent. Kylian too,' I said,"" Pochettino told Amazon Prime Video. ""I don't understand why this was taken out of context. I'm very tired, but I'm strong and I don't care about rumours. I'm focused on football, on my players. We continue to do our job. ""That's the problem. We are here to work for the club, to give our best, and there is a lack of respect all the time.

The ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager was considered one of the frontrunners for the Manchester United job before the appointment of Erik ten Hag, although a recent report claimed that the French champions are indeed planning to part ways with Pochettino. © Reuters Current Spurs boss Antonio Conte has been tipped to take over at PSG should Pochettino depart as expected, but the Italian recently dismissed such links as ""fake news"" and ""lies"". Meanwhile, Mbappe is not expected to make a decision on his future until the end of the 2021-22 campaign, during which he has already bagged a staggering 35 goals and 23 assists in 43 matches across all tournaments. Twenty-four of Mbappe's goals and 16 of his assists have come in 32 Ligue 1 matches for the newly-crowned champions, as he scored two and set up Achraf Hakimi but could not prevent PSG from giving up a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with Strasbourg on Friday. Mbappe unsurprisingly leads the way in both goals and assists in Ligue 1, with his 24 strikes three clear of closest challengers Wissam Ben Yedder and Martin Terrier, while teammate Lionel Messi is closest behind in assists with 13. The 2021-22 Ligue 1 title represents Mbappe's 12th major honour with Les Parisiens since his initial loan move from Monaco, with the striker picking up four Ligue 1 crowns, a trio of Coupe de France and French Super Cup crowns, as well as two French League Cups. Should Mbappe complete a free transfer away from the Parc des Princes alongside Angel Di Maria, PSG have reportedly offered a big-money deal to Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, who will also become a free agent in July.

Edinson Cavani is highly likely to bolster Manchester United's forward line (Andrew Milligan/PA) Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has once again had to bear the brunt of criticism with United so far unable to strike deals for forward pair Jadon Sancho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona respectively.  Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.

Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.

Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Hector Bellerin, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Pablo Mari could also head elsewhere following the completion of their loan deals, but William Saliba is understood to have decided against a permanent move to Marseille as he fights for his spot in the defence alongside Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal could temporarily drop out of the top four if Tottenham get the better of Leicester City on Sunday but will attempt to usurp their North London rivals when they meet West Ham United later in the day.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had recently suggested that the Ghanaian's involvement this season was over as a result of the injury, before suggesting in recent days that his midfielder was progressing well in his recovery. Following Arsenal's 2-1 win at West Ham United on Sunday, the North London club posted a video of Gabriel's goal scored at the London Stadium on its official Twitter account. Partey then responded to the tweet on Monday with: ""Tom X Tom soon,"" with this possibly suggesting a link up with Arsenal full-back Takehiro Tomiyasu again in the coming weeks. Should Partey have made a quicker recovery than expected, he could feature in Arsenal's next game against Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with the Gunners leading Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in the race for the Premier League top four as things stand. The former Atletico Madrid midfielder faces competition for his place in the starting lineup however, with Mohamed Elneny impressing in his place alongside Granit Xhaka at the base of the midfield.
