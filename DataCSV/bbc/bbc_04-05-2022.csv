The Reds had comfortably won 2-0 in the first leg but that advantage was wiped out after only 41 minutes at a noisy and passionate El Madrigal as the Spanish side pushed for a huge upset. Boulaye Dia scored Villarreal's first after only three minutes, converting Etienne Capoue's pass, before ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin headed in a second from another Capoue cross as the Reds looked rattled. Liverpool had to improve in the second half and Fabinho put them back in front on aggregate with a shot that went through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 62nd minute. Luis Diaz, whose introduction at half time changed the game after he replaced Diogo Jota, restored Liverpool's two-goal aggregate advantage with a header at the back post. Sadio Mane secured Liverpool's place in their third Champions League final in five seasons with a third goal after taking the ball around Rulli. Villarreal ended the game with 10 men with Capoue sent off late on for two bookable offences. The Reds will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. No English side has ever won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup all in the same season, with Liverpool aiming to create history. Villarreal's performance in their 2-0 loss at Anfield led one English radio pundit to call the Spanish side a ""disgrace"" and ""pathetic"", despite an incredible run that had seen them eliminate former winners Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. However, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp knew the tie was not over and warned his side they ""would have to be prepared to suffer"" in the second leg. And suffer they did in arguably Liverpool's worst half of football this season, with passes misplaced, errors made and the side looking uncharacteristically vulnerable. They made the worst possible start, conceding after only three minutes. Pervis Estupinan, who scored an own goal at Anfield, provided a cross which was pulled back by Capoue and Dia, inside the six-yard box, reacted quickest to convert from close range. Dani Parejo shot just wide and Gerard Moreno had an effort blocked before Villarreal, seventh in La Liga and managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, made it 2-2 on aggregate thanks to Coquelin's fine header. Liverpool had to improve in the second half, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot hit the crossbar after taking a huge deflection off Coquelin. But the breakthrough came with Fabinho's strike and that led to a capitulation from Villarreal, who conceded three times in a 12-minute spell. Diaz headed in Alexander-Arnold's cross to give the visitors some breathing space before a rash decision from Rulli saw him sprint off the line with Mane getting there first and finishing into an unguarded goal. This is the 10th time Liverpool have reached the final of the European Cup or Champions League as they aim to become European champions for a seventh time after successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019. Liverpool's progress keeps them on course to become the first English side to complete the quadruple. They already have the Carabao Cup in the trophy cabinet after beating Chelsea on penalties in February and Thomas Tuchel's side are again the opposition at Wembley for the FA Cup final on 14 May. This victory means Liverpool have become the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. Liverpool are also only one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League title race and could meet in the Champions League final later this month. Pep Guardiola's side hold the advantage in the second semi-final after an incredible first leg at Etihad Stadium saw them beat Real 4-3 in one of the best games in the tournament's history. The second leg takes place at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday and if the Spanish champions, managed by ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, can turn the one-goal deficit around it would set up a repeat of the 2018 final. Real won 3-1 on that occasion as Gareth Bale scored twice, including an incredible overhead kick, but the game will largely be remembered for two goalkeeping errors from Liverpool's Loris Karius.

1,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60342935,Bournemouth 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Cherries promoted to Premier League,"Kieffer Moore sent Bournemouth back to the Premier League with a late winner against Nottingham Forest that sealed automatic promotion from the Championship. Substitute Moore's cool finish, after a low free-kick found him unmarked in the box, leaves third-placed Forest needing to go through the play-offs if they are to join the Cherries in the top flight next season. Moore, a January arrival from Cardiff who has managed to make just three substitute appearances because of injury, was smothered by jubilant team-mates as they knew a win against their closest challengers would end a two-year top-flight absence. They return to the Premier League under manager Scott Parker, who celebrates his second promotion in three campaigns, having taken Fulham up in 2019-20 before leaving the west London club for Bournemouth following relegation last season. The showdown between second and third in the Championship, while lacking the hype and pageantry of a play-off final, felt every bit the high-stakes encounter that makes the Wembley showpiece the richest game in club football. In an absorbing and tense first half, Forest striker Sam Surridge hit the crossbar and had a strong penalty appeal ignored after an incorrect offside flag against him. The forward was brought down by goalkeeper Mark Travers as he tried to round him, but the foul was waved away as the flag was already up. After the match, Forest boss Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham that referee Stuart Attwell and his assistant apologised for the mistake. ""They have put their hands up and owned up to a huge error,"" he said. ""It doesn't really help but at least they had the courtesy to own up to the decision that they made."" The visitors created little in a second half dominated by the Cherries, with Dominic Solanke hitting the side netting while Philip Billing and Jaidon Anthony tested Reds goalkeeper Brice Samba. When Jordan Zemura was brought down on the edge of the area, Billing appeared to be ready to go directly for goal. Instead, he spotted Moore free in box to sweep home a goal that propelled the hosts back to the Premier League and sparked a party atmosphere at the Vitality Stadium, which saw ecstatic home fans spill onto the pitch at full-time. Bournemouth, who are now six points clear of Forest, have spent just one of the past 32 weeks outside the automatic promotion spots. In stark contrast, Forest spent 46 of the first 52 days of the season in the relegation places after making their worst start to a campaign for more than a century. Since Cooper's appointment as Chris Hughton's replacement in September, no side has collected more points than the Reds as they have mounted what would once have seemed to be a preposterous bid to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League after 23 years away. When Forest beat Huddersfield on 18 September for their first win - a victory secured under caretaker Steven Reid - the East Midlands club were bottom of the table and 14 points adrift of then leaders Bournemouth. Forest started the night knowing victory would take them above the hosts on goal difference and into pole position to claim the last remaining automatic promotion place with one game to go. After Billing tested Samba with an awkward curled shot, it was former Cherries striker Surridge who took centre stage, crashing a powerful shot off the crossbar before the controversial offside decision. Bournemouth emerged re-energised after the interval, afforded Forest little space or time to play the free-flowing attacking football that saw them win nine of their previous 10 games, and created the better chances before Moore buried his with a fine first-time finish beyond Samba with seven minutes remaining. Forest finish the season with a trip to Hull on Saturday, knowing victory would guarantee them third place, while Bournemouth host Millwall who are hoping to sneak into the play-offs themselves. Bournemouth boss Parker told BBC Radio Solent: ""I never wanted the game to be an emotional one, I felt if we turned it into an emotional game it would suit Forest. ""It was easier said than done, and we got dragged into that, it became helter-skelter, a basketball game. If we'd shown the same performance second half there would have only been one winner. ""We've executed second half tonight, we were electric and certainly worthy of the result. My emotions are ecstatic."" Nottingham Forest boss Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""Obviously it hurts, but like it or not we have to get over it and get ready for the play-offs. ""Congratulations to Bournemouth, promotion wasn't just about tonight. It was about getting to the position they had been in. We go into the play-offs now to try and join them.""

3,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season. ""Let's look forward to that, rather than dwell on a poor performance - they were good, but we weren't aggressive, didn't defend our box well and in the end felt a bit a sorry for ourselves.""

5,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61300016,Villarreal v Liverpool: Does Unai Emery get respect he deserves?,"Guiding unfancied Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals ought to have been a career highlight for Unai Emery, the manager who has taken a team from a town with a smaller population than Clacton-on-Sea to the pinnacle of European football. Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday. ",positive
6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61293998,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: 'Pickford's saves have kept their dreams alive',"With an unbroken run in England's top flight stretching back to 1954, Everton aren't about to give up their status among the elite without a fight. Their critical 1-0 win over Chelsea was a full-blooded football spectacle, with fireworks and smoke bombs playing cameo roles. But aside from Richarlison's winner, the leading star was Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford thanks to two second-half saves worthy of their own script. When England's number one somehow denied Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger in quick succession, Goodison Park rose in unison to cheer his efforts with a noise almost as loud as a goal. That was recognition of what was at stake, by a crowd who played a massive part in a blood-and-thunder victory, which closed the gap on Leeds and Burnley to two points. Everton started the day five points from safety as they attempted to maintain their 68-year stay in the top-flight. Some pundits have debated whether they would be the biggest club to go down from the Premier League, given their history. And, with Frank Lampard's side staring relegation in the face, it was apt that Pickford used his to deny Rudiger with a point-blank save. ""Pickford's saves have kept Everton's dreams alive,"" former Everton midfielder Leon Osman said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That [Azpilicueta] save was incredible. Pickford has been criticised in the past because he has a tendency to do something rash. But not today. It was arguably his best-ever game for Everton in Everton's most important game of the season. ""If Everton had lost today you would have felt they were out of the Premier League and the fans knew how important this was."" That much was emphasised by thousands of fans lining the streets in the approach to Goodison Park to welcome the team bus. Blue flares wafted down Goodison Road as supporters sang about the ""Grand Old Team"" whose Premier League status looked anything but impressive. It might have even explained the decision for some fans to create their own firework display in front of the Chelsea team hotel on Saturday night, although Thomas Tuchel said his side were unaffected by the noise despite the German boss, and midfielder Jorginho, saying it woke them up. But in a season where Everton have not won away since August, the atmosphere once again dragged the team to new heights and underlined how big a role the fans will play. Lampard said of the escort from fans: ""The feeling it gave the players, to make them understand what it means to the fans, was special. ""If it doesn't give you goosebumps, if it doesn't get you ready to go out and give everything, then you shouldn't be playing the game. ""The fans were the 12th man, they were the people of the match. The men, the women, the children that came and did that before the game, in the warm up, at the start of the game and also to get us over the line late in the game, was huge."" Seamus Coleman, who alongside Yerry Mina epitomised Everton's aggressive approach against Chelsea, added: ""I have been here a long time but never felt like I did coming into the stadium today."" Lampard said he would leave it to fans whether they replicated it for their remaining home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace. But he said it ""definitely helped"" and also highlighted how improving his side's away form would be a crucial factor in staying up, given they have trips to Leicester, Watford and Arsenal to come. Part of that may come from taking a harder approach with his players, which he admitted prior to only his fourth Premier League win in 13 games since he was appointed. That included ""prodding"" Richarlison about how he needed to be more ""clinical"" alongside his pressing, with the Brazilian rewarding Lampard with a ninth goal of the season after harrying Azpilicueta into a mistake. ""I think it was an important moment to talk [to the players] about the reality of the situation because there's different ways you can go about it,"" Lampard added. ""You can keep telling the players to believe and there are other times where we're going, 'hang on, the demands are this'. ""To be good lads and show good effort is not enough for us to stay in this league because we knew what the table said before this game. ""So my feeling was that we needed the extra bit of discipline, the extra bit of tension and, to be fair, the players have delivered that."" There is sure to be more tension as Everton try to keep their hopes alive, but Lampard said: ""My feeling is there's a long way to go in this. ""We can control our games, but we can't control Burnley or Leeds. And as much as we sit and stare at our phones and analyse their remaining games, it won't make a difference unless we do our thing."" ",positive

The Reds had comfortably won 2-0 in the first leg but that advantage was wiped out after only 41 minutes at a noisy and passionate El Madrigal as the Spanish side pushed for a huge upset. Boulaye Dia scored Villarreal's first after only three minutes, converting Etienne Capoue's pass, before ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin headed in a second from another Capoue cross as the Reds looked rattled. Liverpool had to improve in the second half and Fabinho put them back in front on aggregate with a shot that went through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 62nd minute. Luis Diaz, whose introduction at half time changed the game after he replaced Diogo Jota, restored Liverpool's two-goal aggregate advantage with a header at the back post. Sadio Mane secured Liverpool's place in their third Champions League final in five seasons with a third goal after taking the ball around Rulli. Villarreal ended the game with 10 men with Capoue sent off late on for two bookable offences. The Reds will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. No English side has ever won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup all in the same season, with Liverpool aiming to create history. Villarreal's performance in their 2-0 loss at Anfield led one English radio pundit to call the Spanish side a ""disgrace"" and ""pathetic"", despite an incredible run that had seen them eliminate former winners Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. However, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp knew the tie was not over and warned his side they ""would have to be prepared to suffer"" in the second leg. And suffer they did in arguably Liverpool's worst half of football this season, with passes misplaced, errors made and the side looking uncharacteristically vulnerable. They made the worst possible start, conceding after only three minutes. Pervis Estupinan, who scored an own goal at Anfield, provided a cross which was pulled back by Capoue and Dia, inside the six-yard box, reacted quickest to convert from close range. Dani Parejo shot just wide and Gerard Moreno had an effort blocked before Villarreal, seventh in La Liga and managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, made it 2-2 on aggregate thanks to Coquelin's fine header. Liverpool had to improve in the second half, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot hit the crossbar after taking a huge deflection off Coquelin. But the breakthrough came with Fabinho's strike and that led to a capitulation from Villarreal, who conceded three times in a 12-minute spell. Diaz headed in Alexander-Arnold's cross to give the visitors some breathing space before a rash decision from Rulli saw him sprint off the line with Mane getting there first and finishing into an unguarded goal. This is the 10th time Liverpool have reached the final of the European Cup or Champions League as they aim to become European champions for a seventh time after successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019. Liverpool's progress keeps them on course to become the first English side to complete the quadruple. They already have the Carabao Cup in the trophy cabinet after beating Chelsea on penalties in February and Thomas Tuchel's side are again the opposition at Wembley for the FA Cup final on 14 May. This victory means Liverpool have become the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. Liverpool are also only one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League title race and could meet in the Champions League final later this month. Pep Guardiola's side hold the advantage in the second semi-final after an incredible first leg at Etihad Stadium saw them beat Real 4-3 in one of the best games in the tournament's history. The second leg takes place at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday and if the Spanish champions, managed by ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, can turn the one-goal deficit around it would set up a repeat of the 2018 final. Real won 3-1 on that occasion as Gareth Bale scored twice, including an incredible overhead kick, but the game will largely be remembered for two goalkeeping errors from Liverpool's Loris Karius.

8,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61300016,Villarreal v Liverpool: Does Unai Emery get respect he deserves?,"Guiding unfancied Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals ought to have been a career highlight for Unai Emery, the manager who has taken a team from a town with a smaller population than Clacton-on-Sea to the pinnacle of European football. Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level.

11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61221249,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Pep Guardiola's side win thrilling Champions League semi-final first leg,"Manchester City will take a slender Champions League semi-final advantage to the Bernabeu after winning a seven-goal first-leg classic against Real Madrid at Etihad Stadium. City delivered a magnificent display as they peppered Real's goal for long periods but Carlo Ancelotti's side kept rising off the canvas to somehow keep themselves in serious contention to reach another final. Kevin de Bruyne set the tone for a magical night of football with a diving header from Riyad Mahrez's cross in the second minute and in-form Gabriel Jesus quickly added a second from close range as Real reeled under wave after wave of attacks. Mahrez enraged manager Pep Guardiola when he hit the side-netting instead of finding the unmarked Phil Foden, who shot inches wide before Karim Benzema, inevitably, gave Real a lifeline by sweeping home Ferland Mendy's cross after 33 minutes. The Spanish side escaped again shortly after the break when Mahrez struck the post but City restored their two-goal advantage when an unmarked Foden headed home Fernandinho's cross in the 53rd minute. City were pegged back again when Vinicius Junior dummied past Fernandinho and ran from inside his own half to score a superb second for Real. However, a brilliant use of advantage from referee Istvan Kovacs allowed Bernardo Silva to fire into the top-left corner for City's fourth. There was still no let-up and Benzema capped a spectacular game by showing nerves of steel to chip a Panenka penalty past Ederson with eight minutes left following Aymeric Laporte's handball. Liverpool face Spanish side Villarreal in this year's other semi-final, with the first leg at Anfield on Wednesday. The final will be held at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. City would have taken any sort of advantage to Spain before kick-off but deep down they will know their almost total dominance of Real should have given them much more than this narrow lead for the second leg. Guardiola's side were simply irresistible for spells and could have been four goals ahead before Benzema struck Real's first, the manager clearly infuriated by Mahrez's selfishness in shooting with Foden standing unmarked in front of goal at 2-0. Guardiola and his players will take heart from the manner in which they carved Real open so often and they will hope to capitalise on their opponents' need to press for a goal in Spain. De Bruyne was outstanding once more and Foden just showed how at home he is on the elite stage, but City have to be concerned at how they looked defensively vulnerable on occasion to leave Real very much alive in this semi-final. A side of City's calibre will be confident of progress - but most observers will know this tie should already be over. Real will always have hope when they have Benzema, the 34-year-old Frenchman who deserves his place in the upper echelons of the great strikers in world football. It is often a mystery how Real survive when looking punch drunk having come back from losing situations to beat Paris St-Germain and Chelsea in their previous knockout ties. But a comeback looked beyond them when they were blown away by a blistering City opening that left them two down after only 11 minutes. And yet, for all their struggles elsewhere, the La Liga leaders carry an air of menace that means concentration levels cannot drop for a moment. They proved it again as they dusted themselves down to give themselves a lifeline. It was no surprise that Benzema was the man responsible, showing all of his class with a left-foot volley past Ederson to make it 2-1. Brazilian youngster Vinicius Junior also produced magic for the second goal before Benzema's nerveless penalty. The great survivors are still in this tie and will now hope the magic of the Bernabeu can inspire them once more next week under coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is trying to win the trophy for a fourth time.

12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61238706,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Classic Champions League tie a genuine gold standard match,"Carlo Ancelotti's last visit to Manchester City ended in a 5-0 humiliation in what proved to be the final match of his tenure as Everton manager. When the legendary Italian manager, 62, turned to his Real Madrid backroom staff with arms outstretched and gave an anxious glance down at his watch with City 2-0 up after only 11 minutes on his return to Etihad Stadium, he was probably fearing a similar scoreline. City were flying. Real were overwhelmed. This was shaping up as a one-sided mauling for the great old Champions League campaigner chasing the trophy for a historic fourth time. And yet, to the disbelief of pretty much everyone who witnessed a gold standard classic of a football match, Ancelotti was pitchside after the game smiling, eyebrow raised in trademark fashion suggesting he was rather happy to come away with a 4-3 first leg loss. He did not look as mystified as others at the fact that Real were still in with a shout of reaching yet another Champions League Final. City's players were not exactly deflated - how could they be after such a brilliant performance and a semi-final first leg win? However, their body language gave away the brutal fact that they should have had this tie all wrapped up heading into the second leg in the Bernabeu. This was a breathless night, everything that is good about football at this rarified level and City were, at times, magical. And yet... The Bernabeu does strange things in the Champions League and, while City are unlikely to endure the same physical onslaught Atletico Madrid subjected them to in the quarter-final second leg, they will face a severe test with just a one-goal lead. City let Real off the hook and history tells us this can be a very expensive mistake. Ancelotti, as well as many of this Real squad, have been over this course and distance before though they will also know they were ripped to shreds for long periods of this game. But they will also have serious belief they can go through to face either Liverpool or Villarreal in Paris. The good news for City is that, despite the narrow scoreline, there were times when they outclassed Real, with Luka Modric unable to exert his usual influence in midfield. City were quicker, slicker, better, more threatening. This is the knowledge they will pack with them on the flight to Madrid. And yet... Who knows what sort of lead it takes to finish Real off, backed by the Bernabeu crowd and such a rich history in this competition? Every big night in the grand old arena is accompanied by sense of destiny. A glimpse of Guardiola's mindset came with City two goals up and Real pretty much floored. The Spaniard flew into a full-on rage in his technical area when Riyad Mahrez committed the cardinal sin in this manager's book by being too greedy, lashing a shot into the side-netting with Phil Foden waiting unattended in the middle and the goal at his mercy. At 3-0 it could have been job done. ""Riyad. Riyad"", Guardiola shouted before continuing the fume. He knows you simply cannot give Real a break and the Spanish giants proved that. City had a two-goal advantage on three occasions, played wonderful, fluent football but will know there should be no need of those nagging doubts that might have been felt at the final whistle.

13,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60342935,Bournemouth 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Cherries promoted to Premier League,"Kieffer Moore sent Bournemouth back to the Premier League with a late winner against Nottingham Forest that sealed automatic promotion from the Championship. Substitute Moore's cool finish, after a low free-kick found him unmarked in the box, leaves third-placed Forest needing to go through the play-offs if they are to join the Cherries in the top flight next season. Moore, a January arrival from Cardiff who has managed to make just three substitute appearances because of injury, was smothered by jubilant team-mates as they knew a win against their closest challengers would end a two-year top-flight absence. They return to the Premier League under manager Scott Parker, who celebrates his second promotion in three campaigns, having taken Fulham up in 2019-20 before leaving the west London club for Bournemouth following relegation last season. The showdown between second and third in the Championship, while lacking the hype and pageantry of a play-off final, felt every bit the high-stakes encounter that makes the Wembley showpiece the richest game in club football. In an absorbing and tense first half, Forest striker Sam Surridge hit the crossbar and had a strong penalty appeal ignored after an incorrect offside flag against him. The forward was brought down by goalkeeper Mark Travers as he tried to round him, but the foul was waved away as the flag was already up. After the match, Forest boss Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham that referee Stuart Attwell and his assistant apologised for the mistake. ""They have put their hands up and owned up to a huge error,"" he said. ""It doesn't really help but at least they had the courtesy to own up to the decision that they made."" The visitors created little in a second half dominated by the Cherries, with Dominic Solanke hitting the side netting while Philip Billing and Jaidon Anthony tested Reds goalkeeper Brice Samba. When Jordan Zemura was brought down on the edge of the area, Billing appeared to be ready to go directly for goal. Instead, he spotted Moore free in box to sweep home a goal that propelled the hosts back to the Premier League and sparked a party atmosphere at the Vitality Stadium, which saw ecstatic home fans spill onto the pitch at full-time. Bournemouth, who are now six points clear of Forest, have spent just one of the past 32 weeks outside the automatic promotion spots. In stark contrast, Forest spent 46 of the first 52 days of the season in the relegation places after making their worst start to a campaign for more than a century. Since Cooper's appointment as Chris Hughton's replacement in September, no side has collected more points than the Reds as they have mounted what would once have seemed to be a preposterous bid to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League after 23 years away. When Forest beat Huddersfield on 18 September for their first win - a victory secured under caretaker Steven Reid - the East Midlands club were bottom of the table and 14 points adrift of then leaders Bournemouth. Forest started the night knowing victory would take them above the hosts on goal difference and into pole position to claim the last remaining automatic promotion place with one game to go. After Billing tested Samba with an awkward curled shot, it was former Cherries striker Surridge who took centre stage, crashing a powerful shot off the crossbar before the controversial offside decision. Bournemouth emerged re-energised after the interval, afforded Forest little space or time to play the free-flowing attacking football that saw them win nine of their previous 10 games, and created the better chances before Moore buried his with a fine first-time finish beyond Samba with seven minutes remaining. Forest finish the season with a trip to Hull on Saturday, knowing victory would guarantee them third place, while Bournemouth host Millwall who are hoping to sneak into the play-offs themselves. Bournemouth boss Parker told BBC Radio Solent: ""I never wanted the game to be an emotional one, I felt if we turned it into an emotional game it would suit Forest. ""It was easier said than done, and we got dragged into that, it became helter-skelter, a basketball game. If we'd shown the same performance second half there would have only been one winner. ""We've executed second half tonight, we were electric and certainly worthy of the result. My emotions are ecstatic."" Nottingham Forest boss Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""Obviously it hurts, but like it or not we have to get over it and get ready for the play-offs.

14,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47442879,Real Madrid 1-4 Ajax: Brilliant visitors knock out Champions League holders,"Scintillating Ajax stunned 13-time European champions Real Madrid at the Bernabeu to progress from a Champions League knockout tie for the first time in 22 years. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, Erik ten Hag's side stormed into an aggregate lead after just 18 minutes through forwards Hakim Ziyech and David Neres. The electric Dusan Tadic, provider of his side's first two goals, then added a brilliant third as he whipped an effort into the top corner from the edge of the area. Chasing a fourth consecutive Champions League triumph, Real looked to have gained a lifeline when Marco Asensio scored with 20 minutes remaining. But Ajax's Danish midfielder Lasse Schone scored a spectacular free-kick just two minutes later to leave Santiago Solari's side requiring three goals to progress. Gareth Bale, jeered by fans in Saturday's defeat by Barcelona, was dropped by Solari but struck the post after coming on as a 29th-minute substitute for the injured Lucas Vazquez. Real looked fragile without captain Sergio Ramos, serving a two-match ban ""for clearly receiving a yellow card on purpose"" in the tie's first leg. Their miserable night was compounded as Nacho was sent off in injury time for a second bookable offence, as Ajax became the first team to overturn a 2-1 first-leg home defeat in the Champions League. This was a performance of sheer quality by a young Ajax side who arrived at the home of the European champions with no fear as they danced through to the quarter-finals. A last-16 meeting with Real was the club's first knockout tie in 13 years, and with six of their starting side aged 22 and under, there is the sense something special could be achieved this season - although the challenge of holding on to those players when the next transfer window opens will be significant. The visitors needed at least two goals in Madrid and learned from their wastefulness in the first leg to silence the home support inside 18 minutes. Ajax had to weather early pressure, but Ziyech's fine finish came as a powerful blow to their bewildered hosts. Tadic, almost unrecognisable from his Southampton days, produced a moment of excellence to set up Neres before seemingly putting the tie out of reach with a finish that epitomised his performance. There was a long wait before the video assistant referee eventually confirmed Noussair Mazraoui had managed to keep the ball in play during the build up to Tadic's goal - as nervous tension paved the way for wild celebrations in the away end. Barcelona-bound Frenkie de Jong shone brightly too - with his pending £65m move to La Liga already a concern for Real - but it was fellow midfielder Schone who added the deserved gloss just as Real may have sensed hope. Ajax could have had even more as goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was forced to stop efforts from Donny van de Beek and Tadic, while the impressive Matthijs de Ligt stood firm alongside Daley Blind under periods of pressure. The visitors more than held their own against the holders, and could play a huge part in the final stages of this season's competition should they maintain such a devastating level of performance. After three consecutive Champions League titles, the most successful side in the competition's history did not see this coming. Ajax head coach Ten Hag had suggested that absence of Ramos for Real was ""not only a tactical loss for them but also a mental one"". Ultimately, he was proven correct. Real's aggregate advantage disappeared quickly without their captain's authority, despite a promising start in which Raphael Varane had headed on to the bar from a cross by Vazquez, who drew a fine save from Andre Onana before injury forced him off, to be replaced by Bale. The Wales forward received a warmer reception than he had at the weekend, with Asensio also sharpening the hosts' attack when he came on for Vinicius Junior before half-time. When Asensio made it 4-3 on aggregate, he appeared to have dragged his side - with a reputation of churning out results in Europe - back into the tie. But Ajax crushed any hope of a comeback just moments later, effectively ending Real's season, given that they fell 12 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona at the weekend. Nacho's dismissal and an injury to Bale in the closing stages rounded off an ugly night for the home side. Having gone eight campaigns without failing to reach the Champions League semi-finals, it now looks as if a summer of change awaits at the Bernabeu.

16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57268064,Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea: Kai Havertz goal secures Champions League trophy for Chelsea,"Chelsea won the Champions League for the second time with a fully deserved victory over Manchester City in an all-Premier League confrontation in Porto. Thomas Tuchel got the better of his Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola for the third time since succeeding sacked Frank Lampard in January to bring European club football's biggest prize back to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2012. Kai Havertz, blossoming after a slow start to his Chelsea career, got the winner three minutes before half-time when he collected a defence-splitting pass from Mason Mount to round City goalkeeper Ederson and score. It leaves City still searching for the Champions League, the trophy that has always eluded them, and Guardiola cannot escape scrutiny for his part in this defeat after taking a tactical gamble which backfired. Guardiola surprisingly decided against utilising either Rodri or Fernandinho as a defensive midfielder, leaving City with a muddled game plan that reduced their effectiveness and rarely presented Chelsea with any problems. Chelsea had the better opportunities throughout, Timo Werner wasting two good chances before Havertz struck and substitute Christian Pulisic squandering another in the second half. City, who lost Kevin De Bruyne to injury midway through the second half, threw on Sergio Aguero for his final appearance but there was no fairytale ending for the club's greatest goalscorer as Chelsea closed out the win. And for Tuchel it was elation after the disappointment of losing last year's final as manager of Paris St-Germain. Tuchel made it three out of three against Guardiola by producing a fiercely disciplined, positive Chelsea performance that has brought a season that was shrouded in uncertainty to the most glorious conclusion. The German has transformed Chelsea since his arrival in January, making significant changes by restoring the towering Antonio Rudiger in central defence and playing the magnificent man-of-the-match N'golo Kante in the position in which he is quite simply a world-class operator. Kante controlled everything from his position in midfield, the complete player giving a breathtaking performance. Chelsea needed to be defensively perfect but this was no smash-and-grab result. It was a front-foot display to take the initiative away from City in the first half. They then held firm in the second with very few anxious moments. They even survived the first-half loss of the experienced Thiago Silva to injury and carried on in the same measured, committed fashion. It is a huge personal triumph for Tuchel, who already had victories against Guardiola in the FA Cup semi-final and in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium going in to this game. And the confidence and self-belief those victories brought was in evidence as Chelsea played with a fearless attitude that never allowed City to settle and sparked wild scenes of celebration among players, staff and the fans inside Porto's Estadio do Dragao. The scale of Tuchel's achievement is that this night was barely imaginable when he arrived in January but now Chelsea are champions of Europe for a second time. City's march to their first Champions League final was accompanied by a sense of destiny - that their years of suffering in Europe's elite tournament were about to end, especially after the manner in which they overcame Paris St-Germain in the semi-final. Sadly for Guardiola's side, the agony will go on after a final in which the Premier League champions failed miserably to do themselves justice and their Spanish manager played a part in their downfall as he tried to join Bob Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane in the select group to win this tournament three times. Eyebrows were raised when he decided against utilising either of his outstanding holding midfield men Rodri and Fernandinho in favour of an all-out attacking line-up. It produced a confused, muddled performance with the likes of Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin de Bruyne seemingly uncertain of their roles. And with Raheem Sterling having a disappointing night on the left flank as he was dominated by Reece James before being substituted, City rarely carried the threat that has made them the prime force in the Premier League this season. And there was sadness as Aguero was a loser on his final appearance for the club after a glittering career. Guardiola turned to City's greatest goalscorer late on but Chelsea were not to be moved or play their part in someone else's happy ending. City have still had a season of success winning the title and the League Cup. This is still a very bitter pill for Guardiola and his team to swallow but they can tell no hard luck stories about this game.

Mauricio Pochettino was in the Tottenham dugout that day but Guardiola will now face a Spurs side managed by his long-time rival Jose Mourinho.

""I saw Tottenham at Southampton and they were alive. They conceded a last-minute goal but I saw a team that is there. ""Every manager has different ideas, both are incredible managers.

18,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60116469,Christian Eriksen: Former Tottenham midfielder joins Brentford on six-month deal,"Brentford have signed Denmark and former Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen on a six-month deal. Eriksen has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Denmark's match against Finland at Euro 2020 last June. He was subsequently fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - a type of pacemaker. ""We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford,"" head coach Thomas Frank said. The 29-year-old won the league title with Inter Milan last season, but the Italians and Eriksen agreed to cancel his contract in December as players fitted with an ICD cannot compete in Serie A. However, the Premier League does not have the same regulations. After leaving Inter, Eriksen started training alone at Danish side Odense Boldklub - where he was previously a youth player - and outlined his aspirations of resuming his playing career in order to play for Denmark at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. He joined Inter in 2020 following a seven-year spell at Tottenham, during which he scored 69 goals in 305 games and helped the club reach the 2019 Champions League final. Frank added: ""He hasn't trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level. ""At his best, Christian has the ability to dictate games of football. He will also bring experience of top level football to the club. I expect him to have an impact in the dressing room and at the training ground."" Speaking to Danish broadcaster DR earlier this month, Eriksen said: ""My dream is to rejoin the national team and play at Parken [Denmark's home stadium] again and prove that it was a one-timer and that it won't happen again. ""I want to prove I've moved on and that I can play for the national team again."" His agent, Martin Schoots, told the BBC: ""Playing in England again would absolutely feel like coming home for Chris and his family. ""Christian has been treated exceptionally well by the British public, not only because of his top football skills, but also because of his human values, his modesty and altruism.""

19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season.

21,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021.

22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61044707,Premier League: Can Fulham succeed in the top flight under Marco Silva?,"This feature has been updated since it was first published on 20 April, 2022. Up, down, up, down, up... will 2022-23 be the season Fulham finally avoid the drop and achieve Premier League survival? The clinical Cottagers dismantled play-off challengers Luton 7-0 on Monday to claim the Championship title in style, with relentless top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic breaking the modern-day record for goals scored in a second-tier season on a perfect day in west London. With the trophy finally secured, having topped the table since mid-January, Fulham's focus now turns to the top tier and whether or not this group of players can stay there. ""It will be a huge challenge for us; we have to be positive,"" said head coach Marco Silva after their victory over Luton. ""We have to work all together because in my opinion this club belongs in the Premier League. But we have to work hard to keep it this way after the season we've had in the Championship."" Fulham have been here before - twice in the past five seasons. On both occasions swift, chastening relegations back to the Championship followed, only for the club to twice come back up at the first time of asking. Silva's team have cut through the league this season with ruthless efficiency - led by the unstoppable Mitrovic and his record-breaking 43 league goals. They need three goals in their final fixture at Sheffield United to break the modern second-tier record of 108 set by Kevin Keegan's Manchester City side in the 2001-02 season. Yet Mitrovic and his team-mates have faltered when faced with the more clinical finishers, tougher defences and higher intensity of the Premier League in 2018-19 and 2020-21. So do Silva's team have what it takes to finally break the relegation curse? Paul Parker, who played for the club from 1982 to 1987 before returning for a brief spell 10 years later, feels plenty will have to change if they want to avoid the drop. ""Fulham need to alter how they want to play; they play with a very slow tempo,"" he said. ""They would get ripped apart by a team like Brighton, who press and move it very quickly through the midfield. ""Fulham have got a long way to go. They're going to need to incorporate at least four players into the starting 11, I'd say."" Mitrovic's jaw-dropping return - smashing Ivan Toney's record of 31 goals in a single Championship season and then eclipsing Guy Whittingham's post-1992 record of 42 for a second-tier campaign - has epitomised the front-foot intent of Silva's team. But the Serbian hitman's 85 goals in 125 Championship matches are in stark contrast to his 24 in 104 Premier League games for Newcastle and Fulham. Parker believes Silva will need to add genuine quality to the side to get the best out of his star striker, with forward Fabio Carvalho out of contract and saying his future was ""undecided"" on Monday, and impressive right-back Neco Williams' loan from Liverpool set to end. ""They need players who have played at a high level of football, in the Premier League or a top league abroad,"" said the former Manchester United right-back. ""Mitrovic needs a better calibre of player around him. When he's played in the Premier League [for Fulham], he's been in poor teams."" Parker believes Silva could take inspiration from Bruno Lage and Nuno Espirito Santo before him at Wolves, who have recruited players such as Ruben Neves, Raul Jimenez, Rui Patricio and Pedro Neto from clubs in Portugal. ""It's a physical league and so the players can deal with the physicality here,"" he added. BBC Radio London's Jamie Reid believes Fulham could make it ""third time lucky"" and stay up if they add the right reinforcements next season. ""They've got to try to strengthen in and around both penalty boxes,"" the Fulham commentator said. ""They need support for Mitrovic in the final third. He's had a wonderful season and next season is going to be harder. ""They also need to replace Fabio Carvalho - he's had a brilliant season too. It's a shame he's going to be leaving the club but Tony Khan and his recruitment team are already working on replacement options. ""They need to strengthen defensively. Neco Williams has been tremendous at right-back. ""To sign Neco on a permanent basis would be the aim and I feel the team would benefit from at least one other central defender as you need strong competition in the Premier League. ""They also need a striker and a goal-scoring midfielder. They need players to be brought in to further strengthen what is a talented and motivated group."" Before leaving when Fulham were relegated at the end of last season, former boss Scott Parker said the club ""need to try to get off this rollercoaster we're on"". Here are some of the twists and turns of that crazy journey. Fulham banished the heartache of losing in the play-off semi-finals to eventual runners-up Reading in the 2016-17 season to bounce back and go all the way the following year. Slavisa Jokanovic's expansive team finished two points behind second-placed Cardiff in third - and their 79 goals were only bettered by league winners Wolves, who scored 82. Starlet Ryan Sessegnon, 17 at the time, hit 15 goals on the way to promotion, with captain Tom Cairney scoring before the Cottagers had Denis Odoi sent off on the way to beating Dean Smith's Aston Villa at Wembley. Jokanovic's time as Fulham manager came to an end in November 2018, with his side bottom of the Premier League after 12 games and without a win in nine. Leicester's title-winning hero Claudio Ranieri was brought in to change the club's fortunes, but lasted just 106 days in the job, before he was replaced by temporary boss Parker. Relegation was confirmed in a 4-1 hammering at Watford, with five games still to play. Victory in their final three games ensured they ended the season on a more respectable 26 points in 19th place, with only Huddersfield below them. Despite losing his first five games in temporary charge, Parker was given the permanent role and steered the club to a fourth-placed finish in the Championship, setting up a play-off semi-final against Cardiff. The Cottagers progressed despite losing 2-1 at home, beating the Bluebirds 2-0 in the second leg with goals from Josh Onomah and Neeskens Kebano, setting up an all-west London final against Brentford at Wembley. The final pitted the Championship's two top scorers against each other - Mitrovic and Ollie Watkins, who finished the season with 26 goals each. A tense game finished goalless before two extra-time goals from Joe Bryan sealed victory for Fulham. Five wins, 27 goals for, 53 against and a total of 28 points - two more than they had accrued in their previous top-flight season - made for grim reading as the Cottagers were relegated with three games to spare. Bobby Decordova-Reid was the club's top scorer with five goals as Mitrovic managed just three in the league, the Serbian claiming the club ""did not deserve to stay up"" in a damning assessment of the season. Parker opted to leave the club for Championship rivals Bournemouth, with former Watford and Everton manager Silva taking over. In their 45 games, Fulham have so far recorded 27 wins and 106 goals. They have simply blown away the competition after storming to the top of the league in January and sealing promotion with four games to spare. The free-scoring Cottagers have hit five or more goals on seven occasions, including 7-0 wins at Blackburn and Reading before this week's 7-0 home hammering of Luton. They became the first English team in 88 years to score six or more goals in three consecutive games, with 6-2 wins against Bristol City and Birmingham following that 7-0 rout of the Royals. Silva will now be tasked with achieving something Jokanovic, Ranieri and Parker could not - Premier League survival. ",positive

24,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61284264,Real Madrid 4-0 Espanyol: Real win title as Carlo Ancelotti completes 'Grand Slam',"Carlo Ancelotti became the first manager to win the league in all five of Europe's major leagues as Real Madrid beat Espanyol to win La Liga. Two goals from Rodrygo and strikes from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema confirmed Real's 35th Spanish title. They are 17 points clear of second-placed Sevilla with four games to play. Ancelotti has also won titles in Italy's Serie A, France's Ligue 1, the Premier League in England and the German Bundesliga. Real needed only a draw to win the title, but victory was never really in doubt once Rodrygo stroked home from just inside the area. The Brazilian doubled Real's lead a minute before the break when he robbed Sergi Gomez of possession on the edge of the penalty area and fired low into the bottom corner. Asensio finished off a rapid counter-attack before Benzema - rested with Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Manchester City in mind - came off the bench to sidefoot home from Vinicius Jr's cutback. Ancelotti was lured back for a second spell at Real last summer following the departure of Zinedine Zidane, quitting Everton after 18 months at the Premier League club. The 62-year-old won five major titles in two years at the Bernabeu between 2013 and 2015, including 'La Decima' - their 10th European Cup - but the Spanish title eluded him. His first league title as a manager was with AC Milan in 2004, the club where he won the league twice as a player in the 1980s. The Premier League with Chelsea followed in 2010, before Ancelotti lifted Ligue 1 with Paris St-Germain in 2013 and the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in 2017. Ancelotti's season could end in more glory, although Real must overturn a 4-3 first-leg deficit against City at the Bernabeu. If they do reach the final and lift the trophy Ancelotti would become the only man to win the European Cup or Champions League four times as a manager, having also led AC Milan to the trophy in 2003 and 2007. Wales forward Gareth Bale, who will leave Real Madrid when his contract expires this summer, was absent for the team's title celebrations. In a tweet Bale said: ""So disappointed that I'm not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title.

25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205839,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison winner boosts strugglers' survival hopes,"Everton moved to within two points of the Premier League safety zone with a priceless win over Chelsea that was inspired by a thunderous atmosphere at Goodison Park. Starting the day in the relegation places, five points behind Leeds and Burnley, the hosts were lifted by their fans in their attempt to extend a 68-year stay in the top flight. Everton's aggressive pressing was eventually rewarded a minute after the break when Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and scored his ninth goal of the season. The Brazilian celebrated by picking up a smoke flare that had landed on to the pitch and throwing it back towards the stands. Vitalii Mykolenko could have doubled the lead soon afterwards but skewed wide, and Everton were indebted to two stunning saves from Jordan Pickford to keep themselves in front. First, the Everton keeper denied Azpilicueta after Mason Mount's shot hit both posts and spun out. From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment. It was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German. Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge. The victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals. Chelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel. Tuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham. If Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety. With so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival. Chelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night. Before kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. And in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans. At times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount. Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park. The football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion. Mount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort. But no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics. Azpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy. Three minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range. But around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored. Mount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy. From the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact. Following that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison. Pickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.

26,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198224,Millwall 3-0 Peterborough United: Lions keep slim play-off hopes alive,"Millwall kept their slim Championship play-off hopes alive as they beat relegated Peterborough 3-0 at the Den. After a drab first half George Saville almost opened the scoring early in the second period, but Posh keeper David Cornell pulled off a great close-range save. Millwall took the lead soon after as Benik Afobe lashed in a left-footed shot before hitting the post and bar in quick succession 10 minutes later. Josh Knight turned Jed Wallace's teasing cross into his own net as Millwall doubled their lead before Saville headed home another excellent Wallace cross two minutes later. The win - a third in a five-game unbeaten run - means Gary Rowett's side are three points off sixth-placed Sheffield United and one off seventh-placed Middlesbrough. But they need to overturn a five-goal deficit in goal difference and hope the Blades lose and Boro fail to win their final games to make the last play-off place, while Posh remain second-from-bottom. The first half had an end-of-season feel to it with no chances until Posh striker Jonson Clarke-Harris missed an excellent chance from close range five minutes before the break. Sammie Szmodics' weak effort into the arms of Millwall keeper Bartosz Bialkowski five minutes later was the first effort on target for either side. Saville's chance early in the second half kicked the game into life and Jack Marriott forced a smart save from Bialkowski soon after. Afobe's goal came after Posh failed to clear Ryan Leonard's long throw and the striker was able to readjust his feet before firing home. It should have been a bigger lead after Murray Wallace hit the bar with a half-volley and, from the resulting corner after a Peterborough clearance, Saville headed against the post. But the introduction of Jed Wallace from the bench proved to be the turning point as his crosses set up both Millwall's second and third goals to take their season to the final day. Millwall manager Gary Rowett told BBC Radio London: ""I thought it was a fabulous effort, I think the only disappointment is we had so many chances second half that we really could have scored five or six goals today. ""I think the players have done so well again at home, it's another good second half home performance. ""But to be in the position that we're in once again, it's not the first time we've been in this position to take care of our own side of the business and to take it to the last game of the season, albeit a really outside chance. ""I think the players have to deserve enormous credit and enormous complements."" Peterborough United manager Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""I'm not one to ever blame officials for a result. ""We've lost the game today because of us, but I will say the decision to give them the throw-in, which is a massive strength for them, has cost us the first goal today and swung the momentum. ""Up to that point we were comfortably the better team, I think everyone could see that. ""Yes, we were lacking the end product, yes, we lacked in the final third, they changed their shape in the second half, but we had them and then the throw-in's cost us.""

27,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198621,Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Visitors stay above title rivals Liverpool after comfortable win,"Manchester City produced the perfect response to Premier League title rivals Liverpool by outclassing Leeds United to regain top spot. City needed the win after Liverpool had overtaken them earlier in the day with victory at Newcastle - and they produced a highly impressive display in Elland Road's hothouse that also prolonged the relegation worries for Jesse Marsch's side. The reigning Premier League champions went ahead in the 13th minute when Rodri glanced home Phil Foden's free-kick and while Leeds were spirited, they barely tested visiting keeper Ederson until the game was lost. City doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break from another set-piece, Nathan Ake pouncing from close range when Foden's corner was headed down by Ruben Dias. Foden was City's brilliant orchestrator and he was involved again when he set up the third for Gabriel Jesus with 12 minutes left, before Fernadinho added the fourth with virtually the last kick of the game. The win means City are a point ahead of Liverpool, with four games left for both teams. It is now a case of who blinks first in the title race. Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game. For the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. Guardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain. The strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination. City were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second. The pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat. Foden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities. With their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu. Leeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop. Burnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton. Leeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone. Marsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish. Dallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss. Leeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality. They must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. Everton may have two games in hand, but have a tough run-in of their own - and Leeds have what might be five crucial extra points on the board.

28,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205838,West Ham United 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners reclaim Champions League place,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said it was the sign of a big team to be able to win ugly as the Gunners beat West Ham at London Stadium to reclaim fourth spot in the Premier League. The Gunners knew only a win would lift them back into the Champions League places after Tottenham beat Leicester earlier in the afternoon, but Mikel Arteta's side responded by grinding out an important three points. It was Arteta's centre-backs who came up with the goods, with Gabriel Magalhaes nodding the winner early in the second half after Rob Holding had opened the scoring from Bukayo Saka's 38th-minute corner. ""We didn't play so well,"" Arteta said. ""If I have to use a word it would be we won ugly. Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well."" Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have."" Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance. But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said. ""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations. ""We knew that was a risk and we got punished for it."" The Gunners are desperate to return to Europe's elite competition next season and Arteta's side have enjoyed the advantage of having no continental football this term, meaning all their resources can be focused on achieving a top-four finish for the first time since 2015-16. West Ham's only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League now is to win the Europa League - and Moyes' team would be forgiven for having one eye on overturning their 2-1 deficit in the semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. Arsenal struggled to get a foothold, though, before Eddie Nketiah's clever run and low shot forced a corner, from which Holding climbed highest to head in Saka's delivery for his first Premier League goal. Bowen's smart finish pulled the Hammers level on the brink of half-time. But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post. Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal. Injuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma. That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13. Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box. The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end. More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

29,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47442886,Japan Women 0-3 England Women: Lionesses win SheBelieves Cup for first time,"England won the SheBelieves Cup for the first time after thrashing Japan in their final match in Tampa. Jodie Taylor set up Lucy Staniforth to fire England into an early lead with a fine low finish from outside the area. Karen Carney doubled the lead when she nodded in from Taylor's lofted cut-back before Beth Mead fired in a third before half-time. England also beat Brazil and drew with hosts the USA to ensure they topped the four-team round-robin competition. The night's other game saw the USA beat Brazil 1-0. It is the first time England have won the invitational tournament, which was introduced in 2016, having lost to world champions the USA in last year's competition. England, ranked fourth in the world, also meet Japan again in the group stages of this summer's World Cup in France, which kicks off on 7 June and is live across BBC TV, radio and online. Japan knocked England out in the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2015 but failed to impose themselves following a dominant first-half display from the Lionesses. Taylor lit up the show, using her pace to cause the defence problems and showing her class to set up Staniforth with an excellent pass on the turn. The Euro 2017 golden boot winner then lifted an inch-perfect ball into Carney to pick up a second assist within 23 minutes. But Keira Walsh's sensational diagonal ball set up the goal of the night as Mead took it in her stride before cutting into the box and firing into the back of the net. That rounded off a near-perfect opening half, with Izzy Christiansen's injury the only negative for Phil Neville's side. Japan came out of the blocks with more intensity in the second half and came close through Rikako Kobayashi and Aya Sameshima. Substitute Yuka Momiki should have scored just before the hour but she dragged her shot wide from close-range under pressure from England keeper Carly Telford. Telford was also forced to tip Kobayashi's half-volley over the bar after Hina Sugita's header bounced inches wide of the left post. Neville's substitutions disrupted rhythm after the break, but England's lead was never in any danger as Japan failed to match the clinical shooting the Lionesses displayed in the first half. England manager Phil Neville speaking to BBC Sport: ""It was a sensational performance. I wasn't that bothered before the tournament whether we won or lost, I just wanted to see an improvement and we go home knowing we are definitely in the right direction. ""We just keep listening to the USA, Japan and Brazil talk about how good we are. But we remain humble, have fun and enjoy moments like this. ""You don't get many chances to get your hands on a trophy. It is my first as a manager so I am just going to enjoy it. It's great for everybody but I think we have bigger things to aim for. We will enjoy it but tomorrow we will look forward to the April camp."" On Izzy Christiansen's injury: ""It looks bad. But she's strong. We have lost Jordan Nobbs already in the build-up. Christiansen is vital to our squad. Hopefully she will be OK."" Former England forward Sue Smith on BBC TV: ""That will send out a statement to the rest of the world. That was a fantastic, professional performance. England had to defend in the second half and they did. It was brilliant from an England perspective."" Ex-Arsenal and England international Alex Scott on BBC TV: ""In the friendly games we have been wasteful in front of goal but the goals we have scored in this tournament have been fantastic. We have been more clinical. ""Japan's defending could have been better but England have improved so I want to look at those positives. It's that winning feeling. There are so many positives to take from this tournament and you get to pick up silverware.""

Nikita Parris saw a late penalty, awarded for Maria Thorisdottir's foul on England captain Steph Houghton, well saved by Ingrid Hjelmseth. But that did not dampen England's jubilant mood at full-time, as they celebrated with sheer joy after moving within one win of their first major final. White's tap-in took her goals tally to five for the tournament, putting her joint leader in the race for the Golden Boot alongside the United States' Alex Morgan and Australia's Sam Kerr. Backed by thousands of delighted travelling fans, the Lionesses will now face either France or the US in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Lyon. The hosts and the holders meet in their highly anticipated last-eight tie on Friday at 20:00 BST. England's well-deserved progression also boosted their hopes of representing Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics, with the three best-finishing European teams qualifying for next summer's Tokyo Games. England's three fine goals entertained the 21,111 fans who were at Le Havre's Stade Oceane near the English Channel, including delighted former men's internationals David Beckham and Ian Wright, who witnessed a memorable performance. The Lionesses, who reached the last four at the 2015 World Cup in Canada and 2017 European Championship, arrived in France with realistic ambitions of winning a first major title and they showed their true potential on Thursday. Wins over Scotland, Argentina and Japan saw England top Group D without finding their best form, while a victory over an unruly Cameroon side followed in the last 16. The quarter-final against Norway was without doubt the Lionesses' strongest display of the finals so far. Two excellent team moves down the right gave them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead, with Scott putting England in front in the third minute after Bronze's cut-back. Lively winger Parris then clipped wide from close range and a confident White fired on to the post as England created the best chances, before the Manchester City-bound striker tucked in from Parris' unselfish square ball. Backed by their buoyant fans' band, who danced in celebration long after the full-time whistle, England deservedly lapped up the applause before their journey continues to Lyon. Norway, who won the 1995 title, were playing in their sixth World Cup quarter-final, but were well beaten by a side ranked nine places above them. Martin Sjogren's team struggled to win the ball in midfield in the early stages and, when they did get in threatening positions in the first half, Barcelona forward Caroline Graham Hansen was repeatedly thwarted by England centre-back Millie Bright. Aiming to reach the last four for the first time since 2007, Norway did create good opportunities in the second period but were denied by some last-ditch defending. Houghton did well to clear substitute Lisa-Marie Utland's effort off the line, having earlier intervened to deny Graham Hansen a seemingly certain goal just after the break. Norway had not previously conceded a first-half goal in finishing second in Group A and eliminating Australia on penalties in the last 16. But they always faced a difficult task after Scott's early strike went in off the post and they could have lost by more if it was not for Parris' second missed penalty from three attempts at these finals. Norway have been without Women's Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg because she has refused to play for the national side since 2017, having taken a stand against what she describes as a lack of respect for female players in the country. There was a confidence about England's mannerisms as they found red-hot form as a heatwave gripped large parts of France, although a coastal breeze in the port city of Le Havre helped reduce the humidity. Arguably for the first time this summer, they sent a warning to their title rivals, two of whom meet in Paris on Friday. With the form of White - who became England's all-time leading scorer at the Women's World Cup with six goals - they will pose a major threat in the semi-finals. ""We'll have to raise our game against France or the USA but we know we can match up against either one of those teams,"" said Bronze. ""We can get a rest and watch the rest of the quarter-finals now."" England boss Phil Neville: ""That was the best they have played under me. Yesterday, I knew we were going to win this game because of the look in their eyes and the 11 that didn't play were driving it. ""This is where we want to be. We paid respect to Norway but we are the third best team in the world and we have confidence in our own ability. We heard how they were going to outrun us and we stuck to our plan and passed the ball and the ball never got tired."" Norway boss Martin Sjogren: ""We lost against a team that was better than us. We had belief that we could hurt England but at this stage of the tournament, all the teams are very good. ""I'm proud of how the players have represented Norway and how they've behaved. We would have loved to stay on, but England deserved to go through."" England and Lyon midfielder Izzy Christiansen on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Norway looked knackered and we were not. We were fresh and slick and the second goal in particular, Ellen White just puts it into the back of the net without thinking about it. ""That was a performance that had been stored up and it came out tonight."" Former England player Alex Scott on BBC One: ""Lucy Bronze announced herself at the last World Cup and she has to deal with people knowing her game. She showed why she is the best right-back in the world. ""She loves a challenge, tell her 'you are the best, now you have to be the best player in the world' and she rises to that. I knew Lucy would take my place in the team and I give her a huge pat on the back for that."" Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""That was the most convincing performance England have put out. Norway have been a dominant force in women's football forever, and to see them very much second best is very rare."" Formation  4-4-2 Formation  4-1-4-1 Match ends, Norway 0, England 3.

31,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,"Samuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. ""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. ""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy."" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""

32,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61233604,Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp's Reds take control of Champions League semi,"Liverpool took a giant stride towards another Champions League final with a commanding victory over Villarreal at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing Reds had to demonstrate patience to break down a Villarreal side well organised by European specialist Unai Emery. Liverpool were held at bay despite creating all the chances and needed a touch of fortune to break the deadlock after 53 minutes when Jordan Henderson's cross was deflected beyond Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli by Pervis Estupinan. Sadio Mane increased Liverpool's control when he touched Mohamed Salah's pass beyond Rulli two minutes later. The second leg in Villarreal is still to come next Tuesday but Liverpool now look firmly on course to meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Paris in May. Liverpool just seem to be gathering unstoppable momentum as all challenges, even from a Villarreal side that claimed the scalps of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds, are overcome. Villarreal set out to take the sting out of the home team from the first whistle, taking an age over goal-kicks and other restarts, but unlike the frustration that overtook them at times against Everton at Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool remained composed, seemingly safe in their knowledge that their chance would come. And so it proved as they moved through the gears at the start of the second half, a change of tempo that proved too much for Villarreal, with Fabinho having a goal disallowed even before Henderson's attempted cross took that crucial touch off Estupinan. Klopp was able to remove the tireless Henderson and goalscorer Mane from the fray as Liverpool remained in control. Liverpool possess such threat that it is almost impossible for a team to simply sit out and hope to keep them away, such is the array of attacking riches now at Klopp's disposal. It is a collection of such power that he was able to keep Diogo Jota on the bench until that two-goal cushion was established, such has been the stunning impact of January signing Luis Diaz. Diaz gave an electrifying performance, with two first-half shots that were simply too powerful for Rulli to hold, while his change of pace troubled Villarreal all night. Klopp and Liverpool will take nothing for granted but such is their form and confidence, it is hard to see how even a side as durable as Villarreal can haul this back. Liverpool now turn their attentions back to the Premier League pursuit of Manchester City when they travel to in-form Newcastle United on Saturday (12:30 BST). The historic quadruple is still on and the celebrations at the final whistle here suggested the Kop believes that what most observers thought was impossible is now a genuine possibility. Emery's body language and impassioned gestures in the closing moments, enraged when Villarreal players conceded possession, suggested he thinks his side are still in this Champions League semi-final despite a two-goal deficit. He has every right to hold out hope with his stellar record in these two-leg formats, having won the Europa League four times with Sevilla and Villarreal and defied the odds to take 'the Yellow Submarine' into the last four of the Champions League. It will surely require something spectacular, even for this European expert, for Villarreal to disrupt a side of Liverpool's stature. Villarreal were drilled to the last detail in defence but they were not given any opportunity to launch the devastating counter-attacks that did such damage to Juventus and Bayern Munich. Emery can never be discounted but Villarreal did not show enough here to suggest they can stop Liverpool reaching their third Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp. Player of the match ManéSadio Mané 7.87 7.82 7.69 7.61 7.43 7.43 7.39 7.37 7.34 7.27 7.01 6.98 6.97 6.86 6.85 5.60 5.40 5.36 5.23 5.04 5.02 4.96 4.94 4.94 4.89 4.83 4.39 4.28 4.27 4.24 4.20 Formation  4-3-3 Formation  4-4-2 Match ends, Liverpool 2, Villarreal 0.

33,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198620,Aston Villa 2-0 Norwich City: Canaries relegated from Premier League,"Norwich were relegated from the Premier League with defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. The tame loss, coupled with Burnley's dramatic comeback win at Watford, left the Canaries bottom of the table and 13 points from safety with four games to play. Their fans continued to support as a relegation that has looked on the cards for some time was confirmed. Ollie Watkins put Villa ahead in the first half, capitalising on a slip from Brandon Williams before lashing high into the net. Williams' error summed up Norwich's season, as did their lack of potency in front of goal. They created limited openings, while Villa hit the woodwork in each half. Danny Ings added a late goal in stoppage time to add to Norwich's misery. Manager Dean Smith said ""plans are already in place"" for their bid to return to the top flight. ""I think over the past four to five weeks, there's probably been an inevitability about it,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed that we got relegated today because I thought our performance was good, but unfortunately over the season, the performances have not been good enough and we've lacked the quality required in this league. ""[The players] are very down, very dejected."" The low-key win for Villa ended a five-match winless run, lifted them to 13th in the table and took them to the 40-point mark. This is the third successive time Norwich have been immediately relegated following promotion to the Premier League. The afternoon was particularly painful for Smith, given that he left Villa earlier this season. In truth, Norwich's slide back to the second tier has looked likely throughout a season when they have rarely reached the standard required of a top-flight team. Again, they were spirited and had good spells in possession, but their lack of threat in front of goal was once again laid bare, a diving stop to deny Milot Rashica from distance the only serious save Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make. Norwich have the fewest shots (336), fewest shots on target (100) and lowest shot conversion rate (7%) of all Premier League sides this season. There were issues at the back too, with Villa's opener coming from a long, hopeful ball that was not cleared, even before Williams' slip. The full-back was also outmuscled by Watkins, whose finish was aided by a slight deflection. At full-time the Norwich fans applauded their side's effort and there was no outpouring of emotion. The club's joint majority shareholder Delia Smith watched from the stands and some may again question the hierarchy's resistance to spending big following promotion. But their prudency, and manager Smith's previous promotion with Villa, should leave Norwich well placed to bounce back once again. ""We will try everything to come up again,"" said Smith. ""It is a very difficult league to stay in. I spent £125m at Villa [after promotion in 2019] to keep us up. For Villa this was a much-needed boost. It all but ends any fears of an unlikely slip towards relegation themselves, their winless run having seen them drop from ninth to 15th.

35,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198625,Watford 1-2 Burnley: Two late goals lift Clarets five points clear of relegation zone,"Burnley scored twice in the final seven minutes to complete a dramatic comeback that pulled them five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone and left hosts Watford on the brink of the drop. Jack Cork's diving header from Charlie Taylor's left-wing cross cancelled out James Tarkowski's early own goal, before Josh Brownhill found the bottom corner from the edge of the box to spark jubilant scenes among the travelling fans and in the away dugout at Vicarage Road. Watford had taken a deserved early lead when Juraj Kucka's fierce effort struck the crossbar before rebounding off the unfortunate Tarkowski and into the unguarded net. The Hornets carried the greater threat in the first half, Kiko Femenia striking the near post from an inswinging corner and Joao Pedro blazing over the crossbar after escaping the Clarets defence. Aaron Lennon and Ashley Barnes forced fine saves out of Ben Foster in the second half, but there was little the veteran goalkeeper could do about either of the visitors' late goals, which came in the space of three minutes and stretched Mike Jackson's unbeaten start as Clarets caretaker manager to four matches. The Hornets' 11th consecutive home defeat leaves them 12 points adrift of Burnley and Leeds with only four games remaining. Before Saturday, the only side in the top four tiers of English football to have lost more than 10 consecutive home league games were Rochdale, who suffered 14 straight defeats in Division Three North between 1931 and 1932. It was all going so well for Watford, who were full of energy in the early stages and could have added to Tarkowski's own goal. Burnley's captain had to fling himself in the way of another Kucka strike minutes after putting into his own net, before the returning Pedro blazed over. The visitors thought they had won a penalty when Dwight McNeil's heels were clipped by Moussa Sissoko. However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall. Emmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten. Burnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger. The home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw. Foster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining. Brownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick. This is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets. The last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.

36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61287385,Watford 1-2 Burnley: Mike Jackson leads Clarets five points clear of relegation zone,"Two weeks ago, the question on many people's lips was: ""What are Burnley doing?"" Sean Dyche, a manager with experience of escaping relegation, was sacked and replaced by caretaker Mike Jackson, whose last foray into management ended in the sack at Tranmere. Four games on, Jackson has pulled Burnley five points clear of the drop with a remarkable run - the best start of any Burnley manager for 31 years. The Clarets are not out of trouble yet - but Jackson's Burnley are the form team at the bottom. Remarkably, their dramatic late 2-1 win over Watford on Saturday was the first time they have won when trailing at half-time away from home in the Premier League. ""Burnley's fans stayed for 20 minutes to sing 'Super Mike Jackson',"" former Brighton striker Glenn Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He has united a football club. ""He has tweaked Burnley's identity and given the players more time on the ball. Maybe they aren't playing under such direct instruction and they feel happier for that."" Jackson's only previous first-team managerial experience was at Shrewsbury and Tranmere. At Tranmere he was sacked after just three months, having won just two of his first 10 games in League Two. But since being promoted from his role as Burnley's Under-23 coach, Jackson has guided the first team to a draw at West Ham, followed by victories over Southampton, Wolves and now Watford - making a run of five losses from six league games a distant memory. In the 48-year-old's four games, Burnley have a better rate of goals scored, expected goals, shots, touches in the opposition box, passes in the opposition half and possession than under Dyche this season - and are playing fewer long balls. ""The freedom starts to come after a win or two and you start to realise you are decent players,"" former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said. ""Mike Jackson deserves great credit. ""It is leadership from all angles. They are all in together. It is amazing how winning does things to you."" Asked about the revival, Jackson said there had been ""no magic wand"", instead a matter of increased confidence among the Burnley players. ""I'd say you get those results, you get that more belief, a bit more feeling about yourself and the group starts to come together, they know what's at stake and obviously everything builds with that,"" he said. ""There's been no magic wand whatsoever. It's just reminding the players who they are and making sure they stick together as a group, stay honest and look after each other. That's the way we try to do it."" Midfielder Jack Cork explained the Liverpudlian's impact. ""He pulled us all together and reminded us how good we are,"" Cork said after the 2-1 victory at Watford. ""It is a massive part of this club that when things aren't going our way, we pull together - it has not just been these past few weeks. We never gave up and were probably the better team in the second half."" As it stands, Jackson has only been given the job on a ""game-by-game"" basis. But his haul of 10 points and no defeats with a relegation-threatened team must rank among the best caretaker stints in recent memory. Perhaps the most famous caretaker manager of all is Roberto di Matteo, who won the Champions League and FA Cup after taking over from Andre Villas-Boas at Chelsea in 2012. Guus Hiddink was another interim Chelsea boss to have strong success. In his first of popular two caretaker stints he won the FA Cup, having taken charge after Luis Felipe Scolari was sacked. And it may have ended badly, but who can forget Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell as Manchester United caretaker manager? After Jose Mourinho was sacked, the Norwegian began with a 12-game unbeaten run, winning 10, and memorably oversaw a Champions League knockout win over Paris St-Germain.

37,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198622,Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Naby Keita scores as Reds keep up the pressure on Man City,"Liverpool kept themselves firmly in the fight for the quadruple as they overcame a spirited Newcastle to keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp made five changes at St James' Park, including leaving top scorer Mohamed Salah on the bench, after the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. It looked like it would backfire as in-form Newcastle started strongly, pressing Liverpool high and forcing them into a couple of early mistakes. But Liverpool grew into the game and were dominating possession when Naby Keita struck in the 19th minute. The midfielder showed great composure as he dribbled across the box and past Martin Dubravka before slotting into the net. Sadio Mane should have made it 2-0 before the break when his shot on the counter was too close to Dubravka, who also made a fine save from a Diogo Jota header. The Newcastle fans, who were aggrieved that play continued in the lead-up to Liverpool's goal because Fabian Schar was down injured, thought Miguel Almiron had equalised after rounding Alisson, only for the effort was ruled out for offside. The hosts also made a lively start to the second half, although Liverpool went closest to adding a second with Mane shooting wide from close range before Jota's shot was pushed over. It was not a vintage Liverpool display, but they got the job done and they are second, one point behind Manchester City, who won at Leeds later on Saturday to reclaim top spot after a brief spell in first place for the Reds. The Liverpool line-up may have intrigued City boss Pep Guardiola, who, while focused on his own side's pursuit of a treble, will no doubt welcome any helping hand in denting his rivals' title bid. Thiago - excellent in the 2-0 Champions League semi-final win against Villarreal in midweek - was on the bench alongside Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. It could have been seen as a big risk, but instead it emphasised the incredible strength in depth in this Liverpool squad. James Milner came in and was his dependable self, providing experience in midfield, while Joe Gomez was solid at right-back and the front three of Luis Diaz, Jota and Mane caused as many problems as any of the attacking combinations Liverpool could field. When Newcastle pressed for an equaliser in the closing stages, Liverpool were able to send on Thiago, Salah and Fabinho to see the game out. Against a side who had won their previous six home games, Liverpool fans had a right to feel apprehensive, but the Reds overcame a big hurdle that serves only to strengthen the feeling that they will end this season with multiple trophies. Only Liverpool and City boast a better record in 2022 than Newcastle and there was understandably a buoyant mood among the home fans before kick-off. The match provided Newcastle with an opportunity to show what sort of threat they pose to teams at the top end of the table - and they certainly gave a good account of themselves. They started superbly, getting at Liverpool from the outset and making their opponents nervous. Although Newcastle could not maintain their high-tempo start, there was still a sense of pride at St James' Park at the fight shown against one of the best sides in Europe.

38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198355,Shrewsbury Town 0-3 Wigan Athletic: Latics promoted as League One champions,"Will Keane scored twice as Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the Championship and the League One title with a clinical victory over Shrewsbury. The Latics only had to draw to be sure of returning to the second tier, but needed three points to be certain of going up as champions. An anxious final day was in prospect having wasted two previous chances to seal promotion. However, Max Power's tap-in just before the break settled the nerves and Keane's penalty and calm finish wrapped up victory for a side who were just a point away from relegation last season. Wigan's return to the second tier of English football comes two years after they dropped out of the Championship following a points penalty for going into administration. Rotherham's win over Gillingham took the Millers up as runners up, while MK Dons had to settle for third spot and a play-off place despite a 5-0 thrashing of Plymouth Argyle, who missed out on the top six. Ultimately, other results did not matter for Latics boss Leam Richardson, whose side showed urgency and attacking intent from the off, with Kell Watts heading over after a well-worked short corner and Power's 30-yard free-kick forcing Shrews keeper Marko Marosi into a fine save. The pressure told when the ball fell kindly for Power to score the opener from close range two minutes before the interval and the same player was involved in the second goal when his shot from outside box was handled by a diving Tom Flanagan. Keane knocked in the spot-kick and grabbed his second of the afternoon when he got on the end of James McClean's free-kick. To understand what it means to win promotion back to the Championship, it is important to know what Wigan have been through in less than two years. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, few considered them at risk of imminent financial instability. In July 2020, however, they entered administration when their Hong Kong owners conceded they could not support them financially, throwing an already chaotic season into further disarray. With a 12-point deduction looming, the Latics had six games left to build a cushion on the relegation places to avoid the drop to League One. Under former boss Paul Cook they put up quite the fight, including beating Hull City 8-0 to equal the biggest victory in Championship history, losing just once in their final 15 games, but their spirited efforts were not enough. A failed appeal against the points deduction followed, as did a fan-led crowdfunding campaign to save the club - leading to more than £600,000 being raised. Cook - and many of the club's squad - left the Latics just before they tentatively began the 2020-21 League One season. In March 2021, Bahraini businessman Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi bought the club after an ill-fated deal with a Spanish consortium collapsed, ending nearly a year of financial uncertainty, and the club later avoided relegation to League Two by just a point. This season, under Richardson's stewardship, the club has reached the FA Cup fourth round - as well as the semi-final of the Papa John's Trophy - as the turnaround began. Just one defeat in their final 13 games saw Richardson claw them over the line to restore their place in English football's second tier. Bill Rice - Sports Editor, BBC Radio Manchester It's only just over a year since Wigan Athletic's future was secured with a takeover bringing the club out of administration, so to earn promotion back to the Championship as champions is a phenomenal achievement. The consortium led by Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi has delivered on their promises, providing boss Leam Richardson with the tools to build a promotion-winning squad, and he has done just that, even overcoming the loss of striker Charlie Wyke, who suffered a cardiac arrest in November that ended his season. Becoming a stable Championship club was the aim from day one and they are halfway there. This Wigan might not be as swashbuckling or pretty on the eye as sides of years gone by, but they are efficient, dangerous and manage games as well as anyone - and have performers right across the pitch to call upon when required. The goalkeeper and defence have been solid and stable, the midfield pairing of Tom Naylor and Max Power have won battles all season long, and - in forwards like Will Keane and Callum Lang - the Latics have match-winners when required.

39,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198302,Gillingham 0-2 Rotherham United: Millers seal promotion with win that relegates Gills,"Rotherham United sealed promotion to the Championship and consigned Gillingham to relegation to League Two with victory at the Priestfield Stadium. It is the fourth time in nine seasons that the Millers have been promoted to the Championship, having yo-yoed between League One and the second division. Rarmani Edmonds-Green's poked first-half finish and a late second from substitute Georgie Kelly, on his debut, in the tense and high-stakes final-day meeting was enough to once again send the Millers up. Ben Thompson hit the underside of the bar for Gillingham just before the break, but that is as close as they came from taking something from a game that ended their nine-season stay in League One. Edmonds-Green, who threatened early, put Paul Warne's Millers on track for promotion with his close-range finish on 34 minutes. Gillingham goalkeeper Aaron Chapman ensured Rotherham could not relax in pursuit of promotion in a game they had to win, brilliantly denying Ben Wiles from close range just before the hour. Wiles was again denied late on before Kelly, a January arrival from Bohemians, sealed victory with a clinical 89th-minute strike. Rotherham have once again been promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking. The Millers have now been promoted to or relegated from the second tier in each of the past six seasons, becoming the second club to bounce between two divisions for six consecutive seasons since Wimbledon did so, between the third and fourth tiers, between 1978 and 1984. Warne's side suffered heartbreak as they went down on the final day of the 2020-21 campaign despite drawing with Cardiff. They made an indifferent start to the season, with just three wins from their first seven league matches, but then embarked on a run that saw them go unbeaten in all competitions between 11 September and 26 December. A run of one league win in seven matches from the start of March, that included a first home defeat since September, saw them drop down to third behind Wigan and MK Dons. However, three wins from their final five matches proved to be enough to get them over the line. Promotion ultimately caps a fine season for the South Yorkshire side, who claimed silverware in April, amid their poor league form, when they won the Papa Johns Trophy at Wembley against League Two side Sutton. This is Warne's third promotion in his five-and-a-half-years in charge of the club and, prior to Saturday's game at Gillingham, he acknowledged that going up this season would top the previous two. ""I want the players to have that moment in time that will keep them connected forever. If we can go up automatically it will be the greatest achievement I have ever had, given the quality in this league,"" he told BBC Radio Sheffield. Attention will now turn to seeing if they can put together a squad capable of staying in the Championship, having failed to do so in each of their past three attempts. It's been a difficult season for Gillingham, who have been among the strugglers throughout the campaign, winning only three league games by the end of January. Boss Steve Evans had already been linked with the job at Stevenage before he left the Gills early in the new year following a run of 13 matches without a win in all competitions. He was replaced by former Millwall and Cardiff manager Neil Harris on 31 January and his arrival coincided with an upturn in form, with Gillingham winning five and drawing three of his first 12 games in charge to climb four points clear of the relegation zone. However, they were unable to maintain that momentum as they failed to win any of their final six games to drop into the fourth tier for the first time since 2013.

40,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198301,AFC Wimbledon 3-4 Accrington Stanley: Dons relegated after defeat,"AFC Wimbledon's relegation to League Two was confirmed after they lost a seven-goal thriller at home to mid-table Accrington Stanley. The Dons started the day in 22nd, three points behind 20th-placed Fleetwood with a goal difference seven worse than their relegation rivals - meaning a fair swing was required to overhaul them. First-half goals from Jay Rich-Baghuelou, Colby Bishop and Michael Nottingham ended any slim hopes of a miraculous final-day escape for the hosts, though they did restore some pride through efforts from Ayoub Assal and Jack Rudoni. Accrington made it 4-2 thanks to John O'Sullivan, with Rudoni's second not nearly enough to save Mark Bowen's side from the drop. It means Wimbledon end the season winless in 27 league games, the longest run by a side within a single season in England's top four tiers since Derby's run of 32 in the 2007-08 Premier League campaign. Though Fleetwood were beaten 4-2 at Bolton, the Dons would still have had to win by five goals to stay up. Victory for John Coleman's Accrington, meanwhile, saw them finish 12th and secure a top-half finish. It is the first time that Wimbledon have been relegated since they were formed by fans of Wimbledon FC in 2002. They have struggled to get out of the bottom six all season and also found goals hard to come by, having won just six of their 46 league games. Former Wales international Bowen was only appointed manager on 30 March, after the club parted company with Mark Robinson. He has been unable to steer them to a win in his seven games in charge, including a 3-1 defeat by already-relegated Crewe earlier in April. But a winless league run stretching back to early December has ultimately cost the Dons their League One status. Having been formed from the aftermath of Wimbledon's move to Milton Keynes in 2003, AFC Wimbledon won six promotions from the ninth-tier Combined Counties League up to League One in the space of just 14 years. The club also finally relocated to their former home in Merton in November 2020, as their redeveloped Plough Lane ground was completed. But after finishing 19th and 20th twice in the past three seasons, surviving by a combined seven points in that time, staying up has proved beyond them this season.

Rovers were 23rd in the table coming into their final game, three points from safety but with a substantially worse goal difference than their relegation rivals - meaning they were already realistically down. Billy Bodin put the U's ahead with a rebound from close range, with the visitors levelling through Josh Martin midway through the second half. Gary McSheffrey's Doncaster end the season 22nd on 38 points - only once have they recorded fewer points in the third tier of a Football League season - in 1987-88 when they earned 33 points. Oxford, meanwhile, finish eighth in League One, having seen their play-off bid end in recent weeks. Doncaster started the season badly with four points from their first nine league games, including a 6-0 drubbing at Ipswich, leaving them rock-bottom in League One. That improved slightly to an overall 13 points from 19 league games in December but, with Rovers still six points from safety, the club sacked Richie Wellens as manager after only six months in charge. McSheffrey was promoted from leading Rovers' under-18s side and guided the first team to some spirited results, including wins at play-off chasing sides MK Dons and Sunderland, which kept them in contention to stay up. Doncaster at least lifted themselves off the bottom of the table - helped by Crewe's dreadful run of 15 defeats in 16 games - before they ultimately relegated the Alex by beating them three weeks before their own drop was ultimately sealed. Rovers, who last went down - also from League One - in 2016, beat Burton 2-0 last Saturday, giving them a small source of hope, but with just 10 league wins all season relegation was ultimately out of their hands. This season is the first since 2003-04 in which they have played without talismanic former midfielder James Coppinger following the 41-year-old's retirement in May 2021, after a club record of 695 games in all competitions.

42,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61075987,Fulham 3-0 Preston North End: Whites clinch Premier League return,"Fulham crushed Preston to seal their Premier League return as Aleksandar Mitrovic's double took his season's tally to 40 goals. The Serbian striker netted twice in the first half, sandwiching an eye-catching strike by teenager Fabio Carvalho. Mitrovic was denied a hat-trick by Preston goalkeeper Daniel Iversen - but it made no difference to the outcome as victory confirmed promotion for Marco Silva's side. Fulham could effectively secure the title as early as Saturday if they win at second-placed Bournemouth. The Cottagers might have fallen behind early on, with Marek Rodak called into action to thwart Ched Evans and then tip Ben Whiteman's long-range drive over the bar. But any hint of nerves swiftly evaporated in the ninth minute as Joe Bryan won possession and burst down the left flank to set up Mitrovic, who slid the ball through Iversen's legs. Carvalho and Harrison Reed went close to extending the lead as the home side seized control, repeatedly slicing through Preston's defence. It was Carvalho who did eventually grab Fulham's second in the 34th minute, rifling home on his left foot after Neeskens Kebano's cross had deflected perfectly into his path. Mitrovic made it 3-0 just before half-time, reaching the 40-goal mark after another incisive break along the left, with Harry Wilson providing the assist. North End nearly reduced the deficit early in the second half as Rodak produced another fingertip save to foil Cameron Archer, palming his attempt on to the woodwork. But there was to be no dramatic Preston comeback - nor a third goal for Mitrovic, who had two more attempts kept out by Iversen and was eventually substituted with a quarter of an hour remaining. Although Neco Williams' effort from distance whistled just over, Fulham had to be content with the three goals - and the win that wrapped up their third promotion in five years. The clinical Cottagers have shot through the Championship like a bolt of lightning and look set to smash a number of records as they win promotion back to the top tier with four games to spare. Marco Silva's swashbuckling brand of fast transitions and quick passing has seen them score 98 goals so far. They could still break Manchester City's Championship second-tier record, since the launch of the Premier League in 1992, of 108 goals. Silva's men also wrote themselves into the history books in January when they scored 19 goals in three games and were the first English side in 88 years to score six or more goals in three consecutive games. Serbian striker Mitrovic's 40 goals - already another Championship record - have helped propel Fulham out of sight at the top of the table and all eyes will be on him at the start of next season to see if he can finally recreate his scintillating Championship form against the country's top defences in the Premier League. The west London club have been something of a yo-yo club in the past few seasons, with consecutive promotions and relegations to and from the Premier League every season since their 2017-18 play-off final victory against Aston Villa. Emma Jones, BBC Radio London When Marco Silva became the new Fulham manager, he knew he was taking on the job of leading the team straight back to the Premier League. His first task was to rebuild a squad that had been heavily reliant on loans under Scott Parker in the top flight. But also to rebuild the confidence of players who will have felt they hadn't performed as they'd hoped, or hadn't been given the chance, during another relegation season. New signing Harry Wilson made an instant impact with a goal on the opening day. While a 5-1 win in Fulham's first away match at Huddersfield provided an early indication of just what the team might achieve. That big victory also included a first goal of many for Aleksandar Mitrovic and one from young star Fabio Carvalho, as he began to make headlines that are set to lead to a big move to Liverpool. Wilson looks to have been the best of the new additions, with Silva ultimately relying on the old guard to get the results. And while there will be plenty of praise for Mitrovic, Fulham are far from a one-man team with 'Captain America' Tim Ream one of many players who has had an excellent season. The questions though remain the same. What lessons have the club learnt from previous promotions to ensure they stay up this time? Are the players who have got them up good enough to keep them up? And will any new additions be the right fit for the challenge ahead? Fulham head coach Marco Silva: ""All season he (Mitrovic) has been exceptional. I have to manage his condition - you know how he can play with his energy when he is fresh. ""There was a lot of energy from the first minute. We had to get the job done tonight and we need to be proud of what we achieved. ""We delivered to the club and the fans who deserved this. I am proud of the players as this was the goal on the first day - automatic promotion. ""The season has been fantastic for the fans. Last season was really tough for all of them and we have done this for them."" Preston manager Ryan Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""Congratulations to Fulham. I thought we could have scored in the first five minutes and then maybe the game changes a little bit. ""But you can't give a team like Fulham the opportunities to score that we did - they'll punish you and we found ourselves 3-0 down. ""You only have to look at the star man who scores the goals and that is the difference - they've got that quality. ""I thought we were a lot better second half, but ultimately we were outclassed in the first half."" Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  3-1-4-2 Match ends, Fulham 3, Preston North End 0.

43,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062993,QPR 1-0 Derby County: Rams relegated to League One,"Derby County have been relegated from the Championship after suffering a dramatic late defeat at Queens Park Rangers. Luke Amos' 88th-minute winner for QPR, coupled with Reading's remarkable 4-4 draw against Swansea, consigned Wayne Rooney's beleaguered Rams to the drop to League One. Relegation with three games to go means Derby will play in England's third tier for the first time since 1986. Their fight for survival, in a campaign crippled by a 21-point deduction, could only have been prolonged if they equalled or bettered Reading's result. When Amos coolly slipped the ball past goalkeeper Ryan Allsop, their hopes of staying up had taken a major blow but were not over. However, Tom McIntyre's 95th-minute leveller for Reading left the Rams 10 points behind the 21st-placed Royals with three games remaining. Even then, Tom Lawrence was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Charlie Austin to compound Derby's misery. QPR ended a six-match winless run to move up to 10th in the table and to within two points of the top six, although sixth-placed Sheffield United could increase that gap if they beat Bristol City later on Monday. In a nervy first half of the high-stakes game in west London, Amos had an early goal ruled out for offside while Luke Plange skimmed Derby's best chance off the top off the crossbar with a header. A crucial block from Derby full-back Nathan Byrne to foil Lyndon Dykes after the half-hour mark summed up the steadfast determination Rooney's Rams have played with throughout a fraught campaign. If not for the 21-point deduction this season, for entering administration and breaching the EFL's financial regulations, Derby would be 17th in the table and almost as close to the play-off places as the relegation spots. Allsop made two crucial second-half saves, denying Ilias Chair and Dykes, but Amos finished a quick counter attack with two minutes left to break Derby's resistance and ultimately shatter what hopes they had of avoiding the drop. Derby's spirited attempt to stay in the Championship is over, but the protracted efforts to sell the club are ongoing. US businessman Chris Kirchner was confirmed as the preferred bidder to buy the club earlier this month, but while the sale continues it means Derby remain in administration - having been placed there by former owner Mel Morris 208 days ago. With just five players contracted for next season and the Rams under a transfer embargo, rebuilding the East Midlands club in League One will present significant challenges for whoever is involved. Rooney's future with the Rams is also uncertain, with the 36-year-old linked with the vacant job at Premier League side Burnley. Earlier this season he rejected an approach from boyhood club Everton to speak to them about taking charge at Goodison Park. Analysis - Ed Dawes, BBC Radio Derby's Derby County commentator The effort, energy, creativity, fighting for the cause, camaraderie. It's all been there in recent months. Those relationships have meant this team have taken it to game 43 with a 21-point deduction and that has to be commended. The amount of players that have been introduced and brought through, that's a good starting block for next season. If they can get one or two senior players to sign new contracts and play for Wayne Rooney next season, even in League One, then Derby have a fighting chance. Minus 15 points is a very strong possibility next season, but that's from the off and not in late September. Derby fans should be very proud of their team and I'm sure they are.

44,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61115597,Huddersfield Town 2-1 Barnsley: Defeat consigns Tykes to relegation to League One,"Barnsley were relegated to League One following defeat by promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town, who themselves sealed a Championship play-off spot. Jordan Rhodes headed in from close range after a Huddersfield corner was deflected into his path to give the hosts an early lead. Harry Toffolo was then found completely unmarked to tap in with a cool finish to double their advantage just before the break. In a subdued second half, Barnsley found a late consolation through Callum Styles' impressive strike from the edge of the box but it was too late as their fate was confirmed. The Tykes, who stay bottom, are 11 points behind 21st-placed Reading with three games left this season. Barnsley's three-season stay in English football's second tier comes to an end, while Huddersfield move to within a point of second-placed Bournemouth. However, the Cherries have three games in hand on the Terriers and are still heavy favourites to claim the second automatic promotion place. Huddersfield had lost just two of their past 23 Championship games while Barnsley arrived at the John Smith's Stadium having not won since 15 March and having won just eight points on their travels this term. Barnsley needed a victory to keep up their slim hopes of Championship survival but Rhodes made that task even harder when he put the hosts ahead inside four minutes. The former Scotland striker had to wait for confirmation that the goal would stand after a late flag went up for offside from the assistant referee. But it was eventually given after it was judged the ball had deflected off a Barnsley defender as they tried to defend the corner, leading to Rhodes' simple header. But it was Toffolo's goal just before half-time that epitomised Barnsley's position, as the visitors failed to pick his run into the box, leaving him to latch onto Danel Sinani's cross to fire low past Tykes keeper Jack Walton. Styles' late strike was a bitter-sweet consolation for the visitors, who rarely threatened during an abject 90 minutes where Huddersfield controlled much of the match. Relegation after a season of struggle ends an eventful three-year stay in the second tier for the club who have played more games at this level than anyone else. They scored a last-minute winner at Brentford in the final game of the Covid-hit 2019-20 season to miraculously avoid relegation and send Charlton down instead. Gerhard Struber, who had taken over midway through that campaign after the sacking of Daniel Stendel, left soon into 2020-21 for MLS side New York Red Bulls and was replaced by Valerien Ismael. The former Bayern Munich man oversaw a remarkable turn around of the team's fortunes and improbably guided them to a fifth place finish. They fell to defeat by Swansea in the play-offs and Ismael, along with influential captain Alex Mowatt, both left for West Brom. His replacement Markus Schopp won only one of his 13 games in charge, a victory over Coventry in their first home game, and departed in November after a run of seven straight losses. Sweden Under-21 coach Poya Asbaghi took over but failed to win any of his first 11 league matches at the helm, leaving relegation looking inevitable before finally ending his wait with a home victory against QPR. Surprisingly, that kick-started an upturn in fortunes as they won three times in February to give fans hope of staying up, with January loan signings Domingos Quina and Amine Bassi scoring crucial goals. They could not keep the run going though and conceded late equalisers in home games against Stoke and Fulham in the space of four days in March, at a time when victory in both would have seen them climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since 2 October. Still, they retained some hope up until Easter Monday's limp 2-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Peterborough in a game where they had more shots and more possession but failed to score against a team who had failed to keep a clean sheet away from home all season.

45,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124793,Peterborough United 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Sam Surridge's winner confirms relegation for Posh,"Peterborough were relegated from the Championship as Nottingham Forest kept alive their automatic promotion hopes with victory at the Weston Homes Stadium. Posh needed a win and Reading to drop points to maintain their slim chance of escaping the drop, but Sam Surridge's goal sent them back to League One. Brennan Johnson's fine cross to the back post picked out Surridge whose header back across goal found the far corner just before the break. A seventh win in eight games leaves Forest fourth and cuts the gap to second-placed Bournemouth to five points with four games left after the Cherries' draw with Fulham. Peterborough's defeat means all three relegation places have been confirmed with two games of the season left, with Barnsley having their fate sealed on Friday, and Derby dropping into League One on Monday. Forest, meanwhile, need just one more point to guarantee their play-off berth, but Steve Cooper's side still harbour even bigger ambitions despite Bournemouth's last-gasp penalty equaliser. Posh went close early on when Ricky-Jade Jones made space and forced Forest goalkeeper Brice Samba into a fine one-handed save, and the home fans had further hope when relegation rivals Reading fell behind. But it proved short-lived as Forest - who lacked spark in the first half - went ahead with only their second attempt thanks to Surridge's fifth goal of the season courtesy of more impressive play from Johnson. The hosts stepped up their urgency in the second half, but struggled to break down the visitors' defence, Harrison Burrows going closest with a strike which forced Samba to save at his near post. Yet it was Forest who went closest to the game's second goal late on, second-half substitute Lewis Grabban seeing a strike ruled out for offside before firing a first-time shot wide from close range. A difficult season has seen Posh struggle to replicate the form that saw them win automatic promotion from League One a year ago, conceding 84 goals - only Reading have leaked more in the Championship. With a run of 15 league games without a win between December and March, the club at one point looked resigned to its fate before showing fight which included wins over Barnsley, Blackburn and QPR. McCann - who himself finished above Peterborough in winning the league with Hull - was reappointed at London Road two months ago after former boss Darren Ferguson resigned and left the club for a third time. It represented something of a merry-go-round for the club and the Northern Irishman - who played for the club between 2010 and 2015 and previously managed them before being sacked in 2018 after no wins in seven matches. To rub salt into the wound, McCann lost to Hull in his opening match, weeks after the Tigers sacked him following their takeover by a Turkish consortium. Injuries to key players including strikers Jack Marriott have depleted their squad, while Jonson Clarke-Harris has scored 11 league goals compared to the 31 that won him last season's League One golden boot. Francis Green, former Peterborough striker and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire co-commentator A lot of people will say recruitment will be probably the main reason Posh have gone down. If you do get that wrong, ultimately it's going to cost you in the long run. Most will probably look at this as an opportunity missed because it took eight seasons to get back in the Championship and all of a sudden now, with some of the clubs that may be in League One next season - the likes of Derby, Sunderland, Ipswich - it's going to be very hard to get out. It obviously took until February for a managerial switch, with Grant McCann replacing Darren Ferguson, but still as a squad I don't think they'd have been good enough to stay in the Championship even if they made a change a little bit earlier. It's going to be a big, big challenge next season. When Posh did get promoted last season there was no-one in the grounds - you're not going to get a season like that again - it was a one-off type of season. These players are obviously capable of challenging for promotion next season, there's no doubt, and if they implement a way that McCann wants to play - and add a few players - then they've got a good opportunity, but they need to get it right from pre-season. Peterborough United boss Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""Today I couldn't fault the effort and attitude of the players. They have gone toe-to-toe with probably the best team in the league at the minute and were probably the better team over the first half. ""It's a disappointing day. I told the players you have got to feel this pain and use it to your advantage because the comeback's always stronger than the failure. ""I'm proud of everyone since I've come in. The help and support I've had from everyone at the football club has been great and I know that's going to continue for the remainder of the season and next season. ""We would love to get to the stage, hopefully under my tenure, where we are a sustainable Championship club and we're pushing, but one step at a time. We have to make sure we get out of the league (League One) next year."" Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""There's work to do (to reach the play-offs). I haven't looked at it (the table) if I'm honest - I don't even know what the other results are. ""We'll just stick to our plans. It's a busy period, four games left, so concentrate on our work, recover well and get down to Fulham and try and be in the best shape possible. ""Once we got the lead it was always going to be about managing it a little bit. Truth be told we should have probably got a second and third goal, particularly a second because they were always going to throw more players at the top end of the pitch. ""Credit to Peterborough, they really put up a good fight today. They've got a lot of good young players. It's easy to say now, on a day like today, but I have a lot of respect for Grant and he knows that."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  3-4-1-2 Match ends, Peterborough United 0, Nottingham Forest 1.

46,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.

47,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124970,Bristol Rovers 0-0 Forest Green Rovers: Forest Green promoted after draw,"Forest Green Rovers have been promoted to League One for the first time in their history, following a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers. The Gloucestershire team have been at the top of the table since September and are now eight points clear of fourth-placed Port Vale, who have only two matches remaining to Forest Green's three. Jamille Matt, Jack Aitchison and Nicky Cadden were all denied by Bristol Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw in the second half, while Luke McGee produced a fine save to thwart Luke Thomas at the other end. Bristol Rovers remain in fifth place, two points away from the automatic promotion places with two games left. Having looked to be racing towards League One only a few months ago, Forest Green have seen their push towards the automatic promotion finish line stumble of late. They fell to a shock 4-0 loss to Barrow on Good Friday, but then beat Oldham Athletic on Easter Monday and knew they needed one point against west country rivals Bristol Rovers to officially secure a top-three finish. Regan Hendry was close to getting an opening goal but his effort was cleared off the line, while Ebou Adams' strike forced Belshaw into making a one-handed save. Bristol Rovers have been on a fine run during the second half of this season and are still in the hunt for a top-three finish themselves, meaning there was little between the sides as Antony Evans and Elliot Anderson also saw chances go begging. But it was Forest Green who looked more like scoring with Matt denied from close range, as Belshaw was called on repeatedly to keep out the visitors. Still, a 0-0 draw has never seemed so welcome to a team as Forest Green staff and fans raced on to the pitch to start the celebrations at full-time. Forest Green's promotion to League One has looked so certain at points this season, it is easy to forget it has only been five years since the club was promoted to the English Football League for the first time. The majority of their 133-year history has seen them more as a local village team than a professional outfit. After falling short in the play-offs in each of the past two seasons, automatic promotion has been the main target for the squad. The appointment of former Wales, Aston Villa and Wolves defender Rob Edwards as manager last summer - the first senior job of his coaching career - has proved a masterstroke. Edwards, 39, has been praised for his forward-thinking approach. He signed few players and focussed on developing the young squad he already had - only seven of their 29 players are over 25 - fitting for someone who earned his coaching stripes working with the England youth teams. Consistency has also been key. Forest Green have sat at the top of the table since September, before going on a run of 19 matches unbeaten into February that pushed them 10 points clear. Remarkably, only 19 players have been fielded in the league and that has shown in their performances. This is a team that knows each other well and how they want to play. Striker Matty Stevens is among those to flourish under Edwards' management. Having spent most of last season out of favour and on loan, this term he has been a regular starter and the team's top scorer. His partnership with Matt up front - the 'Matt Attack' - has been so formidable they have scored 43 goals between them. Things have stuttered since February when Forest Green's unbeaten run came to an end and they went seven matches without a win. The pressure seemed to show and their advantage dramatically receded. But another four victories followed, and while a recent 4-0 defeat by bottom-of-the-table Barrow was a shock, Forest Green have got over the line - the 'little team on top of the hill' have secured a historic promotion to League One. Analysis - Paul Furley, BBC Radio Gloucestershire What a journey it's been for Forest Green Rovers - from the Stroud League in its early days at the start of the 20th century to League One. The club that was founded on a hill high above Nailsworth in 1889 never played an opponent outside of Gloucestershire until the 1970s, yet 40 years on from winning a double of the Hellenic League Premier Division and the FA Vase at Wembley, Rovers find themselves promoted to the third tier of English football. This is their fourth promotion in the last 25 years, the first two achieved under the stewardship of late chairman Trevor Horsley and manager Frank Gregan who took the club from obscurity to a place among the non-league elite and achieved a return to Wembley in the 1999 FA Trophy final. The recurring theme for the club down the years, according to Tim Barnard who wrote its official history and designed its current ground, is that every time it has needed someone to come in and take it to the next level, it has found that person. That is what it has done under Dale Vince as chairman and with Rob Edwards now in charge of the team. He has worked with a squad largely inherited from Mark Cooper's time at the New Lawn and taken them to automatic promotion in League Two.

48,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357319,Exeter City 2-1 Barrow: Grecians promoted from League Two after Matt Jay winner,"Matt Jay's late winner saw Exeter City secure promotion from League Two as they came from a goal down to beat Barrow 2-1 in a nervy affair at St James Park. The hosts fell behind to a bizarre Cameron Dawson own goal after Remeao Hutton's long throw-in from the left appeared to go straight in. Kieran Phillips hit the bar for Exeter 15 minutes later before the on-loan Huddersfield Town striker superbly broke to get the equaliser. Exeter struggled to create any chances after the break until homegrown skipper Jay coolly finished at the far post from Josh Key's cross from the right. The win sees Exeter return to League One after a decade in the fourth tier. Having started the better the hosts fell behind after Hutton's throw appeared to go straight into the net. But the referee, after a moment of deliberation and a glance at his assistant, gave the goal having judged that it had taken a touch off Exeter goalkeeper Dawson having hit the post. Exeter regrouped quickly as Tim Dieng, Jack Sparkes and Jay all had efforts as they had the better of the possession against a Barrow side assured of a third season in the EFL. Phillips should have put City level when he crashed an effort off the top of the bar from eight yards out after some superb build-up play by Jevani Brown. But he did find the net when Cheick Diabate's headed clearance from a free-kick fell to his feet midway in his own half and the 22-year-old raced through before his right-footed effort deflected off Patrick Brough and beat a wrong-footed Paul Farman at his near post. A nervy second half saw Exeter almost go behind when Hutton beat the offside trap, but his low shot was saved by the legs of Dawson just after the hour mark. But Exeter weathered the storm and Jay - a product of the club's much-vaunted academy who has risen to become skipper - superbly controlled Key's cross before blasting in to send almost 8,000 people in St James Park into raptures. Sam Nombe almost got a third as his shot was blocked after breaking through in the final minute, before Exeter's fans invaded the pitch on the final whistle as they won promotion on home turf for the first time since 1990. Exeter's sixth promotion in their 121-year history came after six years of heartbreaking near-misses. The Grecians were beaten play-off finalists in 2017 when they lost to Blackpool and again a year later when Coventry City defeated them at Wembley. Matt Taylor's first season in charge ended with City one point outside the play-off places in 2019 before a humbling 4-0 loss to Northampton in a Covid-19 affected play-off final a year later. Last season the Grecians were three points short but this term - including a club-record 20-game unbeaten run - they have impressed and will deservedly take their place in the third tier for the first time in a decade. Exeter manager Matt Taylor told BBC Sport: ""It was strange because it felt like it was one of those nights where it wasn't going to be our night and we might not get that goal. ""When it did come I didn't feel nervous at all, I felt we were in control, we knew what we needed to do, they didn't really have any chances after their goal. ""It was a game of very few chances, their goal was a freak goal and our goal was a big deflection as well. ""We've just got to enjoy these moments because this club and some of these players have been through some difficult moments, and to come through it in the way they have and to get promoted with two games left in the automatic positions is a reflection on that group of players. Exeter goalscorer and captain Matt Jay told BBC Sport: ""I'm absolutely delighted, over the moon, words can't really describe it to be honest. ""This group has been extra special this year, it's a fantastic group, brilliant recruitment and we've really felt together and you could see how much it meant to us at the end. ""The club have been wanting to go up for many, many years, and to finally do that on a special night in front of more than 7,800 fans is a brilliant turnout. ""It was probably a fairly average game, but luckily we got the better of it."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Exeter City 2, Barrow 1. Second Half ends, Exeter City 2, Barrow 1.

49,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033835,Leyton Orient 3-0 Scunthorpe United: Iron relegated after 72 years in EFL,"Scunthorpe United's 72-year spell in the English Football League will come to an end as a 3-0 loss at Leyton Orient confirmed their relegation from League Two. Paul Smyth cut in from the right wing, skipped past Ryan Delaney and arrowed a low shot past Rory Watson's near post to put the O's in front early on. Orient doubled their lead six minutes later as Theo Archibald curled a left-footed effort into the far corner of the net from the corner of the 18-yard box. Ruel Sotiriou found himself unmarked at the far post to head in Jordan Brown's deep cross for Orient's third as the Iron's will buckled. Sotiriou almost got his second seven minutes after the break, but he hit the post after Brown's through ball, while Watson did well to deny Archibald after an hour and Hector Kyprianou crashed an effort off the Scunthorpe crossbar six minutes later. The loss - Scunthorpe's 26th in 42 league games - leaves the Iron 16 points from safety with 12 left to play for. Scunthorpe manager Keith Hill, who has seen his side win just two games in the 28 he has taken charge of since November, said he is upset that his side will be playing in the National League next season. ""I'm really sad. I am angry. I don't want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it's not stood me in good stead, but I'm very, very disappointed,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. ""I've been disappointed a lot of times, but I've got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. ""It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn't been good enough. ""Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you're staring down the barrel of relegation. ""We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don't think we've been competitive enough throughout the course of the season."" In truth the writing has been on the wall for the North Lincolnshire side for the majority of a campaign where they have won just four league matches. Since beating fellow strugglers Oldham 3-1 at Boundary Park on 26 December the Iron have won just once - a 1-0 win over Walsall on 8 February - and this loss at Brisbane Road was their seventh successive defeat. They finished just one place above the League Two relegation zone in 2020-21 and their cause this campaign was hindered when they were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer. Boss Neil Cox was sacked in November with the club bottom of League Two and replaced by former Rochdale, Barnsley and Bolton manager Hill. Hill lost just one of his first seven matches in charge but they never built up any momentum, and last spent a day outside the bottom two on 28 December. Relegation out of the Football League will be hard to swallow for Iron fans, who saw their team play in the Championship in 2011 and compete in the League One play-offs as recently as 2018. However, they were then relegated to League Two in 2018-19 and finished 20th in their first season back in the fourth tier. With hopes of EFL survival drifting badly, boss Hill said after a home defeat by fellow strugglers Barrow on 15 March that he had to change ""the culture"" at the club. ""I'm trying to navigate this football club through some stormy moments to where I can build a positive future in a positive environment,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. Though there is now certainty of what level the Iron will be playing in next season, the club's next move behind the scenes is unknown. Owner Peter Swann resigned as chairman last month and has acknowledged he is looking for someone to buy the club from him.external-link Lee Turnbull has returned to the club in the role of chief operating officer and Hill will now hope that he is given the chance to turn the club's fortunes around. BBC Radio Humberside's Mike White It's a sad, miserable, heart-breaking day for Scunthorpe United. A club with a storied history that can list legendary England internationals like Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan among its most notable former players, in addition to club icons such as Jack Brownsword and Barrie Thomas, and even dual-sport star Ian Botham. In recent times, the Iron punched above their weight in the Championship in the mid-to-late 2000s and flirted with it again under the management of Graham Alexander. Many fans believe his 2018 sacking was the start of the decline that's brought them to this point. Recruitment has been questioned in the past few years too, with many fans suggesting now-former chairman - but still club owner for the time being - Peter Swann had too much input, something he has refuted on several occasions. Whilst some fans are angered by the current state of the club and this situation, many almost seem numb to it now and were resigned to their fate a long time before the dreaded 'R' was placed next to their name on the league table. And despite the consistent positivity from manager Keith Hill about the future of the club, I'm not sure the majority of Iron supporters share that sentiment as they've seen that the National League can quite easily turn into a giant abyss that has swallowed up clubs without a hint or whisper of a return to the Football League. Maybe recent talk and suggestion of a takeover could provide the required impetus needed to at least provide the right resources to Hill and his team - and breathe new life back into a club in desperate need of it - but that will have to wait for another day.

50,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125002,Oldham Athletic 1-2 Salford City: Latics relegated after protest interrupts match,"Oldham Athletic have been relegated from the English Football League for the first time after defeat by Salford City in a game interrupted by a supporters' on-pitch protest against the club's owners. It ends 116 years of league football for the Boundary Park club, and also means they are the first former Premier League team to drop into non-league since its creation in 1992. The Latics, who needed to avoid defeat to keep their hopes of League Two survival alive after wins for both Barrow and Stevenage, trailed 2-1 with 14 minutes to play against Salford when fans poured on to the pitch. The players were taken off by referee Bobby Madley as supporters staged a centre-circle sit-in against owner Abdallah Lemsagam, despite appeals from boss John Sheridan to return to the stands. Protests remained in place for some time after, but once the pitch had been cleared, the teams returned to play out the remaining time behind closed doors. An EFL spokesperson said: ""This afternoon's League Two fixture between Oldham Athletic and Salford City has been concluded behind closed doors. ""The remaining 14 minutes played resulted in a final scoreline of Oldham Athletic 1 Salford City 2, and as a result Oldham Athletic have been relegated from League Two. ""Despite the earlier announcement of the abandonment of the fixture, after discussions with both clubs, match officials, and stadium security it was agreed the match could be concluded today. ""The decision was taken in order to maintain the integrity of the competition given the importance of the fixture at both ends of the League Two table."" Salford, who needed the points to maintain their play-off hopes, took an early lead through ex-Oldham striker Matt Smith who tucked into an open goal. Davis Keillor-Dunn stroked home a penalty to give the home side hope after a handball by Jordan Turnbull, but Brandon Thomas-Asante's near-post header in first-half injury time restored the Salford lead. With pressure mounting, Oldham went for the goal they needed to delay the drop, with Keillor-Dunn's tame chip saved by Tom King after Jamie Hopcutt's header was ruled out. No further score was achieved after the resumption, and Oldham's fate was sealed before eerily empty stands. Relegation to the National League marks a huge fall from grace for a club who were founder members of the Premier League, League Cup finalists 32 years ago and Wembley FA Cup semi-finalists as recently as 1994. In a cruel twist of fate, they are set to begin their first season outside of the EFL on the 30th anniversary of the breakaway division. Oldham's likely drop rounds off a miserable spell for the club in recent times. Keith Curle, appointed in March 2021, looked set to inspire some hope in the beleaguered Latics when he arrived at Boundary Park. Arriving at the club having won promotion from the fourth tier with Northampton as recently as 2020, supporters would be forgiven for thinking he could turn around the fortunes of a club who have slumped to their lowest point in recent memory. It took seven games to find a win in any competition this term and the club's form did not noticeably improve in the first half of the campaign. Curle left in November, just eight months into his tenure, amid the backdrop of heightened tensions with the club's support. Three fans were banned in December for ""promoting their dislike"" of the club, with one of the trio branding it a ""dictatorship"". The bans - which were issued directly by the club and were not court-issued football banning orders - were overturned just two days later after a public outcry, but the damage was done. Protests continued and less than a month later Lemsagam announced that he was willing to sell the club, a U-turn on the position he had taken in September 2021 when he claimed he did not want to. Under his tenure there have been accusations of late payment of salaries and threats of player strikes - as well as the prospect of administration, which was eventually avoided. After more than a month without a permanent manager, Sheridan arrived in January for his sixth stint at the club. Despite a bright run of form in February which took them out of the League Two drop zone, as well as two successive wins in March and April, nine defeats in the past 11 games before Saturday saw a slide into trouble that could not be halted, not even by a club legend.

51,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52072592,Didier Drogba: How Ivory Coast striker helped to halt civil war in his home nation,"Al-Merrikh Stadium, in Sudan's second largest city of Omdurman, is not one of the world's great gladiatorial arenas. Yet this small ground - known as the Red Castle - became the setting for one of football's most extraordinary tales. The date was 8 October 2005. The mathematics of qualification for World Cup 2006 were simple. A win for Cameroon against Egypt would see them reach their sixth tournament. Anything less would allow Ivory Coast, playing in Sudan and just a point behind, to leapfrog them and qualify instead - for the first time. The tag ""golden generation"" can be a substantial yoke to bear, but the Ivorian squad in 2005 was just that. They were led by the artfully bruising Didier Drogba, with Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Eboue and Didier Zokora all also shining in the Premier League, a world away in London. Yaya Toure, then with Greek side Olympiakos and still considered raw, was waiting in the wings. This was a squad that could match anything on the African continent. Despite having lost twice to Cameroon in qualifying, they remained agonisingly close as they took to the pitch in Sudan that evening. Yet, while Ivory Coast's footballing stars stood on the verge of history, back home the country teetered on the edge of something dark. A civil war that began in 2002 had divided the country, with President Laurent Gbagbo's government controlling the south and a rebel faction known as The New Forces of Ivory Coast, led by Guillaume Soro, controlling the north. Fighting broke out on 19 September 2002 with rebels attacking various cities across the country. Sebastien Gnahore, an ex-footballer who fled Ivory Coast, recalls those times. ""It was awful. When I called my sister I could hear the shooting outside the house,"" he says. ""They all hid under the bed for four days, and only came out to find food. ""All I cared about was whether my family was going to be OK. That's the only worry I had each morning."" The initial violence was fierce but short-lived, as both sides became quickly entrenched along a north-south divide. Much of the fighting had ended in 2004, but tensions were rising once again in 2005. The future of the West African country looked bleak. Modern footballers can seem a world away from the everyday man and woman. The money involved can catapult them into a different realm, and the results can be unpalatable. But the Ivorian players that evening, despite their multi-million-pound lives in Europe, knew much more was at stake. And nobody encapsulated this quite like the man who led their line, and who was about to take centre stage. Didier Drogba had arrived at Chelsea in 2004 for a reported fee of £24m. His nine-year stay in the Premier League was synonymous with a number of things - including a brutally effective, bulldozing style of centre-forward play and accusations ranging from unsportsmanlike behaviour to outright cheating. Love him or hate him, his achievements in west London were unquestionable. Four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and a Champions League winner's medal. Arsene Wenger, whose Arsenal side frequently found themselves on the wrong end of Drogba's brutal style, said of him: ""He is a winner and he will be like that until the end of his life."" Drogba was indeed a serial winner, but the pressure on that  October night in Sudan was entirely different. Cameroon's match against Egypt in Yaounde and Ivory Coast's fixture with Sudan kicked off simultaneously. Ivory Coast, knowing nothing less than a victory would do, made short work of a Sudanese side second-bottom in the group. In the 73rd minute, Aruna Dindane tucked away his second goal, and the team's third. An 89th-minute Sudanese strike was no more than a consolation. Events were unfolding relatively straightforwardly - but nearly 1,600 miles away in Yaounde, the picture was very different. Cameroon took the lead in the 20th minute, but the game was tight. A 79th-minute equaliser, bundled in by Mohammed Shawky, brought Egypt level and swung the tide back into the Ivorians' favour. A draw - so long as they beat Sudan - would see them qualify. With just seconds remaining in Yaounde, and with the score locked at 1-1, Ivory Coast looked set for their maiden trip to the World Cup. Their match in Sudan had finished. Drogba was standing, surrounded by his team-mates. They were all listening to the radio and waiting. Then the crushing news filtered through. Cameroon had been awarded a soft penalty in the fourth minute of injury time. For every tale of heartbreak, there must be one of joy. Pierre Wome's spot-kick crashed against the left-hand post and flew wide. The Cameroon players gathered, dazed and despondent in the penalty area, some pulling their shirts over their eyes. On the other side of the continent, Ivory Coast erupted. For the first time in their history, they would compete at the highest level of international football. ""The whole country - every person, every house - was happy. That day we all forgot the country was still divided,"" says Hassane Omar, a 20-year-old student in Abidjan at the time. For all the breathless footballing drama that took place that night, the most seismic event did not occur on the football pitch, but in the cramped away dressing room at the Al-Merrikh Stadium. A post-game prayer led by Drogba had become something of a ritual, but this would be different. With the celebrations unfolding, a TV camera was ushered into the changing room. The players huddled before it, their arms draped across each other's shoulders. Standing in the centre, microphone in hand, was the imposing figure of the Chelsea striker. ""Men and women of Ivory Coast,"" he began. ""From the north, south, centre, and west, we proved today that all Ivorians can coexist and play together with a shared aim - to qualify for the World Cup."" ""We promised you that the celebrations would unite the people - today we beg you on our knees."" On cue, the players sank to their knees. ""The one country in Africa with so many riches must not descend into war. Please lay down your weapons and hold elections,"" Drogba urged. The clip, available on YouTube, is barely a minute long and ends with the players on their feet once more. ""We want to have fun, so stop firing your guns,"" they sang joyously. Back home, the party had already started. There were reports of a conga line outside the Egyptian embassy as Ivorians showed their appreciation for the draw in Cameroon. Even the rebel capital of Bouake bounced to the beat of victory that night. For all the revelry, and for all the 'Drogbas' - bottles of beers renamed in the striker's honour - Ivory Coast still woke up the following morning in the same situation, as a deeply divided country. Yet something was stirring and the following weeks and months were to see a dramatic change. The video clip played relentlessly on television as if the sheer force of media exposure might be enough to enact change. And change did follow. Both sides moved closer to the negotiating table and a ceasefire was finally signed. While any Hollywood scriptwriter would have been proud of this ending, the story was not quite finished. At the 2006 World Cup, Ivory Coast had been knocked out at the group stage, losing to Argentina and the Netherlands before beating Serbia & Montenegro. It was a respectable first performance. The following year, an extraordinary announcement was made by Drogba, while touring the rebel-held area of his homeland after claiming the African Footballer of the Year award. Ivory Coast's home match and Madagascar, due to be played on 3 June 2007, would not be played in Abidjan as scheduled, he said, but instead in Bouake, the symbolic centre of the rebellion. This would have been unimaginable just two years before. Whether presidential permission was given for Drogba's announcement is still not entirely clear. ""Bearing in mind Drogba is from the south - from Gbagbo's area - he was just like a god at the time,"" says Austin Merril, a reporter who was in Ivory Coast working for Vanity Fair magazine. The atmosphere that day in the northern city crackled with anticipation. ""It was completely bonkers,"" adds Merrill, who drove behind the team bus on the way to the stadium with a heavy military presence. People rode on top of cars, weapons slipped from the grasp of excited soldiers. Inside the stadium itself, government and rebel troops hurled football chants back and forth. It was a marked change from the violence of the recent past. ""It felt like more than just football,"" recalls Omar, who was watching on TV in Abidjan. ""Everybody had stopped work at 12 o'clock and was drinking beer or champagne. We were all so happy."" On the pitch, any notion that the script would not be a fairytale was dispelled when Salomon Kalou tapped in on 18 minutes. The goals kept coming. With just five minutes to go, and with Ivory Coast leading 4-0, the stage was set for the spectacular finale everybody had hoped for. A lofted ball from midfield dropped behind the defence, into the path of the onrushing Drogba. Delicate control and a delightful second touch took him round the goalkeeper, and he slid the ball into an empty net. The explosion of noise defied the stadium's modest capacity. The country's messiah wheeled along the running track in celebration, players and supporters streaming in his wake. Above him in the stands, old adversaries celebrated together. The final whistle brought fans rushing on to the pitch, with security personnel forming protective screens around the players, most of all Drogba. The symbolic gesture of the game in Bouake seemed to have united a country once again. ""It was euphoria across the whole country, everybody came together,"" says Gnahore. ""We had so much hope in Drogba and his team. The Toures from the north, Drogba from the south. It was a true Ivorian mosaic."" However, what followed was sadly very different. With divisions running deep, and memories short, the euphoria surrounding those two matches began to fade. Just five years later, violence again gripped the country after disputed elections, resulting in the deaths of 3,000 people and culminating in the arrest of President Gbagbo and his eventual trial at the Hague for crimes against humanity. In January 2019, he was acquitted on all charges. One year on, he remains in custody in Belgium,external-link pending the outcome of an appeal, with Ivory Coast still in a delicate political state. Ivory Coast's 'golden generation' never truly fulfilled their potential, losing on penalties in the final of the African Cup of Nations in both 2006 and 2012. Their star power dwindled in response. Perhaps it was simply impossible to follow on from the seismic events of 2005 and 2007. Drogba retired from football in 2018 after a glittering career that saw success in six countries, with a place in the pantheon of African greats - if not world greats - already assured. But he and his team-mates were responsible for something far bigger than just footballing glory. ""They showed that we could still live together, that we could be the Ivory Coast that we had been before. It wasn't about football, but rather the unification of a country,"" says Omar. Drogba and his team-mates didn't single-handedly stop the civil war. But over the course of two football matches, they did at least give their beleaguered country a reason to hope. ",positive
52,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61300681,Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 on aggregate): Jurgen Klopp's side advance to Champions League final,"Liverpool survived a scare against Villarreal to move into the Champions League final - and keep their hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple alive. The Reds had comfortably won 2-0 in the first leg but that advantage was wiped out after only 41 minutes at a noisy and passionate El Madrigal as the Spanish side pushed for a huge upset. Boulaye Dia scored Villarreal's first after only three minutes, converting Etienne Capoue's pass, before ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin headed in a second from another Capoue cross as the Reds looked rattled. Liverpool had to improve in the second half and Fabinho put them back in front on aggregate with a shot that went through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 62nd minute. Luis Diaz, whose introduction at half time changed the game after he replaced Diogo Jota, restored Liverpool's two-goal aggregate advantage with a header at the back post. Sadio Mane secured Liverpool's place in their third Champions League final in five seasons with a third goal after taking the ball around Rulli. Villarreal ended the game with 10 men with Capoue sent off late on for two bookable offences. The Reds will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. No English side has ever won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup all in the same season, with Liverpool aiming to create history. Villarreal's performance in their 2-0 loss at Anfield led one English radio pundit to call the Spanish side a ""disgrace"" and ""pathetic"", despite an incredible run that had seen them eliminate former winners Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. However, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp knew the tie was not over and warned his side they ""would have to be prepared to suffer"" in the second leg. And suffer they did in arguably Liverpool's worst half of football this season, with passes misplaced, errors made and the side looking uncharacteristically vulnerable. They made the worst possible start, conceding after only three minutes. Pervis Estupinan, who scored an own goal at Anfield, provided a cross which was pulled back by Capoue and Dia, inside the six-yard box, reacted quickest to convert from close range. Dani Parejo shot just wide and Gerard Moreno had an effort blocked before Villarreal, seventh in La Liga and managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, made it 2-2 on aggregate thanks to Coquelin's fine header. Liverpool had to improve in the second half, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot hit the crossbar after taking a huge deflection off Coquelin. But the breakthrough came with Fabinho's strike and that led to a capitulation from Villarreal, who conceded three times in a 12-minute spell. Diaz headed in Alexander-Arnold's cross to give the visitors some breathing space before a rash decision from Rulli saw him sprint off the line with Mane getting there first and finishing into an unguarded goal. This is the 10th time Liverpool have reached the final of the European Cup or Champions League as they aim to become European champions for a seventh time after successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019. Liverpool's progress keeps them on course to become the first English side to complete the quadruple. They already have the Carabao Cup in the trophy cabinet after beating Chelsea on penalties in February and Thomas Tuchel's side are again the opposition at Wembley for the FA Cup final on 14 May. This victory means Liverpool have become the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. Liverpool are also only one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League title race and could meet in the Champions League final later this month. Pep Guardiola's side hold the advantage in the second semi-final after an incredible first leg at Etihad Stadium saw them beat Real 4-3 in one of the best games in the tournament's history. The second leg takes place at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday and if the Spanish champions, managed by ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, can turn the one-goal deficit around it would set up a repeat of the 2018 final. Real won 3-1 on that occasion as Gareth Bale scored twice, including an incredible overhead kick, but the game will largely be remembered for two goalkeeping errors from Liverpool's Loris Karius.

53,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61300016,Villarreal v Liverpool: Does Unai Emery get respect he deserves?,"Guiding unfancied Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals ought to have been a career highlight for Unai Emery, the manager who has taken a team from a town with a smaller population than Clacton-on-Sea to the pinnacle of European football. Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday. ",positive
54,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61221249,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Pep Guardiola's side win thrilling Champions League semi-final first leg,"Manchester City will take a slender Champions League semi-final advantage to the Bernabeu after winning a seven-goal first-leg classic against Real Madrid at Etihad Stadium. City delivered a magnificent display as they peppered Real's goal for long periods but Carlo Ancelotti's side kept rising off the canvas to somehow keep themselves in serious contention to reach another final. Kevin de Bruyne set the tone for a magical night of football with a diving header from Riyad Mahrez's cross in the second minute and in-form Gabriel Jesus quickly added a second from close range as Real reeled under wave after wave of attacks. Mahrez enraged manager Pep Guardiola when he hit the side-netting instead of finding the unmarked Phil Foden, who shot inches wide before Karim Benzema, inevitably, gave Real a lifeline by sweeping home Ferland Mendy's cross after 33 minutes. The Spanish side escaped again shortly after the break when Mahrez struck the post but City restored their two-goal advantage when an unmarked Foden headed home Fernandinho's cross in the 53rd minute. City were pegged back again when Vinicius Junior dummied past Fernandinho and ran from inside his own half to score a superb second for Real. However, a brilliant use of advantage from referee Istvan Kovacs allowed Bernardo Silva to fire into the top-left corner for City's fourth. There was still no let-up and Benzema capped a spectacular game by showing nerves of steel to chip a Panenka penalty past Ederson with eight minutes left following Aymeric Laporte's handball. Liverpool face Spanish side Villarreal in this year's other semi-final, with the first leg at Anfield on Wednesday. The final will be held at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. City would have taken any sort of advantage to Spain before kick-off but deep down they will know their almost total dominance of Real should have given them much more than this narrow lead for the second leg. Guardiola's side were simply irresistible for spells and could have been four goals ahead before Benzema struck Real's first, the manager clearly infuriated by Mahrez's selfishness in shooting with Foden standing unmarked in front of goal at 2-0. Guardiola and his players will take heart from the manner in which they carved Real open so often and they will hope to capitalise on their opponents' need to press for a goal in Spain. De Bruyne was outstanding once more and Foden just showed how at home he is on the elite stage, but City have to be concerned at how they looked defensively vulnerable on occasion to leave Real very much alive in this semi-final. A side of City's calibre will be confident of progress - but most observers will know this tie should already be over. Real will always have hope when they have Benzema, the 34-year-old Frenchman who deserves his place in the upper echelons of the great strikers in world football. It is often a mystery how Real survive when looking punch drunk having come back from losing situations to beat Paris St-Germain and Chelsea in their previous knockout ties. But a comeback looked beyond them when they were blown away by a blistering City opening that left them two down after only 11 minutes. And yet, for all their struggles elsewhere, the La Liga leaders carry an air of menace that means concentration levels cannot drop for a moment. They proved it again as they dusted themselves down to give themselves a lifeline. It was no surprise that Benzema was the man responsible, showing all of his class with a left-foot volley past Ederson to make it 2-1. Brazilian youngster Vinicius Junior also produced magic for the second goal before Benzema's nerveless penalty. The great survivors are still in this tie and will now hope the magic of the Bernabeu can inspire them once more next week under coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is trying to win the trophy for a fourth time.

55,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47463849,Real Madrid: How Champions League holders crashed out against Ajax,"Real Madrid's 1,011-day reign as European champions is over. Two years, nine months and five days since they beat fellow Spaniards Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final in Milan, they have finally been eliminated from Europe's premier club competition after three titles in a row. Santiago Solari's team saw their 2-1 first-leg lead overturned in emphatic fashion, as Dutch side Ajax claimed a stunning and deserved 4-1 victory at the Bernabeu. Despite only being in charge for 113 days, Solari has overseen Real's two heaviest home Champions League defeats, with this coming after the 3-0 defeat by CSKA Moscow in December. And Tuesday's exit comes six days after they were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by fierce rivals Barcelona, whom they trail by 12 points in La Liga. BBC Sport looks at the stats behind Real's remarkable run and the fallout from Tuesday's chastening loss... For the first time since May 2015 - a run stretching 46 months - Real Madrid are out of the Champions League. They have a remarkable record since the start of the 2015-16 season, in which they claimed the first of their three successive titles. Real's CL results since start of 2015-16: WWDWWWWWLWDWDWDWDWDWWWWWLWWWDLWWWWWLWDWWLWWWLWL Real had reached at least the semi-finals in every season since they were knocked out in the last 16 by French side Lyon back in 2010, in Cristiano Ronaldo's first season with the club. So what has gone wrong? Too much to sum up in one paragraph, but obviously losing the goals of Ronaldo has been a major problem. This year, Real's top scorer in Europe was striker Karim Benzema with four - some way off the pace of Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski (eight), Barcelona's Lionel Messi (six) or Ajax's former Southampton forward Dusan Tadic (also six). Spanish newspapers ASexternal-link and Marcaexternal-link went into overdrive at the full-time whistle, with several articles calling for the exits of manager Solari, president Florentino Perez, and numerous players - including Gareth Bale - who are ""many of them in an undeniable end of cycle.""external-link Captain Sergio Ramos - who missed the game through suspension having been booked deliberately in the first leg - watched from a box while being filmed for an upcoming documentary.external-link Now a must-watch... Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Just wait until the summer! There are big big problems at Real. One of the top players, one of the captains at Real, said that they only need to play well for four games a season to win the Champions League. That attitude in the long term is a massive problem. ""It's the worst defeat at home in their European history. There was resignation from the fans - they just went home without making any noise. ""They cannot compete in the market like they used to; they stopped getting Galacticos in 2014 and the squad is thinner and thinner. Who would you say is a superstar in this team? Everyone has disappointed. ""Gareth Bale did not start, which is frustrating him big time, but they do not see him as one of them. When he has been given the responsibility he hasn't shone but he won't shine if he's only given 15 or 20 minutes."" Former Manchester United and Real Sociedad boss David Moyes on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Real needed this game tonight, but they were well beaten. It should have been by more. A lot of people will be wanting to know what is going to change at Real Madrid. It is the end of an era. ""Cristiano Ronaldo left over the summer and you'll now be looking at a Luka Modric, maybe a Toni Kroos or Sergio Ramos leaving. It would not surprise me if there is a complete change at Real Madrid in the summer. ""I think they are something like 25-30 goals down on what they were last season. That is because of Ronaldo's goals. But I still don't think you expect to go to the Bernabeu and win the way teams are doing at the moment. That title - the Galacticos - is not there at the moment. ""But they have a strong president and club and I'm sure they'll already be thinking about how they rebuild to get back to where they have been.""

56,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47417260,Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona: Rakitic sends Barca 10 points clear in La Liga,"Barcelona moved 10 points clear at the top of La Liga after a second El Clasico win in four days, Ivan Rakitic's goal all but ending Real Madrid's faint title hopes. Rakitic kept his composure to beat Thibaut Courtois after a one-two with Sergi Roberto split Real's defence. Karim Benzema and Raphael Varane were denied towards the end but Real rarely looked like equalising at the Bernabeu. They are third in the table, 12 points behind Barcelona with 12 games left. Atletico Madrid, who are second, will cut Barca's lead at the top to seven points if they win at Real Sociedad on Sunday (17:30 GMT). Barcelona's players formed a huddle as they celebrated on the pitch after the final whistle. This was their 18th victory in 26 games in the league and, barring a disastrous set of results, they will retain the title they won by 14 points last season. Having beaten Real in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, Ernesto Valverde's side inflicted further misery on their bitter rivals. Barca showed their class all over the pitch. Croatia midfielder Rakitic raced clear of Sergio Ramos to score before Courtois produced a double save to keep out Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. At the back, Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet were solid as Barca clocked up a fifth clean sheet in six games. This will not go down as a classic but Barcelona emerged with their treble hopes intact. Barca boss Valverde was not getting carried away though. ""We still have a whole world in front of us. We know Madrid can win a lot of consecutive games, Atletico Madrid are still there too,"" he said. ""Until it is mathematically secure, we will keep battling. You have to keep fighting, if you think about it, you start losing."" A few days ago Real Madrid were still in the hunt for the Copa del Rey, while victory over Barca on Saturday would have given them a fighting chance in the league. Instead their season, at least domestically, lies in tatters after another disappointing home performance. They lacked cutting edge. Gareth Bale replaced having made little impact but he was by no means alone. Luka Modric wasted a good chance when he headed over on the stroke of half-time and Karim Benzema scuffed wide in front of an open goal early in the second half. Meanwhile, Ramos' arm connected with Messi's face at the end of the first half in what was a niggly, rather than dirty, game. This was Real's third successive home defeat and the locals made their feelings clear at the final whistle. Real's next match is against Ajax in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, with the Spanish side 2-1 up from the first leg. The European champions need to keep their season alive. Another defeat could be damaging for Santiago Solari and his players. ""The league is always important. The team will compete until the last date,"" said Solari. ""We played as a team. It was a game hard fought and we matched them in almost everything. We looked for it in every way and we could not score. ""Football is pretty simple sometimes, it's a good metaphor for life.""

57,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47442872,Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Tottenham: Kane becomes top European scorer as Spurs reach quarter-finals,"Tottenham eased past Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2011 as Harry Kane became the club's top scorer in European competition. Leading 3-0 from the first leg, Spurs were forced to survive a first-half barrage from the Bundesliga leaders in the crackling atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion. But Kane's intervention just after half-time ensured a comfortable second period in which the hosts failed to register a shot on target. Latching on to Moussa Sissoko's pass, the England captain clinically lifted the ball past home goalkeeper Roman Burki into the right corner. It was Kane's first effort on goal and confirmed a 4-0 aggregate win for a Tottenham side that defended resolutely throughout. Kane's 24th European goal moves him one clear of the club record he previously shared with Jermain Defoe. The draw for the quarter-finals takes place on Friday, 15 March. Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs side have kept just one clean sheet in the Premier League in 2019, but they looked solid in Germany after deploying the same three-man defence that helped them to a commanding first-leg lead. Jan Vertonghen's 10th-minute tackle on Marco Reus exemplified their early resolve. Timing his challenge to perfection, the Belgian nipped the ball away from the Dortmund attacker who had broken clear inside the area. When Dortmund did break through, Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made brilliant saves from Reus, Julian Weigl Mario Gotze and Jadon Sancho, while Weigl was denied a second time by a superb Ben Davies block. Dortmund bombarded Lloris' goal with five shots on target in the latter stages of the opening half, but Tottenham carried a threat on the break with the pace and movement of Son Heung-min and Kane. Son clipped an effort just wide of the left post before Kane's clinical finish inflicted a first home defeat on Dortmund under manager Lucien Favre. It also ensured only Tottenham's third appearance in the last eight of the competition. Despite a strong first-half showing in which they monopolised possession and chances on goal, it proved a disappointing evening for Dortmund. Former Borussia Monchengladbach and Nice coach Favre has taken the club back to the top of the Bundesliga as they aim for their first league title since 2012. However, their attacking threat was blunted by a strong Tottenham defence with centre-forward Paco Alcacer managing just 27 touches during the game. That impacted on Dortmund's other attackers, particularly after the break, with the likes of England winger Jadon Sancho struggling to make an impact as a result. With no central thrust to the Germans' play, the 18-year-old - who has registered nine goals this term - was shackled throughout and snatched at his only shot on target. With just five touches in the Tottenham penalty area, Sancho was unable to influence the game in the final third. Instead he was restricted to the middle of the pitch where he was well marshalled by a combination of Davies and Harry Winks. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BT Sport: ""We are in the quarter-finals. I'm so happy for the players and the fans. It's an important victory. Of course we suffered a bit but it's OK and we fully deserve to be in the quarter-finals. ""Hugo Lloris was great. We conceded more chances than we expected but that's football. After losing in the first leg they had nothing to lose. ""In the last 10 minutes of the first half it was difficult for us. They started to play a little bit more and then in the first action, when we were able to connect, we managed to score the goal. ""Now it's about enjoying that we are in the quarter-finals. We need to feel proud."" Tottenham resume their Premier League duties when they travel to Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, Erik ten Hag's side stormed into an aggregate lead after just 18 minutes through forwards Hakim Ziyech and David Neres. The electric Dusan Tadic, provider of his side's first two goals, then added a brilliant third as he whipped an effort into the top corner from the edge of the area.

But Ajax's Danish midfielder Lasse Schone scored a spectacular free-kick just two minutes later to leave Santiago Solari's side requiring three goals to progress. Gareth Bale, jeered by fans in Saturday's defeat by Barcelona, was dropped by Solari but struck the post after coming on as a 29th-minute substitute for the injured Lucas Vazquez. Real looked fragile without captain Sergio Ramos, serving a two-match ban ""for clearly receiving a yellow card on purpose"" in the tie's first leg. Their miserable night was compounded as Nacho was sent off in injury time for a second bookable offence, as Ajax became the first team to overturn a 2-1 first-leg home defeat in the Champions League. This was a performance of sheer quality by a young Ajax side who arrived at the home of the European champions with no fear as they danced through to the quarter-finals. A last-16 meeting with Real was the club's first knockout tie in 13 years, and with six of their starting side aged 22 and under, there is the sense something special could be achieved this season - although the challenge of holding on to those players when the next transfer window opens will be significant. The visitors needed at least two goals in Madrid and learned from their wastefulness in the first leg to silence the home support inside 18 minutes. Ajax had to weather early pressure, but Ziyech's fine finish came as a powerful blow to their bewildered hosts. Tadic, almost unrecognisable from his Southampton days, produced a moment of excellence to set up Neres before seemingly putting the tie out of reach with a finish that epitomised his performance. There was a long wait before the video assistant referee eventually confirmed Noussair Mazraoui had managed to keep the ball in play during the build up to Tadic's goal - as nervous tension paved the way for wild celebrations in the away end. Barcelona-bound Frenkie de Jong shone brightly too - with his pending £65m move to La Liga already a concern for Real - but it was fellow midfielder Schone who added the deserved gloss just as Real may have sensed hope. Ajax could have had even more as goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was forced to stop efforts from Donny van de Beek and Tadic, while the impressive Matthijs de Ligt stood firm alongside Daley Blind under periods of pressure. The visitors more than held their own against the holders, and could play a huge part in the final stages of this season's competition should they maintain such a devastating level of performance. After three consecutive Champions League titles, the most successful side in the competition's history did not see this coming. Ajax head coach Ten Hag had suggested that absence of Ramos for Real was ""not only a tactical loss for them but also a mental one"". Ultimately, he was proven correct. Real's aggregate advantage disappeared quickly without their captain's authority, despite a promising start in which Raphael Varane had headed on to the bar from a cross by Vazquez, who drew a fine save from Andre Onana before injury forced him off, to be replaced by Bale. The Wales forward received a warmer reception than he had at the weekend, with Asensio also sharpening the hosts' attack when he came on for Vinicius Junior before half-time. When Asensio made it 4-3 on aggregate, he appeared to have dragged his side - with a reputation of churning out results in Europe - back into the tie. But Ajax crushed any hope of a comeback just moments later, effectively ending Real's season, given that they fell 12 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona at the weekend. Nacho's dismissal and an injury to Bale in the closing stages rounded off an ugly night for the home side. Having gone eight campaigns without failing to reach the Champions League semi-finals, it now looks as if a summer of change awaits at the Bernabeu.

59,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57885665,Raphael Varane: Man Utd confirm agreement with Real Madrid to sign defender,"Manchester United have confirmed they have reached an agreement with Real Madrid to sign defender Raphael Varane. It is understood the clubs have agreed an initial fee of £34m, which could rise to £42m, and that Varane, 28, has agreed terms on a four-year contract with the option for another 12 months. United said the transfer would be completed ""subject to a medical and to player terms being finalised"". Varane, a World Cup winner with France, has made 360 appearances for Real. ""Real Madrid wants to show all its affection to Raphaal Varane and his family and wishes him good luck in this new stage of his professional career,"" the club said in a statement. ""Our club thanks you for your professionalism and exemplary behaviour during the 10 seasons in which you defended our shirt."" Varane, who has 79 caps, will become Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's third signing in this transfer window - following the re-signing of goalkeeper Tom Heaton and the £73m arrival of England winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. BBC Sport understands Varane will quarantine before having his medical, after which he will complete his move. United, who agreed a fee with Real on Monday, have been long-term admirers of Varane, whose contract was due to expire next summer. Former boss Sir Alex Ferguson originally pursued a deal for the player before his move to Madrid, and Jose Mourinho was also keen to add the defender to his squad during his time at Old Trafford. After coming through Lens' academy, Varane broke into the first team at the age of 17, and while he was unable to steer them away from relegation, his performances attracted the attention of some of Europe's top clubs. Despite strong interest from United, Real signed the teenager on a six-year contract in 2011, and he went on to make 15 appearances in all competitions during his first season in Spain as Mourinho's side regained the title. That was the start of Varane's impressive trophy haul during his decade in the Spanish capital. He helped Carlo Ancelotti's side clinch their 10th European title - 'La Decima' - in the 2013-14 season, making seven appearances and partnering Sergio Ramos in the final as they beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra time in Lisbon. Varane was also a key figure under compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who replaced Rafael Benitez as manager in January 2016, as Los Blancos secured a hat-trick of Champions League titles from 2016-2018. However, a hamstring injury ruled him out of the 2016 final against Atletico and France's European Championship campaign that summer, which ended in defeat in the final. Having battled injuries during the 2016-17 season, Varane enjoyed arguably his strongest year in 2017-18 as Real beat Liverpool in the 2018 Champions League final, before he starred for France at the 2018 World Cup, playing every minute of Les Bleus' triumphant campaign in Russia. Varane's performances for club and country during 2017-18 saw him finish seventh in the Ballon d'Or rankings - the highest-placed defender - and he was named in the Uefa Team of the Year. The centre-back has had his share of disappointments too, however, most notably in 2019-20 when his error-strewn display led to Real's Champions League last-16 exit at the hands of Manchester City. Varane also played every minute of France's Euro 2020 campaign, which ended with a last-16 penalty shootout defeat by Switzerland. Should the Varane deal be completed as expected, United will have spent just short of £400m on players since Solskjaer was appointed manager on a permanent basis in March 2019. That eclipses the outlay of Manchester City (£298m), Chelsea (£262m), Tottenham (£255m) Arsenal (£243m) and Liverpool (£119m) in the same period, according to Transfermarkt.external-link Varane is the fourth defender United have brought in since conceding 54 goals during the 2018-19 Premier League season, after Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alex Telles. Having acquired Maguire and Wan-Bissaka in the summer of 2019, the Red Devils conceded 36 goals as they finished third in 2019-20. They climbed a place to finish second behind Manchester City last season, letting in 44 goals, 12 more than their neighbours. It is understood any further signings this summer are likely to depend on outgoings. BBC Sport's Simon Stone This certainly seems like an excellent deal for Manchester United. Varane has precisely the back-story they need to bring leadership and tactical nous to their defence. The experience of starting three Champions League finals victories and a World Cup final win is invaluable in what is a relatively young United squad. United have been able to exploit a weak transfer market - they were the only realistic option for Varane if he decided to leave Real - and the financial issues affecting all Spain's leading clubs to come up with a deal attractive enough to entice a player of true international quality. The big question for United now is whether they are done in the market this summer. That may well depend on whether Paul Pogba decides to sit out the remaining year of his contract or if he would be willing to accept a lower salary that may be on offer in 12 months' time in order to get a move to PSG. Axel Tuanzebe seems the most likely central defender to make way for Varane, potentially on loan to Newcastle, although doubts hang over the futures of Diogo Dalot, Brandon Williams, Jesse Lingard and Phil Jones, who did not make a single appearance last season and has not been involved so far during pre-season games against Derby and QPR. Balancing the finances is important for United. However, for the fans, they just want to see Varane in action. Coming so soon after Jadon Sancho's move from Borussia Dortmund was confirmed, optimism around Old Trafford has not been so high for quite some time. Real Madrid and Belgium attacker Eden Hazard:external-link ""I've come across some fantastic defenders during my career, such as John Terry and Vincent Kompany. I think that although [Varane] is still young, he's already one of the best centre-backs of all time. His partnership with Sergio Ramos is wonderful."" Former Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho in 2014:external-link ""I think Varane is the best central defender in the world. He is still young, but I think he's the best."" Liverpool and Netherlands defender Virgil van Dijk:external-link ""Sergio Ramos's teammate at Real Madrid, Raphael Varane, is my favourite. He is an excellent defender and has already won a lot."" France manager Didier Deschamps:external-link ""When he is 100% fit, he knows how to do everything. He's very strong defensively, he is fast. He has good anticipation. He's never in trouble on the ball. He can score goals at set-pieces. That makes him a complete player."" ",positive
60,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57981122,Raphael Varane: Does defender mean Man Utd are Premier League title contenders?,"Raphael Varane has been described as being a ""Rolls-Royce"" and ""an absolute bargain"" after his £34m move from Real Madrid to Manchester United was agreed. He will join fellow new arrivals Jadon Sancho, signed from Borussia Dortmund for £73m, and free transfer Tom Heaton at Old Trafford as manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer builds a squad to try to improve on the second place they achieved in the Premier League last season. As long as his medical is successful and personal terms are finalised, Varane would take United's spending on players to just short of £400m since Solskjaer was appointed on a permanent basis in March 2019, eclipsing the outlay of Manchester City (£298m), Chelsea (£262m), Tottenham (£255m) Arsenal (£243m) and Liverpool (£119m) in the same period, according to Transfermarkt. But can Varane help the 13-time Premier League winners bridge last season's 12-point gap to their local rivals Manchester City? Should we now class them as genuine title contenders as they look to end their eight-year wait to be English champions? Sir Alex Ferguson always used to say: ""Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles."" Most Premier League champions have been built from the foundation of a strong back line, and as Liverpool and Manchester City can attest, signing the right centre-back can have an almost instant impact on your chances of success. In 2016-17, the year before Liverpool signed Virgil van Dijk, the Reds conceded 42 goals in 38 league games. By 2018-19, the Dutchman's first full season, that total was down to 22. Having finished second, a year later they were champions for the first time in 30 years. While Ruben Dias' impact wasn't quite so stark in that sense - City only let in four fewer goals in his debut campaign than they did in 2019-20 - the Portuguese made a huge difference alongside John Stones. With him in the team, Pep Guardiola's men won 38 of 50 matches - a rate of 76% - and kept 25 clean sheets as they eased to a fifth Premier League title, a fourth successive Carabao Cup success and reached the Champions League final. Solskjaer will be hoping the signing of Varane can be similarly transformative. The pacey centre-back, 28, is expected to partner Harry Maguire in the heart of the defence. Ex-Everton midfielder Don Hutchinson told BBC Radio Live's Football Daily: ""He is an absolute bargain. He is in his prime, is a multiple league winner, multiple Champions League winner, and is coming in as a finished article and one of the quickest centre-backs out there. ""You imagine his partnership with Harry Maguire would be very good. We have questioned the signings for quite a few years at Manchester United, but this one alongside Sancho shows where they are heading. This is a brilliant signing."" Former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison added: ""Sancho is an exciting signing, but Varane is a hell of a signing. He is a Rolls Royce. Lindelof did well but he doesn't have the pace to cover Maguire. "" Going on last season's stats, Varane is a proven upgrade on new team-mates Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly in a number of key areas, particularly tackles won and aerial duels. The Frenchman won an average of 0.8 of the former per 90 minutes compared with Lindelof's 0.6 and Bailly's 0.3 - and 2.4 of the latter on average, which is 0.1 more efficient than Lindelof and 0.3 than Bailly. His strength in the air will be crucial in both boxes. United scored just seven set-piece goals last term, the joint-third fewest in the league. And Varane's pace will allow them to defend with a higher line, enabling Solskjaer to make his team more tactically flexible. A World Cup winner with France in 2018, Varane recorded similar numbers of tackles and interceptions last season as Maguire did for United, and the hope is they could bring the best out of one another - like Dias did for Stones on the blue side of the city. Stats don't tell the full story though. Becoming a great defender is as much about mentality - and Varane is a winner. He has played in 10 finals, including three in the Champions League and one in the World Cup, and won them all. In contrast, Solskjaer has not yet won a trophy since taking over in December 2018, with defeat by Villarreal in the Europa League final in Gdansk extending his frustrating wait. And, together with the earlier signing of Sancho, ex-Everton midfielder Leon Osman believes they now can't be ruled out of the title race this season. He told the Football Daily podcast: ""We were all looking at Manchester United and thinking they were two players away - a centre-back and right-sided player. And they have gone and got them, like a top club does. They look like they are having a real good go and look like they could be real title contenders next season. ""Their issue is Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool are looking strong. Do I think they will win the title? No, I don't. But you can only ask a team to improve and Manchester United are doing that."" Hutchinson added: ""I think they are slightly behind Manchester City still. Liverpool will be back - [Ibrahima] Konate is a brilliant signing, although Jurgen [Klopp] could do with one or two players still. ""They are the teams to beat - and I wouldn't discount Chelsea, if they make signings. If they get that number nine I think they will scare the others and Manchester United are in the hunt as well. ""We are in for a brilliant Premier League - it is a four-horse race."" If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote. ",positive
61,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57827831,Jadon Sancho: England winger completes £73m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund,"England winger Jadon Sancho says joining Manchester United is ""a dream come true"" after he completed his £73m move from Borussia Dortmund. Sancho is the second most expensive English player of all time behind his new United team-mate Harry Maguire. He joins United on a five-year deal. ""I'll always be grateful to Dortmund for giving me the opportunity to play first-team football, although I always knew that I would return to England,"" 21-year-old Sancho said. ""The chance to join Manchester United is a dream come true and I just cannot wait to perform in the Premier League. ""This is a young and exciting squad and I know, together, we can develop into something special to bring the success that the fans deserve."" United agreed the fee for Sancho on 1 July and his five-year contract with the club has a further 12 month option. The completion of the deal brings to an end United's protracted pursuit of former Manchester City player Sancho. They had expected to sign him last summer but could not agree a fee. Sancho scored 50 goals and registered 57 assists in 137 appearances for Dortmund. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Old Trafford will give Sancho ""the platform he needs to release his untapped talent"". ""Jadon epitomises the type of player I want to bring to the club - he is a forward player in the best traditions of Manchester United,"" Solskjaer told the club website.external-link ""He will form an integral part of my squad for years to come and we look forward to seeing him blossom. His goals and assists records speak for themselves and he will also bring tremendous pace, flair and creativity to the team."" Sancho's return to the English game comes after he helped the national team reach the final of the European Championship, where they were beatenon penalties by Italy. The former City youth player, along with Bukayo Saka and now United team-mate Marcus Rashford, were subjected to racial abuse on social media after they failed to score in the decisive shootout. Sancho's move to Old Trafford will see him not only link up with England team-mate Rashford, but also Edinson Cavani, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood in what could prove a formidable attack for Solskjaer's side. Sancho scored 16 goals in all competitions during the 2020-21 season, five fewer than Rashford, but four more than Greenwood, and nine more than Martial. Cavani, who joined United on a free transfer last year after leaving Paris St-Germain, netted 17. In four seasons at Dortmund, Sancho notched 57 assists and created 65 big chances, more than Rashford, Martial, Greenwood and Cavani during the same period. Sancho also stacks up well when compared to some of the biggest names in Europe. Since the start of the 2018-19 season, only seven players have more combined goals and assists than the England international. Of those players, only Barcelona's Lionel Messi (43) has created more goals than Sancho (41) in that time.

62,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60342935,Bournemouth 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Cherries promoted to Premier League,"Kieffer Moore sent Bournemouth back to the Premier League with a late winner against Nottingham Forest that sealed automatic promotion from the Championship. Substitute Moore's cool finish, after a low free-kick found him unmarked in the box, leaves third-placed Forest needing to go through the play-offs if they are to join the Cherries in the top flight next season. Moore, a January arrival from Cardiff who has managed to make just three substitute appearances because of injury, was smothered by jubilant team-mates as they knew a win against their closest challengers would end a two-year top-flight absence. They return to the Premier League under manager Scott Parker, who celebrates his second promotion in three campaigns, having taken Fulham up in 2019-20 before leaving the west London club for Bournemouth following relegation last season. The showdown between second and third in the Championship, while lacking the hype and pageantry of a play-off final, felt every bit the high-stakes encounter that makes the Wembley showpiece the richest game in club football. In an absorbing and tense first half, Forest striker Sam Surridge hit the crossbar and had a strong penalty appeal ignored after an incorrect offside flag against him. The forward was brought down by goalkeeper Mark Travers as he tried to round him, but the foul was waved away as the flag was already up. After the match, Forest boss Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham that referee Stuart Attwell and his assistant apologised for the mistake. ""They have put their hands up and owned up to a huge error,"" he said. ""It doesn't really help but at least they had the courtesy to own up to the decision that they made."" The visitors created little in a second half dominated by the Cherries, with Dominic Solanke hitting the side netting while Philip Billing and Jaidon Anthony tested Reds goalkeeper Brice Samba. When Jordan Zemura was brought down on the edge of the area, Billing appeared to be ready to go directly for goal. Instead, he spotted Moore free in box to sweep home a goal that propelled the hosts back to the Premier League and sparked a party atmosphere at the Vitality Stadium, which saw ecstatic home fans spill onto the pitch at full-time. Bournemouth, who are now six points clear of Forest, have spent just one of the past 32 weeks outside the automatic promotion spots. In stark contrast, Forest spent 46 of the first 52 days of the season in the relegation places after making their worst start to a campaign for more than a century. Since Cooper's appointment as Chris Hughton's replacement in September, no side has collected more points than the Reds as they have mounted what would once have seemed to be a preposterous bid to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League after 23 years away. When Forest beat Huddersfield on 18 September for their first win - a victory secured under caretaker Steven Reid - the East Midlands club were bottom of the table and 14 points adrift of then leaders Bournemouth. Forest started the night knowing victory would take them above the hosts on goal difference and into pole position to claim the last remaining automatic promotion place with one game to go. After Billing tested Samba with an awkward curled shot, it was former Cherries striker Surridge who took centre stage, crashing a powerful shot off the crossbar before the controversial offside decision. Bournemouth emerged re-energised after the interval, afforded Forest little space or time to play the free-flowing attacking football that saw them win nine of their previous 10 games, and created the better chances before Moore buried his with a fine first-time finish beyond Samba with seven minutes remaining. Forest finish the season with a trip to Hull on Saturday, knowing victory would guarantee them third place, while Bournemouth host Millwall who are hoping to sneak into the play-offs themselves. Bournemouth boss Parker told BBC Radio Solent: ""I never wanted the game to be an emotional one, I felt if we turned it into an emotional game it would suit Forest. ""It was easier said than done, and we got dragged into that, it became helter-skelter, a basketball game. If we'd shown the same performance second half there would have only been one winner. ""We've executed second half tonight, we were electric and certainly worthy of the result. My emotions are ecstatic."" Nottingham Forest boss Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""Obviously it hurts, but like it or not we have to get over it and get ready for the play-offs. ""Congratulations to Bournemouth, promotion wasn't just about tonight. It was about getting to the position they had been in. We go into the play-offs now to try and join them.""

63,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57268064,Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea: Kai Havertz goal secures Champions League trophy for Chelsea,"Chelsea won the Champions League for the second time with a fully deserved victory over Manchester City in an all-Premier League confrontation in Porto. Thomas Tuchel got the better of his Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola for the third time since succeeding sacked Frank Lampard in January to bring European club football's biggest prize back to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2012. Kai Havertz, blossoming after a slow start to his Chelsea career, got the winner three minutes before half-time when he collected a defence-splitting pass from Mason Mount to round City goalkeeper Ederson and score. It leaves City still searching for the Champions League, the trophy that has always eluded them, and Guardiola cannot escape scrutiny for his part in this defeat after taking a tactical gamble which backfired. Guardiola surprisingly decided against utilising either Rodri or Fernandinho as a defensive midfielder, leaving City with a muddled game plan that reduced their effectiveness and rarely presented Chelsea with any problems. Chelsea had the better opportunities throughout, Timo Werner wasting two good chances before Havertz struck and substitute Christian Pulisic squandering another in the second half. City, who lost Kevin De Bruyne to injury midway through the second half, threw on Sergio Aguero for his final appearance but there was no fairytale ending for the club's greatest goalscorer as Chelsea closed out the win. And for Tuchel it was elation after the disappointment of losing last year's final as manager of Paris St-Germain. Tuchel made it three out of three against Guardiola by producing a fiercely disciplined, positive Chelsea performance that has brought a season that was shrouded in uncertainty to the most glorious conclusion. The German has transformed Chelsea since his arrival in January, making significant changes by restoring the towering Antonio Rudiger in central defence and playing the magnificent man-of-the-match N'golo Kante in the position in which he is quite simply a world-class operator. Kante controlled everything from his position in midfield, the complete player giving a breathtaking performance. Chelsea needed to be defensively perfect but this was no smash-and-grab result. It was a front-foot display to take the initiative away from City in the first half. They then held firm in the second with very few anxious moments. They even survived the first-half loss of the experienced Thiago Silva to injury and carried on in the same measured, committed fashion. It is a huge personal triumph for Tuchel, who already had victories against Guardiola in the FA Cup semi-final and in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium going in to this game. And the confidence and self-belief those victories brought was in evidence as Chelsea played with a fearless attitude that never allowed City to settle and sparked wild scenes of celebration among players, staff and the fans inside Porto's Estadio do Dragao. The scale of Tuchel's achievement is that this night was barely imaginable when he arrived in January but now Chelsea are champions of Europe for a second time. City's march to their first Champions League final was accompanied by a sense of destiny - that their years of suffering in Europe's elite tournament were about to end, especially after the manner in which they overcame Paris St-Germain in the semi-final. Sadly for Guardiola's side, the agony will go on after a final in which the Premier League champions failed miserably to do themselves justice and their Spanish manager played a part in their downfall as he tried to join Bob Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane in the select group to win this tournament three times. Eyebrows were raised when he decided against utilising either of his outstanding holding midfield men Rodri and Fernandinho in favour of an all-out attacking line-up. It produced a confused, muddled performance with the likes of Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin de Bruyne seemingly uncertain of their roles. And with Raheem Sterling having a disappointing night on the left flank as he was dominated by Reece James before being substituted, City rarely carried the threat that has made them the prime force in the Premier League this season. And there was sadness as Aguero was a loser on his final appearance for the club after a glittering career. Guardiola turned to City's greatest goalscorer late on but Chelsea were not to be moved or play their part in someone else's happy ending. City have still had a season of success winning the title and the League Cup. This is still a very bitter pill for Guardiola and his team to swallow but they can tell no hard luck stories about this game.

64,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

65,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season. ""Let's look forward to that, rather than dwell on a poor performance - they were good, but we weren't aggressive, didn't defend our box well and in the end felt a bit a sorry for ourselves.""

66,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60208290,Liverpool transfer news: Deal for Fulham forward Fabio Carvalho falls down,"Liverpool failed in their bid to sign Fulham's talented teenage forward Fabio Carvalho before the window closed. The clubs agreed a fee in the region of £8m shortly before the deadline but the final details of the transfer could not be concluded in time. The deal included 19-year-old Carvalho being loaned back to Fulham. No deal sheets are used in the EFL and, with the loan back being non-negotiable for Fulham, Liverpool were frustrated in their attempts. The Portugal-born England youth international has scored eight goals in 23 games for Fulham since making his debut in September 2020. This month Liverpool have signed Colombia winger Luis Diaz from Porto in a deal worth 45m euros (£37.5m), with a further 15m euros (£12.5m) in potential bonuses, while defender Nat Phillips joined Bournemouth on loan. Meanwhile, Fulham's Belgian defender Denis Odoi, 33, has left after five-and-a-half years to join Club Bruges in his homeland. ",negative
67,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44178427,Aston Villa 0-1 Fulham,"Fulham have been promoted to the Premier League after beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Captain Tom Cairney was their goalscorer, finishing neatly underneath Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after latching onto Ryan Sessegnon's pass midway through the first half. A fractious game ended with Fulham down to 10 men after centre-back Denis Odoi was sent off for two bookable offences - both for fouls on Jack Grealish. Villa were furious that Ryan Fredericks escaped a card during a first-half tangle with Grealish, the Fulham right-back landing studs first on Grealish's leg, while the Villa man was later booked for a lunging tackle on Cairney. Several Villa penalty appeals were also waved away by referee Anthony Taylor, including one in second-half stoppage time when Grealish fell under a challenge from Matt Targett. The game opened up after the interval, with Villa much more incisive and Grealish looking most likely to find a reply. However, the midfielder headed over the bar under pressure from Marcus Bettinelli and then saw his mazy run thwarted by a combination of the Fulham goalkeeper and Kevin McDonald. Odoi's red card invited further pressure, but Fulham held firm during a late Villa onslaught to clinch a win that is worth an estimated £160m - a figure which financial experts Deloitte say could rise to as much as £280m if the Whites survive for more than one season in the top flight. It was perhaps fitting that Sessegnon and Cairney, the two shining lights in an impressive Fulham team this season, combined to score the goal that sent them back to the top flight after a four-year absence. The pair were two of the three nominees for the EFL's Championship Player of the Season award, which was won by teenager Sessegnon. The 18-year-old winger had been largely anonymous early on, but he found space in the centre of the Villa half and picked his pass perfectly to find the onrushing Cairney, who slotted coolly into the net. Sessegnon could have doubled Fulham's lead before half-time but his back-post header was directed straight at Johnstone, while he almost set up Stefan Johansen for a second goal midway through the second period. ""We've suffered for three years, not just in the second half,"" said Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic, who won promotion as Watford boss in 2015 but left the Hornets before he got the chance to take charge of them in the Premier League. ""It's not been easy since I've been at this place. We've shown with our style that we can be one of the best Championship teams, and we've shown we can be solid, organised and fighting altogether for a clean sheet."" Fulham's transformation from mid-table underperformers to promotion winners has been one of the feature points of the Championship season. Defeat at struggling Sunderland on 16 December left them 12th in the table, 18 points behind the top two. Twenty-three unbeaten matches later, they were on the brink of automatic promotion and, had they won their final game at Birmingham, they would have finished second behind champions Wolves. There was to be no repeat of last season's play-off disappointment, though. The Whites saw off Derby over two legs in their semi-final before beating Villa at Wembley. While many have played their part, two January loan additions have been critical to their success. Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has netted 12 goals in 20 appearances and given the team a physical presence up front, while the arrival of Southampton left-back Targett has allowed Sessegnon to push further forward and excel in a more advanced position. Fulham spent 13 successive seasons in the top flight before their relegation in 2014 and the hope is that the nucleus of this team, helped by the financial backing of owner Shahid Khan, can see them become an established Premier League club again. Their possession-based style has been as eye-catching as anything on show in the second tier and that brand of football should transfer well to the higher level, although there is very little top-flight experience in Fulham's ranks and that is likely to be an area that Jokanovic will look to address in the next couple of months. On another day, Villa could have been awarded at least one penalty and had a man advantage for more than an hour. In particular it was the Fredericks incident, which occurred right in front of the two dugouts immediately after Cairney's winning goal, that most angered Villa boss Steve Bruce. ""There were big decisions that went against us,"" said the former Manchester United captain, who failed to win a record fifth promotion from the second tier. ""For me, the boy should have had a red card very early. It was right in front of the referee and the fourth official, and for me he stamps on him. ""Nobody wants to see people sent off, but when it's as deliberate as that, he deserved a red card. ""There might have been a penalty in the second half, but what we can't disguise is that we didn't do enough in the first half. ""You just need a break and unfortunately we didn't get it."" Many Villa fans will look back at this season and wonder what might have been. What if talismanic midfielder Grealish had not sustained a freakish kidney injury that caused him to miss the first three months of the campaign? What if striker Jonathan Kodjia had not suffered another long-term injury that wrecked his second season with the club? And what if a possible season-defining 4-1 win over leaders Wolves in March, which left them four points off second place with 10 matches remaining and looked to have kick-started an automatic promotion push, had not been followed by miserable defeats by lowly QPR and Bolton? Villa have spent heavily in the past two seasons in their bid to return to the top flight, but they will have to cut their cloth accordingly as they prepare for a third successive season in the second tier. Grealish was their stand-out performer at Wembley. He was outstanding, almost scored one of the best goals ever in a play-off final and did not deserve to be on the losing side. His consistent form in the second half of the campaign has been a huge positive for Villa and he is sure to be a target for Premier League clubs this summer, so keeping the 22-year-old at Villa Park will be paramount to Bruce's side mounting another challenge for promotion next season. ""The discussions have got to be had above me to say what we've got and what we haven't got,"" said Bruce, who added it is up to veteran captain John Terry to decide whether he will play on at Villa Park next season. ""Of course there will be speculation about Jack. Personally, I would like him to stay. Another year with us would do him the world of good. ""We'd love to have given him the platform of the Premier League and we haven't, but he's playing regular football week in and week out. We'll see what happens.""

68,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46205801,Fulham sack Slavisa Jokanovic and appoint Claudio Ranieri,"Fulham have sacked manager Slavisa Jokanovic and replaced him with Claudio Ranieri, who guided Leicester to the Premier League title in 2016. Jokanovic makes way with the Cottagers sitting bottom of the Premier League table with five points from 12 matches. Italian Ranieri, 67, has been given a ""multi-year"" contract by the Londoners. ""Making a change without having the right answer or succession plan was not an option,"" said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan. ""So having someone of Claudio's calibre ready to accept our challenge was comforting but, most of all, essential. ""Claudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham. ""His recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary, and then you look at Claudio's experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe, and it's pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham Football Club."" Khan said he and his son Tony Khan, the club's vice chairman and director of football operations, spoke with a number of potential candidates over the past week. ""It is an honour to accept Mr Khan's invitation and opportunity to lead Fulham, a fantastic club with tradition and history,"" said Ranieri, who spent last season in charge of French club Nantes. ""The objective at Fulham should never be to merely survive in the Premier League. We must at all times be a difficult opponent and should expect to succeed. ""This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table."" Slavisa Jokanovic was Claudio Ranieri's first signing as Chelsea manager in October 2000. Ranieri's first game in charge will see Fulham host Southampton at Craven Cottage on Saturday, 24 November. ""I know this team is very capable of better performances, which we will work on straight away as we prepare for Southampton at the Cottage,"" he added. Despite vast experience with clubs such as Valencia, Juventus, Inter Milan, Roma and Monaco, Ranieri joined Leicester City in 2015 on the back of a failed spell as Greece boss, including losing to European minnows the Faroe Islands during Euro 2016 qualifying. The Italian had earned the nickname 'The Tinkerman' during his previous spell in England in charge of Chelsea, where he guided the Blues to second in the Premier League as well as reaching the Champions League semi-finals. More than a decade later, his Leicester side started the 2015-16 season as 5,000-1 outsiders to win the Premier League and were among the favourites for relegation. But the Foxes delivered one the greatest sporting shocks of all time as they clinched the club's first top-flight English title, described by many as a ""miracle"". The fairytale could not continue, however, with Ranieri sacked the following campaign - just ninth months after delivering the title. Jokanovic, who joined the club in December 2015, led Fulham to promotion via the play-offs last season. But they have so far registered just one win on their return to the Premier League after four seasons in the Championship. ""I wasn't anticipating having to make this announcement related to Slavisa and wish the circumstances were such that I didn't have to, but our path this season has led me to make what I know is the correct decision, at the right time, for our players, the club and our supporters,"" added Khan. ""Slavisa will always have my appreciation and respect for everything he did to return Fulham to top-flight football. ""I am hoping everyone in the Fulham family shares my heartfelt sentiments for Slavisa and joins me in wishing him success and good fortune, wherever his next stop may be."" Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer Fulham's owner Shahid Khan delivered combative public support for manager Slavisa Jokanovic in his programme notes for the home game against Bournemouth less than three weeks ago, telling fans ""don't believe anything"" in reports he faced the sack. Times change. Quickly. Fulham were beaten 3-0 by The Cherries, then lost at fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town, and Sunday's defeat at Liverpool was the last straw. The man who guided The Cottagers to promotion was gone. Khan reacted as Fulham lay bottom of the Premier League, after a summer investment of £100m only resulted in an imbalanced side where few new faces had made an impact, a loss of the attacking impetus that was their trademark and the worst defensive record in the division. The fear of relegation always overrules sentiment. So it is welcome back to the Premier League for ever-popular Claudio Ranieri, whose title-winning deeds at Leicester City will be remembered forever. This time he must work fast to turn a serious situation around with his brand of personal charm but more importantly his tactical acumen, starting with shoring up that porous defence. It will be no easy task for 'The Tinkerman'. ",positive

The Italian's last game was Wednesday's 2-0 defeat by Southampton, which left the Cottagers 19th in the Premier League, 10 points from safety with 10 games left. Ranieri took over in November after the sacking of Slavisa Jokanovic. The 67-year-old won only three of his 17 games as manager. It included a 3-2 victory over Southampton in his first game, but 11 defeats have followed including an FA Cup third-round exit at home to League Two side Oldham. Chairman Shahid Khan said in a statement: ""Claudio walked into a difficult situation, inheriting a side that gained only one point in its prior eight matches, and he provided an immediate boost by leading our club to nine points in his first eight matches as manager. ""Though we were unable to maintain that pace thereafter, I am grateful for his effort. Claudio leaves Fulham as our friend and he will undoubtedly experience success again soon. ""Scott's immediate assignment is merely to help us stabilise, grow and rediscover ourselves as a football club. ""If Scott can answer that challenge, and our players respond to the opportunity, perhaps victories will follow in the months ahead."" Ranieri led Leicester City to a miraculous Premier League title triumph in 2016, but was sacked just nine months later and then had a season in charge at French Ligue 1 side Nantes. He took over on a ""multi-year"" contract at Fulham when they were bottom of the table with five points from their opening 12 matches, but failed to oversee an upturn in fortunes. Ranieri added: ""I am obviously disappointed with the recent results and that we could not build on the good start we made following my appointment. Finally, I would like to thank the club, the players and the fans for the support they have given me during my time at the club."" Former midfielder Parker will become Fulham's sixth manager in 56 Premier League games after Martin Jol, Rene Meulensteen, Felix Magath, Jokanovic and Ranieri. The 38-year-old, capped 18 times by England, has no previous managerial experience but played nearly 600 professional games, mainly in the Premier League for Charlton, Chelsea, Newcastle, West Ham and Tottenham, before ending his career at Fulham in June 2017.

70,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/53603848,Championship play-off final: Brentford 1-2 Fulham (AET),"Fulham beat Brentford in the Championship play-off final to secure an immediate return to the Premier League thanks to two extra-time goals from Joe Bryan. The left-back caught Bees goalkeeper David Raya off guard with a free-kick from 40 yards in the 105th minute of the game at Wembley, with the Spaniard expecting a cross and then unable to scamper back and save Bryan's skidding low effort. With the Bees pouring forward in search of an equaliser, Bryan burst forward and combined with Aleksandar Mitrovic before stabbing past Raya to make the game safe with three minutes remaining. Henrik Dalsgaard pulled a goal back with a header from eight yards out in the fourth minute of added time, but it was too late for the Bees to spark a comeback. The goals from Bryan were two rare moments of quality and quick-thinking in an otherwise cagey encounter between the two west London rivals, which finished goalless after 90 minutes. Scott Parker celebrated wildly at full-time having led Fulham to promotion in his first full season as manager. The 39-year-old was unable to save them from top-flight relegation after replacing Claudio Ranieri in February 2019, but can now prepare them for a 15th campaign in the Premier League. Parker was unable to call on top scorer Mitrovic, returning from injury, from the start - but the Serbia international showed composure to tee-up Bryan for the crucial second goal with a slick one-two inside the box. Ivan Cavaleiro almost made it 3-0 for Fulham in the closing stages when he was denied by Raya, and Dalsgaard's header came far too late to set up a Bees comeback. Bryan had only scored once this season for the Whites heading into the game, but the 26-year-old ended up being the hero as his goals secured a promotion which could be worth £135m over the next three years. Parker has transformed Fulham's fortunes following their relegation last summer - as the Whites suffered 26 defeats and conceded 81 goals over the course of the 2018-19 league campaign. They were among the favourites to go straight back up pre-season, but were unable to overhaul Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion as they stuttered at certain points of a campaign halted for three months by the coronavirus crisis. Mitrovic missed both legs of their semi-final win against Cardiff through injury, and the Championship's golden boot winner was only fit enough for a place on the bench. Despite the 25-year-old's absence, Parker's side had the better chances in a low-key first 90 minutes, with Raya twice saving from Josh Onomah in the first half. However, midfielder Harrison Reed was fortunate to only see yellow for a crunching challenge on Christian Norgaard before the break. Neeskens Kebano sent a free-kick into the side-netting soon after the restart and Bobby Decordova-Reid stabbed an effort wide from 12 yards out. Meanwhile, Marek Rodak's only save of note came in the second half when the Slovakian tipped over a fierce effort from Brentford's Ollie Watkins. Brentford head coach Thomas Frank will be left wondering where things went wrong, as his side spurned another chance to win promotion to the top flight. Brentford needed four points from their final two games of the season against Stoke and Barnsley to go up automatically but lost both matches to finish third. His prolific forward line of Said Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and Watkins had netted 59 goals between them in 2019-20, but were unable to produce clear-cut openings against a stubborn Fulham backline. The Bees have assembled a young and attacking squad via a recruitment model largely based on analytics, but Frank will now face a battle to hang on to Watkins and Benrahma, who are likely be the subject of transfer interest from Premier League clubs. It is Brentford's fourth play-off final defeat, and they have now failed to win promotion in nine play-off campaigns - setting a new English Football League record. Their exile from the top flight will stretch into a 74th year as the Bees move into their new 17,500-capacity stadium at Lionel Road ahead of the start of next season. Former England midfielder Parker said he was proud that players involved in last season's disastrous Premier League campaign had bounced back. ""We've done what we've done tonight, but there's still improvement, and that's what makes me so proud and happy,"" he added. ""For all of the good players and everything you see, what makes me so happy I see a group of players who only a year ago were struggling psychologically, didn't have a mindset or mentality. ""I've driven this team every single day and what makes me proud is I stood on the touchline tonight and seen a team that represents what I've been saying over the last 12 months."" Brentford boss Frank was also full of praise for his side. ""First I would like to say congratulations to Fulham, Scott Parker, his coaching staff and everyone involved,"" the Dane said. ""Of course it's tough when you lose a final like this in a very tight game but I'm extremely proud of my players. ""We have gone from a mid-table club to a team who, in the league table, was the third-best team.

71,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61284264,Real Madrid 4-0 Espanyol: Real win title as Carlo Ancelotti completes 'Grand Slam',"Carlo Ancelotti became the first manager to win the league in all five of Europe's major leagues as Real Madrid beat Espanyol to win La Liga. Two goals from Rodrygo and strikes from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema confirmed Real's 35th Spanish title. They are 17 points clear of second-placed Sevilla with four games to play. Ancelotti has also won titles in Italy's Serie A, France's Ligue 1, the Premier League in England and the German Bundesliga. Real needed only a draw to win the title, but victory was never really in doubt once Rodrygo stroked home from just inside the area. The Brazilian doubled Real's lead a minute before the break when he robbed Sergi Gomez of possession on the edge of the penalty area and fired low into the bottom corner. Asensio finished off a rapid counter-attack before Benzema - rested with Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Manchester City in mind - came off the bench to sidefoot home from Vinicius Jr's cutback. Ancelotti was lured back for a second spell at Real last summer following the departure of Zinedine Zidane, quitting Everton after 18 months at the Premier League club. The 62-year-old won five major titles in two years at the Bernabeu between 2013 and 2015, including 'La Decima' - their 10th European Cup - but the Spanish title eluded him. His first league title as a manager was with AC Milan in 2004, the club where he won the league twice as a player in the 1980s. The Premier League with Chelsea followed in 2010, before Ancelotti lifted Ligue 1 with Paris St-Germain in 2013 and the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in 2017. Ancelotti's season could end in more glory, although Real must overturn a 4-3 first-leg deficit against City at the Bernabeu. If they do reach the final and lift the trophy Ancelotti would become the only man to win the European Cup or Champions League four times as a manager, having also led AC Milan to the trophy in 2003 and 2007. Wales forward Gareth Bale, who will leave Real Madrid when his contract expires this summer, was absent for the team's title celebrations. In a tweet Bale said: ""So disappointed that I'm not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title.

72,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205839,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison winner boosts strugglers' survival hopes,"Everton moved to within two points of the Premier League safety zone with a priceless win over Chelsea that was inspired by a thunderous atmosphere at Goodison Park. Starting the day in the relegation places, five points behind Leeds and Burnley, the hosts were lifted by their fans in their attempt to extend a 68-year stay in the top flight. Everton's aggressive pressing was eventually rewarded a minute after the break when Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and scored his ninth goal of the season. The Brazilian celebrated by picking up a smoke flare that had landed on to the pitch and throwing it back towards the stands. Vitalii Mykolenko could have doubled the lead soon afterwards but skewed wide, and Everton were indebted to two stunning saves from Jordan Pickford to keep themselves in front. First, the Everton keeper denied Azpilicueta after Mason Mount's shot hit both posts and spun out. From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment. It was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German. Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge. The victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals. Chelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel. Tuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham. If Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety. With so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival. Chelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night. Before kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. And in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans. At times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount. Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park. The football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion. Mount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort. But no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics. Azpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy. Three minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range. But around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored. Mount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy. From the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact. Following that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison. Pickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.

73,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198227,Barnsley 1-3 Preston North End: Daniel Johnson scores twice for Lilywhites,"Daniel Johnson's double gave Preston the points in the Championship at already-relegated Barnsley. Aiden Marsh gave the home side the lead when he in volleyed from Victor Adeboyejo's cutback - a first goal for the promising youngster. But after that it was Preston who made the better chances and were level a few minutes later after Emil Riis Jakobsen played in Johnson to score in the bottom right corner. Johnson repeated the trick with an even better strike into the same side of the goal 10 minutes into the second half. And Riis Jakobsen made the game safe when he scored his 19th goal of the season, finishing from a tight angle. With Barnsley already resigned to League One football next term and Preston in mid-table, there was little to play for in the penultimate game of the league season at Oakwell. Preston created the better chances after their equaliser with Ben Whiteman hitting the bar just before the break and Jack Walton pushing Patrick Bauer's header past the post. The visitors should have added a third when Jakobsen side-footed his effort straight at Walton after being played in by Cameron Archer. Preston used the match to mark Gentry Day, an annual event organised by the fans to remember any North End follower or player who has passed away in the previous 12 months.

74,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198200,Blackburn Rovers 0-3 Bournemouth: Solanke & Billing shine in Cherries victory,"Dominic Solanke's 30th goal of a prolific season and a double from Philip Billing kept Bournemouth on track for promotion to the Premier League and put an end to Blackburn's play-off hopes. Solanke slotted low into the corner to put the away side on their way to a win which sets up a tantalising meeting with in-form Nottingham Forest, who, following their 5-1 victory over Swansea, would go above Bournemouth with victory on Tuesday evening with just one game left to play. The Cherries were equally impressive in their win and will go into the fixture full of confidence thanks to a clinical attacking display at Ewood Park. Solanke shone throughout and teed up Billing, who fired the ball home from inside the box, and a routine victory was sealed when Billing slotted in his second from close range with just over 10 minutes remaining. Huddersfield beat Coventry 2-1 and can still mathematically sneak into the automatic promotion spots, but need to win their final game, hope Forest beat Bournemouth, both sides lose their final game, while the Terriers must also overturn a huge goal difference. Bournemouth will be sure of securing automatic promotion if they beat Forest in midweek, while two draws from their final two games will also be enough to take them back to the Premier League. The Cherries were good value for their half-time lead against a side who did not manage an attempt on target and never looked in serious danger against a Rovers side who realistically had to win to keep alive their slim play-off chances. Solanke was involved in much of the away side's most dangerous moments, finding Billing who saw his early shot blocked before the same duo combined neatly to put the Cherries ahead when Billing put Solanke through and the former Liverpool striker finished coolly. The lead should have been doubled soon after when Jaidon Anthony's fierce strike crashed back off the bar following another cute pass from Solanke. Bournemouth continued to remain on top after the break, although Ben Brereton Diaz did force keeper Mark Travers into a decent save after working his way into the box. But, after Jefferson Lerma had an effort cleared off the line and Solanke went close, the visitors did go further ahead thanks to two goals in 10 minutes from Billing to seal a result which keeps them in prime spot in a thrilling promotion race. Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray: ""It's ok running, chasing and tackling, but sometimes you play against better teams. We've already beaten Bournemouth this season, I get that, but they do have some really high-quality players. ""We had some chances and they had some chances to score. We didn't take ours and they took theirs. ""The more you try to attack to win a game, you leave yourself more vulnerable and I think that's what happened today. ""Against the quality of Bournemouth, they punished us today, but I couldn't question the desire of our team. We needed one of our chances to go in. ""Mid-February we were sitting second in the league and it's obviously frustrating we've missed out on the play-offs with a game to go. I feel as if I'm leaving them with some talent in that squad and some assets there and hopefully they can continue to grow."" Bournemouth boss Scott Parker: ""Overall, it was a day that went to plan in every aspect. ""We knew Blackburn would have to come at us. They needed a result with the position they were in. ""We needed to be solid and diligent and all that side of the game, which we showed. We also knew if it opened up, we needed to be clinical . And we were definitely that as well. ""We needed every single player one pulling in the right direction and that has certainly been the case for large parts of the season.  It was a high-pressure game. The result was key. Performance is secondary at this part of the season. But we got a result and we got a performance. We were deadly in our moments. ""I've been in football for a long time and there's only limited teams that get to a point where they have opportunities to be successful.

A first half lacking in quality saw both sides struggle to create opportunities, but the Seasiders squandered the best chance to go ahead when Gary Madine saw his penalty saved by Kelle Roos after James Husband had been felled in the area by Festy Ebosele. Both sides improved after the interval, with Kirk and Madine both going close for the hosts. But Ebiowei fired home the opening goal from inside the box after a smart cross by Ravel Morrison. Victory in front of more than 4,000 travelling fans was all but assured when the excellent Ebiowei sent in an inviting free-kick which Cashin converted past keeper Chris Maxwell. Third-from-bottom Derby's 14th win of the season capped a more encouraging week for Wayne Rooney's troubled side, with the Rams boss saying that he expects to have the club's takeover agreed in the next 10 days. Chris Kirchner was earlier this month named as the preferred bidder to buy the Rams and take them out of administration. Meanwhile, Blackpool are 16th in the table but could still climb as high as 10th with victory against Peterborough United on the final day of the season on Saturday, 7 May. Blackpool boss Neil Critchley: ""When you get a crowd like we had today, you want to give them a day to remember with some goals and a win. Unfortunately, we've not been able to do that. ""The game probably epitomised our season a bit. We were the better team in large parts, but didn't finish our chances. We conceded two really poor goals, and that was frustrating. ""Gary had his penalty saved - the goalkeeper pulled off a very good save. We've had other chances and lots of moments in the final third which we didn't finish. ""It's obviously disappointing to lose but it doesn't change my opinion of the season as a whole. We've had a very good season."" Derby boss Wayne Rooney: ""I'm delighted. We weren't at our best. It's as poor a performance as we've had for while. ""But football's a funny game.  We kept a clean sheet. Kelle kept us in a with a great penalty save. We got the first goal, which is so important, saw the game out and came away with three points. ""We dug in. The lads have showed spirit and togetherness all season.

76,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198199,Bristol City 5-0 Hull City: Five-goal Bristol City thrash Hull,"Chris Martin and Andreas Weimann scored twice as Bristol City romped to a 5-0 win over Hull City, securing back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Weimann open the Robins' account after only five minutes with his 21st goal of the campaign. Antoine Semenyo doubled the lead with a strike into the bottom corner and Chris Martin capped a fine attacking display 60 seconds later, after being set up by the 22-year-old. Martin then made it four early in the second half, before Austria striker Weimann added a fifth with a chip over Nathan Baxter as Bristol City recorded their biggest win of the season. Nigel Pearson's side have struggled with consistency all season but one major positive has been the improvement to their threat in front of goal. Weimann, Martin and Semenyo now have 42 goals between them. The Austrian struck first with a goal that started from Bristol City keeper Dan Bentley at the back, from which Semenyo set up Weimann who took the ball over Nathan Baxter. Semenyo then put his own name on the scoresheet, pouncing on a Hull mistake in midfield and rifling the ball into the left corner. He was involved again a minute later, playing in Martin who only had to tap in as the home side ripped Hull's defence to pieces. Martin got his second before the hour mark, stealing the ball off Sean McLoughlin and running down half of the pitch before stroking the ball beyond Baxter in a one-on-one. Weimann completed the rout eight minutes from time with a delicate chip into the net from close range as Bristol City successfully backed up their win over Derby last week. The Robins stay 17th, but are now five points clear of 18th-placed Hull. Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson told BBC Radio Bristol: ""It's a really positive way to finish the season at home. I suppose one of the questions will be why has it not happened earlier. I always like to concentrate on what the positives are and I think today was such a comprehensive win, it's important that we enjoy it. ""For all three of the strike force to get on the scoresheet again is very, very important. Andi getting two, Chrissy getting two, Antoine one, it's just shows you where we are and the types of players that we have and to keep a clean sheet too was very important. ""I think the message for our fans to go home with is also very important too and that is that we'll do everything we can to improve on where we are at the moment."" Hull City manager Shota Arveladze told BBC Radio Humberside: ""There's too short time to find out what happened today and give you an answer. There was a little bit the impression that says the season is over or something like that; get soft, get easy. Starting with myself I gave the wrong impression last week. ""Even though we tried to prepare the same way as we've done all the time, our work analysing, but it was not enough probably and it cost us what it cost. ""Maybe my body language, my voice, I was quiet maybe on the field giving the messages. There's no point giving this performance like the season is just over before the game. Our season is not over and these boys they've never done this, shown this. ""But today was very slow, sloppy, easy everything slow, everything slow, thinking slow, actions slow, give the opponent anything they wish to play the game they do.

77,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198204,Cardiff City 1-1 Birmingham City: Will Vaulks penalty cancels out Jeremie Bela strike,"Cardiff City and Birmingham City both saw late-season winless runs continue as Will Vaulks' late penalty denied the Blues a rare away win. Lee Bowyer's team were on course for just a fifth travelling triumph of the Championship season after Jeremie Bela's precise finish. But Vaulks' spot-kick saw Cardiff end a four-game losing streak in their last home match of the campaign. The hosts' fightback means Birmingham are also without a win in five matches. Birmingham stay 20th in the table, with Steve Morison's Cardiff one place and three points better off going into the final weekend of what has proved an arduous campaign for both clubs. But for the points deductions at Derby County and Reading, this would have been a hugely significant fixture in the Championship relegation scrap. Birmingham would have started the day in the bottom three, with Cardiff just three points above them. Instead there was little at stake in a contest between two clubs who will hope for much better next season. There were chances at both ends in the first half, with Perry Ng forcing Neil Etheridge to shovel his long-range effort away before Cody Drameh's follow-up shot was beaten away by the ex-Cardiff goalkeeper. At the other end, Dillon Phillips made fairly routine saves from Juninho Bacuna and Onel Hernandez before Birmingham scored on the counter. The goal came from an attacking Tommy Doyle set-piece which was headed clear by Maxime Colin. Bacuna threaded a perfect pass through a ragged Cardiff rearguard for Bela and the Frenchman finished in style, guiding his shot into the bottom corner. Birmingham threatened to double their advantage early in the second period when Gary Gardner headed narrowly wide of the far post, before Jordan Hugill stroked home from close range only for an offside flag to stifle home celebrations. Cardiff kept plugging away, with Mark Harris' penalty appeal ignored before Vaulks' crisp drive flew too close to Etheridge. Jordan James wasted a chance to settle the contest as he shot narrowly wide from Hernandez's pull-back, and Birmingham were made to pay when Ng chipped a pass into the visitors' box and Etheridge raced off his line and collided with Max Watters. There was no debate about the award of Cardiff's first penalty of the season - and there was no doubt about the finish, either, as Vaulks smashed high into the net from 12 yards. Cardiff manager Steve Morison: ""They had one counter-attack in the first half and a moment after that, but we dominated from start to finish. ""We have just got to get better in the final third, you can see that - it's as clear as day. We haven't had a penalty all year. It was nice to get one and Will put it away. ""I am pleased that they stuck at it and gave it a right go. It's nice to not end with a loss in the last home game of the season. ""They had a couple of hairy moments in the second half where they could have scored, but we could have scored plenty as well."" Birmingham manager Lee Bowyer: ""We're disappointed not to win the game. I felt we were the better side for large periods. I didn't see them scoring from open play and I thought we handled them well. ""I thought we controlled the game. We should have taken more advantage in the first half and scored another goal. We had chances in the second half as well but we didn't score and at 1-0 you always leave yourself open for them to nick a draw and that's what they did. ""We didn't do too much wrong but it's another case of dropping two points. ""We didn't take our chances but I've said that too many times this season. We didn't lose, the players gave everything from start to finish but it wasn't a win."" Formation  5-3-2 Formation  3-4-1-2 Match ends, Cardiff City 1, Birmingham City 1.

78,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198197,Coventry City 0-2 Huddersfield Town: Faustino Anjorin scores first Terriers goal in win,"Faustino Anjorin scored his first Huddersfield Town goal to ensure the Terries sealed a top-four finish with victory at Coventry City. The victory leaves the Terriers, who have just one match remaining, equal on points with Nottingham Forest in third and three points adrift of Bournemouth in second spot. Huddersfield's improbable aspirations of automatic promotion now hinge on Forest beating second-placed Bournemouth on Tuesday, and both the Cherries and Reds losing heavily on the final day, while the Terriers would need to win big against Bristol City to overturn a large goal difference deficit. Harry Toffolo's brilliant strike in the final minute of the first half put Huddersfield ahead at Coventry with just their second shot on goal. Terriers goalkeeper Lee Nicholls made a series of fine saves against a Coventry side that had 22 shots, before victory was sealed from the penalty spot late on by 20-year-old Chelsea loanee Anjorin following Ben Wilson's foul on Lewis O'Brien. Viktor Gyokeres eventually beat Nicholls in the final minute, but it proved too late for the Sky Blues who slip to 11th in the table. Martyn Waghorn was first to be denied by Championship goalkeeper of the season Nicholls in the eighth minute. After Sky Blues keeper Wilson kept Jordan Rhodes out, Dominic Hyam and Jamie Allen were both foiled by the excellent Nicholls before Toffolo broke the deadlock. Gustavo Hamer and Callum O'Hare had efforts saved by Nicholls early in the second half, while Anjorin played Danny Ward in for a big chance at the other end which Wilson was equal to. Anjorin took his chance to make it 2-0 from the spot, before Gyokeres salvaged a goal for the hard-working Sky Blues.

79,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198202,Middlesbrough 3-1 Stoke City: Matt Crooks' double helps Boro take their play-off chase down to the final day,"Middlesbrough kept their Championship play-off hopes alive with a comfortable victory over Stoke at the Riverside. The hosts needed a win to maintain their hopes of climbing back into the play-off places going into the final round of matches. Two goals in three first-half minutes, first from Matt Crooks and then a Lewis Baker own goal, set them on their way. Crooks poked home a second before Nick Powell's late consolation to leave Boro seventh and within two points of Sheffield United and Luton. Middlesbrough's chances of making the top six looked slim after a winless five-match run, but they came through must-win matches with Cardiff and Stoke to remain in the hunt. Luton would be out of reach if they beat top side Fulham in their game in hand on Monday, but Chris Wilder's men could still leapfrog Sheffield United on the final day. The hosts went ahead against the run of play when Crooks' deflected shot beat goalkeeper Josef Bursik. The Potters keeper was soon beaten again when Jonny Howson's free-kick was diverted past him by Stoke midfielder Lewis Baker, and Duncan Watmore was denied a third when his close-range finish was ruled out by an offside flag. The hosts remained on top after the break and wrapped up the win with 20 minutes left when Dael Fry headed Marcus Tavernier's corner back across goal and Crooks lunged to poke in his second. Stoke arrived in good form, with five wins in seven and bidding for a third straight away victory, but Powell's goal with virtually the last kick of the game was pure consolation as they drop to 13th. Middlesbrough boss Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Tees: ""The players put in an outstanding performance. The pressure was on yet again against talented players and a team that are in really good nick. I thought the play was really good. We were brave in possession and we defended fantastically well. I would have taken any sort of win so I'm delighted in the way that it came. ""We were dead and buried at half-time at Swansea last week and we've come storming back. A great second-half performance at Swansea and obviously two big, big results."" Stoke City assistant manager Dean Holden told BBC Radio Stoke: ""It was a disappointing afternoon for us after we've been so good in recent weeks. We didn't expect it, certainly not that first-half performance when we didn't really play with any edge. We created four big chances, but we were nowhere near as clinical as in recent weeks and certainly in the first half it was a tough watch. ""We had decent, controlled possession but without any real edge to it and then you concede the first goal and we gave ourselves a mountain to climb and it just wasn't anywhere near good enough.""

80,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198224,Millwall 3-0 Peterborough United: Lions keep slim play-off hopes alive,"Millwall kept their slim Championship play-off hopes alive as they beat relegated Peterborough 3-0 at the Den. After a drab first half George Saville almost opened the scoring early in the second period, but Posh keeper David Cornell pulled off a great close-range save. Millwall took the lead soon after as Benik Afobe lashed in a left-footed shot before hitting the post and bar in quick succession 10 minutes later. Josh Knight turned Jed Wallace's teasing cross into his own net as Millwall doubled their lead before Saville headed home another excellent Wallace cross two minutes later. The win - a third in a five-game unbeaten run - means Gary Rowett's side are three points off sixth-placed Sheffield United and one off seventh-placed Middlesbrough. But they need to overturn a five-goal deficit in goal difference and hope the Blades lose and Boro fail to win their final games to make the last play-off place, while Posh remain second-from-bottom. The first half had an end-of-season feel to it with no chances until Posh striker Jonson Clarke-Harris missed an excellent chance from close range five minutes before the break. Sammie Szmodics' weak effort into the arms of Millwall keeper Bartosz Bialkowski five minutes later was the first effort on target for either side. Saville's chance early in the second half kicked the game into life and Jack Marriott forced a smart save from Bialkowski soon after. Afobe's goal came after Posh failed to clear Ryan Leonard's long throw and the striker was able to readjust his feet before firing home. It should have been a bigger lead after Murray Wallace hit the bar with a half-volley and, from the resulting corner after a Peterborough clearance, Saville headed against the post. But the introduction of Jed Wallace from the bench proved to be the turning point as his crosses set up both Millwall's second and third goals to take their season to the final day. Millwall manager Gary Rowett told BBC Radio London: ""I thought it was a fabulous effort, I think the only disappointment is we had so many chances second half that we really could have scored five or six goals today. ""I think the players have done so well again at home, it's another good second half home performance. ""But to be in the position that we're in once again, it's not the first time we've been in this position to take care of our own side of the business and to take it to the last game of the season, albeit a really outside chance. ""I think the players have to deserve enormous credit and enormous complements."" Peterborough United manager Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""I'm not one to ever blame officials for a result. ""We've lost the game today because of us, but I will say the decision to give them the throw-in, which is a massive strength for them, has cost us the first goal today and swung the momentum. ""Up to that point we were comfortably the better team, I think everyone could see that. ""Yes, we were lacking the end product, yes, we lacked in the final third, they changed their shape in the second half, but we had them and then the throw-in's cost us.""

81,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198207,Nottingham Forest 5-1 Swansea City: Sam Surridge hat-trick downs Swans,"Sam Surridge's first career hat-trick helped Nottingham Forest keep up the pressure on Bournemouth as they thumped Swansea 5-1 at a raucous City Ground. Forest remain third in the Championship, three points behind the Cherries, who they play on Tuesday. They went ahead when Cyrus Christie scored an own goal, but Michael Obafemi levelled for Swansea before the break. Surridge then scored a 21-minute hat-trick for Forest and Alex Mighten wriggled clear to add a fifth. Bournemouth's 3-0 win at Blackburn kept their three-point cushion over Forest, who visit Vitality Stadium on Tuesday. Forest's goal difference is now one better than that of the Cherries. Forest were looking to build on their superb 1-0 midweek win at champions elect Fulham, with their fans no doubt wishing boss Steve Cooper had been in charge since the start of the campaign. Since the Welshman took charge in September, Forest who have won more points - 75 - than any other Championship team over the same period. Forest almost found the early goal they sought on four minutes, but ex-Swans striker Surridge saw his effort partially blocked by goalkeeper Andy Fisher, with defender Ryan Manning blocking on the line from Philip Zinckernagel's follow-up effort. Surridge, who made 23 appearances for Swansea in the 2019-20 campaign, was looking lively and he raced clear on 11 minutes, but he could not get his angles right as he looked to lob Fisher, who saved comfortably. The contest swung in Forest's favour on 22 minutes when Jack Colback took advantage of some lax Swansea defending and looked to have put the hosts ahead, only for Christie to attempt to scoop the ball from goal with his hands as he failed to clear. Referee Graham Scott initially awarded a penalty and a red card for Christie. But technology showed the ball had crossed the line, so an own goal and a yellow card were all Christie ultimately had to show for his goalkeeping effort. Forest's lead lasted only six minutes, as Obafemi finished brilliantly after controlling Matt Grimes' clever cross, though there was almost an instant riposte as Fisher brilliantly denied Joe Worrall's header from James Garner's corner. Fisher was in fine form and made two key saves on 43 minutes to deny Surridge by tipping his header - from another Garner corner - on to the post, before stopping Ryan Yates' close-range rebound. Surridge fired wide in first-half stoppage time - he might have had a hat-trick in the first half - as the hosts were left to wonder how they had not regained the lead. However, any sense of frustration for Forest dissipated within three minutes of the restart as Surridge finally found the net as he headed home from another pinpoint Garner set-piece. Swansea supporters sometimes questioned the style of football Cooper's side played during his two years as their manager, but the hosts continued to create chance after chance and Surridge curled home his second goal on 52 minutes following a rapid Forest counter-attack. The win was secured on 69 minutes as Joel Latibeaudiere deflected a cross on to the crossbar and Surridge was on hand to hammer home the rebound. The hosts added a fifth on 84 minutes as Mighten found far too much space and kept his composure to beat Fisher and set up Forest for their showdown with Bournemouth. Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Wales: ""I thought we were excellent today, the game plan came off perfectly. ""We were very happy for Swansea to have the ball, we wanted to control the game without the ball, which we did brilliantly. ""5-1 is obviously a great result, but to be honest it could have been more, it should have been 5-1 at half-time. ""We know Swansea have a lot of the ball, but also knew they also concede a hell of a lot of chances and a hell of a lot of goals."" Swansea City boss Russell Martin told BBC Radio Wales: ""In the first half I thought we were really good, we had a couple of scares, but mainly from set-pieces. ""We don't have height and the power that Nottingham Forest have. ""It was the same story on Tuesday night (against Bournemouth) and it is something we need to address in the summer, for sure… it's a sign of what we're lacking. ""Today's been embarrassing, the second 45 minutes. The supporters didn't deserve that, and the players and staff didn't deserve that for the way they've worked.""

Baggies substitute Callum Robinson broke quickly just 12 minutes from time for top scorer Karlan Grant to tuck away his 16th goal of the season. Albion's first away win in four matches sets Steve Bruce's side up for their final home game against relegated Barnsley next Saturday. But there is already speculation over the future of former England striker Andy Carroll, who was left out of the squad, is expected be left out next week too and is now considered very unlikely to stay at Albion next season. Bruce won his reunion meeting with former Manchester United team-mate Paul Ince. Reading were already safe from relegation thanks to a timely run of one just one defeat in seven games under Ince - but their season is far from over as their final game next Saturday is a crunch one at Championship play-off contenders Luton. With so little hanging on this game, it led to an inevitably poor contest, with few chances of note. Albion central defender Semi Ajayi headed against Orjan Nyland's left upright and Matt Phillips almost deceived Nyland with a curling, deep cross that looked like it might drop in before the Reading keeper tipped it over the bar. Home skipper Michael Morrison nodded narrowly wide for the hosts and Albion keeper David Button needed two attempts to gather a dipping corner from Junior Hoilett. But the Baggies finally broke through when, just six minutes after coming on, Robinson's quick counter and incisive pass set up Grant, who found the space to drill home the winner.

83,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198624,Southampton 1-2 Crystal Palace: Late Wilfried Zaha winner seals Eagles fightback,"Crystal Palace came from behind to win at Southampton and boost their hopes of a top-half finish in the Premier League. Oriol Romeu headed the hosts into an early lead on the south coast from a James Ward-Prowse corner. But Palace then dominated possession and equalised in the second half through Eberechi Eze's first goal of the season. Moments later they brought on top scorer Wilfried Zaha, who started on the bench in their only change to the side which drew 0-0 with Leeds last Monday. And the Ivory Coast forward created a chance out of nothing to fire in a stoppage-time winner and send Palace up to 12th in the table. With four games left to play the Eagles are two points behind 10th-placed Newcastle with a game in hand as they aim to secure their first top-half finish since 2014-15. Zaha's 13th goal in all competitions this season condemned Southampton to their sixth defeat in nine league games and saw them slip to 15th. Southampton are also hoping for a rare top-half finish - their first since 2016-17 - and took an early lead from an inswinging corner by Ward-Prowse, with Romeu shrugging off James McArthur to head in off the underside of the crossbar. But Palace then took charge, with Conor Gallagher sending an unmarked header wide from a Jeffrey Schlupp cross while Jean-Philippe Mateta was denied by Fraser Forster from Schlupp's cutback. The hosts were restricted to a long-range strike by Nathan Tella, saved low by Vicente Guaita, but Palace continued to press for an equaliser, with Jordan Ayew's header parried by Forster, who comfortably saved McArthur's header from the rebound. The Eagles remained on top after the break, as Forster pushed out Ayew's low cross as far as Schlupp, whose shot was blocked. Palace's more positive play was eventually rewarded as Ayew found Nathaniel Clyne on the overlap and the right-back chipped over a deep cross from the byeline for Eze to sweep the ball low past Forster. Zaha came on moments later and it did not look as though he would get a chance to win the game for Palace, until captain McArthur fed him just outside the box with his back to goal. The Eagles' talisman still had plenty to do as he held off defender Jan Bednarek while making the space to turn and shoot into the bottom corner, making it the first time this season that Palace have come from behind to win a Premier League game. After a run of one point from their past three league games, either side of their FA Cup semi-final defeat by Chelsea, the Eagles are now firmly back in contention to end Patrick Vieira's first season in charge in the top 10.

84,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198623,"Wolves 0-3 Brighton: Mac Allister, Trossard and Bissouma earn excellent away win","Wolves manager Bruno Lage says he wants players with the ""right personality"" at the club after seeing the ""worst performance"" of his tenure in their defeat to an impressive Brighton. The Portuguese manager, nearing the end of his first season with the club, saw his side register their only shot on target in the 85th minute of a sluggish display on home soil. Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister missed a penalty before finding the net nine minutes later with a second spot-kick, and excellent finishes from Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma after the break formed part of a superb display. ""I need to understand who wants to go to war and continue to put the club at a different level because it's not enough for anyone to relax,"" said Lage after Wolves' heaviest loss of the season. ""I need to smell it if the guys want to continue to put the club at a different level. We're in eighth position and we try to do better. To improve we need to have a plan and we need to convince the right players with the right personality to increase the level of the team. ""We didn't come to play. We came to watch Brighton play. It was the worst performance since the first day."" Graham Potter's Brighton showed pockets of their vibrant style throughout to create a flow of chances and they have now compiled a gritty run of form, losing just once in six outings - against Manchester City - and picking up 11 points in the process. They have now reached 44 points - their highest mark since reaching the Premier League in 2017 - and sit ninth, a place below Wolves who have now lost three in a row without scoring. There can be no greater example of Brighton's adventurous approach than the fact Marc Cucurella - the left centre-back in a back three - was powering forward to cross into the box in the build-up to Bissouma's late finish. Their freedom and ambition proved too much for Wolves, whose fans poured out of the ground in the closing stages. This was Brighton's biggest league win of the season and they started with intent, with Enock Mwepu twice forcing Wolves keeper Jose Sa into action before the penalty award. Referee Simon Hooper checked a Roman Saiss' handball in the box on the touchline monitor, only for Mac Allister to miss Brighton's third penalty in a row in 2022. But Willy Boly's trip on the ever-willing Danny Welbeck gave the Seagulls a second penalty and Mac Allister wrestled the ball off Trossard before whipping home from the spot. Cucurella was superb - seeing more of the ball than any player and completing 87% of his passes - while Welbeck created three chances for others in a selfless display and 20-year-old Moises Caicedo offered a blend of bite and composure in midfield. Trossard patiently crafted space to finish after being found by Welbeck for the second, while Bissouma - back from suspension - drove the third from range as Brighton continued to show ambition despite their lead. Potter's side had lost six in a row from February into March but this win further demonstrates that they have now rediscovered their very best form. Wolves' only significant threat saw substitute Pedro Neto strike the post in the final attack of the day but their fans were rightly frustrated with this latest setback in their bid to finish seventh and possibly qualify for Europe. The loss of Nelson Semedo to injury on the day was an added frustration, though the return to action of midfielder Ruben Neves after six weeks out with injury was at least a positive. Lage will surely look to add firepower next term as Raul Jimenez - who came on for the peripheral Fabio Silva at half-time - remains their top scorer on six goals this season. No side has a lower-scoring top scorer in the league. It is in some ways remarkable Wolves can be sat eighth having scored just 33 goals this term. Only Burnley, Watford and Norwich have fewer. The blunt nature of their attack showed here on a day they must quickly put behind them if they are to finish the season positively.

85,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198621,Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Visitors stay above title rivals Liverpool after comfortable win,"Manchester City produced the perfect response to Premier League title rivals Liverpool by outclassing Leeds United to regain top spot. City needed the win after Liverpool had overtaken them earlier in the day with victory at Newcastle - and they produced a highly impressive display in Elland Road's hothouse that also prolonged the relegation worries for Jesse Marsch's side. The reigning Premier League champions went ahead in the 13th minute when Rodri glanced home Phil Foden's free-kick and while Leeds were spirited, they barely tested visiting keeper Ederson until the game was lost. City doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break from another set-piece, Nathan Ake pouncing from close range when Foden's corner was headed down by Ruben Dias. Foden was City's brilliant orchestrator and he was involved again when he set up the third for Gabriel Jesus with 12 minutes left, before Fernadinho added the fourth with virtually the last kick of the game. The win means City are a point ahead of Liverpool, with four games left for both teams. It is now a case of who blinks first in the title race. Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game. For the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. Guardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain. The strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination. City were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second. The pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat. Foden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities. With their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu. Leeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop. Burnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton. Leeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone. Marsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish. Dallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss. Leeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality. They must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. Everton may have two games in hand, but have a tough run-in of their own - and Leeds have what might be five crucial extra points on the board.

86,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205838,West Ham United 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners reclaim Champions League place,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said it was the sign of a big team to be able to win ugly as the Gunners beat West Ham at London Stadium to reclaim fourth spot in the Premier League. The Gunners knew only a win would lift them back into the Champions League places after Tottenham beat Leicester earlier in the afternoon, but Mikel Arteta's side responded by grinding out an important three points. It was Arteta's centre-backs who came up with the goods, with Gabriel Magalhaes nodding the winner early in the second half after Rob Holding had opened the scoring from Bukayo Saka's 38th-minute corner. ""We didn't play so well,"" Arteta said. ""If I have to use a word it would be we won ugly. Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well."" Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have."" Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance. But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said. ""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations. ""We knew that was a risk and we got punished for it."" The Gunners are desperate to return to Europe's elite competition next season and Arteta's side have enjoyed the advantage of having no continental football this term, meaning all their resources can be focused on achieving a top-four finish for the first time since 2015-16. West Ham's only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League now is to win the Europa League - and Moyes' team would be forgiven for having one eye on overturning their 2-1 deficit in the semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. Arsenal struggled to get a foothold, though, before Eddie Nketiah's clever run and low shot forced a corner, from which Holding climbed highest to head in Saka's delivery for his first Premier League goal. Bowen's smart finish pulled the Hammers level on the brink of half-time. But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post. Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal. Injuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma. That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13. Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box. The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end. More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

87,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48766811,Women's World Cup: Norway 0-3 England – Lionesses into semi-finals,"England reached their second consecutive Women's World Cup semi-final as they produced an excellent performance to beat Norway in Le Havre. Lucy Bronze's brilliant second-half strike capped a fine night that saw the Lionesses become the first senior England team to reach the last four at three consecutive major tournaments. Two slick team moves had given them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead, as Jill Scott and Ellen White found the net from close range either side of White hitting the post. Nikita Parris saw a late penalty, awarded for Maria Thorisdottir's foul on England captain Steph Houghton, well saved by Ingrid Hjelmseth. But that did not dampen England's jubilant mood at full-time, as they celebrated with sheer joy after moving within one win of their first major final. White's tap-in took her goals tally to five for the tournament, putting her joint leader in the race for the Golden Boot alongside the United States' Alex Morgan and Australia's Sam Kerr. Backed by thousands of delighted travelling fans, the Lionesses will now face either France or the US in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Lyon. The hosts and the holders meet in their highly anticipated last-eight tie on Friday at 20:00 BST. England's well-deserved progression also boosted their hopes of representing Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics, with the three best-finishing European teams qualifying for next summer's Tokyo Games. England's three fine goals entertained the 21,111 fans who were at Le Havre's Stade Oceane near the English Channel, including delighted former men's internationals David Beckham and Ian Wright, who witnessed a memorable performance. The Lionesses, who reached the last four at the 2015 World Cup in Canada and 2017 European Championship, arrived in France with realistic ambitions of winning a first major title and they showed their true potential on Thursday. Wins over Scotland, Argentina and Japan saw England top Group D without finding their best form, while a victory over an unruly Cameroon side followed in the last 16. The quarter-final against Norway was without doubt the Lionesses' strongest display of the finals so far. Two excellent team moves down the right gave them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead, with Scott putting England in front in the third minute after Bronze's cut-back. Lively winger Parris then clipped wide from close range and a confident White fired on to the post as England created the best chances, before the Manchester City-bound striker tucked in from Parris' unselfish square ball. Backed by their buoyant fans' band, who danced in celebration long after the full-time whistle, England deservedly lapped up the applause before their journey continues to Lyon. Norway, who won the 1995 title, were playing in their sixth World Cup quarter-final, but were well beaten by a side ranked nine places above them. Martin Sjogren's team struggled to win the ball in midfield in the early stages and, when they did get in threatening positions in the first half, Barcelona forward Caroline Graham Hansen was repeatedly thwarted by England centre-back Millie Bright. Aiming to reach the last four for the first time since 2007, Norway did create good opportunities in the second period but were denied by some last-ditch defending. Houghton did well to clear substitute Lisa-Marie Utland's effort off the line, having earlier intervened to deny Graham Hansen a seemingly certain goal just after the break. Norway had not previously conceded a first-half goal in finishing second in Group A and eliminating Australia on penalties in the last 16. But they always faced a difficult task after Scott's early strike went in off the post and they could have lost by more if it was not for Parris' second missed penalty from three attempts at these finals. Norway have been without Women's Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg because she has refused to play for the national side since 2017, having taken a stand against what she describes as a lack of respect for female players in the country. There was a confidence about England's mannerisms as they found red-hot form as a heatwave gripped large parts of France, although a coastal breeze in the port city of Le Havre helped reduce the humidity. Arguably for the first time this summer, they sent a warning to their title rivals, two of whom meet in Paris on Friday. With the form of White - who became England's all-time leading scorer at the Women's World Cup with six goals - they will pose a major threat in the semi-finals. ""We'll have to raise our game against France or the USA but we know we can match up against either one of those teams,"" said Bronze. ""We can get a rest and watch the rest of the quarter-finals now."" England boss Phil Neville: ""That was the best they have played under me. Yesterday, I knew we were going to win this game because of the look in their eyes and the 11 that didn't play were driving it. ""This is where we want to be. We paid respect to Norway but we are the third best team in the world and we have confidence in our own ability. We heard how they were going to outrun us and we stuck to our plan and passed the ball and the ball never got tired."" Norway boss Martin Sjogren: ""We lost against a team that was better than us. We had belief that we could hurt England but at this stage of the tournament, all the teams are very good. ""I'm proud of how the players have represented Norway and how they've behaved. We would have loved to stay on, but England deserved to go through."" England and Lyon midfielder Izzy Christiansen on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Norway looked knackered and we were not. We were fresh and slick and the second goal in particular, Ellen White just puts it into the back of the net without thinking about it. ""That was a performance that had been stored up and it came out tonight."" Former England player Alex Scott on BBC One: ""Lucy Bronze announced herself at the last World Cup and she has to deal with people knowing her game. She showed why she is the best right-back in the world. ""She loves a challenge, tell her 'you are the best, now you have to be the best player in the world' and she rises to that. I knew Lucy would take my place in the team and I give her a huge pat on the back for that."" Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""That was the most convincing performance England have put out. Norway have been a dominant force in women's football forever, and to see them very much second best is very rare."" Formation  4-4-2 Formation  4-1-4-1 Match ends, Norway 0, England 3.

88,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60755067,Lille 1-2 Chelsea (1-4 agg): Blues move into Champions League quarter-finals,"Thomas Tuchel wants Chelsea to be the side everyone wants to avoid in the Champions League quarter-final draw after the holders beat Lille at a lively Stade Pierre-Mauroy to secure a 4-1 aggregate win. The Blues took a 2-0 first-leg lead to France but, in a match played amid continued uncertainty over the club's future, they had to come from behind after a slow start to earn success in the return. Burak Yilmaz pulled Lille back into the tie with a penalty after Jorginho handled, only for Christian Pulisic to reply in first-half injury time. Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta then put the last-16 encounter beyond the French champions when he finished at the back post with 19 minutes remaining. Tuchel's side will find out their last-eight opponents in Friday's draw. ""I want us to be the team nobody wants to play,"" said Tuchel. ""That's the role we see ourselves in this last round of eight. ""It's a big step to do it again and again - and that is why we fight for top-four places in maybe the toughest league in the world and we fight now again in the top eight teams [in Europe]. ""This brings out the very best in us."" It was something of a passive performance from the Blues as Lille harried and pressed with intent, though the Premier League outfit were able to maintain control and show their quality when needed. Developments regarding the club's ownership continued to play out during the game as it was announced Lord Coe has joined a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton to buy the club, while former Chelsea striker Gianluca Vialli said he is working with Nick Candy on his bid. Earlier the Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball team the Chicago Cubs, confirmed they are leading a group of investors which will make an offer by Friday's deadline. Whether those off-field matters were a distraction or not, it was Lille who got a deserved 38th-minute opener following a bright start in which they made life uncomfortable for Chelsea. Yilmaz placed his spot-kick in the top corner after Jorginho handled, with referee Davide Massa awarding the penalty after being told to view the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee. But to Chelsea's credit they responded quickly and Jorginho made amends with a neat pass into Pulisic, who finished from a tight angle to dampen Lille's renewed hope. Xeka did head against the post for the hosts in the second half, but when Azpilicueta guided Mason Mount's whipped ball in with his knee, the tie was over. Chelsea will now wait to see what happens off the field, with Uefa also saying on Wednesday it was seeking clarification from the European Union on future Champions League matches involving the Blues after sanctions were imposed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich. Abramovich, who is understood to have strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, has had his assets frozen by the UK government and Chelsea have had to obtain a special licence to continue operating. That has brought with it spending caps, though the club's players and staff were able to fly to Lille for the game because those arrangements were already made prior to the sanctions. Meanwhile, the Three logo was displayed on Chelsea's changed yellow strip during the fixture despite the company saying it has requested the club finds a solution to remove it. So while it may not have been a vintage performance, boss Tuchel will be pleased his side kept their focus and still have a chance to add to last season's Champions League triumph.

89,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,"Samuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. ""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. ""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy."" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""

In a Champions League epic, Mason Mount's wonderful finish and Antonio Rudiger's powerful header wiped out Real's 3-1 first-leg advantage and brought the quarter-final tie level in Spain's capital. Thomas Tuchel's side were outstanding throughout and Timo Werner's clever finish from an angle put them ahead for the first time on aggregate and within sight of a place in the semi-finals. But substitute Rodrygo - after a stunning pass by Luka Modric - forced extra time with a volleyed finish before Karim Benzema, a hat-trick hero in the first leg at Stamford Bridge six days earlier, headed the decisive goal in the 96th minute to send Real through 5-4 on aggregate. Benzema, who had earlier headed against the bar on a rollercoaster night, was unmarked when he scored to break Chelsea's hearts after Rudiger slipped inside the box. Even after what turned out to be the clincher, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho went close to forcing a penalty shootout. In the end Chelsea, who played superbly, were made to pay for their first-leg performance as Tuchel's side fell just short of producing one of the great comebacks in the competition. Many of Chelsea's players slumped to the ground at the end of 120 gripping minutes after pushing record 13-time winners Real - who will face Manchester City or Atletico Madrid in the last four - all the way. Tuchel had said on the eve of this game that Chelsea's progression into the semi-finals would be akin to the best Hollywood script. His players came close to producing a blockbuster in their first game at the Bernabeu in European competition as they showed incredible fight and belief - ingredients which were missing from their poor performance in the first leg. This breathless game had everything and more, including a Marcos Alonso goal at 2-0 ruled out by the video assistant referee for handball. While Tuchel will be delighted with the way his players responded, there will be concern at how much the energy-sapping 120 minutes has taken out of them. Chelsea do not have long to recover from going out of Europe as they prepare to make a second visit of the season to Wembley. They face Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST) - a competition that offers them their last chance of landing a major domestic trophy. Despite enjoying success in the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup, they lost a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in the Premier League with just eight matches left.

91,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61233604,Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp's Reds take control of Champions League semi,"Liverpool took a giant stride towards another Champions League final with a commanding victory over Villarreal at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing Reds had to demonstrate patience to break down a Villarreal side well organised by European specialist Unai Emery. Liverpool were held at bay despite creating all the chances and needed a touch of fortune to break the deadlock after 53 minutes when Jordan Henderson's cross was deflected beyond Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli by Pervis Estupinan. Sadio Mane increased Liverpool's control when he touched Mohamed Salah's pass beyond Rulli two minutes later. The second leg in Villarreal is still to come next Tuesday but Liverpool now look firmly on course to meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Paris in May. Liverpool just seem to be gathering unstoppable momentum as all challenges, even from a Villarreal side that claimed the scalps of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds, are overcome. Villarreal set out to take the sting out of the home team from the first whistle, taking an age over goal-kicks and other restarts, but unlike the frustration that overtook them at times against Everton at Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool remained composed, seemingly safe in their knowledge that their chance would come. And so it proved as they moved through the gears at the start of the second half, a change of tempo that proved too much for Villarreal, with Fabinho having a goal disallowed even before Henderson's attempted cross took that crucial touch off Estupinan. Klopp was able to remove the tireless Henderson and goalscorer Mane from the fray as Liverpool remained in control. Liverpool possess such threat that it is almost impossible for a team to simply sit out and hope to keep them away, such is the array of attacking riches now at Klopp's disposal. It is a collection of such power that he was able to keep Diogo Jota on the bench until that two-goal cushion was established, such has been the stunning impact of January signing Luis Diaz. Diaz gave an electrifying performance, with two first-half shots that were simply too powerful for Rulli to hold, while his change of pace troubled Villarreal all night. Klopp and Liverpool will take nothing for granted but such is their form and confidence, it is hard to see how even a side as durable as Villarreal can haul this back. Liverpool now turn their attentions back to the Premier League pursuit of Manchester City when they travel to in-form Newcastle United on Saturday (12:30 BST). The historic quadruple is still on and the celebrations at the final whistle here suggested the Kop believes that what most observers thought was impossible is now a genuine possibility. Emery's body language and impassioned gestures in the closing moments, enraged when Villarreal players conceded possession, suggested he thinks his side are still in this Champions League semi-final despite a two-goal deficit. He has every right to hold out hope with his stellar record in these two-leg formats, having won the Europa League four times with Sevilla and Villarreal and defied the odds to take 'the Yellow Submarine' into the last four of the Champions League. It will surely require something spectacular, even for this European expert, for Villarreal to disrupt a side of Liverpool's stature. Villarreal were drilled to the last detail in defence but they were not given any opportunity to launch the devastating counter-attacks that did such damage to Juventus and Bayern Munich. Emery can never be discounted but Villarreal did not show enough here to suggest they can stop Liverpool reaching their third Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp. Player of the match ManéSadio Mané 7.87 7.82 7.69 7.61 7.43 7.43 7.39 7.37 7.34 7.27 7.01 6.98 6.97 6.86 6.85 5.60 5.40 5.36 5.23 5.04 5.02 4.96 4.94 4.94 4.89 4.83 4.39 4.28 4.27 4.24 4.20 Formation  4-3-3 Formation  4-4-2 Match ends, Liverpool 2, Villarreal 0.

92,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

93,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198620,Aston Villa 2-0 Norwich City: Canaries relegated from Premier League,"Norwich were relegated from the Premier League with defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. The tame loss, coupled with Burnley's dramatic comeback win at Watford, left the Canaries bottom of the table and 13 points from safety with four games to play. Their fans continued to support as a relegation that has looked on the cards for some time was confirmed. Ollie Watkins put Villa ahead in the first half, capitalising on a slip from Brandon Williams before lashing high into the net. Williams' error summed up Norwich's season, as did their lack of potency in front of goal. They created limited openings, while Villa hit the woodwork in each half. Danny Ings added a late goal in stoppage time to add to Norwich's misery. Manager Dean Smith said ""plans are already in place"" for their bid to return to the top flight. ""I think over the past four to five weeks, there's probably been an inevitability about it,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed that we got relegated today because I thought our performance was good, but unfortunately over the season, the performances have not been good enough and we've lacked the quality required in this league. ""[The players] are very down, very dejected."" The low-key win for Villa ended a five-match winless run, lifted them to 13th in the table and took them to the 40-point mark. This is the third successive time Norwich have been immediately relegated following promotion to the Premier League. The afternoon was particularly painful for Smith, given that he left Villa earlier this season. In truth, Norwich's slide back to the second tier has looked likely throughout a season when they have rarely reached the standard required of a top-flight team. Again, they were spirited and had good spells in possession, but their lack of threat in front of goal was once again laid bare, a diving stop to deny Milot Rashica from distance the only serious save Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make. Norwich have the fewest shots (336), fewest shots on target (100) and lowest shot conversion rate (7%) of all Premier League sides this season. There were issues at the back too, with Villa's opener coming from a long, hopeful ball that was not cleared, even before Williams' slip. The full-back was also outmuscled by Watkins, whose finish was aided by a slight deflection. At full-time the Norwich fans applauded their side's effort and there was no outpouring of emotion. The club's joint majority shareholder Delia Smith watched from the stands and some may again question the hierarchy's resistance to spending big following promotion. But their prudency, and manager Smith's previous promotion with Villa, should leave Norwich well placed to bounce back once again. ""We will try everything to come up again,"" said Smith. ""It is a very difficult league to stay in. I spent £125m at Villa [after promotion in 2019] to keep us up. For Villa this was a much-needed boost. It all but ends any fears of an unlikely slip towards relegation themselves, their winless run having seen them drop from ninth to 15th.

94,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198625,Watford 1-2 Burnley: Two late goals lift Clarets five points clear of relegation zone,"Burnley scored twice in the final seven minutes to complete a dramatic comeback that pulled them five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone and left hosts Watford on the brink of the drop. Jack Cork's diving header from Charlie Taylor's left-wing cross cancelled out James Tarkowski's early own goal, before Josh Brownhill found the bottom corner from the edge of the box to spark jubilant scenes among the travelling fans and in the away dugout at Vicarage Road. Watford had taken a deserved early lead when Juraj Kucka's fierce effort struck the crossbar before rebounding off the unfortunate Tarkowski and into the unguarded net. The Hornets carried the greater threat in the first half, Kiko Femenia striking the near post from an inswinging corner and Joao Pedro blazing over the crossbar after escaping the Clarets defence. Aaron Lennon and Ashley Barnes forced fine saves out of Ben Foster in the second half, but there was little the veteran goalkeeper could do about either of the visitors' late goals, which came in the space of three minutes and stretched Mike Jackson's unbeaten start as Clarets caretaker manager to four matches. The Hornets' 11th consecutive home defeat leaves them 12 points adrift of Burnley and Leeds with only four games remaining. Before Saturday, the only side in the top four tiers of English football to have lost more than 10 consecutive home league games were Rochdale, who suffered 14 straight defeats in Division Three North between 1931 and 1932. It was all going so well for Watford, who were full of energy in the early stages and could have added to Tarkowski's own goal. Burnley's captain had to fling himself in the way of another Kucka strike minutes after putting into his own net, before the returning Pedro blazed over. The visitors thought they had won a penalty when Dwight McNeil's heels were clipped by Moussa Sissoko. However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall. Emmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten. Burnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger. The home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw. Foster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining. Brownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick. This is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets. The last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.

The Clarets, who have lost five of their last six top-flight games, are 18th and four points from safety. Dyche was the Premier League's longest serving manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012. Burnley chairman Alan Pace said it was ""an incredibly difficult decision"" to part company with the 50-year-old, but ""we feel a change is needed"". Dyche's last game in charge of Burnley saw them lose 2-0 to Norwich City, who are bottom of the Premier League. Assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have also left the club. ""Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,"" said Pace. ""During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. ""However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. ""Under-23s coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee have been asked to take charge of the team for Sunday's game with West Ham United. ""The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course."" Dyche had signed a new four-year contract until 2025 with Burnley in September last year. During his spell at the club he guided them to two promotions from the Championship and two top-half Premier League finishes. He also helped Burnley achieve their first European qualification in 51 years courtesy of leading them to a commendable seventh place in the Premier League in 2017-18. However, the Clarets have won just four Premier League games this season, the worst win record in the league. ""It's massive news, no one really expected it,"" reacted former Burnley midfielder Paul Weller. ""He has been backed by the board for so long, so to do it so late in the season is a really big surprise. ""To do it so late in the week is leaving it really tight because there's a massive game coming up against West Ham on Sunday. There's a big eight games left and we need somebody in there quick."" Weller added: ""Sean has had to take the ultimate punishment. ""What he has done at Burnley is unbelievable, he has done it on a shoestring [budget]. He's not been supported by any of the chairmen financially like other Premier League managers have been. ""It's been a really difficult season and I think that's why everybody is so surprised because the fans love him. ""Even though we are struggling, we are down at the bottom and it's looking like relegation, Burnley fans were still loyal to him."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Burnley are in their sixth successive season in the Premier League, which is their longest run in the top flight since their heydays in the 1960s. It is a brave owner of any football club who just accepts relegation without doing something to stop it. Alan Pace, the owner and chairman of Burnley, is a relatively new owner and he has decided to act. The impact has to be absolutely immediate and I guess that means Burnley picking up points immediately. They start against West Ham on Sunday, then Southampton and Wolves. Sean Dyche is highly employable. Any like-minded club such as Burnley, Dyche will be top of the people who will be to be favourites to take over that job. He has been linked with many Premier League jobs over the years. He has always responded to those rumours by saying he was at Burnley - now he is not. I don't think it will be long until he gets another job. Clearly the problem for Burnley is getting another manager for themselves. ",negative
96,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198622,Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Naby Keita scores as Reds keep up the pressure on Man City,"Liverpool kept themselves firmly in the fight for the quadruple as they overcame a spirited Newcastle to keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp made five changes at St James' Park, including leaving top scorer Mohamed Salah on the bench, after the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. It looked like it would backfire as in-form Newcastle started strongly, pressing Liverpool high and forcing them into a couple of early mistakes. But Liverpool grew into the game and were dominating possession when Naby Keita struck in the 19th minute. The midfielder showed great composure as he dribbled across the box and past Martin Dubravka before slotting into the net. Sadio Mane should have made it 2-0 before the break when his shot on the counter was too close to Dubravka, who also made a fine save from a Diogo Jota header. The Newcastle fans, who were aggrieved that play continued in the lead-up to Liverpool's goal because Fabian Schar was down injured, thought Miguel Almiron had equalised after rounding Alisson, only for the effort was ruled out for offside. The hosts also made a lively start to the second half, although Liverpool went closest to adding a second with Mane shooting wide from close range before Jota's shot was pushed over. It was not a vintage Liverpool display, but they got the job done and they are second, one point behind Manchester City, who won at Leeds later on Saturday to reclaim top spot after a brief spell in first place for the Reds. The Liverpool line-up may have intrigued City boss Pep Guardiola, who, while focused on his own side's pursuit of a treble, will no doubt welcome any helping hand in denting his rivals' title bid. Thiago - excellent in the 2-0 Champions League semi-final win against Villarreal in midweek - was on the bench alongside Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. It could have been seen as a big risk, but instead it emphasised the incredible strength in depth in this Liverpool squad. James Milner came in and was his dependable self, providing experience in midfield, while Joe Gomez was solid at right-back and the front three of Luis Diaz, Jota and Mane caused as many problems as any of the attacking combinations Liverpool could field. When Newcastle pressed for an equaliser in the closing stages, Liverpool were able to send on Thiago, Salah and Fabinho to see the game out. Against a side who had won their previous six home games, Liverpool fans had a right to feel apprehensive, but the Reds overcame a big hurdle that serves only to strengthen the feeling that they will end this season with multiple trophies. Only Liverpool and City boast a better record in 2022 than Newcastle and there was understandably a buoyant mood among the home fans before kick-off. The match provided Newcastle with an opportunity to show what sort of threat they pose to teams at the top end of the table - and they certainly gave a good account of themselves. They started superbly, getting at Liverpool from the outset and making their opponents nervous. Although Newcastle could not maintain their high-tempo start, there was still a sense of pride at St James' Park at the fight shown against one of the best sides in Europe.

97,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198304,Plymouth Argyle 0-5 Milton Keynes Dons: Scott Twine scores four to seal third for MK Dons,"Scott Twine equalled a club record four goals in a game to help Milton Keynes Dons finish third in League One - and end Plymouth Argyle's hopes of a play-off place - with a thumping 5-0 win at Home Park. Twine's superb free-kick gave Dons an early lead after an action-packed start to the game. He doubled the advantage as he blasted into the far corner and Harry Darling headed in a third shortly after, before Argyle had Jordan Houghton sent off for a second booking just before the break. Twine side-footed home David Kasumu's pull-back from the byeline for his third, and as 10-man Argyle tired he got his fourth from the edge of the box as his right-footed effort went in off the post. Despite the victory Milton Keynes finished a point outside of the automatic promotion spots after Wigan and Rotherham both won to secure first and second place respectively. Liam Manning's side will now face Wycombe in the play-offs after they leapfrogged Argyle into sixth place following a 1-1 draw at Burton Albion. The defeat for Argyle was so heavy that even a one-goal defeat at Burton for Wycombe would not have been enough to keep the Pilgrims in the play-off places. It was Argyle's fifth successive game without a win and saw them drop out of the play-offs for the first time since early March. Both sides should have taken the lead inside the opening 15 minutes as Twine crashed a free-kick off the crossbar, having had Cooper beaten, while at the other end Argyle striker Luke Jephcott twice put close-range efforts wide of the far post after low crosses from the left by Jordan Garrick and Ryan Law. But Twine did score from a set-piece moments later, with a superb curling effort into the top corner from a central position from 20 yards. James Wilson had Argyle's only meaningful first-half effort on target as his header from Steven Sessegnon's cross was parried away by Jamie Cumming soon after. But the game turned in a six-minute spell shortly before the break - first Jephcott missed another close-range chance and a minute later Troy Parrott broke the hosts' offside trap and forced a good save from Cooper. From the the resulting corner Twine picked the ball up on the left corner of the box, beat Wilson and blasted past Cooper for his second. Darling headed home a third three minutes later as the defender found himself unmarked from a corner six yards out. But the half got even worse for Steven Schumacher's side when Houghton was given a soft-looking second yellow card for tugging David Kasumu's shirt after protests from a number of MK Dons players. Twine missed a near-post effort 10 minutes after the break, but the summer signing from Swindon made no mistake soon after as he converted from seven yards before forcing a fine diving save from Cooper with a header 11 minutes later. He matched Will Grigg's record of four goals in a game for MK Dons when he got his 20th of the season, to put the gloss on an excellent display. ""We were ruthless, we kept a high line, we dominated the game and after the red card it sort of killed them really,"" Twine told Sky Sports after the game. ""I'm buzzing, most things went right today so I'm happy. ""Wycombe are a great team, but we'll focus on ourselves and if we play like we did today we'll be confident we'll win."" Liam Manning's side will now travel to Wycombe on Thursday, 5 May in the first leg of the play-offs before the return game three days later. The last time the club were promoted from this division Dele Alli scored 16 goals before a big-money move to Tottenham. But six years on from relegation in their first and only season in the Championship, Milton Keynes Dons are dreaming of a return to the EFL's elite. A run of 13 wins in 17 games between mid-January and the start of this month fired Manning's side into promotion contention. But a three-game winless run earlier this month seemed to have ended any hopes of automatic promotion before Wigan and Rotherham were both beaten on Tuesday. After 19th and 13th-placed finishes in League One in the past two seasons Dons fans will now hope they can progress in the play-offs and improve on that one season in the Championship under Karl Robinson, when they finished 23rd and won just nine matches. While a seventh-placed finish in just their second season back in the third tier is probably more than any Argyle fan would have hoped for at the start of the season, missing out on the play-offs will still hurt. The Pilgrims were top of the table in November and were eight points above seventh place at the start of this month. But a five-game winless run to end the season, including a defeat at Wycombe and draws with Sunderland and Wigan before Saturday's defeat by MK Dons, ended their hopes of the play-offs. However, in rookie manager Steven Schumacher they have a man who has, in the main, shored up the club's defence and led them to almost knocking Chelsea out of the FA Cup. If they can keep star players such as Ryan Hardie, Cooper and Panutche Camara over the summer, and keep building their squad, there is no reason why they cannot one better in 12 months' time.

98,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198300,Bolton Wanderers 4-2 Fleetwood Town: Fleetwood avoid relegation despite loss,"Fleetwood Town secured their League One status despite a 4-2 defeat at Bolton Wanderers, as rivals Gillingham also lost to be confined to relegation. The Cod Army started the day in 20th position, knowing their fate was in their own hands. The Gills sat a place below them, level on points but with an inferior goal difference, and Fleetwood had to match or better their result to ensure their own survival. Barry Baggley's early strike gave Fleetwood the lead, before Dion Charles and Declan John hit back for Bolton. Joe Garner equalised but Charles' second, followed by Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's injury time goal, left Fleetwood looking over their shoulders in the final minutes. However, Gillingham's inability to come away with points against Rotherham ensured Fleetwood stayed up. Fleetwood have endured a difficult season, in which they have never climbed any higher than 17th place, and consistently hovered in or around the drop zone. A torrid eight-match losing streak through the autumn saw manager Simon Grayson sacked in November, with former player and club under-23 coach Stephen Crainey appointed on an interim basis in his place. Things briefly improved with a decent spell before Christmas, in which Fleetwood took eight points from 18 - including wins over relegation rivals Doncaster and promotion hopefuls Rotherham - and Crainey was named head coach until the end of the season. Yet Fleetwood recorded only three victories in 2022 and ended the season on an eight-match winless run. They avoided a first relegation since the team was reformed in 1997 by the tiniest of margins. Fleetwood started with more intent as Callum Camps had a header saved by Bolton keeper James Stafford 10 minutes in. Baggley, 20, - one of four players aged under 23 included in the starting 11 - then impressively scored his first goal for the club, taking the ball around a defender on the edge of the box and striking it into the top corner. Bolton have closed the season on a good run, however, and came into the match with 13 wins out of their previous 21, and having not lost in seven matches. Charles ended a 12-match goal drought to score with Wanderers first real chance of the match shortly before half-time, and John made it 2-1 - cutting inside with a darting run and shooting the ball beyond Alex Cairns. Garner equalised with a scrappy effort from a corner 11 minutes from time yet Charles put Bolton back in front with a bizarre goal, winning the ball in a midfield tackle and watching the ball fly high down the pitch and loop into the net. Bodvarsson wrapped up the three points for Bolton with seconds on the clock, as they end the season in ninth place, while Fleetwood's loss will have felt like a win as they survive to remain in League One.

The Chairboys were sitting pretty in a top-six spot from early on with results elsewhere going their way, with closest rivals Plymouth losing at home to MK Dons meaning that just a point would suffice. Vokes' 16th goal of the season set the visitors on the way to three points and although Albion equalised through Gassan Ahadme, Obita's close-range finish capped things off for Wycombe. Vokes had already tested Matej Kovar at his near post from a low centre in the early stages but finally found the breakthrough two minutes before half-time. The big Welsh striker got up well to glance home Joe Jacobson's corner and further strengthen Wanderers' grip on a play-off spot. Gareth Ainsworth's side looked in control in the second half but they were pegged back on 72 minutes when substitute Ahadme scored from close range just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. Obita was then in the right place with five minutes to go, prodding home after substitute David Wheeler robbed Joe Powell inside his own box.

Bakinson opened the scoring when he rifled a 20-yard shot into the top corner of the Athletic goal and Burns extended the Ipswich lead with his 12th goal of the season.

A wonderful move thrilled most of the 26,002 fans in the stadium which ended with Sam Morsy side footing the ball wide.

103,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198303,Morecambe 0-1 Sunderland: Black Cats secure play-off place as Shrimps stay up,"Sunderland clinched a League One play-off place with victory at Morecambe, who also avoided relegation on the final day of the regular season. The Black Cats kicked off in fifth, knowing they would secure a place in the top six if they bettered or matched the result of either Plymouth or Wycombe. Nathan Broadhead claimed the 10th-minute winner, racing through one-on-one to finish calmly past Morecambe goalkeeper Trevor Carson. A seventh win in 10 matches was enough to keep Sunderland in fifth place and tee up a two-legged play-off semi-final with Sheffield Wednesday, who wrapped up fourth spot with victory over Portsmouth. Despite seeing their automatic promotion hopes fade in the final handful of matches, Sunderland will go into the play-offs in top form on a 13-match unbeaten run and with just one defeat in 15 since Alex Neil took charge in February. Morecambe started the day two points and two places above the relegation zone and needing to match or better the result of either Gillingham or Fleetwood to guarantee third-tier football next season. And despite a third defeat in five matches, the Shrimps secured the club's highest-ever league finish of 19th as both of their rivals slipped to defeat. Derek Adams' men started brighter, but offered little threat after Broadhead's 10th goal in 12 games, scored against the run of play. There was concern for Sunderland when their in-form striker Broadhead went off injured after 27 minutes. But Ross Stewart almost added a second on the hour when his deflected shot went inches past the post, while Carson then denied Patrick Roberts from close range.

104,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198349,Sheffield Wednesday 4-1 Portsmouth,"Sheffield Wednesday booked their place in the League One play-offs with a stylish 4-1 win over Portsmouth. A midweek victory at Fleetwood meant the Owls started the day fourth but still needing a win to guarantee a top-six finish. That looked unlikely when George Hirst, a former Wednesday player and the son of Hillsborough great David, tapped in from Ronan Curtis' cut-back in the fourth minute. Darren Moore's side responded with goals from Lee Gregory, Saido Berahino, Jordan Storey and George Byers to set up a two-legged semi-final against Sunderland. The hosts dominated after going behind and were good value for Gregory's 17th-minute equaliser from Marvin Johnson's cross. Gregory and Barry Bannan stung the palms of visiting goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu before Berahino put the hosts ahead in the 36th minute after Pompey failed to clear a corner. Storey converted a low cross from former Pompey loanee Byers five minutes before the break. Byers was denied after the break by Bazunu, and Portsmouth substitute Aiden O'Brien hit the post before Gregory's audacious lob narrowly cleared the crossbar. Sean Raggett had a header tipped onto the woodwork by Bailey Peacock-Farrell with 15 minutes remaining and the Northern Ireland keeper denied Hirst a second with a point-blank save before Byers nodded home a late corner.

105,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198355,Shrewsbury Town 0-3 Wigan Athletic: Latics promoted as League One champions,"Will Keane scored twice as Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the Championship and the League One title with a clinical victory over Shrewsbury. The Latics only had to draw to be sure of returning to the second tier, but needed three points to be certain of going up as champions. An anxious final day was in prospect having wasted two previous chances to seal promotion. However, Max Power's tap-in just before the break settled the nerves and Keane's penalty and calm finish wrapped up victory for a side who were just a point away from relegation last season. Wigan's return to the second tier of English football comes two years after they dropped out of the Championship following a points penalty for going into administration. Rotherham's win over Gillingham took the Millers up as runners up, while MK Dons had to settle for third spot and a play-off place despite a 5-0 thrashing of Plymouth Argyle, who missed out on the top six. Ultimately, other results did not matter for Latics boss Leam Richardson, whose side showed urgency and attacking intent from the off, with Kell Watts heading over after a well-worked short corner and Power's 30-yard free-kick forcing Shrews keeper Marko Marosi into a fine save. The pressure told when the ball fell kindly for Power to score the opener from close range two minutes before the interval and the same player was involved in the second goal when his shot from outside box was handled by a diving Tom Flanagan. Keane knocked in the spot-kick and grabbed his second of the afternoon when he got on the end of James McClean's free-kick. To understand what it means to win promotion back to the Championship, it is important to know what Wigan have been through in less than two years. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, few considered them at risk of imminent financial instability. In July 2020, however, they entered administration when their Hong Kong owners conceded they could not support them financially, throwing an already chaotic season into further disarray. With a 12-point deduction looming, the Latics had six games left to build a cushion on the relegation places to avoid the drop to League One. Under former boss Paul Cook they put up quite the fight, including beating Hull City 8-0 to equal the biggest victory in Championship history, losing just once in their final 15 games, but their spirited efforts were not enough. A failed appeal against the points deduction followed, as did a fan-led crowdfunding campaign to save the club - leading to more than £600,000 being raised. Cook - and many of the club's squad - left the Latics just before they tentatively began the 2020-21 League One season. In March 2021, Bahraini businessman Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi bought the club after an ill-fated deal with a Spanish consortium collapsed, ending nearly a year of financial uncertainty, and the club later avoided relegation to League Two by just a point. This season, under Richardson's stewardship, the club has reached the FA Cup fourth round - as well as the semi-final of the Papa John's Trophy - as the turnaround began. Just one defeat in their final 13 games saw Richardson claw them over the line to restore their place in English football's second tier. Bill Rice - Sports Editor, BBC Radio Manchester It's only just over a year since Wigan Athletic's future was secured with a takeover bringing the club out of administration, so to earn promotion back to the Championship as champions is a phenomenal achievement. The consortium led by Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi has delivered on their promises, providing boss Leam Richardson with the tools to build a promotion-winning squad, and he has done just that, even overcoming the loss of striker Charlie Wyke, who suffered a cardiac arrest in November that ended his season. Becoming a stable Championship club was the aim from day one and they are halfway there. This Wigan might not be as swashbuckling or pretty on the eye as sides of years gone by, but they are efficient, dangerous and manage games as well as anyone - and have performers right across the pitch to call upon when required. The goalkeeper and defence have been solid and stable, the midfield pairing of Tom Naylor and Max Power have won battles all season long, and - in forwards like Will Keane and Callum Lang - the Latics have match-winners when required.

106,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198302,Gillingham 0-2 Rotherham United: Millers seal promotion with win that relegates Gills,"Rotherham United sealed promotion to the Championship and consigned Gillingham to relegation to League Two with victory at the Priestfield Stadium. It is the fourth time in nine seasons that the Millers have been promoted to the Championship, having yo-yoed between League One and the second division. Rarmani Edmonds-Green's poked first-half finish and a late second from substitute Georgie Kelly, on his debut, in the tense and high-stakes final-day meeting was enough to once again send the Millers up. Ben Thompson hit the underside of the bar for Gillingham just before the break, but that is as close as they came from taking something from a game that ended their nine-season stay in League One. Edmonds-Green, who threatened early, put Paul Warne's Millers on track for promotion with his close-range finish on 34 minutes. Gillingham goalkeeper Aaron Chapman ensured Rotherham could not relax in pursuit of promotion in a game they had to win, brilliantly denying Ben Wiles from close range just before the hour. Wiles was again denied late on before Kelly, a January arrival from Bohemians, sealed victory with a clinical 89th-minute strike. Rotherham have once again been promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking. The Millers have now been promoted to or relegated from the second tier in each of the past six seasons, becoming the second club to bounce between two divisions for six consecutive seasons since Wimbledon did so, between the third and fourth tiers, between 1978 and 1984. Warne's side suffered heartbreak as they went down on the final day of the 2020-21 campaign despite drawing with Cardiff. They made an indifferent start to the season, with just three wins from their first seven league matches, but then embarked on a run that saw them go unbeaten in all competitions between 11 September and 26 December. A run of one league win in seven matches from the start of March, that included a first home defeat since September, saw them drop down to third behind Wigan and MK Dons. However, three wins from their final five matches proved to be enough to get them over the line. Promotion ultimately caps a fine season for the South Yorkshire side, who claimed silverware in April, amid their poor league form, when they won the Papa Johns Trophy at Wembley against League Two side Sutton. This is Warne's third promotion in his five-and-a-half-years in charge of the club and, prior to Saturday's game at Gillingham, he acknowledged that going up this season would top the previous two. ""I want the players to have that moment in time that will keep them connected forever. If we can go up automatically it will be the greatest achievement I have ever had, given the quality in this league,"" he told BBC Radio Sheffield. Attention will now turn to seeing if they can put together a squad capable of staying in the Championship, having failed to do so in each of their past three attempts. It's been a difficult season for Gillingham, who have been among the strugglers throughout the campaign, winning only three league games by the end of January. Boss Steve Evans had already been linked with the job at Stevenage before he left the Gills early in the new year following a run of 13 matches without a win in all competitions. He was replaced by former Millwall and Cardiff manager Neil Harris on 31 January and his arrival coincided with an upturn in form, with Gillingham winning five and drawing three of his first 12 games in charge to climb four points clear of the relegation zone. However, they were unable to maintain that momentum as they failed to win any of their final six games to drop into the fourth tier for the first time since 2013.

107,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198301,AFC Wimbledon 3-4 Accrington Stanley: Dons relegated after defeat,"AFC Wimbledon's relegation to League Two was confirmed after they lost a seven-goal thriller at home to mid-table Accrington Stanley. The Dons started the day in 22nd, three points behind 20th-placed Fleetwood with a goal difference seven worse than their relegation rivals - meaning a fair swing was required to overhaul them. First-half goals from Jay Rich-Baghuelou, Colby Bishop and Michael Nottingham ended any slim hopes of a miraculous final-day escape for the hosts, though they did restore some pride through efforts from Ayoub Assal and Jack Rudoni. Accrington made it 4-2 thanks to John O'Sullivan, with Rudoni's second not nearly enough to save Mark Bowen's side from the drop. It means Wimbledon end the season winless in 27 league games, the longest run by a side within a single season in England's top four tiers since Derby's run of 32 in the 2007-08 Premier League campaign. Though Fleetwood were beaten 4-2 at Bolton, the Dons would still have had to win by five goals to stay up. Victory for John Coleman's Accrington, meanwhile, saw them finish 12th and secure a top-half finish. It is the first time that Wimbledon have been relegated since they were formed by fans of Wimbledon FC in 2002. They have struggled to get out of the bottom six all season and also found goals hard to come by, having won just six of their 46 league games. Former Wales international Bowen was only appointed manager on 30 March, after the club parted company with Mark Robinson. He has been unable to steer them to a win in his seven games in charge, including a 3-1 defeat by already-relegated Crewe earlier in April. But a winless league run stretching back to early December has ultimately cost the Dons their League One status. Having been formed from the aftermath of Wimbledon's move to Milton Keynes in 2003, AFC Wimbledon won six promotions from the ninth-tier Combined Counties League up to League One in the space of just 14 years. The club also finally relocated to their former home in Merton in November 2020, as their redeveloped Plough Lane ground was completed. But after finishing 19th and 20th twice in the past three seasons, surviving by a combined seven points in that time, staying up has proved beyond them this season.

108,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198298,Oxford United 1-1 Doncaster Rovers: Gary McSheffrey's side relegation to League Two,"Doncaster Rovers' inevitable relegation to League Two was confirmed as they ended the season with a draw at Oxford United. Rovers were 23rd in the table coming into their final game, three points from safety but with a substantially worse goal difference than their relegation rivals - meaning they were already realistically down. Billy Bodin put the U's ahead with a rebound from close range, with the visitors levelling through Josh Martin midway through the second half. Gary McSheffrey's Doncaster end the season 22nd on 38 points - only once have they recorded fewer points in the third tier of a Football League season - in 1987-88 when they earned 33 points. Oxford, meanwhile, finish eighth in League One, having seen their play-off bid end in recent weeks. Doncaster started the season badly with four points from their first nine league games, including a 6-0 drubbing at Ipswich, leaving them rock-bottom in League One. That improved slightly to an overall 13 points from 19 league games in December but, with Rovers still six points from safety, the club sacked Richie Wellens as manager after only six months in charge. McSheffrey was promoted from leading Rovers' under-18s side and guided the first team to some spirited results, including wins at play-off chasing sides MK Dons and Sunderland, which kept them in contention to stay up. Doncaster at least lifted themselves off the bottom of the table - helped by Crewe's dreadful run of 15 defeats in 16 games - before they ultimately relegated the Alex by beating them three weeks before their own drop was ultimately sealed. Rovers, who last went down - also from League One - in 2016, beat Burton 2-0 last Saturday, giving them a small source of hope, but with just 10 league wins all season relegation was ultimately out of their hands. This season is the first since 2003-04 in which they have played without talismanic former midfielder James Coppinger following the 41-year-old's retirement in May 2021, after a club record of 695 games in all competitions.

109,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61075987,Fulham 3-0 Preston North End: Whites clinch Premier League return,"Fulham crushed Preston to seal their Premier League return as Aleksandar Mitrovic's double took his season's tally to 40 goals. The Serbian striker netted twice in the first half, sandwiching an eye-catching strike by teenager Fabio Carvalho. Mitrovic was denied a hat-trick by Preston goalkeeper Daniel Iversen - but it made no difference to the outcome as victory confirmed promotion for Marco Silva's side. Fulham could effectively secure the title as early as Saturday if they win at second-placed Bournemouth. The Cottagers might have fallen behind early on, with Marek Rodak called into action to thwart Ched Evans and then tip Ben Whiteman's long-range drive over the bar. But any hint of nerves swiftly evaporated in the ninth minute as Joe Bryan won possession and burst down the left flank to set up Mitrovic, who slid the ball through Iversen's legs. Carvalho and Harrison Reed went close to extending the lead as the home side seized control, repeatedly slicing through Preston's defence. It was Carvalho who did eventually grab Fulham's second in the 34th minute, rifling home on his left foot after Neeskens Kebano's cross had deflected perfectly into his path. Mitrovic made it 3-0 just before half-time, reaching the 40-goal mark after another incisive break along the left, with Harry Wilson providing the assist. North End nearly reduced the deficit early in the second half as Rodak produced another fingertip save to foil Cameron Archer, palming his attempt on to the woodwork. But there was to be no dramatic Preston comeback - nor a third goal for Mitrovic, who had two more attempts kept out by Iversen and was eventually substituted with a quarter of an hour remaining. Although Neco Williams' effort from distance whistled just over, Fulham had to be content with the three goals - and the win that wrapped up their third promotion in five years. The clinical Cottagers have shot through the Championship like a bolt of lightning and look set to smash a number of records as they win promotion back to the top tier with four games to spare. Marco Silva's swashbuckling brand of fast transitions and quick passing has seen them score 98 goals so far. They could still break Manchester City's Championship second-tier record, since the launch of the Premier League in 1992, of 108 goals. Silva's men also wrote themselves into the history books in January when they scored 19 goals in three games and were the first English side in 88 years to score six or more goals in three consecutive games. Serbian striker Mitrovic's 40 goals - already another Championship record - have helped propel Fulham out of sight at the top of the table and all eyes will be on him at the start of next season to see if he can finally recreate his scintillating Championship form against the country's top defences in the Premier League. The west London club have been something of a yo-yo club in the past few seasons, with consecutive promotions and relegations to and from the Premier League every season since their 2017-18 play-off final victory against Aston Villa. Emma Jones, BBC Radio London When Marco Silva became the new Fulham manager, he knew he was taking on the job of leading the team straight back to the Premier League. His first task was to rebuild a squad that had been heavily reliant on loans under Scott Parker in the top flight. But also to rebuild the confidence of players who will have felt they hadn't performed as they'd hoped, or hadn't been given the chance, during another relegation season. New signing Harry Wilson made an instant impact with a goal on the opening day. While a 5-1 win in Fulham's first away match at Huddersfield provided an early indication of just what the team might achieve. That big victory also included a first goal of many for Aleksandar Mitrovic and one from young star Fabio Carvalho, as he began to make headlines that are set to lead to a big move to Liverpool. Wilson looks to have been the best of the new additions, with Silva ultimately relying on the old guard to get the results. And while there will be plenty of praise for Mitrovic, Fulham are far from a one-man team with 'Captain America' Tim Ream one of many players who has had an excellent season. The questions though remain the same. What lessons have the club learnt from previous promotions to ensure they stay up this time? Are the players who have got them up good enough to keep them up? And will any new additions be the right fit for the challenge ahead? Fulham head coach Marco Silva: ""All season he (Mitrovic) has been exceptional. I have to manage his condition - you know how he can play with his energy when he is fresh. ""There was a lot of energy from the first minute. We had to get the job done tonight and we need to be proud of what we achieved. ""We delivered to the club and the fans who deserved this. I am proud of the players as this was the goal on the first day - automatic promotion. ""The season has been fantastic for the fans. Last season was really tough for all of them and we have done this for them."" Preston manager Ryan Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""Congratulations to Fulham. I thought we could have scored in the first five minutes and then maybe the game changes a little bit. ""But you can't give a team like Fulham the opportunities to score that we did - they'll punish you and we found ourselves 3-0 down. ""You only have to look at the star man who scores the goals and that is the difference - they've got that quality.

110,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062990,Reading 4-4 Swansea City: Incredible Royals comeback relegates Derby,"Reading produced an incredible comeback from 4-1 down to draw 4-4 with Swansea City and relegate Derby County. A frenetic start saw Lucas Joao put the hosts ahead with a contentious penalty, before Hannes Wolf fired home to level and Joel Piroe curled home beautifully. Piroe added his second with a penalty and Michael Obafemi grabbed a fourth goal as Swansea were cruising. Tom Ince's volley and a second for Joao made it 4-3, before Tom McIntyre scored deep into stoppage time. The thrilling draw in one of the most entertaining games of the campaign relegates Derby County after their defeat to Queens Park Rangers, as well as putting both Barnsley and Peterborough United on the brink of going down. Reading came into the contest looking to confirm their Championship status after the boost of their dramatic 2-1 win at promotion-chasing Sheffield United on Good Friday, which saw them remain in 21st but with a seven-point cushion above the bottom three. Royals boss Paul Ince made two changes from the side that earned that shock win at Bramall Lane, with Tom Dele-Bashiru and Junior Hoilett replacing Tom Holmes and Ovie Ejaria. Swansea boss Russell Martin made one change from the Swans' 1-1 draw with Barnsley, Flynn Downes replacing Jay Fulton and almost making an immediate impact on his return. However, Swans were a goal down before that, with Piroe adjudged - by the assistant referee who flagged instantly - to have fouled Josh Laurent, allowing Joao to score his ninth goal of the season from the spot. The visitors shrugged off that disappointment, with Downes' fine run and pass creating space for Wolf, who curled the ball into the top corner of the net expertly. If that goal was good, Swansea's second was even better as Piroe made amends for conceding a penalty as he curled home beautifully from outside the penalty area to score. Swansea enjoyed a good period of controlled possession after they went ahead - and Wolf might have scored his second but hit the side-netting. But Reading emerged more as the first half wore on and were unlucky not to level on 37 minutes when Hoilett's ambitious effort rattled the crossbar. Hoilett, however, was then involved in an incident in the other penalty box as he barged into Obafemi in stoppage time, with referee Kevin Friend pointing to the spot for the second time, allowing Piroe to score his 20th league goal of the season as he found the bottom corner. The third goal gave Reading a lot to do to rescue even a point, but Ince blazed over the bar just before the hour and moments later it was 4-1 as Piroe found Obafemi unmarked and he fired home, unchallenged. Reading responded quickly and scored a second on 62 minutes when Ince volleyed home after Hoilett's delightful cross, and a real grandstand finish was ensured when Joao scored his second from close range as Swansea failed to clear. The contest was increasingly end-to-end and Obafemi was within inches of making it 5-3 to Swansea, but he prodded wide after Wolf's cross, while Wolf shot over as Reading committed more and more players forward. Swansea sub Olivier Ntcham hit the post in added on time and that miss proved to be massive when McIntyre popped up in the fifth minute of stoppage time, smashing home an unlikely equaliser and prompting wild Reading celebrations. Swansea are 13th after the draw with their tiny play-off hopes now surely ended. Reading boss Paul Ince told BBC Radio Berkshire: ""It's hard to comprehend how we came back against a good Swansea side. ""We still had belief at half-time we could get back into it, even at 3-1 down. ""We got a good goal to make it 4-2 and you could see it gave everyone belief. ""When we got the third goal, it was game on. It was push, push, push. ""When we got to 4-3 I thought we would get one or two chances… the fans spurred us on and it was an amazing day for us, an unbelievable effort from the players and the fans."" Swansea City boss Russell Martin told BBC Radio Wales: ""I am disappointed in the mentality of the team for the first time in a long time, 4-1 up… our intensity dipped. ""The game turned into a game that suited them more than and we allowed that to happen. ""We allowed the game to become a stereotypical Championship game and we're not very good at that. ""The mentality wasn't right for the last half an hour and for the first hour it was brilliant. ""We have to learn from this.""

111,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062999,Middlesbrough 0-1 Huddersfield: Terriers boost Championship promotion hopes with win,"Huddersfield Town moved to within one point of the Championship's automatic promotion places as they dented Middlesbrough's play-off hopes at the Riverside stadium. Naby Sarr opened the scoring for the visitors just before half-time, nodding home Jordan Rhodes' header across goal following a Sorba Thomas wide free-kick. And Rhodes rounded off the win against his old club with a composed finished on the counter-attack on the hour mark having been played through by Lewis O'Brien. Middlesbrough came closest in the 88th minute when Riley McGree struck the underside of the crossbar, but were otherwise toothless in attack. Huddersfield's win saw them strengthen their third-place position, going just one point behind second-placed Bournemouth. However the Terriers' chances of going up automatically as part of the Championship's top two remain slim, having played three games more than the Cherries. Carlos Corberan's side are realistically fighting for a spot in the play-offs with their victory putting them 10 points clear of Middlesbrough in seventh having played two games more. They had the better of the opening exchanges, with Boro defender Sol Bamba forced into an error, nearly lobbing his own keeper Luke Daniels early in the first half. Once they went in front, Huddersfield dominated as Daniels did well to save a Josh Koroma shot when the forward was clean through in the 53rd minute. Middlesbrough struggled in attack throughout, managing only two shots on target. The loss saw the hosts' torrid recent Championship form continue. Boro have now failed to win any of their past four, losing three games in that stretch. A win would have seen them return to the top six. Instead they stay just outside the play-offs, two points behind Sheffield United in sixth having played one game fewer. Middlesbrough manager Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Tees: ""After 30 minutes we were in complete control of the game against a side who is also fighting to get out of this division as much as we are. ""I thought we were comfortably the better team we just didn't find that last little bit yet again. ""We had the majority of play and the majority of possession. It was a nearly performance."" Huddersfield head coach Carlos Corberan, speaking to BBC Radio Leeds: ""Our team worked really hard and really well. In defence we concentrated to stop them because we know how difficult it is to come here away. ""But I think the strong mentality from our players, from our keeper to our striker, was massive and they gave us a deserved win today. ""It's always important to grow as a team.

112,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062995,Barnsley 0-2 Peterborough United: Tykes on the brink of Championship relegation,"Peterborough United kept their slim Championship survival hopes alive with a narrow win at Barnsley to all but confirm the Tykes' relegation to League One. Jack Marriott opened the scoring for Posh at Oakwell, striking home Sammie Szmodics' pass in the 25th minute. And Frankie Kent rounded off the win for the visitors, nodding in a corner 15 minutes from time. With 21st-placed Reading drawing 4-4 with Swansea, Peterborough are seven points off safety with three games remaining. Barnsley stay rooted to the foot of the table and are 11 points off the Royals with four matches left to play. The Tykes will go down if they fail to beat Huddersfield Town on Friday. Posh will be relegated if Reading beat Hull City on Saturday or they lose to Nottingham Forest on the same day. Barnsley were the better side for much of the game with Domingos Quina hitting the crossbar early in the first half and Carlton Morris forcing a fine save from Peterborough keeper David Cornell with a looping header. But once Posh went in front through top-scorer Marriott they frustrated their opponents with Barnsley limited to half-chances in the second half. After Kent met Harrison Burrows' corner with a well-placed header to make it 2-0, Morris went close to halving the deficit but his shot was deflected over with Posh goalkeeper Cornell off his line. Despite both sides avoiding the drop for another week, relegation to the third tier still looks all but certain. Peterborough manager Grant McCann, speaking to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""It was a good result for us. I don't think it was the best of games to be honest, it was a scrappy, tense affair. ""But I'm really pleased with our lads, we dug in, stayed strong and were made to defend. And when we needed to be clinical we were. ""The boys have put an unbelievable shift in over the last nine games. I'm pleased with the reaction the players have given me. ""All we can do is focus on us. If we somehow stay up then great. If we don't we'll have a plan and try and put a squad together to try and win the league."" Barnsley head coach Poya Asbaghi, speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield: ""The performance was okay, in terms of creating chances and being the better team, we were. But in the end football is about the result. They were calm in front of goal and we weren't. ""We created enough chances to score two or three goals. We could have won anyway, even with them being efficient up front. ""We're all very disappointed, it's really quiet in the dressing room too.

113,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062994,Blackburn 0-1 Stoke: Jacob Brown goal dents Rovers' Championship play-off hopes,"Blackburn missed their chance to move into the Championship play-off spots with a 1-0 home defeat by Stoke City. Jacob Brown's fourth-minute strike proved enough for the Potters, who made it four wins in their last six games. The striker's calm finish past Thomas Kaminski gave Stoke a dream start and neither side was able to add any further goals. Blackburn have now won once in their last nine games and have dropped to eighth in the table - two points outside the top six - with three games remaining, while Stoke moved up to 14th in the table on 58 points. The away side made the dream start when Josh Maja's first-time pass set Brown through on the Blackburn goal, with the striker slotting past Kaminski to score his 13th goal of the season. Jack Bonham saved well from Ben Brereton Diaz at a tight angle before clawing away a looped header from Sam Gallagher. Gallagher's curled effort struck the crossbar as time ticked down for the hosts. Blackburn almost made their hard work pay deep into stoppage time with Bonham somehow keeping out substitute Ryan Hedges' point-blank header, with Brereton Diaz hitting the side-netting with the rebound. Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""[It was] a game of two halves. I felt first half we didn't get going, we lost an early goal. ""I think the atmosphere in the stadium sort of affected the confidence of some of the young players. ""We needed to change a few things at half-time and I thought we were much, much better [in the] second half. ""I thought we probably deserved to get something from the game and yet as has been in recent weeks, we don't seem to get the breaks."" Stoke City boss Michael O'Neill told BBC Radio Stoke: ""We played some brilliant football, scored a great goal and had some great chances. We should have put the game to bed with some of the chances we had on the counter attack. ""Our attitude to the game was excellent and it was a really good performance."" On Josh Maja and Jacob Brown: ""Josh is an easy player to play with. His awareness and ability to link the play - he works tirelessly for the team as well as Jacob does.

114,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062992,Blackpool 6-1 Birmingham: Tangerines stroll to easy win against poor Blues,"Birmingham City manager Lee Bowyer has described his side's humiliating 6-1 Championship defeat by Blackpool as his ""worst day in football"" and says he is prepared to ""move on"" if the club's owners want him to. Bowyer saw his struggling side taken apart by a Blackpool team who had not won in their previous five games as Jake Beesley marked his first start with two goals while CJ Hamilton scored one and made another. Beesley tucked home Hamilton's low cross after only three minutes as the Tangerines dominated the first half, with Blues the architects of their own downfall for a second successive game. Hamilton lashed in a second after Blues gave the ball away in midfield before Kenny Dougall made it 3-0 from a short corner, as the visitors' defence dozed. Beesley tapped in his second shortly after half-time as Birmingham failed to deal convincingly with a corner. Although Ivan Sunjic pulled a goal back, Jerry Yates' late penalty and Callum Connolly's 35-yarder completed Blackpool's saunter to a first win in six games to pile more pressure on beleaguered Bowyer. It was Blues' worst defeat since losing 6-1 at Hull in September 2017, in their last game under the caretaker management of Lee Carsley, between the departure of Harry Redknapp and the appointment of Steve Cotterill. ""That's the darkest day I've experienced in my whole football career. It was unacceptable from start to finish,"" Bowyer told BBC Radio WM. ""I never associated myself with quitting and failing in that way but I'm in charge and stand there in front of the players. ""That was my worst day in football."" Having thrown away a 2-0 lead to lose 4-2 to Coventry on Good Friday, Blues' defensive limitations were again ruthlessly exploited as the Tangerines raced into a two-goal lead inside the first quarter of an hour. First, Hamilton tormented Onel Hernandez down the Birmingham left before drilling his low cross to the edge of the six-yard area, where Beesley slid in ahead of Nico Gordon. Jordan Graham then carelessly poked the ball in-field from the touchline straight to Dougall. He fed Hamilton, who checked back inside his marker to fire past Zach Jeacock at his near post. That prompted Blues boss Bowyer into a formation change, with Hernandez deployed at the tip of a midfield diamond, and it was not long before it mustered their best chance when returning captain Troy Deeney - making his first start in three months after injury - had a header well saved by Chris Maxwell. The visitors' soft underbelly was again exposed shortly after - this time from a quick short corner routine - as Dougall reacted quicker than the Blues' static defence to nod in Charlie Kirk's cross. That triggered more torrents of boos from the travelling fans and an impromptu team huddle led by Deeney. Blues did start the second half slightly better, with Lyle Taylor forcing a smart stop from Maxwell, but it was not long before Beesley grabbed his second when Blues failed to properly clear a corner and Beesley finished off the rebound after Jeacock had parried Connolly's shot. With a simmering atmosphere in the away end threatening to boil over with chants of ""you're not fit to wear the shirt"", Birmingham belatedly got their act together when Deeney's lovely pass on halfway set Hernandez clear down the left, and his cutback was side-footed in by Sunjic. Beesley came close to his hat-trick but saw his header hit a post before Yates added a fifth from the spot, after Taylor had fouled Gary Madine, and Connolly smashed in a glorious free-kick from 35 yards. It completed a miserable Easter for Birmingham, who have conceded 10 goals in two games to slip to third defeat in a row, as their bleak season limps to a desperate end. ""There was no fight, no passion, no desire - I've never experienced as a player or manager your own fans singing what they were signing and they had every right to sing what they sung,"" Bowyer added. ""I'd be stupid to think that my job is as safe as I think it should be. We've conceded 10 goals in two games but this is the hand I'm dealt. ""Obviously people aren't going to be happy upstairs and they have every right to be - I don't disagree. ""I take full responsibility, so if the owners want to have a conversation with me and tell me to move on, then I'll move on.""

115,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062986,Cardiff City 0-1 Luton Town: Harry Cornick header seals Hatters win,"Luton Town moved closer to securing a Championship play-off place as Harry Cornick's high-class header gave them victory at Cardiff City. Substitute Cornick left Cardiff goalkeeper Dillon Phillips grasping at thin air as he expertly guided Robert Snodgrass' cross inside the far post. Nathan Jones' team stay fourth in the table but stretch the gap to seventh place to six points. Cardiff remain 17th after a third defeat in four matches. Bluebirds boss Steve Morison will rue missed chances from Jordan Hugill and Isaak Davies in what was a tight contest for long periods. But it was Luton who looked the more likely winners as the game wore on, with Cornick's moment of class clinching what may prove a pivotal victory. The only disappointment for Luton was potentially costly injuries to goalkeeper James Shea, James Bree and Fred Onyedinma. This was a meeting of two sides with contrasting ambitions, with Cardiff already glancing towards next season, while Luton focus on the possibility of achieving something extraordinary this spring. The Hatters have not played at the highest level in three decades, but have given themselves a genuine chance of ending their top-flight exile just eight years after they were a non-league club. It was hard to tell as much in a first half which was long on endeavour but short on quality at both ends of the pitch. Luton's only sights of goal came from set-pieces, with Dan Potts heading over in the first minute and Reece Burke drawing a comfortable save from Phillips. Cardiff threats were rare, although Joel Bagan's deep cross reached Rubin Colwill in space only for the Wales international to volley into the crowd. The home side did create the one clear opportunity of the first half, when Hugill went through one on one after a tight offside call went his way. But the on-loan Norwich striker was denied by a fine save from Shea, in what was his last significant contribution before he was forced off injured following a heavy collision with Tom Lockyer. The game opened up in the second period, with Snodgrass' 20-yard drive forcing Phillips to paw clear before Cornick's audacious effort from outside the area dipped narrowly over the bar. Cardiff responded on the counter, with Hugill's strong hold-up play allowing Tommy Doyle to square for Davies in the penalty area only for the substitute to lift his shot too high. It was Luton asking the more difficult questions as the contest wore on, with Cardiff fortunate to avoid an own goal when Peter Kioso's cross hit Perry Ng and was somehow kept out by Phillips. The breakthrough finally arrived 19 minutes from time, when Snodgrass' inviting delivery from the left was brilliantly guided home by Cornick. Luton protected their lead with relative comfort, substitute keeper Harry Isted gathering Davies' low shot as Jones' side made it back-to-back victories over the Easter weekend. Cardiff manager Steve Morison: ""I hate saying it because it just gets thrown back in your face, but we didn't deserve to lose the game. ""They were clinical in their one moment and we weren't. I thought we dominated the game from start to finish and we had all the chances. They got the goal, we didn't. It's really disappointing. ""We have to be better. It's difficult because you have one team fighting for the play-offs, one just trying to find our way in transition, trying to play a bit of a different style to what got us safe. ""It was nearly all good today apart from the goal. If we score, it might have knocked the stuffing out of them. They score and they have something to hold onto."" Luton manager Nathan Jones: ""The games are getting tough, not just because they are Championship games but because we are losing players. ""I have got 10 injuries - eight central midfield players out - we are patching everything up. ""We dug deep, we kept a clean sheet, defended our box and converted one of our chances. ""It's the best squad I have ever seen for togetherness. I can be vociferous and demanding but they work hard and are over-achieving. ""Our budget is bottom three. We wouldn't be top eight budget in League One, so to be fourth in the Championship and competing against some of the juggernauts is a wonderful story.""

116,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062991,Coventry City 0-3 Bournemouth: Dominic Solanke double helps Cherries win,"Dominic Solanke scored twice as a clinical Bournemouth beat play-off chasing Coventry to strengthen their grip on second place in the Championship. The Cherries had failed to win or score in their past three games but showed a ruthless edge to overcome their recent wobble and stay in prime position to claim automatic promotion to the Premier League. The visitors led when Jamal Lowe adjusted brilliantly to power in a header off the underside of the bar, from an Adam Smith cross which was slightly behind him, with Solanke making it 2-0 with a deflected shot which wrongfooted Sky Blues keeper Simon Moore. Bournemouth maintained a tactically-astute, counter-attacking style after the break and snatched a third thanks to a precise low finish from former Liverpool striker Solanke, his 27th league goal of the season. The result leaves Scott Parker's side four points ahead of third-placed Huddersfield, who have played two matches more and have only three games to play, while Nottingham Forest are seven points adrift of the Cherries after their win over West Brom. Coventry, meanwhile, remain three points from the final play-off spot before Sheffield United's trip to Bristol City but drop to 11th and are running out of matches to climb into the top six. It was a smash and grab first half for Bournemouth, who scored from all their three shots on target in the game, with Mark Travers saving well from Viktor Gyokeres and Callum O'Hare to keep the dominant home side out. Bournemouth pragmatically switched to five at the back after the break and took the wind out of Sky Blues' sails with the third goal, and once-capped England man Solanke missed the chance to seal a hat-trick late on as he shot over when through on goal. Martyn Waghorn went closest for Coventry after the break, his half-volley excellently stopped by Travers, but it is now just one win in six home games for Mark Robins' side. Coventry manager Mark Robins: ""We started off brightly and created chances that we didn't take. They stuck their first chance in and then stuck their second chance in and it was game over. ""When you're playing against top teams, you have to take your chances when they are presented to you. If you don't and they take their first two, then it changes their mentality and belief systems. ""The supporters aren't as anxious either and, with players like they have, if you give them a sniff, they grow in confidence and we have no divine right to win football matches because we've created more chances. ""They were in the Premier League a couple of seasons ago and look like they will be going back there."" Bournemouth boss Scott Parker: ""The first half was very difficult and we had to weather the storm against a very good side, but we were clinical in our moments because, when the chances came our way, we buried them. ""We knew what they are about and what we were up against - they've put seven goals past Fulham over the course of two games and beat Sheffield United 4-1 recently and the game didn't look like we would have liked in the first half in terms of asserting ourselves against them. ""But, sometimes, when you're in that arena, it can be like that and, when it is, it's not about being tactical or technical, it's about digging in and getting to half-time to regroup. ""Even during that first half we defended set-plays well but, at half-time, we fixed a few things to help the players and we have kept three clean sheets in a row and this was one against a team who are renowned for scoring late goals.""

117,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062989,Millwall 2-1 Hull City: Lions close in on play-offs with victory at the Den,"Millwall moved to within a point of a Championship play-off place with a 2-1 win against Hull City at the Den. Quick-fire goals from Scott Malone and Tom Bradshaw near the start of the second half gave the Lions just their second win in six games and keeps their promotion dream alive. The home side came out all guns blazing after an uneventful first half and took the lead through a bizarre deflection, with Malone's block from outside the area going all the way in past Nathan Baxter in the Hull net. Bradshaw scored his ninth goal of the season before Tom Eaves' late reply set up a tense finish to the match, but the home side held on to within a point of six-placed Sheffield United - who drew at Bristol City. A Benik Afobe volley was well saved by Baxter early in the second half, while the score was goalless. Hull then hit the post from a goalmouth scramble but were behind before they knew it, as Murray Wallace drove forward for the hosts. His cross-field pass found Malone, whose first touch was closed down and the clearance deflected off Malone and went all the way in from the edge of the area. The hosts doubled their lead within four minutes when Afobe headed a long ball forward into the path of his strike partner Tom Bradshaw, who calmly slotted home as Millwall took control of the game. Tyler Burey hit the crossbar as the hosts looked to make the points safe. Hull had threatened from corners and halved the deficit with three minutes left, Eaves latching on to Keane Lewis-Potter's mishit shot and slotting into the bottom corner. The defeat leaves Hull 19th in the table, with 47 points. Millwall boss Gary Rowett told BBC Radio London: ""Hull don't open a lot of space up so we wanted to go forward and be a little bit more direct in the early stages of the game. We were too predictable. ""At half-time we settled down a bit. In the second half there was a bit more zip about us. ""A massive slice of luck [for the first goal] obviously helps. It was most welcome because we haven't been a particularly lucky team this season."" On injuries: ""Jed [Wallace, who missed the game through injury] will have a scan tomorrow, it's hard to tell [how serious the injury is]. ""If a scan shows anything I think that's more or less going to rule him out for a few games. ""Scotty [Malone, who went off injured] I think has done his hamstring."" Hull City boss Shota Arveladze told BBC Radio Humberside: ""[It was a] different first half and second half. ""A little bit I think we lost in the physical and that cost us the game. ""I cannot blame the boys, they're giving every little bit [on the pitch]."" Formation  3-4-2-1 Formation  3-4-2-1 Match ends, Millwall 2, Hull City 1. Second Half ends, Millwall 2, Hull City 1.

118,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062993,QPR 1-0 Derby County: Rams relegated to League One,"Derby County have been relegated from the Championship after suffering a dramatic late defeat at Queens Park Rangers. Luke Amos' 88th-minute winner for QPR, coupled with Reading's remarkable 4-4 draw against Swansea, consigned Wayne Rooney's beleaguered Rams to the drop to League One. Relegation with three games to go means Derby will play in England's third tier for the first time since 1986. Their fight for survival, in a campaign crippled by a 21-point deduction, could only have been prolonged if they equalled or bettered Reading's result. When Amos coolly slipped the ball past goalkeeper Ryan Allsop, their hopes of staying up had taken a major blow but were not over. However, Tom McIntyre's 95th-minute leveller for Reading left the Rams 10 points behind the 21st-placed Royals with three games remaining. Even then, Tom Lawrence was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Charlie Austin to compound Derby's misery. QPR ended a six-match winless run to move up to 10th in the table and to within two points of the top six, although sixth-placed Sheffield United could increase that gap if they beat Bristol City later on Monday. In a nervy first half of the high-stakes game in west London, Amos had an early goal ruled out for offside while Luke Plange skimmed Derby's best chance off the top off the crossbar with a header. A crucial block from Derby full-back Nathan Byrne to foil Lyndon Dykes after the half-hour mark summed up the steadfast determination Rooney's Rams have played with throughout a fraught campaign. If not for the 21-point deduction this season, for entering administration and breaching the EFL's financial regulations, Derby would be 17th in the table and almost as close to the play-off places as the relegation spots. Allsop made two crucial second-half saves, denying Ilias Chair and Dykes, but Amos finished a quick counter attack with two minutes left to break Derby's resistance and ultimately shatter what hopes they had of avoiding the drop. Derby's spirited attempt to stay in the Championship is over, but the protracted efforts to sell the club are ongoing. US businessman Chris Kirchner was confirmed as the preferred bidder to buy the club earlier this month, but while the sale continues it means Derby remain in administration - having been placed there by former owner Mel Morris 208 days ago. With just five players contracted for next season and the Rams under a transfer embargo, rebuilding the East Midlands club in League One will present significant challenges for whoever is involved. Rooney's future with the Rams is also uncertain, with the 36-year-old linked with the vacant job at Premier League side Burnley. Earlier this season he rejected an approach from boyhood club Everton to speak to them about taking charge at Goodison Park. Analysis - Ed Dawes, BBC Radio Derby's Derby County commentator The effort, energy, creativity, fighting for the cause, camaraderie. It's all been there in recent months. Those relationships have meant this team have taken it to game 43 with a 21-point deduction and that has to be commended. The amount of players that have been introduced and brought through, that's a good starting block for next season. If they can get one or two senior players to sign new contracts and play for Wayne Rooney next season, even in League One, then Derby have a fighting chance. Minus 15 points is a very strong possibility next season, but that's from the off and not in late September. Derby fans should be very proud of their team and I'm sure they are.

119,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062987,Bristol City 1-1 Sheffield United: Blades fight back to take point,"Play-off-chasing Sheffield United battled back to claim a point in an exciting encounter at Bristol City. The away side had much the better of it in the first half but it was the home side who took the lead against the run of play after the break when Chris Martin slotted in from Antoine Semenyo's low centre. Morgan Gibbs-White levelled for United with an acrobatic volley after Dan Bentley had parried Enda Stevens' initial shot. Both teams pushed on in search of a winning goal but a draw was ultimately a fair result as the injury-hit Blades stayed sixth. Paul Heckingbottom's men are one point ahead of seventh-placed Millwall, having played the same amount of games. He will have felt his side should have gone in ahead at the break, with Gibbs-White forcing a smart save from Dan Bentley in the home goal and Iliman Ndiaye blazing over when he should have scored after being played in on goal. Bentley was then instrumental in the home side's goal. After saving from Jack Robinson's header, he launched the ball down the pitch for Semenyo, who beat indecisive Chris Basham out wide before sliding the ball across the face of goal for the onrushing Martin to put it away. Semenyo missed a chance to make it 2-0 when his fierce shot from Andreas Weimann's pass flew over the crossbar from the edge of the area. Gibbs-White, who has been forced into an unfamiliar striker role with the Blades missing the injured Billy Sharp and Oli McBurnie, equalised with a brilliant finish from 10 yards but it was the home side who then had the better opportunities to win it. Substitute Nahki Wells dragged a shot wide from 18 yards when he should have slid Weimann in on goal as the Blades ultimately settled for a point.

120,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61063056,Nottingham Forest 4-0 West Bromwich Albion: Steve Cooper's Reds win to delay Fulham promotion,"Nottingham Forest further consolidated their place in the Championship play-offs as they beat West Bromwich Albion to make leaders Fulham wait for confirmation of their promotion. Steve Cooper's men had the game won before the break with three fortune-laced goals - Brennan Johnson's penalty, for a handball which also triggered a red card for Albion defender Darnell Furlong, Ryan Yates' header and an outrageous strike from Jack Colback. Sam Surridge added a late fourth on a night when Albion's own slim promotion hopes surely came to an end. With just three games left, 12th-placed Albion trail sixth-placed Sheffield United by six points - and have five other clubs better placed ahead of them in pursuit of what looks like one remaining play-off place. Forest, who still have five games left, including a trip to second-placed Bournemouth in early May, are looking upwards, knowing that they still have a chance of automatic promotion despite their Friday slip-up at Luton. Their eighth win in nine home league games since the turn of the year also means that Fulham cannot confirm their promotion to the Premier League until Tuesday, when victory over Ryan Lowe's Preston would take them back up. After an Easter weekend which began badly at Kenilworth Road, then worsened with reports that on-loan Aston Villa striker Keinan Davis might be ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury, Forest could be forgiven for thinking their luck was right out. At Luton they lost to a debatable penalty, had a perfectly legitimate second-half equaliser chalked off and hit the woodwork. But they more than made up for it as the ball began bouncing their way in a one-sided first half at a bouncing City Ground. The game first hinged on Forest's opener from the penalty spot. Furlong, booked just three minutes earlier for a daft, needless late challenge on Philip Zinckernagel, was lying prone on the ground when James Garner's shot hit his arm. But referee David Webb decided that it was deliberate handball, sent off Furlong and awarded Forest a penalty. Johnson struck it powerfully low into the left corner, beating Baggies keeper David Button's despairing dive. And, just four minutes later, Forest had a second goal when the officials unquestionably made a mistake. They awarded a throw-in the wrong way, and Albion's defence, caught badly wrongfooted, were panicked into conceding the corner from which Yates headed home - from Garner's right-wing flag-kick - to double the home lead. Then came Colback's wonder strike on the stroke of half-time. The ball bounced up to the wing-back on the left side of the pitch and he launched a wicked, dipping volley over David Button from 25 yards. With the game won and Albion's spirited 10 men left running on fumes, Forest could have won by more but they could manage just a very late fourth. January deadline day signing Surridge ran onto a neat through ball to power his shot over Button for his fourth goal for the club - to match last month's 4-0 win over Reading as Forest's best of the season. It was also Albion's heaviest league defeat of the season - and their worst at second-tier level since losing by the same scoreline at Leeds in March 2019. Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper: ""To win a game 4-0, you have to do a lot of things well. We took real control. We forced them into a situation where they were down to 10 men. We forced the 1-0, the 2-0 and got the third. ""Jack Colback was excellent, man of the match. He is not a character who generally craves extra praise. He is a bit of a throwback on that front. I'm not going to argue with him if he said he meant it. ""It is one of the best goals we have seen at the City Ground this season, even if we have seen a few good ones. The fourth goal was good as well. I don't know how many passes there were involved. ""The thing that mattered most was our attitude and approach. We felt really hard done by on Friday when a lot of the decisions and things did not go our way."" West Bromwich Albion boss Steve Bruce told BBC Radio WM: ""It was an awful night that went against us. Is it a penalty? It's debatable. Is it a red card? That was ludicrous. ""Then we got that linesman's decision go against us, and the fourth official gets in the ref's ear. And, within 20 minutes, we've got a red card, a penalty and another decision and the game's over. ""Forest are the form team in the division and you can understand why. It was always going to be difficult for us. ""But, while you know you need to put in a performance, you also need the officials to do their job. I  don't usually complain as I know they have a difficult enough task as it is but you need them to be better and, unfortunately, they were awful.""

121,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61115597,Huddersfield Town 2-1 Barnsley: Defeat consigns Tykes to relegation to League One,"Barnsley were relegated to League One following defeat by promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town, who themselves sealed a Championship play-off spot. Jordan Rhodes headed in from close range after a Huddersfield corner was deflected into his path to give the hosts an early lead. Harry Toffolo was then found completely unmarked to tap in with a cool finish to double their advantage just before the break. In a subdued second half, Barnsley found a late consolation through Callum Styles' impressive strike from the edge of the box but it was too late as their fate was confirmed. The Tykes, who stay bottom, are 11 points behind 21st-placed Reading with three games left this season. Barnsley's three-season stay in English football's second tier comes to an end, while Huddersfield move to within a point of second-placed Bournemouth. However, the Cherries have three games in hand on the Terriers and are still heavy favourites to claim the second automatic promotion place. Huddersfield had lost just two of their past 23 Championship games while Barnsley arrived at the John Smith's Stadium having not won since 15 March and having won just eight points on their travels this term. Barnsley needed a victory to keep up their slim hopes of Championship survival but Rhodes made that task even harder when he put the hosts ahead inside four minutes. The former Scotland striker had to wait for confirmation that the goal would stand after a late flag went up for offside from the assistant referee. But it was eventually given after it was judged the ball had deflected off a Barnsley defender as they tried to defend the corner, leading to Rhodes' simple header. But it was Toffolo's goal just before half-time that epitomised Barnsley's position, as the visitors failed to pick his run into the box, leaving him to latch onto Danel Sinani's cross to fire low past Tykes keeper Jack Walton. Styles' late strike was a bitter-sweet consolation for the visitors, who rarely threatened during an abject 90 minutes where Huddersfield controlled much of the match. Relegation after a season of struggle ends an eventful three-year stay in the second tier for the club who have played more games at this level than anyone else. They scored a last-minute winner at Brentford in the final game of the Covid-hit 2019-20 season to miraculously avoid relegation and send Charlton down instead. Gerhard Struber, who had taken over midway through that campaign after the sacking of Daniel Stendel, left soon into 2020-21 for MLS side New York Red Bulls and was replaced by Valerien Ismael. The former Bayern Munich man oversaw a remarkable turn around of the team's fortunes and improbably guided them to a fifth place finish. They fell to defeat by Swansea in the play-offs and Ismael, along with influential captain Alex Mowatt, both left for West Brom. His replacement Markus Schopp won only one of his 13 games in charge, a victory over Coventry in their first home game, and departed in November after a run of seven straight losses. Sweden Under-21 coach Poya Asbaghi took over but failed to win any of his first 11 league matches at the helm, leaving relegation looking inevitable before finally ending his wait with a home victory against QPR. Surprisingly, that kick-started an upturn in fortunes as they won three times in February to give fans hope of staying up, with January loan signings Domingos Quina and Amine Bassi scoring crucial goals. They could not keep the run going though and conceded late equalisers in home games against Stoke and Fulham in the space of four days in March, at a time when victory in both would have seen them climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since 2 October. Still, they retained some hope up until Easter Monday's limp 2-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Peterborough in a game where they had more shots and more possession but failed to score against a team who had failed to keep a clean sheet away from home all season.

122,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124791,Bournemouth 1-1 Fulham - Dominic Solanke equalises from spot in added time for Cherries,"Dominic Solanke's 98th-minute penalty snatched a point for Bournemouth in a 1-1 draw against Championship leaders Fulham. Aleksandar Mitrovic's 41st league goal of the season, awarded via goalline technology, looked to have all but sealed the title for the Cottagers. But the Cherries won a penalty deep into added time as Harry Wilson was penalised for a foul on Adam Smith, with Fulham boss Marco Silva sent off for his protests against the decision. Solanke stepped up to slot the ball home for his 27th league goal of the season and keep the title race alive for another week. A stop-start first half went by largely without incident and the spark came soon after the restart when Wilson, who had been Fulham's best player, crossed for Mitrovic to out climb Nat Philips and divert his header goalward. Mark Travers looked to have made a smart save on the line but referee Graham Scott's watch alerted him to blow the whistle as the ball had just crossed the line. Tosin Adarabioyo headed against the bar as the Cottagers looked to double their lead, Wilson again playing the ball in before Tim Ream nodded the ball down for his centre-back partner to hit the woodwork. Bournemouth upped the intensity as they went in search of an equaliser but Fulham thought they had done enough to close out the game and essentially win the title. But a late, late Wilson challenge on Smith was deemed a foul as the referee pointed to the spot. Silva was dismissed for his remonstrations and Solanke scored in the eighth minute of time added on to delay Fulham's title celebrations. The visitors can secure the trophy with a win against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, while eight points from the Cherries' four remaining games will guarantee that Scott Parker's side will join Fulham in the Premier League next season. Bournemouth boss Scott Parker: ""They scored a goal which looks a little bit dubious. It doesn't look like the whole ball has crossed the line so I think that's a little bit harsh. ""Maybe technology was faulty or the camera was not lined up properly, I don't know. ""It was well-deserved point for sure. It was a match between two very good sides. ""In the second half I felt we took them to certain depths and really nullified their opportunities. ""In the end I thought physical prowess and endeavour got us the penalty. ""I didn't see why Marco got sent off. It was edgy at times, it was a bit nitty gritty and I don't think anyone would have wanted it any different."" Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC Radio London: ""It's tough for us, for me it's a mistake from the referee [to award the penalty], that's made a big impact on the game. ""It wasn't a great game to watch, both teams didn't perform to their best in my opinion. ""I saw just one picture [of Mitrovic's goal] and I saw the ball over the line.""

123,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124786,Luton Town 1-1 Blackpool: Visitors fight back to deny play-off chasers victory,"Luton missed the chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place in the Championship with a 1-1 draw against Blackpool. Elijah Adebayo gave the hosts the lead inside two minutes before Gary Madine equalised from the penalty spot in the second half at Kenilworth Road. Luton were denied a penalty when Keshi Anderson cleaned out Robert Snodgrass in the area, before Blackpool had a second shout waved away for Kal Naismith's challenge on substitute Josh Bowler. Luton had the ball in the net in added time but Adebayo was adjudged to have fouled Richard Keogh before squaring for Admiral Muskwe to tap home. Adebayo got the Hatters off to a flying start inside two minutes when he received the ball down the right before cutting in and sending a left-foot shot into the net via a big deflection off Blackpool defender Keogh. The Seasiders did not shrink following that early blow and could have been level after 10 minutes when Luton's defence failed to deal with a long Callum Connolly throw into the box, but Madine sliced his effort wide. Keeper Chris Maxwell needed strong hands to keep out a powerful Harry Cornick strike, before Cornick missed a glorious chance to double the lead, heading over from Robert Snodgrass' tantalising whipped cross into the box. Blackpool were level 10 minutes into the second half after Dan Potts brought down CJ Hamilton for a penalty that Madine drilled into the bottom-left corner. Muskwe was sent on for the injured Sonny Bradley and the striker was involved straight away, forcing a smart save from Maxwell. Anderson brought down Snodgrass in the aftermath for what looked like a clear penalty but referee John Brooks waved play on. Blackpool were then calling for a second penalty when Naismith appeared to bring down Bowler in the box but Brooks was again unmoved. Luton thought they were in for the winner as Adebayo powered through Keogh, but the whistle blew for a foul with Keogh going down after the shoulder-to-shoulder tussle, before Muskwe finished. Adebayo left the field injured in added time as the game finished 1-1, with Luton needing four points from their last two games to guarantee a play-off spot. Luton boss Nathan Jones told PA Media: ""We're very, very hard done by not to have got three points. ""We didn't play well today, we weren't ourselves but we did enough to win the game. ""We had some glorious chances - Harry Cornick had two in the first half, Cameron Jerome's had one, Admiral Muskwe's had one, Allan Campbell's had a chance, we had a penalty shout and that's a clear goal, no issue whatsoever. ""Suddenly we don't get that and we end up drawing the game. ""Blackpool were front-footed today, caused us a few problems. Harry [Isted] hasn't had many saves to make, but they're playing with freedom, four up top - it's easy to do that when you're 16th and haven't really got anything to play for and were really at it.""

124,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124787,Birmingham City 2-2 Millwall: Benik Afobe's late penalty grabs a vital point for Millwall,"Benik Afobe scored a 96th-minute penalty to earn Millwall a crucial point at Birmingham City in their push for the play-offs. Juninho Bacuna put the Blues ahead two minutes into the second half with a low strike, but Oliver Burke found the Lions a crucial equaliser. Lyle Taylor reinstated Birmingham's lead with 11 minutes to go from the penalty spot after he was brought down, but there was late drama after Jake Cooper was also fouled inside the box with seconds left on the clock, and Afobe stepped up to draw Millwall level. Millwall remain in seventh, three points behind Sheffield United, who occupy the final play-off spot, with two games remaining. Birmingham came into the match stuck in 20th place on the run of three straight defeats and having conceded 12 goals - including a humiliating 6-1 thrashing to Blackpool. Manager Lee Bowyer had called for his players to 'step up' for the fixture with Millwall and he saw an almost instant reaction when Gary Gardner's free-kick hit the post after only three minutes. Millwall grew into the game, however, and Murray Wallace forced a good save out of Neil Etheridge before Ivan Sunjic superbly prevented Shaun Hutchinson from scoring with a block on the line. Bacuna then rattled a second shot against the woodwork for Birmingham just before the break, after being set up by Onel Hernandez. Hernandez picked up where he left off in the second half, teeing up Bacuna to slot into the net. Millwall needed to get something out of the match to keep up their hopes of getting into the top six and when Mason Bennett whipped a cross into the box and Danny McNamara headed it back across goal, Burke was on hand to draw them level. Taylor had appeared to give Birmingham all three points when he scored from the spot with only 11 minutes to go, but there was late drama when Gary Rowett's side were awarded their own penalty deep in stoppage time and Afobe tucked it away. Birmingham City head coach Lee Bowyer told BBC Radio WM: ""I have to praise the players for the effort that they just put in. The fighting spirit. That's what we are and when we come off it shows a lot. ""To have the result we did last time out and then to put in that performance shows a lot from the players so, I have to say, I'm pleased that we got that reaction. ""Most of all I'm pleased for the fans because the last thing I wanted to do was come and play against a Millwall side and they could have easily run over the top of us, but every player stood up man for man and was counted today. ""We should have won the game for sure. I think Bacuna's chance in the first half hits the bar, he's a very technically gifted player and I would expect him to finish that. But he took his goal well and got us going. ""In the end, another decision - a bad decision - goes against us and then we end up only getting a point but we deserved all three for sure."" Millwall manager Gary Rowett said: ""We threw everything we had at it. We made too many mistakes in the game and didn't do the basics well enough at this stage of the season to pass the ball and open the game up. ""What we have got is fabulous desire and character. We ended up with Oliver Burke at right wing-back, Tyler Burey at left wing-back and Jake Cooper up front on his own. Maybe, just because of that, we deserved something out of the game. 'We've got to win those games and if we win those games, what you've seen is teams faltering all around the top 10 - teams with far better squads than ours. But we're still in there because we've got character."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  3-4-2-1 Match ends, Birmingham City 2, Millwall 2. Second Half ends, Birmingham City 2, Millwall 2.

125,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124788,Derby County 1-3 Bristol City: City eased past already-relegated Rams,"Andreas Weimann scored his 20th goal of the season as Bristol City beat relegated Derby 2-1 at Pride Park. The Austrian found the net against his old club after only 10 minutes, coolly striking the ball past Ryan Allsopp in the Rams' goal in a one-on-one . Antoine Semenyo doubled the Robins' advantage before half-time, but Craig Forsyth headed a goal back for Derby on the hour mark. Defender Timm Klose then wrapped up the win for Bristol City with a header from a set piece, to confine Derby to only a fourth home defeat this season. Derby's fate was finally sealed on Easter Monday after they were beaten by Queens Park Rangers and relegated to League One next season. Wayne Rooney made six changes to his side for the visit of City - a team also confined to the bottom half of the table and similarly looking ahead to the summer and a restart. Weimann has been a significant bright spot, however, for the Robins and has been enjoying his most prolific campaign to date. He didn't take long to move his tally of goals for the season to 20, after being set up by Chris Martin, beating the offside trap before slotting past the on-rushing Allsopp. Semenyo then made it 2-0, after stealing the ball from Richard Stearman and running into the box to slot into the far corner. Bartosz Cybulski was among the changes Rooney made but the teenager missed a sitter for Derby on his debut right before time, heading the ball over the bar from close range. Forsyth pulled one back for the hosts with a unmarked header from a Malcolm Ebiowei cross. But it was Derby's only real chance in front of goal and they recorded only two shots on target all match. Klose eased Bristol City's nerves for the final 10 minutes with his first goal for the club as they go unbeaten in four games and moved up a place to 17th. Derby first-team development coach Justin Walker: ""It was a good exercise for us in terms of providing players with the opportunity today. ""Disappointing first half, I thought the goals we gave away were cheap, we were disappointed as a group and at half-time had a bit of a chat about the rhythm and intensity and self belief. ""I thought second half we started to push a little bit and got ourselves back in the game. That's what we were looking at today, the character and temperament of some of the players to handle the environment. ""There's an objective to what we want out of these last three games and we've got a tough job to do over the coming weeks to prepare ourselves properly for next season."" Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson told BBC Radio Bristol: ""I'm pleased with the result, We made hard work of it in the second half because we created so many chances but couldn't put them away. ""We just wanted to come away with a positive result today and the players in the first half were excellent. We should've made the game easier for ourselves but it was still a really good team performance. ""For somebody [Weimann] who's at the more senior end of his career to get a career-best return is testament to his professionalism and his desire and attitude - he's a top-class pro.""

126,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124794,Hull City 3-0 Reading: Royals' Championship survival confirmed despite defeat,"Reading's Championship survival was confirmed despite defeat at Hull as Peterborough lost at home to Nottingham Forest. Two goals from Keane Lewis-Potter and one from Alfie Jones secured a 3-0 victory for the Tigers. The Royals went into the game knowing three points would ensure they played Championship football next season. But Posh's 1-0 home defeat ensures no team can better Reading's 41 points in 21st place, with Peterborough joining Derby County and Barnsley in relegation to League One. Hull took the lead through the impressive academy graduate Lewis-Potter, whose unstoppable shot rifled into the roof of the net after he darted into the box from the left. The home side doubled their lead soon after the restart when George Honeyman, who assisted the first goal, swung the ball into the Reading box for Jones to poke home for his first goal for Hull. The away side almost pulled one back when Lucas Joao forced Nathan Baxter into action, with Tom Ince's follow-up deflecting over the bar. But Lewis-Potter would have the last word, racing clear one-on-one with Orjan Nyland to beat, firing home hard and low into the net. Hull's third win in four games lifts them to 18th in the table on 50 points, while Reading have to win both their remaining games to have any chance of finishing higher than 21st. Hull boss Shota Arveladze told BBC Radio Humberside: ""It's great to win in front of our supporters, having three goals, the best score from the season. ""I think everything we did well and we should be happy for this day. ""They had to change [after conceding] and we reacted. They put more offensive players on and gave more space in the back. We catch this space and then Keano [Lewis-Potter] scores."" On a new contract for Lewis-Potter: ""Not yet [we haven't offered him one]. Of course we will have to, but then it's up to him."" Reading boss Paul Ince told PA Media: ""It's a big one for me - especially the time I've been out [of management]. ""There were a few eyebrows raised when I came to Reading. Getting what I've got out of the players, I'm proud of that. ""I didn't think we'd be able to turn it around that quickly. From day one, the atmosphere has been great.

127,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124793,Peterborough United 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Sam Surridge's winner confirms relegation for Posh,"Peterborough were relegated from the Championship as Nottingham Forest kept alive their automatic promotion hopes with victory at the Weston Homes Stadium. Posh needed a win and Reading to drop points to maintain their slim chance of escaping the drop, but Sam Surridge's goal sent them back to League One. Brennan Johnson's fine cross to the back post picked out Surridge whose header back across goal found the far corner just before the break. A seventh win in eight games leaves Forest fourth and cuts the gap to second-placed Bournemouth to five points with four games left after the Cherries' draw with Fulham. Peterborough's defeat means all three relegation places have been confirmed with two games of the season left, with Barnsley having their fate sealed on Friday, and Derby dropping into League One on Monday. Forest, meanwhile, need just one more point to guarantee their play-off berth, but Steve Cooper's side still harbour even bigger ambitions despite Bournemouth's last-gasp penalty equaliser. Posh went close early on when Ricky-Jade Jones made space and forced Forest goalkeeper Brice Samba into a fine one-handed save, and the home fans had further hope when relegation rivals Reading fell behind. But it proved short-lived as Forest - who lacked spark in the first half - went ahead with only their second attempt thanks to Surridge's fifth goal of the season courtesy of more impressive play from Johnson. The hosts stepped up their urgency in the second half, but struggled to break down the visitors' defence, Harrison Burrows going closest with a strike which forced Samba to save at his near post. Yet it was Forest who went closest to the game's second goal late on, second-half substitute Lewis Grabban seeing a strike ruled out for offside before firing a first-time shot wide from close range. A difficult season has seen Posh struggle to replicate the form that saw them win automatic promotion from League One a year ago, conceding 84 goals - only Reading have leaked more in the Championship. With a run of 15 league games without a win between December and March, the club at one point looked resigned to its fate before showing fight which included wins over Barnsley, Blackburn and QPR. McCann - who himself finished above Peterborough in winning the league with Hull - was reappointed at London Road two months ago after former boss Darren Ferguson resigned and left the club for a third time. It represented something of a merry-go-round for the club and the Northern Irishman - who played for the club between 2010 and 2015 and previously managed them before being sacked in 2018 after no wins in seven matches. To rub salt into the wound, McCann lost to Hull in his opening match, weeks after the Tigers sacked him following their takeover by a Turkish consortium. Injuries to key players including strikers Jack Marriott have depleted their squad, while Jonson Clarke-Harris has scored 11 league goals compared to the 31 that won him last season's League One golden boot. Francis Green, former Peterborough striker and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire co-commentator A lot of people will say recruitment will be probably the main reason Posh have gone down. If you do get that wrong, ultimately it's going to cost you in the long run. Most will probably look at this as an opportunity missed because it took eight seasons to get back in the Championship and all of a sudden now, with some of the clubs that may be in League One next season - the likes of Derby, Sunderland, Ipswich - it's going to be very hard to get out. It obviously took until February for a managerial switch, with Grant McCann replacing Darren Ferguson, but still as a squad I don't think they'd have been good enough to stay in the Championship even if they made a change a little bit earlier. It's going to be a big, big challenge next season. When Posh did get promoted last season there was no-one in the grounds - you're not going to get a season like that again - it was a one-off type of season. These players are obviously capable of challenging for promotion next season, there's no doubt, and if they implement a way that McCann wants to play - and add a few players - then they've got a good opportunity, but they need to get it right from pre-season. Peterborough United boss Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""Today I couldn't fault the effort and attitude of the players. They have gone toe-to-toe with probably the best team in the league at the minute and were probably the better team over the first half. ""It's a disappointing day. I told the players you have got to feel this pain and use it to your advantage because the comeback's always stronger than the failure. ""I'm proud of everyone since I've come in. The help and support I've had from everyone at the football club has been great and I know that's going to continue for the remainder of the season and next season. ""We would love to get to the stage, hopefully under my tenure, where we are a sustainable Championship club and we're pushing, but one step at a time. We have to make sure we get out of the league (League One) next year."" Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""There's work to do (to reach the play-offs). I haven't looked at it (the table) if I'm honest - I don't even know what the other results are. ""We'll just stick to our plans. It's a busy period, four games left, so concentrate on our work, recover well and get down to Fulham and try and be in the best shape possible. ""Once we got the lead it was always going to be about managing it a little bit. Truth be told we should have probably got a second and third goal, particularly a second because they were always going to throw more players at the top end of the pitch. ""Credit to Peterborough, they really put up a good fight today. They've got a lot of good young players. It's easy to say now, on a day like today, but I have a lot of respect for Grant and he knows that."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  3-4-1-2 Match ends, Peterborough United 0, Nottingham Forest 1.

128,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124789,Sheffield United 1-0 Cardiff City: Iliman Ndiaye header keeps Blades play-off hopes alive,"Iliman Ndiaye's second-half header secured all three points for play-off chasing Sheffield United against Cardiff City at Bramall Lane. The Bluebirds had the best chance of the first half, when Max Watters' tame effort was saved by Wes Foderingham despite being clean through on goal. Just two minutes after the restart, Morgan Gibbs-White found space down the left and crossed for an unmarked Ndiaye to head home from six yards. Sander Berge had the chance to seal the win deep in added time, but his right-foot curling effort crashed back off the post. The Blades stay in sixth place with victory, but extend their advantage over the chasing pack to four points. Cardiff slip two places to 19th, but are already assured of Championship football next season; Peterborough joining Barnsley and Derby in League One next season after defeat to Nottingham Forest. The visitors started strongly and Sheffield's back three looked shaky whenever the Bluebirds advanced. Oliver Denham's long ball up to Jordan Hugill was smartly played first time to Watters, who beat the final defender only to fire a weak left-footed shot straight at Foderingham. The Blades keeper almost gifted Cardiff the opener minutes later, his miss-kicked clearance hitting Watters on the edge of the 18-yard box but the Bluebirds striker could not control the ball. Sheffield's first sight of goal came after 14 minutes, as Ben Osborn's low volley skipped off the surface but was well saved by Dillon Phillips in the Cardiff goal. Berge's run from deep caught the Bluebirds defence sleeping as the hosts took control of the game, but Phillips was equal to the effort once more. Berge had Sheffield's best chance of the first half, his neat spin freed him into the Cardiff box with Cody Drameh being treated for an injury, but once more Phillips was on hand to tip the effort around the post. The Blades opened the scoring early in the second half when Perry Ng and substitute Mark McGuinness lost Ndiaye and allowed him to drift into space and power a header home. That goal spurred on the hosts and lifted the home crowd, which had been quieter than usual during the first half as play-off nerves played their part. Sheffield continued to run rings around the Bluebirds but despite their dominance they struggled to find any clear-cut openings. A Will Vaulks long throw almost gave Cardiff an equaliser against the run of play, as Joel Bagan launched himself onto the end of it, but Foderingham stood tall to deny him. Sheffield brought on the Championship's all-time leading goal scorer Billy Sharp as they searched for a second, and moments after coming on the veteran striker thought he had won a penalty, but referee Oliver Langford waved away appeals. Cardiff improved in the final quarter of the match, Rubin Colwill's introduction making an impact, but the Bluebirds failed to carve out a clear opportunity to draw level. The Blades almost made the points safe two minutes into added time when Berge was sent free by Sharp, his effort beat Phillips but the post came to Cardiff's rescue. It did not matter though, as Sheffield held on to secure a crucial three points and keep play-off aspirations in their own hands. Cardiff City manager Steve Morison told BBC Sport Wales: ""I thought we were excellent, it was tough for us against a very good team. ""We started well and should have taken one of our chances, we didn't, and I'm gutted with the goal but it's shows how far we've come.

129,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124785,Stoke City 1-0 Queens Park Rangers: Jacob Brown goal secures Potters win,"Jacob Brown's strike lifted Stoke into the top half of the table and effectively killed off Queens Park Rangers' faint play-off hopes. Brown fired home in first-half injury time, which proved enough to clinch a deserved victory for Michael O'Neill's side. Rangers - who needed a win to maintain any realistic chance of scrambling into the top six - created little other than a George Thomas header that hit the post. The Potters climb to 12th place, just two places and as many points behind QPR. Stoke, who went into the game with four victories in their previous six, looked the more likely to open the scoring as Lewis Baker and Tommy Smith went close. Rangers goalkeeper Keiren Westwood did well to deny Romaine Sawyers with a 20-yard effort that took a deflection, the rebound looping up for Brown who could only head over. But the Stoke striker was on target in first-half injury time as Westwood foiled Ben Wilmot from a corner, only for Brown to rifle the loose ball into the net. The Potters might have extended their advantage soon after the restart, with Westwood clawing a Taylor Harwood-Bellis header over the bar and also keeping out Josh Maja's attempt. Rangers rang the changes in a bid to salvage their season, bringing on strikers Charlie Austin and Andre Gray, but they rarely looked like staging a turnaround. Thomas came closest to levelling the contest 20 minutes from time when he headed Ilias Chair's cross against the woodwork. Stoke assistant manager Dean Holden told BBC Radio Stoke: ""It's a pleasing win because we got on the front foot early in the game. We were banging the door down when we scored and I think it's the least we deserved to go in 1-0 at half-time. ""Then you've got to try and replicate that in the second half against a team who are dangerous because they're going to throw everything at the game - it was win or bust for them. ""They took a lot more possession of the ball but I think we controlled the second half without having as much possession. I don't think they got anywhere near our goal apart from once. ""It was important we got a 90-minute performance - that's what we asked for and that's what we saw."" QPR manager Mark Warburton told BBC London 94.9: ""We gave away an awful goal. We were awful in the first half, we lacked any pace, purpose or intensity. ""We didn't move the ball quickly enough or test the goalkeeper, we had no crosses in - we looked like a team doing everything not to win the game as opposed to a team that had to win the game. ""The second half was better but we still had two or three more gears to go, which is the most frustrating of all. A bit of quality in the final third can change everything. ""They know how they can perform - it's about that consistency of performance. The teams that have success in the Championship are the ones that have a consistent level of performance.""

130,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124790,Swansea City 1-1 Middlesbrough: Boro's play-off hopes hit by Swans draw,"Middlesbrough's Championship play-off hopes suffered another setback as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Swansea City. Riley McGree ended Boro's four-game goal drought with a deflected drive at the start of the second half. But Swansea trailed for just two minutes as Michael Obafemi produced his latest cool finish. Middlesbrough are five points off the play-offs having failed to win in five games. The draw sees them climb a place to eighth, but victories are needed if they are to force their way into the top six. They might have claimed all three points here had Aaron Connolly's late effort not come back off the post - the third time the woodwork rattled in a thrilling second half. Swansea drop to 14th, but are finishing the season in good shape having stretched their longest unbeaten run under Russell Martin to eight games. Middlesbrough had been boosted on the eve of the game by boss Chris Wilder's declaration that he is ""all in"" at the Teesside club despite speculation linking him with a move to Burnley. The Riverside club were in need of a lift having stumbled in recent weeks, taking only one point in the four games before the long trip to Wales. Wilder's side pressed high when possible in the early stages, and their bold approach almost paid dividends when Swansea coughed up possession near halfway. McGree rolled a pass in behind for Duncan Watmore, but his rising drive flew just the wrong side of Andy Fisher's post. Swansea, as is usually the case, dominated the ball - but made little impression in the final third before the break. Their one sight of goal came when Joel Latibeaudiere lofted a pass into the area for Flynn Downes, but his hooked half-volley drifted over the bar. The contest came to life in the first minute of the second half, when a rare Matt Grimes error presented possession to McGree and his drive from outside the area deflected off Kyle Naughton and bounced into the net via the underside of the bar. Middlesbrough's first goal since 2 April really ought to have been followed by a second two minutes later, but Marcus Tavernier shot too close to Fisher. Fisher's save started a counter-attack which ended with Swansea's equaliser, as Joel Piroe fed Obafemi and he turned away from Sol Bamba before placing a shot beyond Luke Daniels from the edge of the box. After the calm of the first half, chaos suddenly reigned. Marc Bola missed out on a goal-of-the-season contender as his glorious 25-yard volley crashed back off the crossbar, and Swansea escaped again when Anfernee Dijksteel was denied by Fisher and another Tavernier effort was cleared off the line. Once more Martin's team responded on the break, with Cyrus Christie picking out Hannes Wolf at the far post only for the Austrian to see Daniels push his sweet half-volley on to the bar. Piroe's 20-yard effort then drew a sprawling stop from Daniels, who was on hand again to deny Ryan Manning. Ben Cabango then headed wide when he looked odds on to score, before Andraz Sporar's drive was parried by Fisher. Middlesbrough looked certain to win it when substitute Connolly went through on goal in the 90th minute, but his low shot rolled to safety off the base of the post after a slight touch from Fisher. Swansea head coach Russell Martin: ""I thought it was a really high level game. The first half I really liked. We had so much dominance and control. We have to make more of that. "" The start of the second half, an uncharacteristic mistake, that's on me. Grimesy has been incredible, so brave. ""I'm grateful to them for the way they reacted and the game came to life I guess. At 1-1 the atmosphere shot up. The game became really open and we wanted to score quickly because we got caught up in the emotion. ""The game became far too open. It was scary stuff. They had a few too many chances and we'll learn from that."" Middlesbrough manager Chris Wilder: ""It could have gone either way. We are obviously a touch disappointed. I always believe when we play Swansea and they are full of confidence, they do that to everybody. I don't get fazed about possession - they have great players and they play a way that suits the football club. ""I do think the way they play sometimes gives you an opportunity to create and punish. We didn't do that. We have had some great chances. We have got to do better. ""I know they had chances too - it was fabulous viewing and a few heart attacks for the managers. ""It's a huge game for us on Wednesday night [against Cardiff], a season-defining game for us."" Formation  3-4-2-1 Formation  3-5-2 Match ends, Swansea City 1, Middlesbrough 1.

131,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124792,West Bromwich Albion 0-0 Coventry City - Midlands derby ends goalless at The Hawthorns,"West Bromwich Albion and Coventry City's slim Championship play-off hopes were ended as as the two sides played out a goalless Midlands derby at The Hawthorns. But it needed a last-penalty save by Coventry keeper Ben Wilson to deny Albion a dramatic injury-time winner. Michael Rose was adjudged to have fouled Callum Robinson but Wilson, making his first start in three months, dived to his right to palm away Karlan Grant's 96th-minute spotkick. That officially put an end to any lingering play-off hopes Steve Bruce's Albion nurtured, while Coventry's bid is over too. Mark Robins' side sit six points behind sixth-placed Sheffield United, with two games to go and a far worse goal difference. Their only hope of making the play-offs would have been if the five teams immediately above them lost their remaining two games and they won both of theirs, with a major turnaround in goal difference. But two of those teams - QPR and Sheffield United - play each other next Friday night at Loftus Road. In a poor game in which neither side managed a shot in target in the first 45 minutes, it turned into the sixth goalless draw Albion's fans have suffered this season - four of them at The Hawthorns. Viktor Gyokeres, Jamie Allen (twice), Ben Sheaf and Martyn Waghorn missed chances for the visitors. Grant and Matt Clarke wasted Albion's best openings prior to the late penalty drama, while Andy Carroll slid in at the far post to sky over a Matt Phillips corner. Albion, who drop to 13th, have two remaining games, away to Bruce's old Manchester United team-mate Paul Ince's Reading next Saturday followed by the visit of relegated Barnsley. Coventry wind up their season with a visit from one of Robins' former clubs, automatic promotion chasers Huddersfield, followed by a final-day trip to Stoke. West Bromwich Albion boss Steve Bruce told BBC Radio WM: ""There is a long summer ahead. We need a freshness in terms of the players we want to bring in. And we're on with it. It will be a new-look team. ""We are not going to accept being mid-table. There are a lot of players that have been here for a long time and the supporters want to see some new faces more than anything. ""We've got to be professional in our last two games and maybe we'll look at the younger element. But we still want to finish the season respectfully and in a respectable position. ""It was a penalty because he gave it. It didn't make any difference, but it looked a bit soft."" Coventry City manager Mark Robins: ""My disappointment was the penalty was given in the first place. No way on this planet was that a penalty but he couldn't wait to give it. ""Ben Wilson's penalty save was out of this world - top drawer. Not only that, his distribution and general play was really good and gave us a decent platform to play. ""We were really good value for a point and we could have nicked something with a bit more belief. If that belief shifts in one or two individuals in the team then we will score more goals and create more chances. Then we can clearly move forward a little bit more. ""When you're playing against teams like this who were in the Premier League last season, they've got Premier League quality. When you've got a powerhouse in the air like Andy Carroll, you're always under pressure and you've got to try to stop crosses.""

The result was of more use to them than their relegation-threatened hosts, who led for most of the game through captain Alex Woodyard's goal, although they closed the gap between them and safety to three points. Wimbledon took a precious lead in the 19th minute after the visitors had failed to clear Nesta Guinness-Walker's free-kick as a mishit effort by Woodyard trickled into the net. The pressure from MK Dons built as the second half wore on, with home goalkeeper Nik Tzanev making a good save from Mo Eisa's shot across goal. But there was nothing he could do with 10 minutes left when Dean Lewington picked out Parrott, who crashed in a fantastic volley off the underside of the bar from a tricky angle. The hosts rallied from this and almost scored a winner when Ethan Chislett's stooping header was blocked by MK Dons goalkeeper Jamie Cumming. Match report supplied by PA Media.

133,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963567,Bolton Wanderers 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday,"MJ Williams scored a 90th-minute equaliser as late show masters Bolton secured a 1-1 League One draw with top-six contenders Sheffield Wednesday. Darren Moore's visitors dominated for long periods and should have had more than Jordan Storey's 66th-minute goal to show for their control. But Wanderers have a habit of netting in the closing stages and Williams' leveller was his team's 23rd goal in the final 15 minutes of action this season. Like midfielder Williams, on-loan Preston defender Storey also registered his first goal for his current club. He converted from inches after Sam Hutchinson headed Barry Bannan's corner against a post. Wednesday should have gone on to claim a third successive win against opponents, who have won only one of their past six games to fade out of the play-off picture. Bannan, March's League One player of the month, had three chances in the opening 12 minutes and should have made it 2-0 14 minutes from time. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing had wasted another glorious first-half opportunity, though Bolton almost took the lead through Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's first-half header. And those misses came back to haunt the Owls as Williams pounced in dramatic fashion. Match report supplied by PA Media.

The visitors thought they had taken the lead after a minute but Burton skipper John Brayford produced a superb clearance off the line to deny his opposite number Joe Edwards. Burton, struggling for form, started without an orthodox striker but after seeing much of the early Argyle threat began to cause problems for the visitors. Cameron Borthwick-Jackson lashed a rising drive just wide on the half-hour mark and Harry Chapman was marginally unable to get his head on a teasing cross from Jonny Smith. Joe Powell twice had chances for Burton in a tense second half but the best opportunity fell to Chapman, who forced to superb save from Michael Cooper in the Plymouth goal only for the ball to ricochet onto the shin of Burton defender Tom Hamer and deflect away when it looked like it might be sneaking in the bottom corner. Former Albion loanee Ryan Broom glanced a late header towards goal to force a save from Matej Kovar but there was to be no breakthrough for either side as the spoils were shared.

Morecambe could have gone ahead after 15 minutes, but Arthur Gnahoua shot wide from a narrow angle. Liam Bennett made a fine double goal-line clearance to deny Cole Stockton and then Gnahoua. The home side took the lead three minutes before the interval when Smith prodded home after Harvey Knibbs' shot had been blocked by Jacob Bedeau.

137,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.

139,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963569,Gillingham 1-1 Wycombe Wanderers,"Wycombe dropped out of the League One play-off places after being held to a draw by relegation-threatened Gillingham. Gills goalkeeper Aaron Chapman was called upon in the early stages to palm away Garath McCleary's strike. However, constant Wycombe pressure in the early stages prevailed in the 20th minute when a pass from Brandon Hanlan found Sam Vokes inside the penalty area and his left footed strike gave the Chairboys the advantage. Daryl Horgan had an opportunity to add a second goal shortly afterwards but Chapman stood tall and gathered at the second attempt. The home side's best opportunity of the half fell to top scorer Vadaine Oliver, who headed Robbie McKenzie's cross wide. The hosts were better in the second period, enjoying more of the possession, and eventually found a deserved equaliser when Jack Tucker's stunning volley found its way beyond keeper David Stockdale with 15 minutes remaining. Neil Harris' men nearly scored a dramatic winner, but Oliver's prodded shot towards goal, with Stockdale having dropped an initial effort, was hacked off the line. A frustrating afternoon was compounded for Gareth Ainsworth and his team when Lewis Wing was dismissed for a foul with four minutes remaining. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Lang scored the first and third goals, with Will Keane netting the other for the visitors. Anthony Scully had equalised for the Imps. The game got off to a lively start with three goals in the opening quarter. First, in the eighth minute, the visitors took the lead when Josh Magennis headed the ball on to Lang, who volleyed home from close range. City levelled six minutes later when the ball broke to Lewis Fiorini on the edge of the box. His shot took a big deflection off a defender and landed at the feet of Scully, who composed himself before slotting home. Wigan restored their lead in the 21st minute when, after good work from Lang and Max Power, Keane fired into the top corner from the edge of the box. The pacesetters had chances to extend their lead in the second half but a combination of poor finishing and a stunning save from Jordan Wright kept Lincoln in the game. However, Leam Richardson's men finally added a third goal with 18 minutes remaining. Teddy Bishop was dispossessed inside his own half, the ball was played to Lang and he fired home via the inside of the far post. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Embleton struck just three minutes after coming on in the League One contest, firing home when Ross Stewart played the ball square to him with the home defence stretched. Victory stretched Sunderland's unbeaten run to seven matches, while Oxford's play-off hopes appear in tatters after three successive defeats. Both skippers scored during the first half. Black Cats captain Corry Evans pounced in the 16th minute when the home defence failed to clear a free-kick, prodding home a shot from 14 yards before centre-half Elliott Moore headed in Billy Bodin's free-kick to equalise for Oxford in the 35th minute. Both sides had early chances with visiting goalkeeper Anthony Patterson turning over Mark Sykes' shot and Nathan Broadhead seeing an effort blocked on the line by Luke McNally at the other end.

The recently won Papa John's Trophy was paraded before the match but the mood was killed by George Dobson's second-half winner. Defeat leaves Rotherham three points outside of the automatic promotion berths they have occupied for a large part of the season. Ben Wiles threatened early on for the home side with his long-range volley whistling just wide of the post. Conor Washington got through on goal for the visitors but was denied a shot on goal thanks to a great recovering tackle by Ollie Rathbone. Viktor Johansson had to get in the way of Washington's lobbed effort early in the second half but there was nothing he could do to stop them taking the lead on 55 minutes. Neat interplay around the box saw Dobson teed up and the midfielder rifled an unstoppable shot into the corner.

James Norwood put the visitors ahead with his sixth-goal of the season after six minutes before team-mate Cameron Burgess was shown a second yellow card on 75 minutes. That moment swung the momentum and Whalley spectacularly picked out the far corner from 25 yards. Just five minutes in, Marko Marosi made a sensational save to keep out Conor Chaplin's header but Norwood made no mistake one minute later - glancing Janoi Donacien's cross into the far corner. Shortly after - in a bizarre turn of events - play was halted as one of the assistant referees suffered a leg injury and he had to be eventually replaced with the fourth official Lisa Rashid.

But a dramatic second half that saw Sutton's Rob Milsom miss a penalty also included a late allegation of racism from the crowd towards a visiting player. That contributed to 10 minutes of stoppage time but Phil Brown's Barrow clung on for three vital points against the odds. Home delight at Rooney's fifth goal of the season quickly turned to despair. Josh Kay, booked in the opening half, was cautioned for something said to referee Ben Toner as the players walked back to re-start. Minutes later Barrow conceded a penalty for Connor Brown's foul on striker Omar Bugiel. However, Paul Farman came to the Bluebirds rescue with a stunning spot-kick stop from Milsom. As Sutton searched for an equaliser, the game was halted for an incident involving home fans with the referee speaking to both managers before resuming the game.

145,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124942,Bradford City 2-1 Scunthorpe United - Hughes earns first win as Bantams boss,"Mark Hughes enjoyed his first home win as Bradford manager as the Bantams beat already-relegated Scunthorpe with a 2-1 League Two victory at Valley Parade. The result ended a run of nine home matches without a win, five of them since Hughes became manager at the end of February. Bradford made the perfect start, going ahead after just 18 seconds through midfielder Jamie Walker - on loan from Hearts - following a four-man move. Lee Angol collected a headed clearance from Fiacre Kelleher and played the ball out to Charles Vernam on the left, who crossed the ball into the goalmouth where Walker slipped it past goalkeeper Rory Watson. Before Scunthorpe could recover, the home side scored a second goal, Vernam firing low into the corner of the net from 20 yards after five minutes. Angol was denied, first by Ryan Delaney and then by Watson as Bradford were in search of a third before Scunthorpe pulled one back after 33 minutes. Rekeil Pyke blocked Alex Bass' clearance and the ball rebounded into the empty net off goalkeeper Bass for an own goal. At the other end, Dion Pereira had a shot charged down and Vernam sped down the left before cutting in, only to see his right-footed shot rebound from the underside of the crossbar three minutes before half-time. Bradford dominated the second half without being able to add to their score but their early two-goal burst was enough to give them their first home win since beating Salford on January 16 and only their fifth at Valley Parade this season.

146,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124970,Bristol Rovers 0-0 Forest Green Rovers: Forest Green promoted after draw,"Forest Green Rovers have been promoted to League One for the first time in their history, following a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers. The Gloucestershire team have been at the top of the table since September and are now eight points clear of fourth-placed Port Vale, who have only two matches remaining to Forest Green's three. Jamille Matt, Jack Aitchison and Nicky Cadden were all denied by Bristol Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw in the second half, while Luke McGee produced a fine save to thwart Luke Thomas at the other end. Bristol Rovers remain in fifth place, two points away from the automatic promotion places with two games left. Having looked to be racing towards League One only a few months ago, Forest Green have seen their push towards the automatic promotion finish line stumble of late. They fell to a shock 4-0 loss to Barrow on Good Friday, but then beat Oldham Athletic on Easter Monday and knew they needed one point against west country rivals Bristol Rovers to officially secure a top-three finish. Regan Hendry was close to getting an opening goal but his effort was cleared off the line, while Ebou Adams' strike forced Belshaw into making a one-handed save. Bristol Rovers have been on a fine run during the second half of this season and are still in the hunt for a top-three finish themselves, meaning there was little between the sides as Antony Evans and Elliot Anderson also saw chances go begging. But it was Forest Green who looked more like scoring with Matt denied from close range, as Belshaw was called on repeatedly to keep out the visitors. Still, a 0-0 draw has never seemed so welcome to a team as Forest Green staff and fans raced on to the pitch to start the celebrations at full-time. Forest Green's promotion to League One has looked so certain at points this season, it is easy to forget it has only been five years since the club was promoted to the English Football League for the first time. The majority of their 133-year history has seen them more as a local village team than a professional outfit. After falling short in the play-offs in each of the past two seasons, automatic promotion has been the main target for the squad. The appointment of former Wales, Aston Villa and Wolves defender Rob Edwards as manager last summer - the first senior job of his coaching career - has proved a masterstroke. Edwards, 39, has been praised for his forward-thinking approach. He signed few players and focussed on developing the young squad he already had - only seven of their 29 players are over 25 - fitting for someone who earned his coaching stripes working with the England youth teams. Consistency has also been key. Forest Green have sat at the top of the table since September, before going on a run of 19 matches unbeaten into February that pushed them 10 points clear. Remarkably, only 19 players have been fielded in the league and that has shown in their performances. This is a team that knows each other well and how they want to play. Striker Matty Stevens is among those to flourish under Edwards' management. Having spent most of last season out of favour and on loan, this term he has been a regular starter and the team's top scorer. His partnership with Matt up front - the 'Matt Attack' - has been so formidable they have scored 43 goals between them. Things have stuttered since February when Forest Green's unbeaten run came to an end and they went seven matches without a win. The pressure seemed to show and their advantage dramatically receded. But another four victories followed, and while a recent 4-0 defeat by bottom-of-the-table Barrow was a shock, Forest Green have got over the line - the 'little team on top of the hill' have secured a historic promotion to League One. Analysis - Paul Furley, BBC Radio Gloucestershire What a journey it's been for Forest Green Rovers - from the Stroud League in its early days at the start of the 20th century to League One. The club that was founded on a hill high above Nailsworth in 1889 never played an opponent outside of Gloucestershire until the 1970s, yet 40 years on from winning a double of the Hellenic League Premier Division and the FA Vase at Wembley, Rovers find themselves promoted to the third tier of English football. This is their fourth promotion in the last 25 years, the first two achieved under the stewardship of late chairman Trevor Horsley and manager Frank Gregan who took the club from obscurity to a place among the non-league elite and achieved a return to Wembley in the 1999 FA Trophy final. The recurring theme for the club down the years, according to Tim Barnard who wrote its official history and designed its current ground, is that every time it has needed someone to come in and take it to the next level, it has found that person. That is what it has done under Dale Vince as chairman and with Rob Edwards now in charge of the team. He has worked with a squad largely inherited from Mark Cooper's time at the New Lawn and taken them to automatic promotion in League Two.

Rochdale started the better of the two teams and Cameron Dawson made a superb save with his feet to deny former Grecian Jimmy Keohane before he made an even better one moments later to again deny Keohane. Offrande Zanzala should have done better from a Pierce Sweeney cross, but he headed wastefully wide at the near post, while Archie Collins was denied by Rochdale goalkeeper Jay Lynch when he had Jake Caprice screaming for the lay-off in a goal-scoring position. Jevani Brown saw a shot deflect over the crossbar, while Zanzala was again off target from Joshua Key's cross. However, the deadlock was finally broken in the 34th minute when Tim Dieng scrambled in Archie Collins' free-kick for his 14th goal of the season. Exeter extended their lead on the hour mark when Brown's shot was beat away by Lynch and Matt Jay dived to head the rebound into the net. Rochdale rarely threatened until the final minute when Dawson made another outstanding reactive save to deny Josh Andrews. Exeter will now win promotion with a home win over Barrow on Tuesday.

148,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124945,Harrogate Town 3-0 Carlisle United: Sulphurites end seven-game winless home run,"Harrogate's joint-longest run without a home win since 2012 came to an end as Jack Diamond's brace and a Rory McArdle goal secured victory over Carlisle. The hosts had failed to win any of their last seven matches at Wetherby Road but Diamond's double strike - taking his season's tally to 13 - and a first in Harrogate colours for McArdle meant the Cumbrians have now been defeated in each of their three visits to the North Yorkshire outfit without scoring a goal. On-loan Sunderland winger Diamond started and finished a flowing 18th-minute move to open the scoring when he first showed nimble footwork on the left touchline before play was spread to George Thomson and he then leapt high to meet the latter's right-wing cross before heading over Carlisle keeper Mark Howard. Thomson was again the provider for the hosts' second goal, bending in a free kick from the right that was met by McArdle's stooping eight-yard header. After the interval, Carlisle striker Lewis Alessandra, who has only scored once all season, was denied by an excellent reflex save from Joe Cracknell. But home forward Jack Muldoon then thumped the underside of the bar with a shot that was adjudged not to have crossed the line before Diamond wrapped up matters in the first minute of stoppage time, latching on to Alex Pattison's through ball and emphatically finding Howard's bottom-left corner from 12 yards.

Pools almost got one back on 51 minutes as Tom Crawford turned and his shot was pushed out by the alert Lewis Ward. But McKirdy got a second on 55 minutes. Payne was the provider for the marksman to net at the near post. He was denied a hat-trick a minute later by covering defender Jake Hull. On 85 minutes, centre-half Mathieu Baudry prodded in a corner from close range to complete the rout. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Mitch Pinnock opened the scoring in the 19th minute when he rifled home an unstoppable 20-yard shot and the Cobblers doubled their lead on 32 minutes when John Guthrie scored from close range after his initial effort had hit the upright. Six minutes later, Joshua Felix-Eppiah sprung the offside trap for the visitors' third goal of the game.

Jamie Murphy and Lucas Akins both netted their first goals to get the Stags back on track after back-to-back Easter defeats. Mansfield deservedly led at the break, Murphy turning home a 12-yard volley from Elliott Hewitt's fine cross from the right. Crawley goalkeeper Glenn Morris had a busy half, saving an early effort from Akins before making a superb full-length save to his left to prevent a Rhys Oates shot finding the top corner after 41 minutes and then spreading himself at his near post to deny Stephen McLaughlin two minutes later. Crawley, who suspended manager John Yems on Saturday morning following allegations of discrimination, came close to levelling when James Tilley lashed inches wide of the far post after 39 minutes. Murphy almost made it 2-0 after 51 minutes amid a scramble but Jordan Tunnicliffe headed off the line, and shortly afterwards Morris was there again to deny Oates one-on-one. Tilley's late challenge on McLaughlin in the 69th minute brought his second booking and Crawley were down to 10 men. And just three minutes later Akins headed home a McLaughlin cross from the left from six yards and the points were secured. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Luke Norris struck in each half to take his tally for the season to 14, sparking jubilant scenes at full-time. After a quiet opening quarter, two goalmouth scrambles in as many minutes almost had Stevenage ahead, only for the finish to elude them. With the wind and momentum behind them, Boro broke the deadlock after 22 minutes when Norris scored from 12 yards. Luther James-Wildin's cross hit Josh Hawkes' outstretched arm and after initially hesitating, referee Keith Stroud pointed to the spot. The hosts continued to threaten from wide areas, but Tranmere were the livelier side after the break, with Elliott Nevitt failing to convert a close-range chance. That proved costly when Norris doubled Boro's lead after 67 minutes, heading back across goal following an inch-perfect Ben Coker cross. Tranmere's best chance fell to substitute Nicky Maynard late on but he slipped at the decisive moment, allowing Stevenage to claim the points. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Vale controlled the first half but Walsall keeper Carl Rushworth saved Connor Hall's header and James Wilson's 25-yard free-kick, while Jamie Proctor curled over from the edge of the box. Walsall improved after the break and made the breakthrough on 67 minutes, Perry timing his run into the box perfectly to glance home a deft header from Osadebe's teasing cross. George Miller almost sealed the points seven minutes later as he rattled the crossbar from an acute angle. Vale came close to rescuing a point but Rushworth produced a superb save with his leg from Chris Hussey's free-kick and also kept out Ryan Edmondson's follow-up.

154,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357319,Exeter City 2-1 Barrow: Grecians promoted from League Two after Matt Jay winner,"Matt Jay's late winner saw Exeter City secure promotion from League Two as they came from a goal down to beat Barrow 2-1 in a nervy affair at St James Park. The hosts fell behind to a bizarre Cameron Dawson own goal after Remeao Hutton's long throw-in from the left appeared to go straight in. Kieran Phillips hit the bar for Exeter 15 minutes later before the on-loan Huddersfield Town striker superbly broke to get the equaliser. Exeter struggled to create any chances after the break until homegrown skipper Jay coolly finished at the far post from Josh Key's cross from the right. The win sees Exeter return to League One after a decade in the fourth tier. Having started the better the hosts fell behind after Hutton's throw appeared to go straight into the net. But the referee, after a moment of deliberation and a glance at his assistant, gave the goal having judged that it had taken a touch off Exeter goalkeeper Dawson having hit the post. Exeter regrouped quickly as Tim Dieng, Jack Sparkes and Jay all had efforts as they had the better of the possession against a Barrow side assured of a third season in the EFL. Phillips should have put City level when he crashed an effort off the top of the bar from eight yards out after some superb build-up play by Jevani Brown. But he did find the net when Cheick Diabate's headed clearance from a free-kick fell to his feet midway in his own half and the 22-year-old raced through before his right-footed effort deflected off Patrick Brough and beat a wrong-footed Paul Farman at his near post. A nervy second half saw Exeter almost go behind when Hutton beat the offside trap, but his low shot was saved by the legs of Dawson just after the hour mark. But Exeter weathered the storm and Jay - a product of the club's much-vaunted academy who has risen to become skipper - superbly controlled Key's cross before blasting in to send almost 8,000 people in St James Park into raptures. Sam Nombe almost got a third as his shot was blocked after breaking through in the final minute, before Exeter's fans invaded the pitch on the final whistle as they won promotion on home turf for the first time since 1990. Exeter's sixth promotion in their 121-year history came after six years of heartbreaking near-misses. The Grecians were beaten play-off finalists in 2017 when they lost to Blackpool and again a year later when Coventry City defeated them at Wembley. Matt Taylor's first season in charge ended with City one point outside the play-off places in 2019 before a humbling 4-0 loss to Northampton in a Covid-19 affected play-off final a year later. Last season the Grecians were three points short but this term - including a club-record 20-game unbeaten run - they have impressed and will deservedly take their place in the third tier for the first time in a decade. Exeter manager Matt Taylor told BBC Sport: ""It was strange because it felt like it was one of those nights where it wasn't going to be our night and we might not get that goal. ""When it did come I didn't feel nervous at all, I felt we were in control, we knew what we needed to do, they didn't really have any chances after their goal. ""It was a game of very few chances, their goal was a freak goal and our goal was a big deflection as well. ""We've just got to enjoy these moments because this club and some of these players have been through some difficult moments, and to come through it in the way they have and to get promoted with two games left in the automatic positions is a reflection on that group of players. Exeter goalscorer and captain Matt Jay told BBC Sport: ""I'm absolutely delighted, over the moon, words can't really describe it to be honest. ""This group has been extra special this year, it's a fantastic group, brilliant recruitment and we've really felt together and you could see how much it meant to us at the end. ""The club have been wanting to go up for many, many years, and to finally do that on a special night in front of more than 7,800 fans is a brilliant turnout. ""It was probably a fairly average game, but luckily we got the better of it."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Exeter City 2, Barrow 1. Second Half ends, Exeter City 2, Barrow 1.

Former Mansfield boss Steve Evans was given a hostile reception by home fans on his return to his former club. But his Stevenage side defended stoutly in a frustrating first half for Mansfield. Indeed, the nearest the sides came to a breakthrough was at the other end on the half-hour when Stevenage forward Luke Norris out-muscled Stephen McLaughlin and burst into the box, his low shot turned away by keeper Nathan Bishop's fingertips at full stretch to his right. Mansfield went up a gear after the break and after George Maris had shot inches wide from a Lucas Akins pull-back in the 47th minute, they went ahead four minutes later. A short corner from the left was sent over by Jamie Murphy and Lapslie won the ball in a scramble and fired inside the left post from six yards. Stevenage finished the game with 10 men after making all their subtitutions and then losing Terence Vancooten injured eight minutes from time. Longstaff made the points safe in the third added minute as the Stags played keep-ball and then some neat passing found him unmarked in the box to tuck away a low finish from 10 yards.

Louie Barry gave Swindon the lead after only 15 minutes, tapping into the net unmarked from a Harry McKirdy cross and Jack Payne doubled their score before half-time, shooting from range. Substitute Josh March pulled one back for Forest Green after Swindon were reduced to 10 men early in the second half but were unable to find an equaliser. Swindon are now up to eighth but remain two points outside the play-offs places. It was a fast start, with Jordan Moore-Taylor hitting the bar for Forest Green and Barry seeing a shot blocked right on the line for Swindon. But Barry took his next chance to put Swindon ahead, after McKirdy and Payne combined down the right and he tapped in from close range. Forest Green looked a threat whenever they ran into the Swindon half and Regan Hendry saw a low, driving shot go just wide, while Baily Cargill forced Lewis Ward into making a two-handed save. But Swindon made them pay for the missed opportunities when Payne slotted home five minutes before the break after Barry broke inside on the left. The atmosphere became increasingly fraught after Swindon were reduced to 10 men with Ellis Iandolo sent off for a second yellow card. And when Jonny Williams lost the ball on the edge of the box, Ebou Adams' shot was palmed into the path of substitute March, who put it in the net.

Former Colchester man Jevani Brown played an inch-perfect pass into the path of Jack Sparkes and the Grecians academy graduate fired a low shot across goal into the corner to send a sold-out crowd into a frenzy.

160,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033846,Bradford City 1-1 Tranmere Rovers,"Substitute Callum McManaman scored a late equaliser to earn Tranmere a draw at 10-man Bradford and leave Bantams manager Mark Hughes still waiting for his first home win after five attempts. Bradford, who played for more than an hour with 10 men after midfield player Elliot Watt was sent off for a second booking, were denied a win when McManaman equalised with a low drive just inside the far post. Bradford dominated the early stages and deservedly went ahead in the 19th minute when Luke Hendrie crossed from the right and Jamie Walker, on loan from Hearts, flicked a smart header into the far corner of the net. However, the Bantams suffered a blow in the 28th minute when Watt was sent off for a second yellow card in the space of three minutes, first for a foul on Elliott Nevitt and then on Lee O'Connor. Walker came close to increasing Bradford's lead, but was denied by a fine save from keeper Joe Murphy who turned his 20-yard shot over the bar. Tranmere hit back strongly and Sam Foley headed narrowly over the bar before Josh Dacres-Cogley saw his header bounce inches wide of the post. However, Murphy came to Tranmere's rescue in first-half stoppage time when he turned Andy Cook's goal-bound shot round the post for a corner. Both sides went close in an evenly contested second half with Murphy saving well from Yann Songo'o and home keeper Alex Bass keeping out a downward header from Peter Clarke. McManaman levelled things up in the 89th minute to earn Tranmere a point. Match report supplied by PA Media. Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  4-3-1-2 Match ends, Bradford City 1, Tranmere Rovers 1.

On-loan Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson drove in low at the near post on 75 minutes for his fifth league goal of the season after being set up by a fine pass from substitute Luke Thomas. Joey Barton had to rejig his attack when striker Leon Clarke was withdrawn from the starting XI after getting injured in the warm-up. Sam Nicholson was brought in to replace him. But it did not stop the Gas extending their unbeaten home run to 11 league games. Matt Smith's header in the sixth minute tested Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw at his near post, while Brandon Thomas-Asante volleyed over the bar on 20 minutes. But that was as close as Salford came to scoring. Rovers substitute Antony Evans hit the crossbar in the second half, but the strike from Anderson, who has made a huge impression during his loan spell, eventually made the difference. Rovers are fifth in League Two, five points behind the automatic promotion places with four matches to play. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Luke Armstrong grabbed the hosts' consolation in the fourth minute of stoppage time, but the victory kept Ben Garner's men, who had gone into the game without a win in three games, on the coat-tails of the top seven. Harrogate, meanwhile, have still not mathematically secured their Sky Bet League Two status for next term following a seventh defeat in nine contests. Swindon totally dominated a one-sided first half, with Jack Payne seeing a deflected edge-of-the-box effort hit an upright before Barry opened the scoring in the 24th minute. The on-loan Aston Villa teenager was left unmarked at the far post to head in Mandela Egbo's right-wing cross from three yards out. He then added a second on the half-hour mark when he was left unchallenged again in the same position to meet another Egbo delivery after Louis Reed's excellent ball through the right channel. The visitors should have taken an even bigger lead into the interval as Barry fired straight at Joe Cracknell when given a clear run on the home goal and Davison side-footed wide from six yards. But Davison was more clinical in the 51st minute when he netted from eight yards after Ellis Iandolo's powerful run from the halfway line into the home box. He then doubled his personal haul for the afternoon, firing inside an exposed Cracknell's near post from 10 yards after being played through the right channel by Payne. The visitors also went close to adding a fifth when Iandolo's spectacular late strike clipped the crossbar before Armstrong pounced from close range after Jojo Wollacott had parried Simon Power's firm drive.

The Valiants have now won five of their last six games and have a five-point cushion ahead of the play-off places. Pools, ensconced in mid-table, had the better of the first half. A volley from Tom Crawford dipped wide before Omar Bogle's powerful run saw him shoot over from 20 yards. Then David Ferguson used his right foot to send a low effort into keeper Aiden Stone. But Vale were fired up after the restart and started to take control. They almost went ahead when Ferguson's wayward header back to Nicholas Bilokapic evaded the keeper, who scrambled the ball off the line.

164,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033835,Leyton Orient 3-0 Scunthorpe United: Iron relegated after 72 years in EFL,"Scunthorpe United's 72-year spell in the English Football League will come to an end as a 3-0 loss at Leyton Orient confirmed their relegation from League Two. Paul Smyth cut in from the right wing, skipped past Ryan Delaney and arrowed a low shot past Rory Watson's near post to put the O's in front early on. Orient doubled their lead six minutes later as Theo Archibald curled a left-footed effort into the far corner of the net from the corner of the 18-yard box. Ruel Sotiriou found himself unmarked at the far post to head in Jordan Brown's deep cross for Orient's third as the Iron's will buckled. Sotiriou almost got his second seven minutes after the break, but he hit the post after Brown's through ball, while Watson did well to deny Archibald after an hour and Hector Kyprianou crashed an effort off the Scunthorpe crossbar six minutes later. The loss - Scunthorpe's 26th in 42 league games - leaves the Iron 16 points from safety with 12 left to play for. Scunthorpe manager Keith Hill, who has seen his side win just two games in the 28 he has taken charge of since November, said he is upset that his side will be playing in the National League next season. ""I'm really sad. I am angry. I don't want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it's not stood me in good stead, but I'm very, very disappointed,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. ""I've been disappointed a lot of times, but I've got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. ""It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn't been good enough. ""Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you're staring down the barrel of relegation. ""We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don't think we've been competitive enough throughout the course of the season."" In truth the writing has been on the wall for the North Lincolnshire side for the majority of a campaign where they have won just four league matches. Since beating fellow strugglers Oldham 3-1 at Boundary Park on 26 December the Iron have won just once - a 1-0 win over Walsall on 8 February - and this loss at Brisbane Road was their seventh successive defeat. They finished just one place above the League Two relegation zone in 2020-21 and their cause this campaign was hindered when they were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer. Boss Neil Cox was sacked in November with the club bottom of League Two and replaced by former Rochdale, Barnsley and Bolton manager Hill. Hill lost just one of his first seven matches in charge but they never built up any momentum, and last spent a day outside the bottom two on 28 December. Relegation out of the Football League will be hard to swallow for Iron fans, who saw their team play in the Championship in 2011 and compete in the League One play-offs as recently as 2018. However, they were then relegated to League Two in 2018-19 and finished 20th in their first season back in the fourth tier. With hopes of EFL survival drifting badly, boss Hill said after a home defeat by fellow strugglers Barrow on 15 March that he had to change ""the culture"" at the club. ""I'm trying to navigate this football club through some stormy moments to where I can build a positive future in a positive environment,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. Though there is now certainty of what level the Iron will be playing in next season, the club's next move behind the scenes is unknown. Owner Peter Swann resigned as chairman last month and has acknowledged he is looking for someone to buy the club from him.external-link Lee Turnbull has returned to the club in the role of chief operating officer and Hill will now hope that he is given the chance to turn the club's fortunes around. BBC Radio Humberside's Mike White It's a sad, miserable, heart-breaking day for Scunthorpe United. A club with a storied history that can list legendary England internationals like Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan among its most notable former players, in addition to club icons such as Jack Brownsword and Barrie Thomas, and even dual-sport star Ian Botham. In recent times, the Iron punched above their weight in the Championship in the mid-to-late 2000s and flirted with it again under the management of Graham Alexander. Many fans believe his 2018 sacking was the start of the decline that's brought them to this point. Recruitment has been questioned in the past few years too, with many fans suggesting now-former chairman - but still club owner for the time being - Peter Swann had too much input, something he has refuted on several occasions. Whilst some fans are angered by the current state of the club and this situation, many almost seem numb to it now and were resigned to their fate a long time before the dreaded 'R' was placed next to their name on the league table. And despite the consistent positivity from manager Keith Hill about the future of the club, I'm not sure the majority of Iron supporters share that sentiment as they've seen that the National League can quite easily turn into a giant abyss that has swallowed up clubs without a hint or whisper of a return to the Football League. Maybe recent talk and suggestion of a takeover could provide the required impetus needed to at least provide the right resources to Hill and his team - and breathe new life back into a club in desperate need of it - but that will have to wait for another day.

With Port Vale winning, sixth-placed Stags now have a six-point gap between them and the third automatic promotion place, although they still have a game in hand. Sutton, meanwhile, climbed up to seventh with the win as they took advantage of Newport and Tranmere dropping points. Mansfield gifted their opponent a ninth-minute lead following an error by defender Farrend Rawson. After having the ball rolled to him on the edge of the box by keeper Nathan Bishop, Rawson was dispossessed by Omar Bugiel who rounded Bishop and calmly netted. The hosts were then rocked by a second Sutton goal four minutes into the second half as David Ajiboye was allowed to turn home his eighth goal of the season from six yards, tucking away Enzio Boldewijn's cross from the left by-line. Stags were handed a lifeline in the 78th minute as a long John-Joe O'Toole ball forward saw Sutton defender Ben Goodliffe loop a header over his own keeper. But United were 3-1 up two minutes later as substitute Richie Bennett raced clear to slot past Bishop with Stags screaming for an offside flag.

170,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125002,Oldham Athletic 1-2 Salford City: Latics relegated after protest interrupts match,"Oldham Athletic have been relegated from the English Football League for the first time after defeat by Salford City in a game interrupted by a supporters' on-pitch protest against the club's owners. It ends 116 years of league football for the Boundary Park club, and also means they are the first former Premier League team to drop into non-league since its creation in 1992. The Latics, who needed to avoid defeat to keep their hopes of League Two survival alive after wins for both Barrow and Stevenage, trailed 2-1 with 14 minutes to play against Salford when fans poured on to the pitch. The players were taken off by referee Bobby Madley as supporters staged a centre-circle sit-in against owner Abdallah Lemsagam, despite appeals from boss John Sheridan to return to the stands. Protests remained in place for some time after, but once the pitch had been cleared, the teams returned to play out the remaining time behind closed doors. An EFL spokesperson said: ""This afternoon's League Two fixture between Oldham Athletic and Salford City has been concluded behind closed doors. ""The remaining 14 minutes played resulted in a final scoreline of Oldham Athletic 1 Salford City 2, and as a result Oldham Athletic have been relegated from League Two. ""Despite the earlier announcement of the abandonment of the fixture, after discussions with both clubs, match officials, and stadium security it was agreed the match could be concluded today. ""The decision was taken in order to maintain the integrity of the competition given the importance of the fixture at both ends of the League Two table."" Salford, who needed the points to maintain their play-off hopes, took an early lead through ex-Oldham striker Matt Smith who tucked into an open goal. Davis Keillor-Dunn stroked home a penalty to give the home side hope after a handball by Jordan Turnbull, but Brandon Thomas-Asante's near-post header in first-half injury time restored the Salford lead. With pressure mounting, Oldham went for the goal they needed to delay the drop, with Keillor-Dunn's tame chip saved by Tom King after Jamie Hopcutt's header was ruled out. No further score was achieved after the resumption, and Oldham's fate was sealed before eerily empty stands. Relegation to the National League marks a huge fall from grace for a club who were founder members of the Premier League, League Cup finalists 32 years ago and Wembley FA Cup semi-finalists as recently as 1994. In a cruel twist of fate, they are set to begin their first season outside of the EFL on the 30th anniversary of the breakaway division. Oldham's likely drop rounds off a miserable spell for the club in recent times. Keith Curle, appointed in March 2021, looked set to inspire some hope in the beleaguered Latics when he arrived at Boundary Park. Arriving at the club having won promotion from the fourth tier with Northampton as recently as 2020, supporters would be forgiven for thinking he could turn around the fortunes of a club who have slumped to their lowest point in recent memory. It took seven games to find a win in any competition this term and the club's form did not noticeably improve in the first half of the campaign. Curle left in November, just eight months into his tenure, amid the backdrop of heightened tensions with the club's support. Three fans were banned in December for ""promoting their dislike"" of the club, with one of the trio branding it a ""dictatorship"". The bans - which were issued directly by the club and were not court-issued football banning orders - were overturned just two days later after a public outcry, but the damage was done. Protests continued and less than a month later Lemsagam announced that he was willing to sell the club, a U-turn on the position he had taken in September 2021 when he claimed he did not want to. Under his tenure there have been accusations of late payment of salaries and threats of player strikes - as well as the prospect of administration, which was eventually avoided. After more than a month without a permanent manager, Sheridan arrived in January for his sixth stint at the club. Despite a bright run of form in February which took them out of the League Two drop zone, as well as two successive wins in March and April, nine defeats in the past 11 games before Saturday saw a slide into trouble that could not be halted, not even by a club legend.

Phil Parkinson's side slip to 11 points adrift of leaders Stockport County, who came back from 2-0 down to beat Wealdstone. Wrexham struggled to create clear chances against a Bromley side who have been hard to beat at home this season. Andy Woodman's Ravens climb to ninth, while Wrexham stay fourth. Aaron Hayden and Max Cleworth headed over for Wrexham, while Ollie Palmer shot wide. Jude Arthurs headed off target at the other end before Rob Lainton made a fine save to deny Luke Coulson. Lainton then suffered a suspected broken wrist making a follow-up stop which led to him being carried off on a stretcher, on the same ground at which was he knocked out last season. Coulson then beat substitute keeper Christian Dibble only for the offside flag to save Wrexham. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson: ""We come into every game trying to get three points. I think on the balance of the game, we weren't at our best. We still had the best moments to win it. ""If you can't win you have to make sure you get something and concentration levels were good towards the end from the set-plays and throws they were putting in the box.

172,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685405,Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth: Leaders win to go 25 points clear,"Jurgen Klopp said he will ""never compare"" himself to former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly after his side beat Bournemouth to take another major step towards a first league title in 30 years. The victory was Liverpool's 22nd successive Premier League win at Anfield, breaking the English top-flight record set by Shankly's team in 1972. ""We didn't think about that number before the game, but after we can,"" said Klopp. ""It's nice, it's special, but today is a very good example that we have to fight."" The hosts fell behind in controversial circumstances, Callum Wilson slotting home Jefferson Lerma's low cross after appearing to shove Joe Gomez in the build-up to the goal. Liverpool soon hit their stride, however, and Mohamed Salah - making his 100th league appearance for the club - restored parity with a low finish after Sadio Mane dispossessed Jack Simpson deep inside the Cherries' half. Mane latched on to Virgil van Dijk's perfectly weighted through-ball to complete the turnaround, but Liverpool needed a brilliant goal-line clearance from James Milner to prevent Ryan Fraser from hauling Bournemouth back on level terms in a nervy second half. ""We're not geniuses, but we can really fight and that's all we have to do until the end of the season,"" said Klopp, who confirmed captain Jordan Henderson - missing with a hamstring injury - is likely to resume full training on Sunday before the Champions League last-16 second leg at home to Atletico Madrid. ""I think he will train tomorrow. If that looks good, I have to make a decision."" The win means Liverpool could be champions by the time they play Everton in the league on 16 March - if Manchester City lose their next three games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Burnley. Eddie Howe's Bournemouth side remain in the relegation zone, level on points with Watford and West Ham but with a worse goal difference than their nearest rivals at the bottom. Klopp spoke before the game about ""getting back on track immediately"" after watching his side slip to consecutive defeats in the league and FA Cup. They made the worst possible start, however, as Bournemouth capitalised on the Reds' early nerves to take a shock lead - albeit in controversial fashion. Wilson finished off a neat move involving Lerma and Philip Billing, but Liverpool felt the goal should have been disallowed for the striker's push on Gomez. The video assistant referee saw no infringement and the goal was given. Things could have got worse for Liverpool when Nathan Ake's powerful header was unconvincingly shovelled on to the top of the crossbar by stand-in goalkeeper Adrian, although they continued to create chances and deservedly restored parity through Salah's low finish - his 70th league goal for the club. If Bournemouth fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Mane scored with a delightful dink over Aaron Ramsdale 12 minutes before half-time, Liverpool failed to carry that momentum into the second half. Chances were few and far between until Ryan Fraser spotted Adrian off his line, with the retreating Milner producing an outstanding clearance, while Mane's 25-yard strike cannoned back off the bar. Having seen his side taken a deserved early lead, Howe will be bitterly disappointed with the manner of Liverpool's two first-half goals. Simpson, who replaced the injured Steve Cook after 19 minutes, was easily dispossessed by Mane in the build-up to Salah's equaliser, before another sloppy pass allowed Van Dijk to tee up the Senegal forward for Liverpool's second. There were positives for Bournemouth, who caused Liverpool problems and were only denied a share of the spoils by Milner's superb clearance from Fraser's looping effort. Ake spurned an opportunity to equalise in the 90th minute when he opted to pass to the offside Wilson with only Adrian to beat. However, Bournemouth will need to cut out individual mistakes if they are to prolong their five-year stay in the Premier League. ""The two goals come from us having possession and they punished us on the transition,"" Howe said. ""It was a ruthless game for us today because I don't think we did much wrong."" With games against Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham and Leicester coming up, Bournemouth will be desperate to claim maximum points at home to Crystal Palace in their next league match. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Sport: ""I know what the boys are able to do, but I am not the one that is playing - they are. We have said before, confidence is not something that you get, put in your pocket and keep for the rest of your life. It comes and goes. You need that feeling where things work out. ""You have to fight hard - that's always the main thing to do - but we have 82 points now, which is really nice. We have to carry on fighting, give everyone a proper fight - and that's what we did today."" Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport: ""We gave it a go. We started really well and looked a threat on the counter-attack. Their two goals came from the transition. They punished us when it counted. ""We made a mistake for the first goal, and the second was similar - we had the ball, seconds later we are conceding. We gave everything to it but came away with nothing. ""Losing Steve Cook was a big moment, and Phil [Billing] couldn't really move at the end. We couldn't have a full assault at them.""

173,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42849447,Liverpool 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur,"Harry Kane's penalty - converted with virtually the last kick of an enthralling encounter - gave Tottenham a vital point at Anfield after Mohamed Salah's brilliant stoppage-time strike looked to have given Liverpool victory. Liverpool had only seconds to survive when referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot after Virgil van Dijk collided with Erik Lamela - allowing Kane, who had missed an earlier penalty, to score his 100th Premier League goal and leave the home fans enraged. Salah's third-minute goal, scored after he intercepted Eric Dier's poor back pass, gave Liverpool a lead they held until 10 minutes from time when Spurs substitute Victor Wanyama lashed keeper Loris Karius' punched clearance back into the top corner from 25 yards. In a dramatic finale, Karius saved Kane's penalty after he brought down the striker, paving the way for Salah to weave his way into the area before lifting a finish over Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris at the start of five minutes of stoppage time. And after Moss awarded Kane a second opportunity from the spot, the England international placed his penalty into the bottom-right corner. It was a fitting end to a thriller and a result which will bring more satisfaction to Spurs as defeat would have left them five points adrift of Liverpool in the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Liverpool remain third in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Tottenham in fifth. When manager Jurgen Klopp set off on a sprint of triumph along the touchline in front of Anfield's giant Main Stand as Salah put Liverpool back in front in injury time, he thought he was celebrating a win that was opening up a crucial five-point gap between his side and Spurs. Instead, minutes later, he was left to reflect on the concession of a late equaliser that left Anfield enveloped in frustration. Liverpool's much-maligned defence had held firm for so long, but Klopp's switch to three at the back, when he sent on Joel Matip for James Milner in the final quarter of an hour, did not have the desired effect. Spurs played on Liverpool's nerves, although Karius, who remains an inconsistent presence, could hardly have expected his punch - when perhaps he should have caught - to be returned into the top corner of his net with such spectacular interest by Wanyama. Liverpool, and indeed Anfield, were suddenly on edge but relieved when Karius saved Kane's lame penalty. Then came that dramatic exchange of goals in a chaotic finale and the points were shared. Liverpool offer so much that is good when it is measured in goals and excitement, but that nasty habit of carelessness and conceding crucial goals has still not been cured. Liverpool's supporters were waiting to celebrate a vital victory after Salah's twisting, turning run into the area in stoppage time ended with a clever finish over the onrushing Lloris. It came just after Kane had missed the chance to give Spurs the lead from the spot when his uncharacteristically poor penalty was saved by Karius. And yet the cheers stuck in the throats as referee Jon Moss - who entered lengthy consultation with his assistant before finally awarding the first Spurs penalty - waited as Van Dijk tangled with substitute Lamela, looking towards his colleague once more before pointing to the spot. The Kop exploded in fury but Kane stayed calm and made no mistake the second time, beating Karius comfortably. Klopp was desolate as he was locked in conversation with fourth official Martin Atkinson. There was barely time to restart the game and Anfield instantly vented its anger on Moss after awarded Spurs two penalties in front of the Kop. Once the drama had subsided, this was a fair result between two teams who mix high quality, intensity and attacking intent with moments of vulnerability - leaving the top four chase as tight as ever. Spurs could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Eric Dier's carelessness let in Salah as early as the third minute, instantly evoking memories of their struggles when visiting other teams in the so-called ""big six"" in recent years. Mauricio Pochettino's side have not won away in the league against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United in 11 game stretching back to a 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in February 2016. And yet they can take massive encouragement away from Anfield after the manner in which they kept their composure and played their way back into contention after Liverpool dominated the first half. Spurs kept probing and even when Salah's second looked to have condemned them to certain defeat - seemingly even more of a blow after Kane's missed penalty - they gathered themselves for one late push that earned another spot-kick and a point. Pochettino's players have been accused of fluffing their lines on occasions like this in recent times. Here they deserve great credit. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""There were so many situations to talk about but the ref's decisions decided the game so I can't help but talk about them. ""I don't understand either of the penalty situations. The first one was offside and the second, I know already what the ref and his assistant will say. There was a touch, a little touch. But Lamela has jumped into him and wanted the touch and to go down. ""If the ref kept playing at that level then fine, but in the first half he wasn't giving fouls. Then for the softest touch of the whole game he decides it is a foul. ""In the second half we had to defend like crazy, they had to chase the game. We had counter-attacks, the high pressure was good and we put in some super crosses. ""We were a bit unlucky here and there but we had enough chances to win the game. And we would have if it wasn't for those decisions."" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: ""It was an amazing game to watch - two teams that always try to play exciting football. ""I was calm because the team plays so well. The feeling is we dropped two points. We were much, much, much better than Liverpool. ""Both were a penalty and it is not controversial. Sometimes people complain about the referee, but when they are right it is good to tell everyone. ""It was important, the character. When you analyse the game, it was always under control despite conceding the first goal. When you analyse the 90 minutes, Tottenham were much better. ""We always try to give our best. The team always shows personality and character. Today was a game we played for the win, and to change history you need time."" Tottenham striker Harry Kane after scoring his 100th Premier League goal: ""I was nervous before the second penalty. It was a big moment, with a lot of pressure, but I stuck to the routine. ""There was a lot of pressure, in front of the Kop. The first one, I did everything I wanted to and the keeper made the save. You've got to take the chances. I thought the second one was a penalty; the defender took out Lamela. ""The gaffer said at half-time: Play a bit quicker. We created some chances. Victor Wanyama scored a great goal, and if I scored the first penalty we probably would have won it. But there we are. I've had a good season in front of goal so let's see how many I can get now.""

174,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43353969,Liverpool 5-0 Watford,"Mohamed Salah scored four goals as Liverpool moved up to third in the Premier League table by thrashing Watford at Anfield. Salah danced through Watford's defence to score early in the game before poking home Andy Robertson's cross late in the first half. He set up Roberto Firmino's clever flick for Liverpool's third, then added two late strikes to complete the rout. Liverpool have now opened a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth. Jurgen Klopp's side also remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. It was Watford's second successive defeat, and despite chances for Roberto Pereyra and Richarlison, they never looked like getting back into the game. But the Hornets are still eight points above the relegation zone and sit comfortably in 11th position. Before kick-off, Klopp insisted his side wanted to be back ""immediately on the winning side"" following the disappointment of their 2-1 defeat at rivals Manchester United last Saturday. And it was a more familiar-looking Liverpool side who turned up at Anfield as Klopp's men put in a performance befitting their manager's urgency. They started the game with high intensity - pressing their opponents and winning the ball back in midfield to set Salah on his way. It did not take long for the Egyptian to make a breakthrough. Within four minutes he had given Liverpool the lead and taken his season's tally to 25 in the league. Salah continued to cause Watford's defence problems and it always looked likely he and Liverpool would get a second, overtaking Harry Kane as the league's top scorer in the process. Robertson's inch-perfect cross from the left meant the second goal was a tap-in but Salah produced two moments of magic to dance his way to a hat-trick and fire in his fourth. Time seemed to stop as he evaded multiple challenges in the area and picked out the corner with a stabbed finish for his third before firing a strike high into the net for his fourth after Danny Ings' shot was saved. It was another masterclass from the Egyptian and his form mirrors Liverpool's as they head into the final stages of the season. The Reds are back up to third place in the table - with rivals Tottenham facing fifth-placed Chelsea in their next match. With seven games left to play, Liverpool look to have consolidated their place in the top four and can also look forward to a Champions League quarter-final with Manchester City. How Salah contributed to all five goals: His record-breaking stats: Miguel Britos scored a 93rd-minute equaliser for Watford as Liverpool were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw when these two teams met on the opening day of the season at Vicarage Road. Liverpool's defensive frailties - which allowed Watford back into the game in August - were on show against Manchester United last Saturday but there was none of the same at Anfield. The hosts never looked like throwing away the lead and, after scoring twice in the first half, controlled the game comfortably before Salah's late additions to the score. Salah's inclusion on the scoresheet comes as no surprise now but when he netted on his debut at Vicarage Road few would have predicted what success he would go on to have this season. Nor would many who saw that game have predicted a 5-0 rout for Watford in March but aside from two chances from Pereyra and Richarlison, they offered very little going forward at Anfield. Pereyra's fizzing free-kick hit the crossbar in the second half and could just conceivably have given the Hornets a route back into the game but, in truth, they never looked like matching their hosts. The determination the Hornets showed to come from behind in that opening fixture set the tone for a largely positive campaign which has seen them climb to 11th, eight points above the relegation zone but Saturday's thrashing will be a day to forget. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""It was very pleasing. It could have been really difficult tonight. We knew we had to be spot on from the first to the last second and our work rate had to be higher than 100%. ""The goals we scored were unbelievably good, and the boys didn't stop. That's how football should be, so I'm really happy with the performance. ""For Mo to be involved in five goals is fantastic but to score four is even more fantastic. His goals are so important for us. We have to hope they all come back well from the internationals. ""The clean sheet is very important. They lost a little concentration in the last few minutes but that's normal. It helps us in the goal difference."" Watford manager Javi Gracia, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We knew today was going to be a tough game. ""We conceded an early goal again like we did against Arsenal and after that it was difficult. We will try to do better next time. They were much better than us and congratulations to them. ""Mo Salah is one of the best players at the moment. We know we have played against one of the best teams in Europe. ""There are positives we can take, but we will try to do better next time.""

175,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409327,Bournemouth 0-4 Liverpool,"Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick against Bournemouth to send Liverpool to the top of the table - then handed his man-of-the-match award to team-mate James Milner. Former England midfielder Milner became the 13th player to make 500 Premier League appearances when he captained Liverpool against the Cherries. When handed his award after the game, Salah opted to give it to Milner and told Sky Sports: ""I will not take it. ""Congratulations on his amazing career. He deserved it today. I hope we'll win something together."" Salah scored his second hat-trick for the club since arriving from Roma 18 months ago as Jurgen Klopp's side went one point clear of Manchester City, who later suffered their first top-flight defeat of the season as they lost 2-0 at Chelsea. Salah was in an offside position when Roberto Firmino hit a 30-yard shot that home keeper Asmir Begovic carelessly pushed out in the direction of the Egypt forward. He finished clinically and his eighth top-flight goal of the season was allowed to stand to break the deadlock in a game the visitors dominated from the start. There was nothing fortuitous about the Liverpool forward's second though, a composed finish after driving at the Bournemouth defence, before Steve Cook backheeled the ball into his own net while attempting a clearance to make it 3-0. Salah then completed his hat-trick after rounding Begovic, cutting back to beat the Bournemouth keeper for a second time and poking the ball past Nathan Ake on the line. ""Whatever you do in a football game, you need somebody to finish it off and what Mo did with his two goals in the second half was exceptional,"" said Klopp after his side's fifth straight league win. Liverpool have taken 45 points from the past 51 on offer and are unbeaten in 17 league games in a run that stretches back to last season. The wins keep coming for Liverpool - and the goals are flowing once again for Salah. Having successfully negotiated a bruising night at Burnley on Wednesday, Klopp's side started a huge week by ruthlessly dismantling Bournemouth. Salah goes into Tuesday's Champions League must-win group game with Napoli having marked his return to the starting line-up by emphatically ending a three-match run without a goal. Bournemouth have every right to feel disgruntled about the former Chelsea player's first, with television replays clearly showing Salah was offside when Firmino struck the shot that Begovic spilled into his path. Yet the hosts can have few complaints about his second or third. Despite Cook's attempt to bring him down, Salah stayed on his feet to drive at Bournemouth's defence before producing a neat finish into the corner via a slight deflection off Ake. Cook's troubled game continued when the Bournemouth defender inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net following a cross by Andy Robertson, before Salah completed the rout. After shrugging Cook off the ball following substitute Adam Lallana's long punt forward, Salah dribbled into the box before tormenting Begovic and slotting home. After the game, Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Salah as ""one of the best in the world"". ""Salah looked very good, razor sharp and we struggled to handle him. He played more centrally and did well from that position,"" he said. While the headlines belong to Salah, Liverpool overcame the absences of injured defensive trio Joe Gomez, Dejan Lovren and Nathaniel Clyne to record a 10th Premier League clean sheet of the season before next Sunday's visit of Manchester United to Anfield. Bournemouth started the weekend seventh in the table - level on points with sixth-placed Everton - and with plaudits ringing in Howe's ears. Their climb from League Two to the fringes of European qualification in 10 seasons is nothing short of phenomenal, but the Cherries were second best all over the pitch against Liverpool. This scenario is becoming a familiar story for the Dorset club against the league's leading sides. Howe's team are regularly praised for producing attractive, progressive football - but their record against the top-six teams is extremely poor. Since the start of 2017-18, Bournemouth have lost 15 times in 17 games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United. The bad news is they still have to face Tottenham and United - both away - in the league this month. They were not helped by the absence of leading scorer Callum Wilson because of a hamstring injury, but the England striker would not have helped their defence - now without a clean sheet in seven league and cup games - contain Liverpool. This was a momentous day for Milner. With Jordan Henderson on the bench, Milner captained Liverpool to victory in a game in which his statistics were again impressive. Having covered 12.57 kilometres at Burnley in midweek - more than any other player on the pitch - the 32-year-old clocked up another 11.73 filling in at right-back against Bournemouth. There was one nervous moment when his misplaced first-half pass required Alisson to dash out of his goal to head clear - and in doing so, taking out Joshua King. But Milner was otherwise a reassuring presence in the back four, demonstrating his value to Klopp with his ability to move from midfield to full-back and give youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold a rest with Gomez injured. In fact the Yorkshireman found himself in the Bournemouth half as often as he was his own as he played a significant part in the 238th top-flight win of his career. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: ""I have many complaints. He [Salah] was offside [for the first goal]. It has a huge bearing on the match. We were fine until that moment. It changes the game. ""It was difficult for us losing Callum Wilson. We have to deal with players who aren't here and can't use that as an excuse. We still had a competitive team on the pitch. ""The first goal is key and then we made some mistakes at bad times. ""At half-time I thought we were well in this match. I expected a very different second half. We just had to manage the scoreline. It is a tough league. We are disappointed as it's another game that has gone away from us."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""It is clear that everyone knows about the quality of Bournemouth. ""We had to keep the ball and win the ball back as quickly as possible. We did both very often but not always as they had their moments too, of course. ""I don't know if it was offside. I've not watched it back but we improved in the second half and controlled the game. It was really nice. Mo Salah scores that goal [the second one] and I don't think many do in that situation. ""The third goal was again brilliant. It is really cool and it helps of course! We played nice football and the players we brought on did really well.""

176,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47742713,Southampton 1-3 Liverpool: Reds return to the top of Premier League table,"Mohamed Salah scored a brilliant solo goal as Liverpool came from behind to beat Southampton at St Mary's and return to the top of the Premier League. Liverpool were in danger of dropping vital points with the score level at 1-1 with 10 minutes remaining, before Salah clinically ended his run of six league games without a goal. With Southampton defenders backing off, the Egyptian ran half the length of the pitch before firing past Angus Gunn with his left foot. Liverpool substitute Jordan Henderson sealed victory late on with a close-range finish. Shane Long had handed Saints an early lead with a composed strike from inside the area but Naby Keita headed the visitors level with his first goal for the club before the break. The result sees the Reds leapfrog Manchester City yet again - the 25th time the lead has changed hands this season. Liverpool have a two-point gap at the top, although defending champions City have a game in hand with six matches left to play. Southampton remain in 16th place, just five points above the relegation zone. Jurgen Klopp's side have the best away record in the league but they got off to a poor start when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's flick-on found an unmarked Long to finish well inside the area. Southampton executed their game plan well after taking the lead by defending deep as Liverpool attempted to play through them. Their biggest threat came from wide areas and the right foot of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who delivered a sensational cross for Keita to convert off the back of Jannik Vestergaard. The Reds continued to dominate the ball after the break with 70% possession but they were limited to just one shot on target before Salah struck his 50th Premier League goal in 69 appearances. Only Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy have reached the landmark in fewer matches. Salah was influential as Liverpool secured three points in injury time against Tottenham in their last outing, and their persistence in the latter stages of matches is no fluke. Liverpool have scored 20 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season, more than any other side, and they have also won a league-leading 16 points from losing positions. If the Reds are to deliver a first league title since 1990, their undying spirit at the death could tip the balance in their favour. Southampton remain five points clear of the danger zone but they were poised to claim a surprise point against the title challengers. Ralph Hasenhuttl has turned the tide since taking charge at St Mary's and the hosts produced a disciplined defensive display to limit a side that has scored 85 goals to just five shots on target. Vestergaard and Maya Yoshida made 10 clearances apiece, while the latter epitomised the Southampton mentality when he leapt off the ground to block Roberto Firmino's shot with the goal at his mercy. However, with the game in the balance and Liverpool struggling to carve out many clear-cut opportunities, the home defence backed off and gave Salah the room he needed to strike the decisive blow. On-loan Saints striker Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, was replaced in the Southampton line-up by Irishman Long, who was making his first league start since February. Long handed his side the perfect start when he also struck his 50th Premier League goal with a cool finish as the visitors started slowly. Only five teams have scored fewer goals than Southampton this season, but with Ings set to return and Long back among the goals, they are well placed to pick up the results needed to stay in the top flight. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: ""I knew it would be difficult. Southampton have been well-organised. We scored two wonderful goals. ""The season is intense for everyone. You have an opportunity to make really good changes - Milner and Henderson helped. They were aggressive in a really important way. You could see them pushing the boys. ""Southampton had to suffer in the second half because of the first-half tempo. Difficult away game, 3-1 is a perfect result. ""What a goal [from Salah]. He couldn't pass because Firmino couldn't get into the right position. The defender could not concentrate on Mo. Wow, what a goal. A good moment. Naby Keita's first goal for the club in a crucial moment."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to BBC Sport: ""We saw a very interesting game today. Our team scored very early so it was a long way to the end to get a point or three. ""We showed it is not so easy if we have a plan and surprise them and can cause problems against the big teams. They know this, believe in this and the guys showed up. ""There was a crucial chance for Shane Long for 2-0 and then it would be very interesting, they were struggling at that point. Then we would have had a chance for a point. ""Their first goal was offside and the second we did not react well. We cannot make such a mistake from this position. They have a counter from our shot and it was too easy. We showed in the second half we are brave and we wanted to win the game. ""We have to pay attention and not fear the moment. The team believes, that is important, and know now that teams are coming where we must take the points.""

177,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59426151,Fulham 1-1 Bournemouth: Late Adarabioyo header keeps Whites top of Championship,"Tosin Adarabioyo's first goal for Fulham ensured his side shared the points with Bournemouth in a meeting of the Championship's top two. The defender glanced home substitute Tom Cairney's cross with six minutes remaining to keep his team one point clear in first place. Dominic Solanke had scored his 17th goal of the season six seconds into the second half to put Bournemouth ahead. But they could not hang on to give manager Scott Parker a winning return to his old club. It is now three successive draws for Marco Silva's Fulham, whereas Bournemouth have won only one of their past six games following a blistering start to the season. However, before the rest of the weekend's games, there is an eight-point gap between the Cherries and third-placed QPR. With the Championship season almost at its halfway point, there was genuine excitement ahead of the meeting of the division's two outstanding teams so far and they did not disappoint with an enthralling encounter. No side had scored more than Fulham's 49 goals, while they and Bournemouth shared the joint best defensive record - along with West Brom - with just 16 conceded. There was the added spice, too, of Parker returning to the club he left in the summer after more than two years in charge with both promotion and relegation on his CV from his time at Craven Cottage. The tempo was high from the off with Adam Smith testing Marek Rodak for the visitors and Neeskens Kebano twice forcing saves out of Mark Travers at the other end all inside the first 10 minutes. In a game littered with intrigue and sub-plots, the Championship's top two strikers were also on the field in Aleksandar Mitrovic and Solanke. Solanke is having his best ever season for goals and he twice nearly gave Bournemouth the lead, but the 24-year-old was just off target on both occasions. But as a pulsating half ended, Fulham looked certain to score, only for visiting captain Steve Cook to make two sensational goalbound blocks in the same attack, from Mitrovic and then Fabio Carvalho. Solanke's goal straight from the restart caught the home side cold as he latched on to Philip Billing's lofted pass in what appeared to be a training ground move. Fulham were stunned and took time to respond before they turned up the pressure on the visitors' goal, with Travers called upon to deny Kebano and Mitrovic. But with six minutes left, Adarabioyo found the net for the first time since a goal on loan for Blackburn in June 2020 to claim a point their efforts deserved. It was an excellent advert for the Championship and on this evidence, both sides will be favourites to claim the two automatic promotion slots in May. Fulham manager Marco Silva told BBC Radio London: ""I think everyone who saw the game will think we deserved more from it. We were the best team on the pitch definitely. ""They tried to surprise us a bit with a change of formation, but we got the message across early and dealt with it and went into half-time the stronger side. ""We had a clear penalty not given and many, many times these decisions are going against us so hopefully one day, they will start to go our way. ""We switched off for two seconds at the start of the second half and we can't concede a goal like that at this level. ""But I was impressed that we never gave up, we kept fighting, kept creating chances and we deserved more than we got from the game. ""They fought and fought and did well, Steve Cook was tremendous for them, like a second goalkeeper with those blocks in the first half. But we know we should've put some of the chances we had away."" Bournemouth manager Scott Parker told BBC Radio Solent: ""We've come here with a group of players and some of them only off the back of just one day's training. Gary Cahill and Adam Smith have been out for a while, but we're a little bit desperate at the moment and we're struggling in that sense. ""We go ahead and then they put us under immense pressure from that point onwards and we weren't quite able to hold out. ""There's elements of the performance you want to improve so early in the process, but overall, I'm incredibly proud of my team and each and every one of them. ""I know the situation in-house at this moment in time and some of those boys out there put their hand up when I get that it wasn't ideal. ""Steve Cook epitomised everything that we needed to do tonight, Mark Travers and Cahill too. ""I said before the game that we would need to weather it and it would be painful at times, but they put it in. ""The goal was straight off the training ground. We worked on it on Thursday to try to work out where they were weak and sometimes they don't always come to fruition on the stage. ""But tonight, there's nothing more pleasing that it came off. We wanted to try to exploit the spaces between full-back and centre-half on transitions and the areas where Dominic Solanke was popping up, and it worked.""
