Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday. ",positive

City have not won the competition despite spending more than £1bn and lifting 16 trophies since the 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group. Pep Guardiola's side have a 4-3 lead against Real Madrid heading into the semi-final second leg on Wednesday. ""I think it would change the perspective from outside,"" De Bruyne said. ""We have not won it but winning it would change that little narrative."" Following their defeat by Chelsea last year, City could make their second successive final if they get past the Spanish champions. ""The fact we've been fighting for numerous years and getting to the latter stages means we've been doing really well,"" Belgium midfielder De Bruyne added. ""It's a cup competition and the quality is very high so it's very difficult to win it."" Manager Guardiola has previously said he needs to win the competition with City otherwise his time at the club will be judged as a ""failure"".. ",positive
2,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

3,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season. ""Let's look forward to that, rather than dwell on a poor performance - they were good, but we weren't aggressive, didn't defend our box well and in the end felt a bit a sorry for ourselves.""

4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61293998,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: 'Pickford's saves have kept their dreams alive',"With an unbroken run in England's top flight stretching back to 1954, Everton aren't about to give up their status among the elite without a fight. Their critical 1-0 win over Chelsea was a full-blooded football spectacle, with fireworks and smoke bombs playing cameo roles. But aside from Richarlison's winner, the leading star was Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford thanks to two second-half saves worthy of their own script. When England's number one somehow denied Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger in quick succession, Goodison Park rose in unison to cheer his efforts with a noise almost as loud as a goal. That was recognition of what was at stake, by a crowd who played a massive part in a blood-and-thunder victory, which closed the gap on Leeds and Burnley to two points. Everton started the day five points from safety as they attempted to maintain their 68-year stay in the top-flight. Some pundits have debated whether they would be the biggest club to go down from the Premier League, given their history. And, with Frank Lampard's side staring relegation in the face, it was apt that Pickford used his to deny Rudiger with a point-blank save. ""Pickford's saves have kept Everton's dreams alive,"" former Everton midfielder Leon Osman said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That [Azpilicueta] save was incredible. Pickford has been criticised in the past because he has a tendency to do something rash. But not today. It was arguably his best-ever game for Everton in Everton's most important game of the season. ""If Everton had lost today you would have felt they were out of the Premier League and the fans knew how important this was."" That much was emphasised by thousands of fans lining the streets in the approach to Goodison Park to welcome the team bus. Blue flares wafted down Goodison Road as supporters sang about the ""Grand Old Team"" whose Premier League status looked anything but impressive. It might have even explained the decision for some fans to create their own firework display in front of the Chelsea team hotel on Saturday night, although Thomas Tuchel said his side were unaffected by the noise despite the German boss, and midfielder Jorginho, saying it woke them up. But in a season where Everton have not won away since August, the atmosphere once again dragged the team to new heights and underlined how big a role the fans will play. Lampard said of the escort from fans: ""The feeling it gave the players, to make them understand what it means to the fans, was special. ""If it doesn't give you goosebumps, if it doesn't get you ready to go out and give everything, then you shouldn't be playing the game. ""The fans were the 12th man, they were the people of the match. The men, the women, the children that came and did that before the game, in the warm up, at the start of the game and also to get us over the line late in the game, was huge."" Seamus Coleman, who alongside Yerry Mina epitomised Everton's aggressive approach against Chelsea, added: ""I have been here a long time but never felt like I did coming into the stadium today."" Lampard said he would leave it to fans whether they replicated it for their remaining home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace. But he said it ""definitely helped"" and also highlighted how improving his side's away form would be a crucial factor in staying up, given they have trips to Leicester, Watford and Arsenal to come. Part of that may come from taking a harder approach with his players, which he admitted prior to only his fourth Premier League win in 13 games since he was appointed. That included ""prodding"" Richarlison about how he needed to be more ""clinical"" alongside his pressing, with the Brazilian rewarding Lampard with a ninth goal of the season after harrying Azpilicueta into a mistake. ""I think it was an important moment to talk [to the players] about the reality of the situation because there's different ways you can go about it,"" Lampard added. ""You can keep telling the players to believe and there are other times where we're going, 'hang on, the demands are this'. ""To be good lads and show good effort is not enough for us to stay in this league because we knew what the table said before this game. ""So my feeling was that we needed the extra bit of discipline, the extra bit of tension and, to be fair, the players have delivered that."" There is sure to be more tension as Everton try to keep their hopes alive, but Lampard said: ""My feeling is there's a long way to go in this. ""We can control our games, but we can't control Burnley or Leeds. And as much as we sit and stare at our phones and analyse their remaining games, it won't make a difference unless we do our thing."" ",positive
5,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61238706,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Classic Champions League tie a genuine gold standard match,"Carlo Ancelotti's last visit to Manchester City ended in a 5-0 humiliation in what proved to be the final match of his tenure as Everton manager. When the legendary Italian manager, 62, turned to his Real Madrid backroom staff with arms outstretched and gave an anxious glance down at his watch with City 2-0 up after only 11 minutes on his return to Etihad Stadium, he was probably fearing a similar scoreline. City were flying. Real were overwhelmed. This was shaping up as a one-sided mauling for the great old Champions League campaigner chasing the trophy for a historic fourth time. And yet, to the disbelief of pretty much everyone who witnessed a gold standard classic of a football match, Ancelotti was pitchside after the game smiling, eyebrow raised in trademark fashion suggesting he was rather happy to come away with a 4-3 first leg loss. He did not look as mystified as others at the fact that Real were still in with a shout of reaching yet another Champions League Final. City's players were not exactly deflated - how could they be after such a brilliant performance and a semi-final first leg win? However, their body language gave away the brutal fact that they should have had this tie all wrapped up heading into the second leg in the Bernabeu. This was a breathless night, everything that is good about football at this rarified level and City were, at times, magical. And yet... The Bernabeu does strange things in the Champions League and, while City are unlikely to endure the same physical onslaught Atletico Madrid subjected them to in the quarter-final second leg, they will face a severe test with just a one-goal lead. City let Real off the hook and history tells us this can be a very expensive mistake. Ancelotti, as well as many of this Real squad, have been over this course and distance before though they will also know they were ripped to shreds for long periods of this game. But they will also have serious belief they can go through to face either Liverpool or Villarreal in Paris. The good news for City is that, despite the narrow scoreline, there were times when they outclassed Real, with Luka Modric unable to exert his usual influence in midfield. City were quicker, slicker, better, more threatening. This is the knowledge they will pack with them on the flight to Madrid. And yet... Who knows what sort of lead it takes to finish Real off, backed by the Bernabeu crowd and such a rich history in this competition? Every big night in the grand old arena is accompanied by sense of destiny. A glimpse of Guardiola's mindset came with City two goals up and Real pretty much floored. The Spaniard flew into a full-on rage in his technical area when Riyad Mahrez committed the cardinal sin in this manager's book by being too greedy, lashing a shot into the side-netting with Phil Foden waiting unattended in the middle and the goal at his mercy. At 3-0 it could have been job done. ""Riyad. Riyad"", Guardiola shouted before continuing the fume. He knows you simply cannot give Real a break and the Spanish giants proved that. City had a two-goal advantage on three occasions, played wonderful, fluent football but will know there should be no need of those nagging doubts that might have been felt at the final whistle.
