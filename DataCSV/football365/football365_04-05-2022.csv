The Reds won the first leg 2-0 at Anfield but went into the break on Tuesday night level on aggregate after a disastrous opening 45 minutes. Pursuit of history creates its own stress as Liverpool Quad-chasers survive Villarreal scare However, Klopp’s side outplayed their opponents in the second half to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate. Liverpool will face Real Madrid or Premier League rivals Manchester City in the Champions League final in Paris as they chase an unprecedented quadruple. “It is outstanding,” Klopp told BT Sport. “We made it pretty tricky for ourselves. We knew before that these kind of things can happen. In life it is always about how you react when things don’t go your way. A goal conceded after two or three minutes is obviously the opposite of what you wanted. Momentum on their side.

They put us under pressure, man for man all over the pitch. “We did not play football at all. I told the boys ‘they have momentum but they don’t own it, we can get it back’. We had to play in the spaces and force our way into a game that did not start well. All of a sudden, when we broke the lines and found spaces and were more flexible and not fixed on positions, all of a sudden we were in the game. We scored goals and made it happen. “The thing at half-time is that we knew what was wrong, it was obvious, but we did not have a situation to show when it was right. We were calm. If Villarreal play the second half like they play the first and we do the same they will be in the final. But we are still here so I think we could give it a try. This is what we did. “Yes I will watch it [the other semi-final]. Whoever it will be it will be massive. Whoever wins tomorrow will enjoy it and then face each other in Paris.”  ",positive

While the three-goal cushion may look comfortable this was a test of their nerve and powers of recovery as an awful first half by their standards saw their first-leg advantage wiped out by debut goals in the competition from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. Pursuit of history creates its own stress as Liverpool Quad-chasers survive Villarreal scare But the half-time introduction of £37.5million January signing Luis Diaz, who has reinvigorated 2022 for Jurgen Klopp’s side, changed the game – aided and abetted by a distinctly ordinary goalkeeping performance from the hosts’ Geronimo Rulli. The Argentinian had a hand – or lack of one – in all of Liverpool’s three goals from Fabinho, Diaz and Sadio Mane in 12 second-half minutes and was culpable for at least two. Villarreal’s misery was completed when Etienne Capoue was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Curtis Jones late on. Incredibly this was the first European semi-final away leg the 2019 winners had won since 1985, having lost the last four and conceded 11 goals in total yet still progressed on three occasions. 👋🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/eaqKMWv7Zy — Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 3, 2022 Thunderstorms on Monday night had given way to persistent rain throughout matchday – causing some localised flooding – and while that may have dampened the surface inside Estadio de la Ceramica it did not affect the atmosphere. Klopp had warned his side would have to suffer in parts of this tie but he could not have expected that to start so early and last for so long. The La Liga side, conquerors of Juventus and Bayern Munich, did not manage a shot on target at Anfield last week but scored with their first here in only the third minute. Pervis Estupinan’s cross was met at the far post by Capoue, whose mis-hit shot found Dia to score into an unguarded net. Villarreal were hoping to become just the second side to overturn a two-goal first-leg deficit in a semi-final, after Liverpool’s famous comeback from 3-0 down against Barcelona in 2019 – and their opponents gave them every encouragement. Boosted by the return of striker Gerard Moreno, they were aggressive and direct but the manner in which the visitors failed to handle that was startling. Naby Keita was preferred to captain Jordan Henderson after a good goalscoring performance at Newcastle on Saturday, but this was surely an occasion to be controlled not cavalier.  Liverpool were overrun in midfield, which was not entirely Keita’s fault, and their failure to string any significant sequence of passes together only contributed to the chaotic nature of their performance. Even when they did get in behind the Villarreal defence, Jota’s touch was heavy from Mohamed Salah’s through-ball and gave Rulli enough of a chance to reach it. He did not claim cleanly but Salah’s follow-up challenge was deemed a foul. Prior to this game Klopp’s side had been behind for only 57 minutes in 2022 but by the break they had not only trailed for 42 minutes but were even further behind. They were lucky to escape conceding a penalty when Keita’s misplaced back-pass straight to Moreno set up Giovani Lo Celso but he ran the ball too close to Alisson and the goalkeeper was given the benefit of the doubt as the ball hit him just before the player went over him. But the second goal came four minutes from the interval when Capoue’s inviting cross to the far post was met by Coquelin, who out-jumped Alexander-Arnold to float a header into the top corner. Swapping Diaz for Jota for the second half made an immediate improvement, allowing Mane to play centrally where he has done well recently. And as Liverpool started to build pressure, Alexander-Arnold had a long-range shot deflected onto the crossbar while Diaz acrobatically volleyed wide from Mane’s cross.

The two-goal cushion was restored five minutes later when Diaz’s downward header from a left-footed Alexander-Arnold cross was only half-saved and Liverpool’s tumbling Colombia international inadvertently turned it in. But Rulli’s eventful night was not over as when he charged 20 yards outside his area to meet the onrushing Mane, the Senegal international side-stepped him then took the ball wider to avoid the recovering defender before rolling the ball into an open goal. Liverpool are into a third final of the season, having won the Carabao Cup and facing Chelsea in the FA Cup a week on Saturday, and this victory means they will have played every game available to them in their fixture calendar. The relentless pursuit of a quadruple – and a seventh European Cup – rolls on.  ",negative

The Holland international has been excellent for the Anfield club since joining from Southampton for £76m in January 2018. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Liverpool reached the Champions League final in his first season at the club before winning the competition the following campaign. Van Dijk was also crucial as the Reds won their first Premier League title in 2019/20 andis now regarded as one of the best central defenders to play in the top flight of English football. Prior to Liverpool’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Villarreal on Tuesday evening, Rio Ferdinand and Owen were high in praise of the 30-year-old. Ferdinand said that Van Dijk “is the best centre-back on the planet right now, easy” before the former Reds striker weighed in with an extremely bold claim. “Well I’d go further. I think he’s the best centre-half of all time,” he said (quotes via Metro) ""I just felt happy to be in the conversation."" 🤷‍♂️ ""Virgil Van Dijk is the best centre back on the planet right now."" 🔝🌎@themichaelowen shares why he thinks Liverpool's rock at the back is even better than prime @rioferdy5…#UCL pic.twitter.com/WtuyENlZjJ — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 3, 2022 Asked what makes him better than other centre-halves, Owen continued: “He probably scored a few more goals, not much, but we’re talking about the greatest here. “As I’ve said, Rio was the best centre-half I ever played with. But with Van Dijk, as a centre-forward, I look at him and think: what do you do against him? “He’s bigger than everyone, he’s faster than everyone, he’s stronger than everyone, he’s brilliant on the ball, he scores goals. I’ve never seen anything like it. “The only thing that goes against Van Dijk at the moment – and I stress, at the moment – is his winners’ medals. He’s only won one Premier League and one Champions League. “People like Rio and [Paolo] Maldini and [Franco] Baresi and people like that who you might consider the greatest, they’ve all got numerous. So that’s the only thing that goes against him. “But as a one off, I look at him and think: how can you get any better than that?”  ",positive

Substitute Moore settled a tension-filled game with a neat finish from a superbly-worked free-kick to seal second place for Scott Parker’s men after two years in the second tier of English football. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Forest, who needed a win to leapfrog the Cherries in the table, will now have to try to end their 23-year top-flight exile via the play-offs. Bournemouth started the game brightly with Philip Billing forcing a good save from Forest goalkeeper Brice Samba in only the fourth minute. Billing’s curling effort – after cutting in from the left – looked destined for the far corner before Samba flung himself down to push the ball behind for a corner. The Cherries received a pre-match boost when their Wales midfielder David Brooks announced on social media that he was cancer free. Brooks was given a standing ovation from the home fans in the seventh minute – in honour of their number seven, who was watching on from the executive boxes. Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Djed Spence set Sam Surridge through on goal with a sublime defence-splitting pass. 𝗪𝗘'𝗥𝗘 𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞 😍 pic.twitter.com/s0yHgUJRyG — AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) May 3, 2022 Surridge, a product of Bournemouth’s youth academy, let his former side off the hook by hammering his shot against the crossbar with goalkeeper Mark Travers beaten. Bournemouth had a massive let off three minutes before half-time when Travers brought down Surridge inside the 18-yard box. Travers was saved from conceding a penalty by the assistant referee’s offside flag, but TV replays showed Surridge had timed his run to perfection. Bournemouth had the first meaningful effort of the second half when top-scorer Dominic Solanke fired into the side-netting from Ryan Christie’s through-ball. The home side were forced into a change on the hour when midfielder Jefferson Lerma hobbled off to be replaced by striker Moore. Billing came close to breaking the deadlock in the 66th minute after outmuscling Ryan Yates on the edge of his own penalty area, but could only fire against the legs of Samba from a tight angle. Moments later former Bournemouth captain Steve Cook made a heroic block to guide Christie’s effort away from goal after the Scotland international had broken free in the area. The Cherries were by now firmly on top and Samba was called into action again 20 minutes from time to push away Jaidon Anthony’s stinging effort. The home side got the goal their efforts deserved seven minutes from time.

The home fans spilled onto the pitch at full-time after their side survived eight long minutes of injury time to seal their top-flight comeback.  ",positive

Despite the arrival of Dan Burn from Brighton in January, the Magpies are expected to bring in at least one new central defender in the summer. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? They have been linked with numerous players – including Sevilla’s Diego Carlos and Lille’s Sven Botman, who were top targets in the winter transfer window. Ciaran Clark and Federico Fernandez could leave St James’ Park this summer, with Fabian Schar recently signing a contract extension. According to Portuguese outlet Record (via Geordie Boot Boys), Newcastle are ‘insistent’ on signing Inacio from Sporting this summer. The 20-year-old recently penned a new deal lasting until 2026 but a summer sale should not be ruled out. Newcastle reportedly offered £25m to sign Inacio in January, with Sporting not interested. It is believed that they would be willing to negotiate a deal worth around€35m (£29.4m). Inacio has played 42 times across all competitions this season and scored in the Allianz Cup final as his side beat Benfica 2-1 on January 29. Gonçalo Inácio is leading the way for Primeira Liga players under 21 this season: ◉ Most attempted passes (1,160)◉ Most completed passes (1,053)◉ Most headed goals (2)◉ 91% pass accuracy A Portuguese central defender that can pass?

He said:“I think Liverpool were probably not at their best but we weren’t either and when you play these games you have to be. We competed well but lacked the quality that could have got us a goal. “It is difficult to it consistently against Liverpool as they have the quality to produce a counter-attack out of nothing. We were much more aggressive in the second half but did not have any concerted pressure in the game. “We were not at our best today but we were still in the game right to the end, so there are positives to take.

De Bruyne told a press conference ahead of Wednesday’s match in Madrid: “I think it (winning the competition) would change the perspective from outside. “Obviously as a player you want to win the trophies, and you want to win this one. But I think the fact we’ve been fighting for numerous years and getting to the latter stages means that we’ve been doing really well. “It’s a cup competition and the quality is very high so it’s very, very difficult to win it, and there’s different circumstances that happen. “I think in the end if you look back at the way we performed, or I performed over seven years with the team, we did really well.

So the consistency we have as a club has been amazing, I think pretty much as good as anybody else. But we just need to try to get over the line, and tomorrow is another step.” In 2015/16, Real Madrid knocked City out in the last four.De Bruyne, who was in his first season with City at that point, said: “I’m thinking we’re in better shape now. “I think I remember when we played that game, we didn’t have the greatest of end of seasons, and Madrid was the powerhouse at the time. I know we lost 1-0 in the end with an own-goal but I think it was a pretty boring game if I remember correctly. “I think we’re in a different shape right now, I think we’re better set up as a team, we play better and I think we have more experience in this stage, so hopefully we’ll be better prepared.” City beat Carlo Ancelotti’s men 4-3 in the first leg after an enthralling encounter at the Etihad last week.

The Blues’ owner put the club up for sale, setting a £3bn asking price while also writing off the £1.5bn debt the club owe him. Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI… However, the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Abramovich’s sanctions mean that all of his assets have been frozen with Chelsea able to operate under a special license. According to The Times, Chelsea have told the government, and rival bidders for the club’s ownership, that they want to restructure the way the Premier League club is being sold. This would include paying off debt from Chelsea’s parent company Fordsham Ltd to a Jersey-based companyCamberley International Investments, which appears to have links to Abramovich. There are, unsurprisingly, concerns over whether this will be allowed to happen due to Abramovich’s UK sanctions.

When Abramovich announced that he would put the club up for sale, he said in a statement:“I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid.” However, the oligarch is reportedly claiming that the sanctions are stopping him from writing off the debt, with the government expected to challenge him on this. Chelsea’s special licence runs out on May 31, with a sale needing to be agreed before then. It is widely expected that the government will not extend the deadline. The Raine Group and Chelsea have both expected the sale to remain on course to meet that deadline. Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly’s consortium bid is understood to have been selected as preferred bidder by the Raine Group, the New York merchant bank overseeing Chelsea’s sale. Boehly has edged ahead of bids from Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca to receive the preferred bidder status that inches the US tycoon ever closer to a takeover.

It is difficult but we have an incredible opportunity to play another final after having won LaLiga. “The mood is very good and we can do it.” Real are without key defender David Alaba through injury but the influential Casemiro is fit to feature in midfield. Casemiro’s availability, having only been fit enough for the bench last week, gives Ancelotti a selection poser over whether or not to retain the in-form Rodrygo, who has scored four goals in his last five games. Rodrygo took Casemiro’s place last week but moved into an advanced position alongside Vinicius Junior and the prolific Karim Benzema – the two goalscorers – with Federico Valverde dropping into midfield. With the experienced pair of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in the centre, Real will not lack the quality needed to prevail against a formidable City side. Modric, the former world player of the year, feels it is now a case of turning it on.

His performances on the pitch and relationship with his teammates show that,” Robinson told Football Insider. “I don’t know to what extent language is a barrier but he looks like a future captain to me. “They will not take the captaincy off of Hugo, there is no call for that but whenever he choses to leave there will be a decision to make. “If Romero is still at the club I can see him stepping up. I’m not talking about anytime in the immediate future but perhaps in a few years time.” Meanwhile, Fabrizio Ravanelli has backed Spurs to win the Premier League title next season: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especially Conte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenham has always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now with Conte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win.

Richards thinks a defeat against Real Madrid is the only thing that could “hamper” City in the fight for the Premier League: “The only thing is, if Man City were to go out in the Champions League, that could knock the confidence,” Richards told Sky Sports. “When you go into big games and you think you’re well prepared and you lose, it knocks the stuffing out of you. That’s the only thing I see hampering the rest of City’s [season].” Richards went onto praise Man City and Liverpool for the high standards they have set: “The standards that both City and Liverpool are setting now. In my opinion, two of the best teams the Premier League have ever seen – they’ve got to keep doing that. “You never know, the Premier League is so unpredictable. But I believe that both teams will win all their remaining fixtures, that’s how good they’ve been. There might be one slip-up or one nervy moment. After this week’s fixtures – Liverpool winning comfortably and City winning comfortably, I think they’ll win all of them.” Elsewhere, Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio is of the belief that Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus “will stay” this summer: “Seeing [Gabriel Jesus] playing against Real Madrid, I don’t think Guardiola will allow him to leave, even if they sign Haaland. Which they will, because they are very, very close,” Di Marzio told wettfreunde. “They still need another striker. A different type of striker. Haaland is a different type. [Gabriel Jesus] will stay because it’s difficult to find a player like him. Manchester City doesn’t need to sell a player in order to get funds to buy another player. They have the possibility to buy all the players they want. “It depends on Gabriel Jesus in the end and if he is okay with playing less with Haaland coming. It depends on his attitude, knowing another incredible striker like Haaland will arrive.” ",positive

The Citizens take a 4-3 lead to the Bernabeu tomorrow as they look to reach the Champions League final for the second time in two seasons after losing to Chelsea in last campaign’s showpiece event. John Stones, who Guardiola has confirmed will not be fit for their return leg in Madrid, started the first leg at right-back before Fernandinho filled in when the defender went off injured. Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham Joao Cancelo was suspended for the first match and Walker was injured but it now looks like they could have both available to start on Wednesday. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Guardiola said: “Joao feels good and we will see tomorrow how Kyle wakes up after training today. He trained and he is going to travel and tomorrow we will decide. He was three weeks without training but happy he is back and hopefully he will be in contention.” When asked if Real Madrid were happier after the first leg, Guardiola said: “It was a lovely open game, the fact the teams scored seven goals between them. We were happy, we could have maybe got a better result but also a lot worse. You look at it, recover the next day, analyse it in the cold light of day. “For better or worse we always knew this would be over two games. The Etihad and the Bernabeu. To knock Madrid out you have to perform well over two games.” Thought on tomorrow from @PepTeam 💭#ManCity #UCL pic.twitter.com/Xw2S84ERfa — Manchester City (@ManCity) May 3, 2022 On whether they will have to play better than the first leg, the Man City boss replied: “Probably we have to play better but I would like to tell you too: we can play much, much worse than we played and we can win. Nobody can deny my assessment is right because nobody knows. Football is unpredictable.” Real Madrid celebrated winning La Liga this week and Guardiola congratuled the Carlo Ancelotti on the job he has done this season. Guardiola added: “Congratulations to him for winning the Spanish league, I did it, he did it last week. I admire him, he’s been all over the world, big football countries and fantastic teams. Always incredibly tough, the football is really good. “Part of that is he’s an exceptional person. I met him years ago and every time with him he’s calm, controls his emotions perfectly.”  ",positive

The former Basel defender has been at Dortmund since the start of 2019. He joined them for just over £15m. Akanji has played over 150 times for the Bundesliga side over the past few years. He also shone for Switzerland at last summer’s European Championships. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football The centre-back is out of contract in 2023 and it is ‘almost impossible’ that he will stay at Dortmund beyond this season. This is according to German outlet Bild (via Sport Witness). Dortmund have already settled deals to signNiklas Sule and Nico Schlotterbeck. The report adds that Arsenal have ‘put our feelers’ for the 26-year-old. It is said that Juventus are also ‘in the running’ for his services. Bild have previously reported that Akanji ‘dreams’ of playing in the Premier League. Elsewhere, Gunners legend Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal for their treatment of their “extraordinary” defender William Saliba. Arsenal paid £27m to sign the centre-back from Saint-Etienne in 2019. He is yet to make his debut for the Gunners. After spells at Saint-Etienne and Nice, the 21-year-old joined Marseille on loan before this season. Saliba has been one of the standout players in Ligue 1 this term as he has played 49 times for Marseille across all competitions. Henry feels for Saliba as he was forced out on loan before making an error for Arsenal: “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” Henry told Amazon Prime. “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” ",negative

Lukaku returned to the Blues last summer. They paid around £97.5m to get him from Inter Milan. The 28-year-old grabbed 24 goals and eleven assists last season for Milan in Serie A. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football It was hoped that Lukaku could help Chelsea challenge for the Premier League title this season. He has struggled for the Blues though. The Belgium international has only scored five goals in 23 league games. He has fallen down the pecking order in recent weeks as he has only started 25 games across all competitions this season. The Evening Standard are reporting that Lukaku ‘will reject any interest’ from AC Milan and Newcastle United this summer. The Magpies are one of few clubs able to afford Lukaku’s fee and £300,000 a week wages, but he ‘would not entertain’ a move to Newcastle. His status at Chelsea is unclear as there are ‘major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him.’ Elsewhere, Frank Leboeuf has tipped Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic to leave the club this summer if he thinks his treatment has been “unfair”. In a tweet which has since been deleted, Mark Pulisic wrote on Twitter: “The sad thing is he [Pulisic] loves this club, teammates, and London.… puts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boy… big 6 months ahead…” And now Leboeuf thinks there is a possibility that Pulisic could leave in the summer transfer window unless he steps up his game. When asked if Pulisic could leave in the next transfer window, Lebouef told ESPN: “Yeah, it’s possible. In don’t know if it’s sad or not. “He never seems to be essential to any of the coaches, whether at Borussia Dortmund or Chelsea. “I think he has the pressure of a country behind him ahead of a World Cup because he’s the [USA] captain. But in Europe we don’t seem him as a real leader or the guy who’s going to save Chelsea. “It is what it is. He still has the time to be stronger but if he thinks it’s unfair then yeah, he should leave Chelsea. Or fight for your spot because the frontline has been a mess for more than a year.” ",negative

Having finished runners-up in last season’s Premier League and Europa League, a feeling of progress and hope was fuelled as stadiums returned to full capacities and new faces bolstered the squad. Varane was paraded in front of Old Trafford’s first full house in 17 months ahead of the season opener against Leeds and watched his new club run amok 5-1 against their rivals. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival only heightened expectation but Man Utd soon ran aground, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer exiting and interim boss Ralf Rangnick struggling to turn things around. The Old Trafford giants are set to end a poor campaign by missing out on Champions League qualification but Varane, who has won trophies aplenty with France and Madrid, is confident next season will be better. “It’s been a frustrating season,” he told the PA news agency after scoring in Monday’s 3-0 victory against Brentford. “I think it’s good to finish at home in Old Trafford with a win. “We have to keep pushing and to fight until the end for our fans, so it was a great attitude from the team and an emotional day. “We want to finish the season with something positive and we have to play for our fans and for our pride. “I think we can improve (defensively). I think we have good players and we have to defend together closer. “I think this season we were a little bit irregular and I think we can improve and do better next season. “I’m always positive and I think with a good pre-season, with good work, we can prepare well for next season and be ready to fight for every trophy. That’s the ambition of this club.” 🔺 That first-goal feeling ⚽️ 🔺 Praise for @Cristiano 🇵🇹 🔺 Looking ahead to 2022/23 💭 Get @RaphaelVarane‘s reaction to #MUNBRE 💬👇#MUFC — Manchester United (@ManUtd) May 3, 2022 Man Utd are without silverware since winning the Europa League final in 2017 against Ajax, whose current manager will be taking over at Old Trafford this summer. Ten Hag has impressed onlookers with his work in Amsterdam, where he is on course to win a third Eredivisie title and captured the imagination with their remarkable run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019. “Yeah, I played against them in the Champions League and they played very well,” Varane said with a laugh, reflecting on Ajax’s shock last-16 win at Real Madrid that season. “I’m very excited to work with him. “I’m looking forward to working with him. I think he has good experience and he’s a good person to work in this club.” Ten Hag has big some decisions to make and a dressing room culture to reshape when he takes the Old Trafford reins. Varane knows United’s defence is an area that requires improvement but believes in the quality of their central defenders and pointed to the wider consistency required to be successful. “I think we have good players, players with experience,” he said when asked about his fellow centre-backs. “I think it’s not just about the defence but the whole team. I think we can improve, we can defend better. “We can be more in control during games. Sometimes we’re able to play very well 20-30 minutes and then play bad 10 or 15 minutes. We lost a lot of points like this. “I think if we are consistent, we can improve a lot, so I think it’s a collective work we have to do.” Varane is also hoping to display his individual quality on a more consistent basis after injuries disrupted a first season at Man Utd that has not gone how anyone envisaged. “Yes, but the experience it’s amazing,” he said. “The feeling to be a United player is something special. “I am very happy to play in the Premier League and it’s a great experience. “Obviously, it’s not the result what we expected but I’m still positive and I think that the next season will be better. “I think I need a full pre-season to be fit but I think next season will be better. “I think this season was not bad but we can improve and we can do better.”  ",positive
16,https://www.football365.com/news/carragher-reveals-admiration-lampard-major-everton-tactical-change,Carragher reveals his admiration for Lampard after major Everton tactical change,"Former Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher says headmires Frank Lampard for the tactical changes he has made over the last four games at Everton. The Toffees had been on a terrible run of one Premier League win in their last seven matches before their 1-0 victory over Manchester United in early April. Including their victory over the Red Devils, they have now picked up seven points from their last four matches as they attempt to claw their way out of relegation trouble. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving And, after analysing clips since Lampard took over at Goodison Park,Carragher has been impressed by the changes the former England midfielder has made over the past four matches “I actually admire what Frank’s done in the last four games,” Carragher said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football show. “We’ve all seen Frank, he’s been at Derby, Chelsea and now at Everton. He wants to play football. We put coaches in categories, does he want to play like Pep? Or like Jose? “Jose Mourinho’s been a huge influence on his coaching career, but we’ve seen his early stages, he wants to play out the back, he wants to be almost a Pep Guardiola type of manager. “What’s happened is, they’ve gone like Jose Mourinho in the past two games. The game that scared Everton that they possibly could go down was the Burnley loss.” Carragher also used clips in Lampard’s first Premier League match against Newcastle United and their February fixture against Manchester City to demonstrate how the former Chelsea boss wanted them to play when he first came in. “When Frank first came in, he’s trying to get on the ball, making passes even round the back going through midfield that’s changed. What’s really interesting as you go further down here is that the actual attacking numbers have been pretty similar, even though they are so much down on possession. “And I think a tell-tale sign for any sort of team, how you want to how they play, is what they do when the goalkeeper gets the ball. I want to go back to Frank Lampard’s first game as a Premier League manager for Everton, it was away at Newcastle. This is three minutes in and the ball goes to Jordan Pickford. Now let’s not forget it was a pressure game, Newcastle were down there, Eddie Howe’s team like to press from the front, Frank will be well aware of that. 🗣 “[Frank Lampard] wants to be a Pep Guardiola type of manager… what’s happened is that they’ve gone more Jose Mourinho!” Part one of @Carra23‘s in-depth Everton analysis ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/uPIwzj4hFq — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “And Newcastle are not dropping off and letting Everton play. There’s the front three from Newcastle. They’re ready to go and press, they want Everton to play from the back. You see Jordan Pickford. We’re playing out from the back. Michael Keane saying: ‘Play. Don’t worry if there’s players there.’ “This is what Frank would have tried to put into them. It was a little bit different under Rafa but that’s what Frank Lampard wanted to do. This is against Man City. And the reason I wanted to show this was because similar to show the Chelsea and Liverpool, two of the top teams, one of the best pressing teams as well. “So you see Jordan Pickford play short. He doesn’t go long now tries to make a pass out wide. And again, this is one of the best teams in the world at winning the ball back, but that was the idea of Frank Lampard. “And I go back to admiring what Frank’s done in the last four games because I don’t particularly like it when managers say: ‘You never change, you always keep the same message and in the ideal world Frank will wanna play from the back and press from the front, but you can’t always do that.”  ",positive
17,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpools-pursuit-of-history-creates-its-own-stress-at-villarreal,Pursuit of history creates its own stress as Liverpool Quad-chasers survive Villarreal scare,"The Quad dream is still alive, but further scares like Villarreal are inevitable for Liverpool in the games ahead… Liverpool will now, at the very, very least, play every possible game this season as their quest for An Unprecedented Quadruple reaches its final hurdles. They have the League Cup done, and now a Champions League final to go with the FA Cup showpiece. This particular hurdle, though, proved far tougher than anyone could have expected or the final scoreline suggested. With a 2-0 first-leg lead safely in their pockets from Anfield, all Liverpool needed to do in Villarreal – which is, and you won’t hear this in the so-called mainstream media, quite a small place – was avoid disaster. For 45 minutes, they flirted dangerously with just that. Now it does need saying that in those first 45 minutes Unai Emery’s happy-go-lucky ragtag bunch of Premier League rejects were absolutely magnificent. Etienne Capoue, who would end the evening collecting the most ‘head’s gone’ second yellow of all time for a pointless lunge at Curtis Jones, was the best player on the pitch by a frankly absurd margin. He got the assists for both goals, the second scored by another familiar face in Francis Coquelin, and there were heroes in yellow all over the pitch. We’ll state with some confidence now that no current Spurs players will give Liverpool as much gip on Saturday night as Juan Foyth and Giovani Lo Celso did here. The biggest compliment one can pay Villarreal’s first-half performance is this: it made Liverpool feel what pretty much everyone else feels playing against Liverpool. Just a relentless, unending examination where no pass is unpressured or straightforward and no respite is offered. Villarreal could hardly have offered a more different display in those first 45 minutes than the passive side with no answer or apparently plan in the first leg. Yet at three-quarters distance they had got themselves level in the tie and if momentum is a thing then they held all of it.  But for all that Villarreal excellence, and for all that they played with the abandon and courage that was their only possible route out of the almost impossible position they found themselves in, this was all about Liverpool. Most prosaically, a half where Liverpool were really, properly poor. Without caveat or mitigation, they played badly. Yet while there can be no excuse for being quite as ponderously, distractedly crap as they were in that first half, there is plenty for why they weren’t Full Liverpool. A probably inevitable by-produce of trying to achieve what Liverpool are currently trying to achieve is accepting the necessity of certain nights being made more difficult than you would ideally like. When you’re trying to win every competition then, unless you happen to find yourself in a Bayern or PSG position where the league is a formality, you have to take a different approach. Liverpool can’t really afford to drop any Premier League points from here on out, so resting players or dialing down the effort in those games is fraught with risk. Just about the only time you can even potentially do it is in cup competition second legs where you have a handy advantage already. This wasn’t even a new thing in this run. Liverpool have been dominant enough and good enough in the two previous rounds that they haven’t really had to get out of second gear in the home legs against either Inter or Benfica. The results on the night in those games weren’t great, but they served Liverpool’s greater needs. Get the job done, expend as little energy as possible, move on to the next job. That’s what the plan was again here, but Liverpool took it too far and Villarreal far exceeded expectations in that captivating first half. And yet even here there lies justification for Liverpool’s approach. They could hardly have played worse in that opening 45 minutes nor Villarreal better. And yet still Liverpool were able to turn things around without ever really having to hit top gear. The second half was a completely different story to the first, with Villarreal perhaps having committed the cardinal sin of scoring too early; their gameplan simply didn’t seem to have a contingency for wiping out the two-goal deficit as fast as they did. Villarreal came out for the second half with none of the energy of the first, while Liverpool had none of the negative passivity that characterised their opening 45. Liverpool didn’t so much roar back from 2-0 down on the night to win 3-2 as saunter. However much they were helped out by some extremely generous goalkeeping for the actual goals, Liverpool never really seemed in any serious danger from the moment the second half got under way. Villarreal were held at arm’s length and even without clown school netminding you still fancy Liverpool would have got at least one goal somewhere in that second half to get the job done. And that’s what Liverpool are doing right now. They are getting the job done. It isn’t always as thrilling to watch as they are at their absurd best – although their absurd worst in the opening half was quite entertaining in its own way – but right now all that matter is doing enough without leaving yourself too exhausted to do it all again in a few days’ time. They did it tonight, they will probably continue to do so. But there will almost certainly be more scares like this in seemingly unexpected places along the way. ",positive
18,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-pochettino-nagelsmann-victims-entitlement-crisis-europe,Pochettino and Nagelsmann are both victims of football’s entitlement crisis across Europe,"Pochettino has been the subject of protests while Nagelsmann received hundreds of death threats. The biggest clubs just don’t seem very happy. The predictable finishes to some European league seasons has provoked much comment, largely about how damaging it might be for the game across the continent. But less seems to be said of whether it might be damaging for those who work at those clubs, or perhaps even the clubs themselves. Because if there’s one thing that can be said for many of these super-clubs, it’s that so many of them seem to be so unhappy for so much of the time. The appointment of Mauricio Pochettino at PSG at the start of last year was the best of appointments and the worst of appointments. Despite a failure to win any silverware with Spurs, his talents were widely acknowledged, while Pochettino got to work with some of the world’s best players, and at a club with an unlimited budget for shiny new ones. PSG have won Ligue Un at a canter this season but they tripped up again in the Champions League, and that’s where they set the bar for success now. Supporters boycotted their title celebrations. With three games of their league season left to play, they are 14 points clear at the top of the table. Meanwhile in Germany, the one-sidedness of club football is even more severe than in France. Bayern Munich have just won their tenth Bundesliga title in a row, a remarkable achievement in a country that can hardly be said to be wanting for big and storied football clubs. But again, that bar is set so high as to be almost unmanageable, as can be seen from the 450 death threats that head coach Julian Nagelsmann received after his team was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Villarreal. Bayern Munich are currently 12 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Both of these stories are particularly troubling because of the scale of the anger. In the case of PSG, the nature of their capitulation to Real Madrid in the Champions League inevitably caused anger among supporters (it was, let’s face it, embarrassing), but the fact that it’s still hanging in the air more than six weeks later surely can’t be healthy for anyone concerned. For there to be talk of Pochettino leaving after they’ve just won the league title seems ridiculous. When PSG are talked of as being ‘unmanageable’, we usually mean their expensively assembled cadre of mega-players, but when fan protests are thrown onto this bonfire as well, it looks more like the entire club. The concern is similar yet different for Bayern Munich. They should have beaten Villarreal, but the scale of such vituperation against Nagelsmann after this defeat is startling. 450 is a lot of people prepared to send death threats. Pochettino leaving PSG come the end of the season now seems inevitable, and this period will likely be considered a blot on his career, despite having won two trophies in a year and a half. Where he goes from here is just about anybody’s guess; Spurs still feels like it was an ideal fit for both parties, despite the way in which it ended before. Perhaps he could return, end this faintly absurd relationship they have with Antonio Conte in which every bad result seems to prompt him to threaten to leave the club, and Spurs can just run on vibes.  Julian Nagelsmann, meanwhile, is just 34 years old. He is at the stage in life where most players would be about to embark upon what they would hope to be a long managerial career. Nagelsmann has already been coaching to some degree for 12 years, and has been managing for six. He has shown no inclination towards leaving Bayern, but where do either party go if the modern management meat-grinder spits him up and chews him out by the time he’s, say, 37 or 38? Bayern Munich’s longest-ever serving coach was Udo Lattek, at eight years and 295 days, and it took him two spells at the club to achieve that. Do those 450 who sent those death threats have a better solution than Julian Nagelsmann for Bayern Munich? If they feel strongly enough about it to send a death threat, perhaps they should run for the club’s board. After all, Bayern are 82% fan owned. This unhappiness seems to be almost everywhere. In England, a bomb threat was made to the Manchester United defender Harry Maguire. In Scotland, fans protested the idea of a Rangers vs Celtic ‘friendly’ in Australia to a point at which the idea was abandoned. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus still seem to be trying to push through a European Super League, whether anyone else wants one or not. And if we strip away what people are so angry about and whether they’re right or wrong, it surely can’t be doing anyone much good that so many people feel this way. Furthermore, as that bar continues to rise, as expectations continue to grow, the number of Champions League trophies that can be given out at the end of each season remains exactly the same. Perhaps it really is as simple as that it’s all become too easy and that this feeds boredom, and consequently anger. There have been plenty of times throughout the history of PSG when the club would have given anything to be anywhere near the top of Ligue Un, while it’s not difficult to see how it might be difficult for Bayern Munich supporters to get anything like as excited about their tenth consecutive Bundesliga title as they did over their first. In England, there remains just enough plurality to give an illusion of competition, but even that now seems restricted to two – at a push, three – clubs. Manchester City and Liverpool have each other to keep themselves competitive, and that seems to be paying dividends in the Champions League. But Liverpool’s success has been despite a huge degree of inequality, and Manchester City have the bottomless pockets of Abu Dhabi to fall back upon. There are few guarantees that Liverpool will be able to keep up with City indefinitely. Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann will never struggle for work; they are elite-level coaches and it shouldn’t be necessary to worry about their future prospects. But we should worry about a football culture that is simultaneously narrowing the horizons of what it means to be successful while making it prohibitively expensive to try to achieve it. The blunt instrument of the accumulation of trophy players hasn’t been enough to deliver a Champions League trophy for PSG, and winning the Bundesliga repeatedly doesn’t seem to have done much for Bayern Munich in this competition either. They’ve won it once in the last nine years. But perhaps the point is that once in nine years should be enough for one club in a pan-continental tournament. If football needs a reset, perhaps that should be the first aim – to lower expectations, to make football feel more competitive again, and to make silverware feel like something that has to really be earned than something that just falls into your lap every May. To return some rarity value. It’s true to say that this level of anger is at least as much a reflection of an increasingly angry world as it is of football in splendid isolation, but that doesn’t mean that the game itself shouldn’t work harder to try and mitigate it. Because setting these increasingly unmeetable expectations for clearly talented coaches such as Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann and then becoming incandescent when they can’t achieve them doesn’t seem to be doing anybody any good.

We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

20,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-career-mino-raiola-demonstrated-absurdities-modern-football,The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football,"Raiola was loved by his clients and made himself a lot of money, but the influence of agents in remains at best mixed for the game. In the end, he died as he lived: bullish to his final breath and shrouded in controversy. At a human level, the death of Mino Raiola at the age of 54 is obviously a tragedy, and a sobering reflection upon how fragile life can be. And that shouldn’t be forgotten as we pause to reflect upon his life. But he was also one of the most divisive figures in one of the most divisive part of football’s universe, and that cannot be ignored either. Even his actual passing had an air of hyperreality. His death was first reported in the Italian press early on Thursday morning, only to be contradicted by a tweet from Raiola’s official account which read: ‘Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in four months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate.’ Later the same day, Jose Fortes Rodriguez, a close colleague, told reporters that “he’s in a bad position, but he hasn’t died”. But on Saturday afternoon, his death was confirmed; this time the confirmation came from his official Twitter account and there have been no subsequent contradictions. Raiola inspired polarised opinions and this is hardly surprising. In one respect, he fitted a stereotype: overweight, usually wearing shades and jogging bottoms, seldom (if ever) seen in a suit, and more often than not with a mobile phone pressed to the side of his face. And he was famously abrasive, with a tendency to berate anybody who got in the way of him negotiating the best deal possible for his clients or those who criticised him. He certainly seemed plenty aware of this perception. When he decided to purchase a property in Miami, he spent €9m on the former home of Al Capone. But he also polarised opinion because he was amongst the most successful agents, at least in terms of making himself a lot of money. It’s always been the case that the transfer of an elite-level player can change the course of a club’s history, and the growing influence of agents as power-brokers within the game has had a strange effect on others. Raiola found his name being sung by fans of clubs desperate to sign his clients, but has also found himself being criticised live on television in post-match discussions. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the players with whom he was most closely associated and a player with a similarly abrasive way of dealing with the outside world, was a close personal friend. Those who criticise agents as ‘leeches taking money out of the game’ (or variants thereupon) are almost missing the point; in this day and age, agents are very much part of the game and its inner workings. Consider, for example, the influence of Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the club having won promotion to the Premier League and established themselves in the top half of the Premier League, with European football under their belt. We might not like the fact that agents hold this much influence, but it doesn’t make it any less true. But the career arc of Paul Pogba does ask questions of whether the influence of the agent is always beneficial to the player concerned. Pogba won four Serie A titles in a row by the time he was 23 with Juventus, but his £89m sale to Manchester United in 2016 has seen his career stall (at least at club level), and it remains likely that he will be leaving Old Trafford at the end of this season with just a Europa League and a Carabao Cup medal to show for the six prime years of his career, although who might now be representing him now is unknown. But the facts are stark. Manchester United didn’t get anything like what they were expecting from him and the player doesn’t seem to have had an especially happy time there, but Raiola was reported to have earned himself €27m from the deal.  Right to the very end, Raiola was understood to be working feverishly to complete the transfer of Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but his death comes with this contract not having been completed and there were even reports that Manchester City had visited him in hospital to get it over the line. What happens to that deal now – or to any of his clients – is a question for another day, but with the end of the season and the opening of another transfer window on the horizon, that other day will have to come sooner rather than later. There is a case for saying that agents are good for football. Players need representation when contracts are being signed, and few would question that they would be highly vulnerable to exploitation if that representation didn’t exist. And there’s a case for saying that redistributing football’s vast wealth to players is better than it staying in the hands of those who run clubs, even if the distribution of those wages isn’t particularly even. And even criticism of the Paul Pogba career arc should be tempered by the fact that Pogba never asked Raiola to stop representing him. If the player thinks the agent is doing a good job, that’s all that matters, right? Well… not quite. What the life and death of Mino Raiola exposes is the absurdity of modern football, a world in which an agent will have their name sung from the rafters if he brings a client to your club but is a game-sucking leech if he doesn’t; a world in which transfers are often treated as more important than matches, in which being abrasive and obnoxious is perfectly okay, so long as that person is throwing shade upon someone else that you disagree with; a world in which grotesque inequalities and the commoditisation of people – including children – are simply accepted as if there’s nothing that can be done about them, and in which millions of not-very-wealthy people pay substantial money in season ticket money and pay-TV subscriptions, only for a fair proportion of it to end up with already very wealthy people who often seem to love football while holding it in contempt. There’s every possibility that, wherever he is right now, Mino Raiola is having a good old laugh to himself over the absurdity of it all – including the reporting of both of his deaths – and he’d be absolutely right.

21,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-premier-league-worst-xi-leeds-brentford-wolves-newcastle,"Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI…","Four Leeds players make the worst XI of the Premier League weekend, joined by three Wolves, three Bees and a Magpie. It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

Liverpool won 2-0 at Anfield last week when they faced the Spanish side in the first leg. Pervis Estupinan scored an own goal before Sadio Mane got their second. The Reds won again at the weekend. This came against Eddie Howe’s in-form Newcastle United side. Naby Keita netted the winner in the 19th minute. Everton top PL winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature If Liverpool get past Villarreal, they will face Man City or Real Madrid in the final of the Champions League in France at the end of May. Klopp was annoyed when asked whether Liverpool’s job was already done in the semi-finals: “If I was younger I’d have been really angry with the question! Of course, no. It’s only half-time,” Klopp said (quotes via Liverpool Echo). “We have to go there and try to win, knowing they (Villarreal) will go with all they have. “It’s a semi-final, it should be tough. We never expected it to be easy. But we played a good game at home and we need to play a good one away as well. “You never know if we’ll get another chance in a semi-final. “We have an exceptional team but you need luck, so you had better treat it carefully and we will.

Everything that we are is required tomorrow night. “We have to be ready to play a top, top game. They will try top lay much more football than we allowed them in the first game. “Unai will sure try to adapt a few things. It will be really interesting. Maturity is important but not the only thing.” Klopp went onto claim that in current form Thiago would play in every team in the world: “In the shape he is in now, he’d play in each team in the world and for Spain as well. “Just when he got here he was injured and Spain had a lot of options. The shape he is in now he’d get in each national team. Like any player, he needs to be in his best shape.” On Liverpool’s team news, he added: “[Roberto Firmino is now running. It’s nothing serious but it’s very painful each step. He will travel with us but won’t be involved in the squad yet. Then we had issues with stomach bug (Kostas Tsimikas, Curtis Jones, Divock Origi) but they are all back.”  ",positive

The Reds produced a good display to beat Eddie Howe’s side 1-0 on Saturday with Naby Keita scoring the only goal of the game as they put pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City. Klopp chose to leave out Salah for their trip to St James’ Park, as well as another couple of regulars, and Liverpool should’ve probably won by a greater margin. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Neville doubted Klopp’s decision on Saturday, as well as Pep Guardiola’s choice to leave out Kevin de Bruyne in their 4-1 win at Leeds United, but admits that the two managers will have made their squad “feel a million dollars”. Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “It’s the first time Jurgen Klopp’s left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don’t know. But when I saw that, I thought, ‘Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?’. “I just thought because he’s played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that’s a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he’s number one. So can we get through without him? “So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that’s the two best players – I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance – but those are the two star players. To come through those games without their two star players, the rest of the squad will feel a million dollars, and you’ve rested your two best players.” Access all areas ✅ Go behind the scenes of our win over Newcastle United at St. James’ Park 📽 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 2, 2022 Neville added: “What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they’re basically empowering the squad. You hear managers say ‘I’ve got a great squad’, but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? “Where you know if you don’t win there is a large consequence, or you’re probably going to lose a league title, or you’re going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win – you’ve empowered everybody. “You’ve made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone’s had a game, no one feels like there’s a first eleven. “It’s a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you’re going to go for three and four trophies because you’re going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it’s for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. “It’s really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you’re going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. “We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they’re contributing to the success, and it’s not just a token gesture where you’re being played in the sort of weak games.”  ",positive

The clubs in the Premier League sigh and prepare for four more years of domination and biannual (probably quadannual) drubbings. Klopp’s new deal at Anfield takes him through to the summer of 2026. It’s brilliant news for Liverpool, obviously. The club love him, the fans love him, the players love him and the feeling goes both ways. Klopp is now synonymous with Liverpool Football Club; may God help the poor sod who will eventually replace him. But he’s just as valuable a commodity to the Premier League. Klopp, as a manager, is ‘worth the entrance fee alone’ – worth spending half your wages on 27 different platforms to watch him fist-pumping at the Kop, grimacing like a gladiator removing their latest head, conducting those special Anfield nights. He’s the box office manager of a box office football team playing box office football. And the Premier League smiles, pats him on the cap and reaps the rewards. The English top flight is no longer The Best League In The World simply because English people said so often enough. It is now actually the best league in the world, owing to it having the best football teams. After a fallow period of five years without a representative in the Champions League final, should Manchester City and Liverpool hold onto their advantages in the semi-finals this season, seven of the last ten finalists will have hailed from this green and pleasant land. The news of Klopp’s extension as good as guarantees further years of supremacy. It’s not just about Liverpool, but about the inability for those who wish to compete to rest on their laurels. The Premier League bar is as high as it’s ever been, and given Liverpool’s brilliance on the pitch, where they swarm over and suffocate opponents to win game after game with no let up,and off it, where they have an extraordinary record of making perfect signings, the ceiling may not yet be in sight. It’s a harrowing thought for all Premier League clubs, including Manchester City, who are right there alongside them. The Premier League will want to bleed what has become a wonderful – if slightly too respectful – rivalry for the four years Klopp is now committed to, at the very least. That relies on Pep Guardiola. Both City and Liverpool are excellent football teams with very gifted footballers, but the reason either is able to keep pace with the other is down to their managers. Liverpool without Klopp would not be in this title race and the same goes for City without Guardiola.  The City boss is about to enter the final year of his contract at the Etihad and will have spent seven seasons at the club by the summer of 2023. He has extraordinary footballers at his disposal, at a football club with extraordinary resources to continue to develop and improve. But that alone may not be enough for him to extend his deal; he’s been on the verge of leaving on more than one occasion and this is comfortably the longest he’s stayed at one club. If anything was to persaude him to remain it may well be the promise of further great battles with his affable nemesis on Merseyside. Draining though that sounds to us mortals, these guys live for the stress of competition at the highest level, and there is, and will be, no higher level while these two masters continue to push each other. It’s terrible news for those playing catch up – 2026 is a long way off.Mikel Arteta will be in the process of extending his ‘process’, Harry Kane will be 33 and still trophyless at Tottenham (or Manchester United), Chelsea will be firmly reduced to a cup team losing two finals a season, and Wayne Rooney will be overseeing the overhaul of the overhaul at Old Trafford. With one flick of his pen, Klopp has fail-safed Liverpool’s future,cemented the Premier League’s top spot in the European league hierarchy for the foreseeable, and f***ed all of us except Manchester City, who will be f***ing us further.

The pair, along with Roberto Firmino and midfielder Naby Keita, have contracts which expire next summer and negotiations have dragged on for some time. With Klopp now staying until 2026, there is a greater degree of security at the club but the German is not convinced that will make a huge difference to individual players’ decisions. Liverpool press to depress opponents as Klopp keeps complacency completely at bay “That is more a question for the boys, what it exactly means for them but all fine, my relationship with them is great,” he said. “My point is in life there are more important things to think about, not only who is the manager but knowing who the manager and coaching staff is is important thing because when you know what you have with other clubs where you could go, you don’t know exactly. “There is no 100 per cent in this business but I think it is pretty likely I will stay for a little bit longer because other coaches are there at other clubs. “If it is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. “It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.” Salah’s contract negotiations have dragged on for several months now, with the Egypt international stressing last week the delay was “not about money at all”. However, whether the guarantee of working with Klopp for the final peak years of his career will be persuasive enough for him to accept an offer below a reported £400,000-plus a week remains to be seen. But whichever way that decision goes Klopp will not hold it against him or any other player who sees their future elsewhere. Asked whether players in the past had spoken to him about his own future before committing theirs, Klopp added: “That happened as well. I don’t judge loyalty because of these kind of things. “From my side yes, if I commit, I commit but I know a player’s career is 15 years and I have great relationships today with former players of mine who wanted to leave in specific moments when I thought ‘That’s a shame you go now’. “If a player tells you early enough he wants to go then you have to deal with it: is there a club that wants him, is there a transfer fee? “If a player is coming at the last moment and tells you on Sunday when the transfer window closes on the Monday ‘By the way, I can’t stay here’ then (it’s) ‘Sorry my friend, that’s not possible’. “To plan we need decisions at a specific point and that’s what we are working on. “But I don’t judge people if they are loyal or not if they say during a contract ‘I want to go somewhere else and see what the weather is like or how the grass is there’. “That’s not the case.

We have to do it now. It’s no threat. This is only the start, to be honest. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. “There’s nothing guaranteed, it’s why we have to enjoy the journey.

Mike Gordon, president of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the Liverpool owners, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday and watched Klopp’s side beat Villarreal 2-0 in their Champions League semi-final first leg. But Gordan had an ulterior motive for the visit and sat down with Klopp to discuss the terms of an extension. FSG have always been keen to tie Klopp down and waited to make their move until the German boss ‘made noises’ confirming his desire to stay at the club. 👀 pic.twitter.com/PkDRRnsSIg — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 28, 2022 This was two-year extension wasconfirmed by the club on Thursday evening. Speaking on this news, Klopp said: “There are so many words I could use to describe how I am feeling about this news… delighted, humbled, blessed, privileged and excited would be a start. “There is just so much to love about this place. I knew that before I came here, I got to know it even better after I arrived and now I know it more than ever before. “Like any healthy relationship, it always has to be a two-way street; you have to be right for each other. The feeling we were absolutely right for each other is what brought me here in the first place and it’s why I’ve extended previously. “This one is different because of the length of time we have been together. I had to ask myself the question: Is it right for Liverpool that I stay longer? “Along with my two assistant managers, Pep Lijnders and Pete Krawietz, we came to the conclusion it was a ‘Yes!’” Klopp won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2019 before winning the Premier League in 2020. He’s already guided them Carabo Cup glory this term, they sit one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League, will play Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and are hot favourites to progress to the Champions League final for the third time in five seasons.

28,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-man-utd-rangnick-brentford,Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here?,"The Mailbox ponders how Liverpool’s season will be viewed if they don’t win any of the three remaining trophies they are going for this month. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… What qualifies as Liverpool success? I think it’s pretty crazy that Liverpool could finish the season as FA Cup finalists, champs league finalists, runner up in the league and winner of the league cup and pretty much every fan will think of it as a failed season. Myself included. By any other standard any two of those four achievements is a superb season for 99% of teams. Which I guess highlights just how high Klopp has raised our expectations now. I said after we drew with city that the title was gone. That was a must win game. My friends (also reds) said I was pessimistic and city would def drop points along the way and we would win every game. Winning every game for us at that point would mean a 14 game winning streak, one of the longest in club history. So far we’ve done that. But pep just knows how to put giant runs together and looking at the calendar at the time I couldn’t see any teams taking points off city. Still don’t. 4 games left and it’s looking ever more likely that the season will finish with city being one point above us and that game Vs city being a costly one (though really any game we dropped points is just as costly). But I genuinely believe (as objectively as I can) that we will win a cup treble this season. Regardless of who makes it to the final it will be a very tough game with either two teams who play fast attacking football and a high tempo pressure game filled with talented players or Liverpool against a team of dark arts masters who are older than the Bible with twice the staying power. Would other Liverpool fans be disappointed with a cup treble? I want to say no but I know in my heart of hearts that that premier League trophy is the one we really want. I’d swap the champs league for the premier League this year for sure. I shouldn’t be disappointed, especially considering only a few years ago we almost ceased to exist. But I know that pang of regret will be there anyway…Lee  Eye on the ballIsaac, believe me, my eye is very much on the ball. I am making no assumptions about Liverpool winning their last 4 games. In fact in my mail on Sunday I said it was a real possibility that they wouldn’t. I am very worried about the game against Tottenham, just as I was worried about the Newcastle game, worried about the Man United game, worried about the Everton game and worried about pretty much every other game Liverpool play. I do find the comment about the ‘ridiculous’ concern from Liverpool fans about where City could drop points slightly odd though. Isn’t that what football fans do? Are Spurs, Arsenal, Leeds, Burnley, & Everton fans not scouring the fixtures list to see where points may be won and lost? Seriously, if you’re not doing that are you even a real football fan?Mike, LFC, London   Everton relegation bad for Man City Not only would Everton’s relegation be bad for the city it would also be bad news for Manchester City. As it stands City only have the Manchester derby as the game where “form goes out of the window” but Liverpool have two, with the Merseyside derby and the rivalry with United. It is rare that Liverpool actually do the double over Everton (this season aside) and it is hard to imagine a promoted team taking points off them. With the margin between the two being so small, Everton’s relegation might make all the difference next season and (perish the thought) beyond.CDM  Departing manager bounce 29th of April – Rangnick appointed Austria manager for next season. 2nd May, Man United play their first convincing game of Rangnick’s tenure, displaying flair, composure, and effort. It turns out these players can play, and they can defend, and score goals too. Coincidence? Or motivation? And if you believe it was ‘just Brentford’ consider that if United had played this way and won all the games we played against teams in the bottom half of the premiership we would have had 16 points more. Contrary to popular opinion, this team doesn’t need surgery. It needs a spark.Ved Sen, MUFC.  Ralf finds the formula Man Utd finally played good football. Huge shout outs to Mata & Matic. All the others players have 100% and it showed. Is it a coincidence Man Utd plays good football without Maguire & Rashford? The former simply doesn’t deserve to be in a top six team, the latter is a footballer turned book writer who can’t be bothered to run on a football pitch. If only Ralf had found this formula earlier. CheersAshwin – Man Utd fan  Where did all the nicknames go? Two things which have been rolling around in my head recently – What ever happened to nicknames for players? It feels like they are not as prominent anymore. In the past, here in sunny and loadshedded South Africa, we had wonderful nicknames for players like Ace, Computer, and my favourite, Lucas ‘Masterpieces’ Moripe. According to Wikipedia, Steven Gerrard is referred to as the ‘Hammer of Huyton’. I can’t recall ever singing for the ‘Hammer’. ‘Scores from forty yards’, uncountable times. Was he referred to as the Hammer at all up in England? I know Luis Suarez went by ‘El pistolero’ but this seemed to be more widely used for him in Uruguay? Maybe Salah’s ‘Egyptian King’ moniker might currently be applicable but in truth, are nicknames still assigned? I’d love if we could start calling them James ‘the Anvil’ Milner and Joel ‘Pureclass’ Matip. My second mental wandering I confine to brackets.

The German has been United’s interim boss since the start of December. He will be replaced this summer by current Ajax manager Erik ten Hag. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope Under Rangnick, Man Utd have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions. They have been beaten by Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal on this run. Anthony Elanga started last time out as they drew 1-1 against Chelsea.Hannibal Mejbri,Shola Shoretire, Alvaro Fernandez andAlejandro Garnacho Ferreyra were on the bench. United host Brentford on Monday night. Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game. They’ll have a go at Manchester United and I think they’ll cause them a few problems this weekend.” ",negative

The Reds travelled to face the Magpies in the early game on Saturday. Before this clash, Newcastle were on a run of winning ten games in 14 in the Premier League. Eddie Howe’s side had also won six straight games at St James’ Park. Liverpool battled hard as they defeated the hosts. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Naby Keita’s goal in the 19th minute proved to be the winner. The visitors had 24 shots and they were resolute in defence as they kept a clean sheet. Liverpool are now top of the Premier League. Man City will return to the summit if they beat Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday evening. Speaking post-match, Robertson reserved special praise for Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez: “Newcastle worked really hard, they’re in fantastic shape. They’re in the top ten, so we knew it was going to be difficult,” Robertson said (quotes via The Metro). “Luckily we got the goal and I don’t think they had too many chances after that. We had a few to kill the game off but we’re just happy with the three points. “Joelinton was causing us a couple of problems early on, but in the second half I thought the lads were excellent against him. “They started better than us but then we got a foothold in the game. We got the goal and we got a bit better after that. “They didn’t have many chances. I thought the two centre-backs and Joe Gomez were different class. “We made five changes today, but the lads that are coming in are putting in big performances. We need that between now and the end of the season.” Jurgen Klopp suggested that Liverpool “controlled the game” against Newcastle: “It’s the most difficult of circumstances. A team in form, a crowd waiting for ages for proper success. Coming here with five changes and building pretty much a new setup is really difficult, so the performance was absolutely outstanding. I loved it. We controlled the game in so many ways. “The only plan they had was the long ball to our right side. The impact we have from the bench is outstanding. Joe Gomez, what a game. Naby Keita, what a game. James Milner, what a game. Diogo Jota – my god, what a game. Then you see Andy Robertson in the 93rd minute, making the run.” ",negative

Van Dijk signed for Liverpool in January 2018 for a fee of £75m, signalling the start of a new era at Anfield after two consecutive fourth-placed finishes under Jurgen Klopp. The signing of Van Dijk, along with Alisson and Fabinho six months later, helped Liverpool win the Champions League in 2018/19 while securing a second-placed finish in the Premier League. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward Liverpool won the Premier League title the very next campaign and are now on course to win an unprecedented Quadruple this term under Klopp. Van Dijk has been a key part of their recent success and Seedorf – who is a big fan of his compatriot – thinks the “boring” nature of the city has helped the Dutchman focus on his football. “Last week, I was in Liverpool for Amazon Prime Video, the streaming service for which I provide commentary,” Seedorf toldNRC. “With my Italian companions, the search for a good place to eat was easily done; they do not deviate from tradition, so it became an Italian restaurant for a change. “Il Forno was the home of Carlo Ancelotti during his period as coach at Everton, and many Liverpool players stay here regularly as well. However, I did not hear the name of Virgil van Dijk among the staff. Was that a coincidence? “Maybe he comes here sometimes, but the captain of Orange is mainly focused on winning prizes with his club Liverpool. The city of Liverpool is very suitable for that. In my opinion, it is a boring city, without many temptations that come your way unwisely. Former Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross: “Van Dijk is slowly becoming the [best] centre-back ever. The more I watch him, I can’t find a fault in his game. I look on in envy. Every attribute he’s 10/10. A Rolls Royce. At [£75m] he was a steal.” #awlive [liverpool echo] pic.twitter.com/MlX9FbiaGz — Anfield Watch (@AnfieldWatch) April 29, 2022 “The calmness he exudes gives Jürgen Klopp’s team a lot of confidence to put high pressure, as it did against Villarreal the whole match on Wednesday. “Many people talk about his physical strength and speed, but how Van Dijk defused most dangerous situations has everything to do with his game insight and also with his ability to quickly choose the best solution. “That is often not without risk, but it is inevitable at the highest level. His fellow players praise him; the fans of Liverpool sleep easy for years thanks to their leader of the rearguard, and the Italian restaurant respects his privacy. With Van Dijk, Dutch football is more than well-represented in Liverpool.”  ",positive

After much speculation, Konate signed for Liverpool last summer for a fee of around £36m from RB Leipzig. The centre-back has been a bit-part player this term, playing 23 times across all competitions. Liverpool are still great even if they win only Carabao Cup this season The 22-year-old was back in Liverpool’s starting eleven on Wednesday night. This was for their Champions League semi-final first leg against Villarreal. He started alongside Van Dijk. Both players had a quiet evening as Liverpool were in full control at Anfield. Villarreal were unable to register a shot on target during the 90 minutes. The Reds won 2-0 thanks to an own-goal from Pervis Estupinan and a finish from Sadio Mane. Konate’s opportunities have been limited this season given the form of Van Dijk and Joel Matip. Van Dijk thinks “it is crazy” that Konate is as good as he is “at such an age”: “(Konate) is a fantastic player. To be that good already at such an age, it’s crazy, in my opinion,” Van Dijk told LFC TV. “Obviously he still has loads to learn and, in my opinion, as a centre-back I think it comes with experience, dealing with situations, dealing with mistakes, dealing with moments that you fail (in) maybe to make sure it doesn’t happen anymore. “But he is already at such a high level and such consistency as well. So, it’s great to have each other and push each other each and every day. Joel (Matip) has obviously had an incredible season as well, so let’s keep that going.” On Liverpool’s attackers, Van Dijk added: “They are so important for us at the moment. I don’t want to be facing any of our strikers, to be fair. Diogo from the bench, Luis, Mo, Sadio, it’s incredible, Divock the last game. “We are in a good moment, everyone is pushing each other and we’ll try to keep that going, and the amount of work they put in is incredible as well.” ",positive

Origi came off the bench against Everton on Sunday to win the game for Liverpool, the latest in a number of crucial contributions from the Liverpool striker. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The Reds struggled until Origi was brought on, and he played a key part in their opening goal before heading in the second. The Belgian is rumoured to be on his way out of Anfield this summer having spent the majority of his career under Jurgen Klopp on the bench. And Owen says he wouldn’t be happy if he was in Origi’s situation. Speaking on Premier League Productions, Owen said: “If I was a centre-forward and I came on so many times to save my manager, yet he never played me and he only brought me on occasionally, then I wouldn’t be giving the manager such a big cuddle. You just know how much that man means to all of those Liverpool players and how much it means to those fans.” But Klopp has consistently hailed the impact of Origi, labelling him “world class” and a Liverpool legend. Speaking after the Merseyside derby win, Klopp said: “We will never miss a player like him because if he leaves, he will explode wherever he goes. He is a world-class striker, he is a legend and will stay a legend forever. “He doesn’t always make the squad which is ridiculous, but he is there when we need him every time. He was involved in both games; everything that we did in the second half, without Divock, wouldn’t have happened.” And Klopp also paid tribute to the other Liverpool players on the fringes, as he called the stars that don’t always play ‘the strongest players ever’. Klopp added: “The group lives because of the boys that don’t always play, they are the strongest players ever. “[Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain, [Harvey] Elliot, [Takumi] Minamino, even Rhys Williams. They are in great shape, but the way they behave is why we do these kind of things.” ",positive

Having been frustrated by the Spanish side in the first half at Anfield, Liverpool scored two goals within ten minutes of the restart to give them a healthy advantage heading into the second leg. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe But the BT Sport pundits believe the tie is still just about alive. “Villarreal have just got a pulse,” Owen said. “If Liverpool nicked another one it would have been game, set and match.” “I think three would have killed it, that would have been too much for Villarreal to come back from,” Peter Crouch echoed. “Two is a possibility but it’s a slim, slim chance when you watch Liverpool in the form they’re in at the moment.” And Owen believes Klopp made a mistake in bringing Joe Gomez on for Trent Alexander-Arnold with then minutes to play as he felt Liverpool should have gone for the jugular. “I thought he made substitutions that almost didn’t promote going for an extra goal,” Owen said. “Joe Gomez for Trent for starters is much more defensive when your right-back is one of the most attacking players you’ve got on the pitch. “I thought maybe not that he was settling for two, but I thought he was comfortable and rested a couple of legs. “They’re going to have to go out there knowing that the game is still alive. It’s still got something in it. If they concede the first goal, it’s really alive. An extra goal tonight would have put it to bed.” Klopp said after his side’s victory that they “had a lot of good moments”. “It was a brilliant game. The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp said. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive
35,https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive

Liverpool dominated the game and could have had more if it wasn’t for some smart saves from Toon keeper Martin Dubravka. The defeat ended a good run for Howe’s side which had seen them steer clear of the relegation zone and despite admitting there were some positives to take, the Newcastle boss told his side they must improve next time out. Howe said: “I think Liverpool were probably not at their best but we weren’t either and when you play these games you have to be. We competed well but lacked the quality that could have got us a goal. “It is difficult to it consistently against Liverpool as they have the quality to produce a counter-attack out of nothing.

I thought we made a bright start to the game but we’re slightly disappointed with our own performance. “Individually I don’t think we hit our top levels, which meant collectively we didn’t quite hit the levels we have recently. We probably didn’t quite have that sustained pressure we were looking for. The second half was better without that big chance ever really coming. “There were one or two bright sparks, but it’s slightly disappointing compared to our previous levels. I’ve seen progress from where we have been, but on the other side there’s a lot of work to do. We’re probably where we were before the game.” On the decision to drop Chris Wood to the bench, Howe added: “We view every game independently.

When it all comes together, and it so often has over the last five years, the Champions League knockout stages are utterly untouchable as sporting entertainment. Some are troubled by watching these behemoths funded by questionable regimes who would sell their own grandmothers for ever-increasing slices of sweet, sweet pie, while others are left cold by teams of superstars paid phenomenal sums of money to don shirts emblazoned with Middle East airlines. But when stripped down to 90 minutes, this is just football and these were 90 phenomenal, ridiculous, ludicrously entertaining minutes. For those 90 minutes there were no thoughts of sportswashing or financial mismanagement or sneaky Super League machinations. Mostly there were just thoughts of ‘f***ing, f***ing hell’ and the occasional ‘what the actual f***’. We could talk tactics – about Pep Guardiola conspiring to pull Real Madrid asunder with high forwards flanking that rare sight of an actual Manchester City striker, about Carlo Ancelotti allowing City to control the midfield, about Vinicius Jnr exposing Fernandinho – but actually, this game could be distilled down to this: Manchester City are easily one of the best two teams in the world and Real Madrid have easily the best striker in the world and have the mentality of a far, far better side. They have no idea when they are beaten, even when the opposition is standing over them holding a massive, blood-stained stick. You can read about all the goals here as City three times forged a deserved two-goal lead only to see it halved three times. City began the game with five of their six top scorers for the season on the pitch and four of them scored; the other is probably still wondering how he didn’t. City conceded three times but you could hardly say they defended badly, only that Karim Benzema is an exquisite goalscorer, a 36-year-old cannot win a foot race with a 21-year-old and Karim Benzema is an exquisite goalscorer with balls of steel and the cheek of a market trader. City were astonishingly good, with Oleksandr Zinchenko excellent at left-back, Phil Foden fizzing in front of him and Kevin De Bruyne underlining why he is the best midfielder in the world bar none. He was City’s only starting survivor from a 0-0 with Real Madrid exactly six years before (The Guardian called it ‘a night of few chances and surprising torpor’), underlining just how far City have come since those dull, dull days when they were managed by Manuel Pellegrini. This had many chances and not a minute of torpor. A times a touch of torpor might have been nice so we could all catch our breath. That this City side could emerge from this season without a trophy seems counter-intuitive and close to bizarre; we live in a curious golden era for English football when that is even remotely possible. No side will have ever been so brilliant in their barrenness. Any other side but Liverpool or this curate’s egg of a Real Madrid team would have been utterly blown away by such a City performance and yet these two teams shared seven goals almost equally. It made no real sense but it was exhilarating. And it’s only half-time. ",positive

Statistics are taken fromthe brilliant FB.Ref. 10)Ruben Neves (Wolves)Non-penalty goals:4Non-penalty xG:1.1Non-penalty G-xG:2.9 Takes an awful lot of shots from outside the area – 35 of 38 this season were from distance.

The Belgium international has been one of the best players in the Premier League since returning in 2015 from Wolfsburg, who he joined in 2014 from Chelsea after playing just three league games for the Stamford Bridge outfit. De Bruyne has been in good form again this season with 14 goals and five assists in all competitions as Man City still fight for glory on three fronts. Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool The 30-year-old is rarely linked with a move away from Man City with the Belgium international happy at the club and the Citizens at the peak of their powers. But now Spanish publication Nacional claims that Real Madrid president Perez ‘met with’ De Bruyne and his agent in a ‘secret meeting in Manchester’ that will ‘shake’ the Premier League. Perez is determined to give a deal for De Bruyne a good go and, although the meeting ‘did not have the expected result’, he is ‘determined to try again’. The Man City playmaker is ‘facing one of the last opportunities of his life to start a new adventure’ and playing in La Liga ‘has always seduced him enormously’. Nacional admit that Real Madrid will find it ‘very difficult to get him out of the Etihad Stadium’ but the Los Blancos recruitment team are still hopeful they can ‘convince him’. Man City will ‘only study proposals close to or greater than’€100m and a deal in the summer transfer window ‘would be one of the great surprises of the market’. Meanwhile,Kyle Walker felt Man City had moved a small step closer to retaining their Premier League title after Sunday’s pulsating 2-2 draw with Liverpool. Walker said after the match: “Of course we want to win every game, especially when people come to our own patch, but it’s very important not to lose the game. “We can’t lose a game (like this) and then be trailing them because good teams like them don’t drop too many points. You take a point, you move on and they’ve still got to catch us. I feel that it’s a step in the right direction. “It’s in our hands, we’re still top of the Premier League. That’s an important message we need to hold onto and take into the next couple of games, which are very important.” ",positive

Pep Guardiola’s side are top of the table but have seen their 13-point lead over second-place Liverpool reduced to just one point since January. The Reds have won ten league games in a row and are piling the pressure on City ahead of Sunday’s all-important clash, which could well decide who lifts the trophy come May. Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet In an interview with the Metro on Friday, De Bruyne praised Liverpool and their attacking brand of football, before revealing it would be “okay” if Jurgen Klopp‘s side beat City to the title, as long as he gave it his all. “I think they’re great,” the City midfielder said of Liverpool. “I feel like here are two teams fighting each other so much and both know what it takes to keep pushing and pushing and we are the only teams to have done that for the last five years. “I like the big matches. It’s two fully attacking teams and our games this season have been entertaining. I can’t remember playing them when it’s been boring. “In my way of thinking, if I tried everything I could to win it and it didn’t happen, it’s okay. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it’s not possible.”  City remain in the Champions League and FA Cup, as do Liverpool, and De Bruyne spoke of the pros and cons of fighting on multiple fronts. “We want to win every game but sometimes you get setbacks,” he said. “Even if you don’t make it [winning the league], you have the chance to be part of these things [at City]. We are doing what everyone wants to do by being in contention for titles. “The schedule is so hectic but we have to make sure we keep winning. Fatigue comes into play of course so it is about being as consistent as you possibly can in this period. “You have to be fresh as a player and hopefully that helps. The games keep coming every three days until the end now. We know this is the time to push.”   ",positive

City are currently one point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after Jurgen Klopp’s side took advantage of City dropping points at Crystal Palace on Monday by beating Arsenal. Why the last eight will all win the CL (and why they won’t) They will face off at the Etihad on April 10th in what could be a potential title decider and former Arsenal man Merson believes if Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne plays well, City will win that game and the title. “Manchester City win the league by double digits if they beat Liverpool at the Etihad – but it all depends on one player,” wrote Merson in his Daily Star column. “If midfielder Kevin De Bruyne plays well until the end of the season I think City win it comfortably because the Belgium international just knits everything together. He makes everybody in the at City side play in my opinion. “I think Pep Guardiola has a big role to play too with the team he picks. “City were dominating Crystal Palace the other night but he never makes a substitution. Not one sub! And they have a gifted squad there. “Surely you bring on fresh legs to take on tired defenders who have spent all game up against it, and you finish them off. But he didn’t, and they drew the game and opened the door for Liverpool to make a real race of it again. “Sometimes I just think Pep makes it too complicated for himself. It was the same in the Champions League final and the team he picked then. “It’s great when it works but when it doesn’t you have to ask questions. When the pressure comes on you make strange decisions and that was a bad sign for City. “But I still think they have the advantage. They can reel off eight wins in a row so easily, and having Liverpool at home is a big advantage. “Liverpool have the ammunition to win there and if you had to pick one team for that situation, having to go there and win, it would be them. “But it would be a massive blow for Liverpool to lose there. They would probably have to put all their eggs into the Champions League.” ",positive

We’re not counting the assist-makers because that relies on the chances being taken and we’re not counting the key passes because that is also pretty narrow; we are all about the SCA (Shot creating actions), defined as ‘the two offensive actions directly leading to a shot, such as passes, dribbles and drawing fouls’ byFBRef. We have taken out those who have played just a few minutes or games. These are the season leaders per 90. 10) Pascal Gross (4.14 SCA per 90)A first Premier League assist since August came in last weekend’s defeat to Newcastle United, but that says as much about Brighton’s misfiring forwards as it does about the German, whose set-piece prowess is up there among the best in the Premier League.  9) Bukayo Saka (4.24 SCA per 90)Tops this very specific list.Six of his goals and three of his assists have come since the start of December in a 10-game run of eight wins, one draw and a harsh defeat to Manchester City. He is really rather good.  8) Hakim Ziyech (4.32 SCA per 90)His creativity is actually way down on last season and yet he still sits second on a creative Chelsea list this season.He was sorely missed in the Carabao Cup final after scoring in his last three Premier League appearances.  7) Martin Odegaard (4.49 SCA per 90)Logged a ludicrous eight SCAs from open play v Watford on Sunday and two of those led to goals. This Arsenal side really is astonishingly good when in full flow, with Odegaard (23) the oldest of four players who have scored five Premier League goals.  6) Bruno Fernandes (4.52 SCA per 90) No Premier League player has produced as many SCAs through an open-play pass this season as Fernandes, who has somehow been at his most creative in defeats to Aston Villa and Leicester under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He’s probably the only Manchester United player who could reasonably expect to step up from the club.  5) Mohamed Salah (4.54 SCA per 90)He takes an awful lot of shots and rather a lot of those shots lead to other shots, but he also creates chances (for himself and others) with passes and dribbles. He has enjoyed a simply brilliant season with 19 goals and 10 assists.   4) Callum Hudson-Odoi (4.77 SCA per 90)Another currently injured Chelsea player missed in that Carabao Cup final defeat, though his critics would point to a Premier League season with only three goal contributions. His critics probably include his manager.  3) Trent Alexander-Arnold (5.02 SCA per 90)Nobody has more assists in the Premier League this season. Nobody has created more chances in the Premier League this season. He remains one of Liverpool’s most potent attacking threats, particularly with his set-piece delivery. Measured on this particular metric (SCA), he has never had a better Premier League season.  2) Kevin De Bruyne (5.23 SCA per 90)An astonishing 30 players have been credited with more Premier League assists than De Bruyne (3) this season but that simply proves that assists are no real measure. Against Manchester United on Sunday, he was simply phenomenal.  1) Jack Grealish (5.38 SCA per 90)Everybody at Manchester City keeps telling us to ignore the headline statistics of two goals and two assists and this is why. The glory belonged to De Bruyne after the derby but Grealish was credited with nine SCAs, illustrating the wisdom of overloading the left side of City’s attack. ",positive

If Manchester United’s tactics played right into his hands, a display of extraordinary dominance was a reminder that the Belgian’s best is better than virtually anyone else’s. He has an old-fashioned ability to grab a game by the scruff of its neck, even one as big as a Manchester derby. His is a barnstorming form of brilliance. Two goals and an assist were a reflection of individual excellence in a consummate team. Now go and read 16 Conclusions.  Phil FodenLess false nine than genuine one, albeit a roving centre-forward, but one who could run in behind the Manchester United defence and dart through the inside-left channel. A terrific performance lacked a goal but offered further evidence of both talent and versatility. Go back to another of the games that define City’s season, the 2-2 draw at Anfield, and he was brilliant as a left winger. He can be equally good cutting in from the right. And, as Tuesday’s display at Peterborough showed, his long-term future could lie in midfield.  Mikel Arteta, going fourthIt wasn’t quite Arteta’s first assist for Arsenal since 2014/15, but his quick throw to Bukayo Saka did lead to Gabriel Martinelli’s ultimately decisive goal against Watford. It felt symbolic: Arteta is having an impact. Arsenal are fourth and with games in hand. Arteta is yet to eliminate their self-destructive streak and it is within their capabilities to mess this up but the Champions League is starting to loom large on the horizon. Victory at Vicarage Road came courtesy of the path Arteta is ploughing. Alexandre Lacazette remains rooted on three league goals for the season but Arsenal’s firepower comes from their attacking midfielders and three – Martin Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli – all scored. It is four wins in a row now. Weekend defeats for Manchester United, West Ham and Wolves made the last all the more valuable as they surged to the top of their mini-league.  Trent Alexander-ArnoldAnd not merely because he set a personal best by recording his 16th assist of a season. Given Alexander-Arnold’s brilliance as a crosser, making him the Beckham of right-backs, there was something unusual in the way he set up Sadio Mane’s winner against West Ham: whether a mishit shot or a cross simply putting the ball into an area, rather than the usual concoction of whip and bend. But it was a victory that owed much to Alexander-Arnold’s contributions at either end. To Jurgen Klopp’s bemusement, the right-back’s defensive instincts are sometimes questioned but they were apparent when he made a swift retreat to his own line to clear Pablo Fornals’ lob: so, too, when he covered for Ibrahima Konate sufficiently quickly that he closed down Manuel Lanzini when the Argentinian blazed over. On a day when Liverpool were below their best, Alexander-Arnold was near his in a reminder their match-winners are not merely found in the forward line. Liverpool haven’t conceded with him on the pitch since Cardiff’s consolation goal in the FA Cup fourth round. That may be no coincidence.  Reece James It was a fitting comeback for a player who had become more productive this season. James’ first start of 2022 brought a goal and an assist; as Kai Havertz only had to bundle the ball over the line, it was more of an assist than some. Burnley were beaten 4-0 in the sort of result Chelsea seemed to produce in autumn when James was flying. It was notable that they lost some of their potency when he joined Ben Chilwell on the sidelines and if that reflects the importance of attacking wing-backs in Thomas Tuchel’s gameplan, it is also the case that very few can make the impact in the final third that James does. And in its own way it is remarkable that he was out for eight weeks and, one game into his return, no Chelsea player has more assists and only two have scored more in the Premier League this season.  Kasper SchmeichelThe position of goalkeeper in Leicester’s all-time side may be fiercely contested. Peter Shilton and Gordon Banks provide stiff competition but Schmeichel already had a case to be City’s finest, and not merely because of historic Premier League and FA Cup wins, and on the day he passed Mark Wallingford to become the keeper with the most appearances for the club, he turned his 461st game into an exhibition of excellence. Clean sheets have been a rarity for Leicester this season and if, at times, there were suspicions Schmeichel’s standards had slipped, he was outstanding in saving from Dan James, Jack Harrison, Rodrigo and Raphinha.  Jesse Marsch Perhaps a loser will be proved a winner in time if a debut defeat was a sign a corner is being turned. Certainly Marsch took Leeds in a different direction, abandoning Marcelo Bielsa’s beloved man-marking system. Leeds were less chaotic at Leicester. After conceding 20 goals in their previous five games, they only let in one. Allowing four shots on target in 90 minutes, as opposed to four goals, felt a case of improvement as there were indications of Marsch’s training-ground work. Yet the loss means back-to-back home games assume a greater significance.  Ivan ToneyThomas Frank has called him the best penalty-taker in the world. If his two nonchalantly cool spot kicks at Carrow Road ultimately keep Brentford up, perhaps Toney will prove the most valuable one. They were the definition of pressure penalties: for a team with one point from the previous 24, knowing defeat would have trimmed the gap to Norwich to just four points. Instead a six-pointer leaves Brentford 10 ahead of their victims and six clear of the bottom three. If Christian Eriksen suggested he can be one difference-maker for Brentford, Toney remains their other potential trump card and is the scorer of their first Premier League hat-trick.  Danny Ings Southampton had felt the winners of a transfer, banking £25 million for a player with a solitary year left on his contract, accelerating into the top half as the loanee Armando Broja proved a revelation and Ings’ former strike partner Che Adams proved more prolific. Meanwhile, Ings found goals rarities in a stop-start Aston Villa career. And so, with a certain perverse inevitability, his first reunion with his old club was a triumphant affair. Ings ended with two assists and a goal: the sort Southampton might recognise, a first-time finish from a low cutback. Perhaps as significant was Ollie Watkins’ strike: set up by Ings, it was the first time either had assisted the other and if a theme of Villa’s season has been the question of whether they can play together or, if not, which starts, Steven Gerrard prospered by pairing them, putting Philippe Coutinho in behind at the tip of a midfield diamond and looking his slightly wider strikers to run either side of Southampton’s centre-backs. At his best, Ings exudes sharpness and he buzzed around, looking lively. It is a sight Southampton used to enjoy.  Newcastle, 2022 stars Admittedly, a year that began with a home defeat to Cambridge got off to an inauspicious start but compile a table for 2022 and Newcastle are third. Only they and Liverpool are unbeaten in the Premier League. And, whereas every win felt newsworthy in itself until recently, now there was a sense of normality about them beating Brighton. That the goals came from the rejuvenated pair of Ryan Fraser (recruited on a free transfer by Steve Bruce) and Fabian Schar (a £3million buy by Rafa Benitez) shows that, for all the money spent this year, the change in form owes much to Eddie Howe’s management.  Crystal Palace, a top-10 hit Making a mockery of pre-season predictions that relegation beckoned. With 10 games to go, they are all but safe. Patrick Vieira has done a terrific job and Palace’s transfer-market planning has transformed Roy Hodgson’s old team.   Losers Ralf Rangnick Manchester United’s interim manager has often argued progress has been made in his reign. His points total suggested it had, but the numbers came with an asterisk attached: United had not faced any of the top three teams. They have now and while Rangnick has tended to cite an improved defensive record as evidence they were going in the right direction, they conceded four goals to Manchester City. As the league leaders mustered 24 shots, it could easily have been more. Given the hapless displays of Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, not to mention the possibility that Victor Lindelof is still charging in the wrong direction after being lobbed by Phil Foden, United were more shambolic than solid. A second-half shot count of 14-0 indicated how United fell apart; there are enduring questions if they display enough fight and they predate the Rangnick era. But some of the blame must rest with him. He gave the impression he felt United were too negative in losing to City under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. His answer was a bold 4-2-4 formation, perhaps rendered all the odder by the absence of a specialist striker. But there was a predictable problem: it left United outnumbered in midfield against what Rangnick called the best passing team on the planet. It afforded Kevin de Bruyne acres of room to run into. And given there is a gulf in class between Scott McTominay and Fred and their City counterparts to begin with, it seemed needlessly reckless.  Harry MaguireThe ball went through his legs for the first goal. And just before the second. The third deflected off him. The fourth was perhaps the worst offside line in the history of football. Not a great afternoon, all things considered.  Norwich Reports of their demise have been premature before. Perhaps not now: Norwich may only be five points from safety but there is a case for arguing that losing 3-1 at home to a Brentford side without a win in two months was their worst result of the season. Certainly, it had the look of a must-win game. Certainly, Norwich were complicit in their own downfall. Ben Gibson’s unfortunate double of conceding two penalties made him the personification of a self-destructive streak, though arguably the team’s defending was still worse for Bryan Mbuemo’s disallowed goal. Norwich had a glimpse of safety after beating Watford. Now it feels a long way away.   Burnley, not defending like Burnley There has long been the sense that some of the cliches about Burnley are a little outdated. Turf Moor has not always been a difficult place to go when Burnley have won two of 23 league matches at home. But as Chelsea have scored 15 goals on their last four visits, they have not had too many difficulties there for a while. The Clarets’ demise on Saturday, however, did feel out of character. After conceding five goals in eight-and-a-half matches, they let in four in 23 minutes. They showed a capacity to get men behind the ball but without halting the delivery into the box or marking the scorer while James Tarkowski got an inadvertent assist for Christian Pulisic’s goal. Back-to-back defeats shift the verdict on a home-heavy bunch of matches. Burnley played six times at Turf Moor in 29 days and if their opponents after Watford – Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Leicester and Chelsea – suggested they were invariably underdogs, they only took five points and scored two goals. In the final reckoning, neither tally may be enough.  Wolves, still struggling to scoreBruno Lage criticised his young right-back, even if blaming a malfunctioning Hoever sounded like a case of a faulty domestic appliance. But Wolves’ major problem remains the same: they don’t score enough goals. The last of their players to find the net was Jose Sa, with his unfortunate own goal against Arsenal. Their barren spell at the right end now spans 260 minutes. A tally of 24 goals in 27 games is lamentable. Barring a strangely prolific end to the season, they will muster fewer goals than the infamously bad Mick McCarthy/Terry Connor team who propped up the Premier League in 2011/12. Lage left Raul Jimenez on the bench for the first hour against Crystal Palace, a decision that backfired. If an experiment with a false nine, in Daniel Podence, failed, Wolves have recurring issues: getting too few players into the box and when some of those rarely score.  Brighton, on a losing streak Remember the statistic that only the top three had lost fewer league games than Brighton? It was true a few weeks ago. Now Albion have doubled their number of defeats in the last four games. It feels out of character for draw specialists who often clawed their way back into matches, aided by Graham Potter’s changes. But in the last three, they have gone behind in the 21st, 17th and 12th minutes, only mustered one goal in response and lost to a trio of bottom-half sides. Maybe Brighton have relaxed a little: perhaps selling Dan Burn, which was excellent business financially, was the wrong move psychologically. But with Liverpool next, it could become five straight defeats. ",positive
44,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive

It was revealed earlier this week that the Magpies are interested in the full-back. Porto are said to have put in a bid of around €5m for him. The 30-year-old joined Arsenal in 2020 from Southampton. He signed for the Gunners on loan before his move was made permanent before the 2020/21 campaign.

They state that this is “speculation” and that the player has “no interest in leaving Arsenal”. Elsewhere, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the race for a spot in next season’s Champions League has more “twists and turns” in it with five games left to play. “I think there will still be twists and turns, we still have difficult matches today,” the Gunners boss said. “We had two really good results that are putting them again in a really good position and then it’s about doing it again at West Ham.” Arsenal face David Moyes’ side on Sunday, with the match taking place between the two legs of West Ham’s first European semi-final for 46 years against Eintracht Frankfurt. They lost the first leg 2-1 at the London Stadium and Arteta’s Arsenal could face a different-looking West Ham side on Sunday if Moyes chooses to rest players for the crucial second leg. However, despite the number of games on the Hammers’ fixture list as they balance Europe and the Premier League, Arteta insisted that does not concern him. “They’ve been doing that all season and have been really good in both competitions,” he said. “They have a big squad as well, they have different options to change their players and still maintain their level.

England aren’t unique in abuse problem; football culture is toxic The left-back has played 38 times for Bologna in Serie A over the past two years. During the latest international break, Hickey made his senior debut for Scotland as Steve Clarke’s side drew 1-1 against Poland. After signing five new players in January, Newcastle are again expected to be busy in the transfer window this summer. Fabrizio Romano has revealed via Twitter that the Magpies are ‘interested’ in the young defender. Hickey is considered to be a ‘top talent’ and ‘other clubs are monitoring him closely.

Botman was the Magpies number one defensive target in the winter transfer window but were unable to bring in the Netherlands under-21 international. It was a busy transfer window for the Geordies, nonetheless. They signed five players in total, spending £85m, eventually getting a central defender through the door in Brighton’s Dan Burn. But it now seems that Newcastle will attempt to sign Botman again ahead of the summer transfer window with Football Insider claiming the Geordies are still likely to beat AC Milan to his signing. The website insists that the Magpies are ‘in pole position to sign’ Botman this summer ‘for around £30million this summer even though he has agreed personal terms with AC Milan’. Botman is ‘still keen on signing for them and is eager to play in the Premier League’ and the Dutchman ‘remains a priority for Eddie Howe and the recruitment team as they look to recruit a top-class centre-back’. The report insists that offering ‘a satisfactory contract will not be a problem for Newcastle’ with the wealth at their disposal this summer and they are ‘confident that Botman will accept their contract offer after verbally agreeing personal terms earlier this year’.

Boehly had an official offer for Chelsea rejected in 2019, and has been determined to make a success of his candidacy this time around.

The influential CST conducted a snap survey of members, with 77 per cent of those polled claiming not to support the Ricketts’ bid to buy Chelsea. READ MORE: Rudiger and Son play as though they love football; that matters The Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts are among the final four bidders aiming to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. Cubs chiefs and siblings Tom and Laura Ricketts front the family’s candidacy to take over at the west London club. Chelsea fans have organised a protest against the Ricketts’ candidacy to take place before Saturday’s Premier League clash with Brentford at Stamford Bridge. Father Joe Ricketts, who has no role at the Cubs or in the bid to buy Chelsea, branded Muslims “my enemy” in leaked emails from 2019. Chelsea fans have voiced concerns consistently on social media, and now the CST has added further weight to those worries. “At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family’s bid for the club,” read a CST statement. “This is reflective of wider concerns articulated by large, vocal sections of Chelsea’s supporter base. “The CST Board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family’s bid to succeed. “We await further public detail from the Ricketts family on concrete steps they will take to address the well-documented concerns of Chelsea supporters. “Should the Ricketts publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns, we may survey our members again in the next week.” Tom Ricketts has built bridges with the Muslim community in Chicago ever since his father’s 2019 comments, and continues to apologise for his father’s comments. The Ricketts have been adding advisory partners in fine-tuning their bid ahead of the April 11 deadline for improved offers, but their bid is understood to be funded entirely by cash. Hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin has added his significant personal financial clout behind the Ricketts’ bid for Chelsea. Blues supporters continue to raise fears over the Ricketts’ candidacy to buy the club, however, with those issues crystallised in the CST survey. “Last week, the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust stated that the Ricketts family must urgently and publicly address supporter concerns – especially with regard to inclusivity, given both past and recent statements by members of the family,” read the CST statement. “We also committed to surveying our members as to their confidence and support in the Ricketts family’s bid for Chelsea FC. “Yesterday we conducted a snap survey of our membership. We asked our membership whether, based on information in the public domain as of April 1, they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, and we asked whether they supported the Ricketts family’s bid. “Our members have given a clear message in this regard: 72 per cent of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with five per cent of respondents believing they would. “Similarly, 77 per cent of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family’s bid for Chelsea FC and three per cent of respondents are in support. “It is essential that the new owners of Chelsea FC have the confidence of the supporter base and demonstrate an understanding of the values that we stand for.” Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special Government licence to continue operating, though under strict terms. Abramovich cannot profit from Chelsea’s sale, but had already vowed to write off the club’s £1.5billion debt. LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and British business titan Jonathan Goldstein, Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca are the four remaining contenders.

Johnson was one of several interested parties to be told by Raine Group last week that they had not been shortlisted to continue to the next stage of the bidding process. READ MORE: Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season The co-owner of the New York Jets is thought to have offered £2billion for the club, according to The Sun. Bids from British property developer Nick Candy and from the Saudi Media Group were also rejected in the first round. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, American Todd Boehly’s consortium, former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton, backed by Crystal Palace co-owners David Blitzer and Josh Harris, and Boston Celtics owner Stephen Pagliuca are the four bids left in the running to be the next owners after Roman Abramovich. Johnson believes he could have done “pretty well” at Chelsea, but claimed the numbers were “so enormous” that the party to take the helm faces a “huge challenge”. “My interest in Chelsea is I’m a fan of Chelsea,” Johnson said in a statement, reported by the New York Post. “When I was over there, I couldn’t be a fan of a particular team. I had to be diplomatic. “I had to like all the teams, but we are Chelsea fans. It’s London’s team. The concept of New York and London, I thought was one that we could do pretty well with that. I thought it would be another interesting endeavour for us.” He added: “Not getting Chelsea [is] disappointing, but the numbers have gotten so enormous that on one hand I’m disappointed and on the other hand, financially, I think it is going to be a huge challenge.” The remaining bidders have been given until April 11 to submit their final proposals to Raine, before the group present the Premier League and the government with Chelsea’s preferred offer by April 18. It’s hoped the change of ownership can be settled before the end of the month. Prospective buyers have reportedly been told by Raine that they must commit at least £1bn to future investment in the club, with redevelopment of Stamford Bridge a priority. ",positive
57,https://www.football365.com/news/football-greatest-fear-chaos-manchester-city-real-madrid-john-nicholson,Man City 4 Real Madrid 3: Football’s greatest fear and greatest strength is chaos,"Chaos is at the heart of football and it’s why Man City 4 Real Madrid 3 can happen and it’s why it’s brilliant. I love a good statistic. By ‘good’ I mean one which is so obscure as to really annoy people who hate statistics. There’s nothing quite so pleasurable as seeing someone fulminate against the use of xA or ‘progressive carrying distance’ numbers as though it is in some way neutering and emasculating their football knowledge. I see stats as the hidden matrix which underlies a game. And who doesn’t love a good heat map? An especially active player can produce a heat map that resembles a psychedelic mandala which you can stare at long enough to lose your ego. And we could all do with doing that. However, the danger is to think that if we drill deep enough into the data we will find some sort of profound revelation of the game’s mysteries, that we will discover the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42. Or possibly 4-4-2. But we won’t. Indeed, every statistical analysis of any aspect of football, no matter how broad or granular, should come with a Warning: Chaos Present red flashing light. Football is chaos: ‘complete disorder and confusion’. More specifically ‘the property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions, Jeff.’ Champions League? You’re having a right f***ing laugh There is no statistic for chaos but it is at play at all times, making unpredictable things happen. The reliable goalkeeper who inexplicably lets a ball between his legs, the 30-yard piledriver from a player who has never scored before. A gust of wind making a curling ball go the wrong side of the post. While it is invisible, cannot be calculated, counted or be relied on in any way, chaos is nonetheless the thing which dictates how every game develops. It is overarching and implicit in everything. We don’t like this. We want to think humans are in control. Look, we can measure everything. Indeed, we have built our civilisation on this concept. But we’re not. Football is chaos but we treat it as though it is a science. We treat it as though it will reveal its truths via deep analysis and thought, but the truth is we don’t know what is going to happen, we can never know what is going to happen and even if we think we do because we get some predictions right, ultimately football will make fools of all of us because of chaos. Because, for all the brilliant statistical analysis, it is always analysing in hindsight. It is measuring what has happened and while what has happened may be a good indicator of what will happen, it is never a guarantee because underneath it all lies chaos, constantly disrupting patterns and measures, constantly undermining what we fool ourselves into thinking are absolutes. And it is this which keeps us coming back for more, even though most of the time we don’t realise it. The best and worst rules changes in modern football The thought that anything can happen is anathema to the corporate business world of football which seeks profits from predictable outcomes by reducing chaos and increasing predictability and conformity. This has become such a profound influence on football, especially at the higher levels, that we mistake it for some sort of innate, natural state. It isn’t. But try as they might, they can never completely get rid of chaos. No-one is ever completely in control and anything that could possibly happen, might and occasionally will happen. Some find this disturbing because it feels too adrift, too free of moorings to sanity. Surely there must be some science behind the game; it can’t just be a load of random moves and happenings with unpredictable consequences. But that is exactly what it is. As clever and insightful as we can be, we can never know for sure what is going to happen from one moment to the next. Chaos rules and that’s how we ended up with Manchester City 4 Real Madrid 3. And that’s absolutely brilliant. ",positive

We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

We made big offers to him, and the club tried everything. “But for some weeks we cannot fight any more because we have the sanctions. We cannot adjust. We cannot continue, and so it is what it is. “He deserves my full support because he delivered incredible performances right until today. I’m just happy that I had the chance to coach him and to have him in the team. Because he was nothing but brilliant.” Real Madrid lost 4-3 to Manchester City on Tuesday night in a seven-goal thriller and Ancelotti is hoping their fans can make the difference at the Bernabeu in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final. “It is a defeat that leaves us alive in the second leg,” Ancelotti said. “We have to be better in our defensive aspect but I believe we are able to create problems for them also. Similar game? It’s really difficult to have and to see this open game as it was tonight. It will be a different game. “Of course Manchester City has the advantage, we have to consider this.

The respected manager took over at Everton at the end of 2019. The Toffees finished 12th in the Premier League in 2019/20. The likes of James Rodriguez, Allan and Ben Godfrey signed for Everton before the 2020/21 campaign. Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism They were in the running for a European place but they ended up 10th in the table. Ancelotti departed Everton that summer as he returned to Real Madrid. Rafael Benitez and Frank Lampard have since had spells at Everton, who are 18th in the league with six games to go. Ancelotti has now reflected on his time at Everton, saying it was a “miracle” that they got 59 points in 2020/21: “They (Everton) have a very passionate crowd, I really like that. It was bad luck not being able to enjoy Goodison Park more (due to the pandemic),”Ancelotti told Diario AS. “We got 59 points, a miracle, but we won more away than at home. It was a good period. (But) Liverpool is not Madrid, it was almost like living through a constant pandemic.” Ancelotti’s Real Madrid face Man City in the semi-finals of the Champions League. The first leg takes place at the Etihad on Tuesday night. Speaking on this game, he added: “I am aware that [I am the coach of] the biggest club in the world, the demand is high and I have to accept it. In Napoli I felt fine, but coming back to Madrid was special, I never thought it would happen. “There are two things, the happiness of being in the semi-finals in this type of match, and the worry. If you’re worried, you’re dealing with what might happen.” Elsewhere, Danny Murphy has claimed that Anthony Gordon is building himself a reputation for being a diver: “People get reputations and he’s diving too much. He’s a great player by the way. I really like him, Anthony Gordon. He’s a super talent, but I’ve watched Everton so much this season and he does dive a lot – and this is within the same game. “Because he’s got that lovely way about him, he’s got great balance, he can go both ways and he’s got a low centre of gravity, he does get fouled a lot.” ",positive

Tuchel even admitted he could expect repercussions for criticising Polish referee Szymon Marciniak in the wake of the Blues’ 5-4 Champions League quarter-final exit. Chelsea toppled Madrid 3-2 at the Bernabeu Stadium in their last-eight second-leg but exited the tournament on aggregate and only after extra time in Madrid. Chelsea played like champions on a mission made possible Karim Benzema’s late header ultimately killed off Chelsea’s hopes of a miracle comeback but German coach Tuchel was left to bemoan Marcos Alonso’s disallowed goal and a clutch of other frustrating issues. Tuchel also criticised referee Marciniak for “laughing and smiling” with Real boss Carlo Ancelotti at full-time. “I’m disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague, Carlo Ancelotti,” said Tuchel. “I know Carlo is a gentleman and a nice guy but when I wanted to go and say thank you I see him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponent coach. “I think this is the very, very worst time to do this, after 126 minutes with one team giving their heart and desire, fighting to the very last drop. “Afterwards you go as a coach and see the referee laughing and smiling with the other coach. I think it’s very, very bad timing.” Asked if he was frustrated with the VAR decision to rule out Alonso’s goal for handball, Tuchel continued: “Not only today, it is like this for some time, and now maybe I get problems. “If you play against Real Madrid you can maybe not expect everybody has the courage. I felt little decisions went against us also in the first-leg and today as well. “I did not see the goal but I told him I’m super disappointed he didn’t go to check it himself. “You should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair and isolated from the atmosphere (the VAR). “A referee has a certain style, things he allows and doesn’t allow, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own, then he could explain it better. “But this is just my opinion.

Last month, Spanish newspaper Marca were very critical of the Welshman, describing him as a ‘parasite’over their perception that he is robbing the club by running down his contract.

He was met with boos and whistles by some of the home crowd, with Ancelotti laughing off his reception, insisting that he – like Bale – was not concerned. “It didn’t bother me that he was whistled at,” Ancelotti said (via 90min) after Bale’s first home appearance in 654 days. “He’s training well and he wants to work hard and help the team.

The end of the season can be a time when the best-laid plans can start to look somewhat absurd. At the start of April, Tottenham Hotspur looked set fair for fourth place in the Premier League and a return to the Champions League. They’d won six of their seven previous matches, scoring 24 goals in the process, while Arsenal and Manchester United had both contrived to recall familiar insecurities to open a gap in the rails. A 5-1 win to put the dampers on the resurgency of Newcastle United at the start of April, coupled with Arsenal getting blown away at Crystal Palace, put Spurs in an unexpectedly secure position in fourth place in the table. But Arsenal recovered. Wins against Chelsea and Manchester United restored the order that had been in place prior to their three-game losing blip, while Spurs followed their little goal spree by somehow forgetting to score in successive matches against Brighton and Brentford, taking one point and handing the initiative and momentum back to Arsenal. Chatter concerning Antonio Conte’s future with the club reignited with rumours that Mauricio Pochettino might be due to be sacked by PSG. Small wonder Spurs seem so jittery so much of the time, if there’s talk of the manager upping sticks and walking awayevery time they fail to win a match. That nerviness was there against Leicester in the opening minutes. Ayoze Pérez had a shot deflected wide, Patson Daka hit the post with a 12-yard daisy cutter, and a low cross from Albrighton had to be desperately cleared by Sergio Romero, as Spurs fumbled an encouraging opening, allowing the visitors to dominate the early stages of the match. They even survived a penalty shout, when the ball appeared to hit Son Heung Min’s arm on the edge of the Spurs penalty area. With 20 minutes played, it looked as though familiar demons were presenting themselves. Two minutes later, Spurs had the lead. Son Heung Min and Harry Kane remain the Premier League’s outstanding attacking duo, but on this occasion the opportunity was rather presented to them on a plate. Son’s corner from the right swung outwards, and Leicester’s defenders chose an inopportune moment to forget about Kane, who powered a header under Kasper Schmeichel and in, under absolutely no pressure whatsoever. The goal didn’t seem to alter the tempo of the match. Spurs looked a little more confident having taken the lead, but Leicester continued to push and ask questions; any hope that their players might turn up with straw donkeys under their arms had been effectively silenced by the way they’d started the game. They pushed the ball around nicely and were nippy in the tackle, while Spurs, who’ve looked brittle all season, continued to look one touch of the ball from doing something calamitous. But as the first half came to an end, it was some chaotic Leicester defending that almost gifted Spurs a second goal. A deep Rodrigo Bentancur ball from the left saw Schmeichel come too far for a ball that he was never going to get, collide with one of his own defenders and then going down injured in the apparent belief that his recklessness warranted a foul for his team. No free-kick was given, but Spurs were unable to do anything productive with the half-chance. After ten minutes of the second half, Antonio Conte corrected his most surprising pre-match selection choice, bringing on Dejan Kulusevski to replace Lucas Moura, and the decision reaped its reward thanks to a combination of three of Spurs four stand-out players this season. A crunching tackle from Romero just inside the Leicester half won the ball, freeing the ball for Kulusevski on the right. He cut inside and fed the ball to Son, who was able to pivot onto his left foot and shoot across Schmeichel, rolling the ball into the corner of the goal to double the Spurs lead. The second goal finally seemed to settle a few Spurs nerves. Leicester had cause to feel somewhat aggrieved by being two goals down following an hour’s football to which they had made a full contribution, but as ‘When the Spurs go marching in’ rang around The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the second goal seemed to loosen limbs and inject an extra yard of pace into Spurs legs. And with 12 minutes to play, Kulusevski rolled the ball inside to Son, who almost absent-mindedly pinged a curling shot around Schemichel and into the top corner to put the result beyond any reasonable doubt, a late consolation goal from Kelechi Iheanacho, thirty seconds into stoppage-time, nothwithstanding. It was Leicester’s second attempt on goal of the second half; the first had come two minutes earlier. This seems to be the space within which Spurs exist. They have a small number of genuinely world-class players, and if those players are on their game, the moments which they are capable of providing will usually be enough to get them over the line. On this occasion it was the turn of Son Heung Min, a player who has mastered the art of getting the simple things right every time, and who has both the physical presence and the intelligence to be able to spot opportunities at a couple of steps removed, to provide the masterclass. Even when doing something that you can see is an extraordinary moment of skill and vision, his gait just makes it look… effortless. Those sudden bursts of pace. That apparent extra-sensory perception, when looking for an angle. It is surprising that any player could remain underrated in the current Premier League, but somehow he manages it, and perhaps that suits both him and Harry Kane. Kane is the England captain, a position that brings the limelight, whether he wants it or not. Son Heung-min continues to almost play in the shadows, but in those shadows he has matured into one of the finest attacking players in the league. It might even be enough to get Spurs back into the Champions League, even though the rest of the team can look so brittle at times, as though they might just snap in half at any moment. ",positive
65,https://www.football365.com/news/ravanelli-spurs-premier-league-title-conte-manchester-united-new-defence,Ravanelli claims Spurs can win title next season and Man Utd need a ‘whole new defence’,"Fabrizio Ravanelli reckons Spurs can win the Premier League title next season but admits they will have to “fight hard” to achieve that under Antonio Conte. Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive

The 26-year-old signed for Arsenal in 2011 when he was 16-years-old. He was unable to establish himself as a regular for the Gunners. Gnabry only played for them 18 times and he had an unsuccessful loan spell at West Brom during the 2015/16 season. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min The attacker left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen on a permanent basis.Following an impressive debut season, Bayern Munich activated his release clause to sign him. The Germany international has been a key player for Bayern Munich in recent seasons. He has grabbed 63 goals and 40 assists from his 169 outings across all competitions. So far this term, he has been involved in 26 goals from his 43 appearances. His future at Bayern is in doubt as his contract expires in 2023. It was reported last week that Gnabry has rejected Bayern’s latest contract offer. If he signed the deal, his salary would have doubled. Robinson thinks Tottenham should be “in the hunt” to sign Gnabry this summer: “Gnabry is a world-class player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “If he is to leave Bayern Munich you would like to think that Spurs are in the hunt for him. “It is going to be a big summer for Spurs. A lot will depend on whether Harry Kane stays at the club, which I hope he does. “I’d question whether Gnabry would get into the Tottenham team ahead of Son, Kane and Kulusevski right now. He’d be competition for Kulusevski but I don’t think that position is a priority at the moment. “That level of player is what you want Spurs to be signing though.” Elsewhere, ex-France international Jerome Rothen has warned PSG against pursuing Antonio Conte because he’s “more passionate about his chequebook” than Spurs. Reports emerged last week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team. That’s already problematic.” ",positive

Saint-Maximin has been terrific for the Geordies since joining from Nice in August 2019. Paul Ince belongs atop our Championship winners and losers The 25-year-old has made 27 Premier League appearances this term and has provided eight goal contributions. He is under contract at St James’ Park until 2026 after signing a contract extension in October 2020. Despite this, he has been linked with a transfer away from Newcastle in the summer transfer window, with Wolves reportedly interested. Former Tottenham goalkeeper Robinson believes Saint-Maximin is ‘part of the process’ at the Premier League club and has urged the Geordies not to sell the tricky winger. “I’d be surprised if they sold him,”he toldFootball Insider. “Yes, they have huge resources and huge financial power but they are not going to be able to attract the biggest names in football until they move up the Premier League table and compete for trophies. It is a process and he has to be part of that process for me. “I understand that they want to sign better players than Saint-Maximin but that has to come in time. “It is a process and I have no doubt that Saint-Maximin should be part of that process. They would be naive to sell him right now in my eyes.” Meanwhile,Newcastle‘s ‘number one forward target’ this summer is reportedly Hugo Ekitike and they are in ‘pole position’ to sign him from Stade Reims. The Magpies were heavily linked with the Frenchman during the winter transfer window. Ekitike has been a regular for Reims in Ligue 1 this season. He has missed several games due to injury but he has still played 24 times across all competitions. Football Insiderare now reporting that Newcastle remain interested in Ekitike as he is their ‘number one forward target’. They state that the Magpies are in ‘pole position’ to sign the young attacker. It is stated that Ekitike would cost around £25m this summer. ",positive
68,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-best-premier-league-signings-ronaldo-chelsea?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Top ten best Premier League signings of the season,"It does feel a little bit like Chelsea did some silly things in the summer when you compile a list of the ten best signings of the season. 10) Christian Eriksen (Brentford) Despite only playing 12.9% of Brentford’s Premier League games this season, Christian Eriksen has started a third of their wins. He has helped galvanise the Bees and guide them from genuine relegation trouble to the comfort of mid-table purgatory, lifting the mood as well as the quality. A goal and an assist barely scratch the surface of the Dane’s impact. But no amount of sentimental arithmetic is required to justify his inclusion, nor claims such as those made by Thomas Frank, who suggested even before Eriksen’s Brentford debut that he could be “potentially the greatest signing” in the club’s history. It is a truly remarkable story, life-affirming in every sense.  9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United) It helped eradicate the reasonable foundations upon which Manchester United were slowly building season upon season. It exacerbated the underlying culture of finger-pointing and blame deflection. It aggravated the growing divides in an increasingly fractured dressing room. It contributed to the professional demise of a manager he described as ‘an outstanding human being’. It exposed the fragile masculinity of an entire super club’s ego at immense expense. But Cristiano Ronaldo has scored loads. Only three players have done so more in the Premier League this season. The campaign is coming to an end and it was far from an easy one, despite his 18 goals – the rest of the Manchester United podium is made up by players on nine and six – scored in all competitions.  8) Craig Dawson (West Ham) In the time since Watford loaned West Ham defensive cover in the form of Craig Dawson – to the jubilation of most connected to Vicarage Road – the Hornets have gone down, come back up and are currently on course to slide into the Championship once more. The 31-year-old had been relegated at the end of his previous two Premier League seasons before linking up with David Moyes, who identified a solid and reliable centre-half when others saw a limited harbinger of potential top-flight doom. By April of last year, the Hammers made it expressly clear that Dawson would be joining on a permanent basis. He has carried on precisely where he left off in terms of consistency and quiet imperiousness, even taking a career-first European campaign in his stride. West Ham signed two central defenders last summer and not only is Dawson roughly as good as his regular partner at one-fifteenth of the price, he also hasn’t yet been revealed to abuse his pets.   7) Tino Livramento (Southampton) The fee itself seems to be on some sort of sliding scale, anywhere between £25m to £38m, reduced from £50m due to clauses that stipulate Chelsea are due some of the profit from Tino Livramento’s next move. But the buy-back option the Blues insisted upon when selling the right-back to Southampton seems destined to be cited extensively over the next two seasons or so. The only question is whether someone else gets there first and locks down their right-back position for the next decade. It is entertaining to see Chelsea start Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso as their full-backs, considering Livramento and Tariq Lamptey were sold to Premier League clubs for a combined £10m within the last couple of years. The former has followed a similar trajectory to the latter, leaving Stamford Bridge for more playing opportunities and immediately transforming from highly rated academy graduate with no senior experience to regular top-flight starter courted and admired by a rapidly expanding gaggle of clubs. Southampton was the perfect choice in many ways: Ralph Hasenhuttl is a tremendous coach; their style of play is expansive enough for an adventurous defender with an insatiable work ethic to stand out; and Saints have shown countless times that when the moment comes, they will not stand in the way of a player who feels ready to take the next step. There are few better places to develop before moving on with your stock exponentially improved. St Mary’s is the ideal place for Livramento right now.  6) Cristian Romero (Tottenham) Five players featured at centre-half in a Premier League game for Tottenham last season. Eric Dier, Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sanchez, Joe Rodon and Ben Davies took turns in forming the crux of a defence that could not afford a viable platform for a teammate who led both the goalscoring and assist providing charts for the campaign. The departure of elder statesmen Alderweireld, one year after kindred spirit Jan Vertonghen’s own sale, necessitated the biggest change in the club’s backline for at least half a decade. The onus fell on Cristian Romero to raise the standards closer to the daunting height of his Belgian predecessors. The 23-year-old channels the passing range and composure of Alderweireld, blending that with Vertonghen’s assurance in bringing the ball forward. But Romero brings his own attributes to the table, namely an unmatched aggression, intrinsic physicality and ability to read the game clearly. He has been far from faultless but then it is worth considering what he is being asked to do in terms of leading an often slapdash defence as one of its youngest components and a new signing to a notoriously difficult league.  5) Emmanuel Dennis (Watford) Watford might yet slip into the shallow abyss, ready to resurface at the next available opportunity, but Emmanuel Dennis has surely done enough to skip the relegation chapter and sustain himself on a regular top-flight diet. Interest from Villarreal is both understandable and likely only the genesis of a possible auction for his services, even if that rhythmic flow of goals in the winter has stalled since the appointment of Roy Hodgson. Nine for the season, with five assists, is a better combined total than Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sadio Mane. Dennis does not discriminate against opponents either. He has scored against as many teams in the top half as the bottom, while those goals have come in five wins and four defeats. The numbers produced in a relegation-battling team under three vastly different managers underline the 24-year-old’s versatility and durability. And that is even before mentioning he has at least three more nutmegs than any other player across Europe’s top five leagues. What a menace.  4) Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) In terms of exceeding expectations, Aaron Ramsdale would be this season’s runaway leader and a probable contender for one of the best Premier League signings ever. His pursuit was supposedly emblematic of a misguided and haphazard transfer philosophy at Arsenal, a frivolous purchase of a perennially relegated back-up when such lavish funds were better focused elsewhere in the squad, a quota-filling acceptance of rank mediocrity from a broken club. Jamie O’Hara bellowed loudest during the chorus of criticism, at which point the world ought to have realised it was probably a decent move. Ramsdale has given Arsenal a stability and seriousness they had lacked for years between the sticks, emitting an air of confidence that has permeated through the defence and energised the rest of the team. It only works in games against sides other than Manchester City, Liverpool or Crystal Palace but that is still most of them. Alisson and Ederson are the only shot-stoppers – a reductive second mention considering Ramsdale’s excellence on the ball –with more clean sheets this season, fitting considering he is certainly among the best of the rest outside the established leading two.  3) Conor Gallagher (Crystal Palace) When used properly and not as a surreptitious means to hoard as many players as humanly possible, the loan market can be an incredibly effective way to help a player evolve and mature. In many cases with a club of comparable size to Chelsea, it is an option overlooked by managers who prefer to work personally with potential first-teamers to ensure their specific tactical ideals are imparted directly, rather than having those waters muddied and confused by a different coach with a completely contrasting approach for a season. But sending players out temporarily to further their progression is a proven practice, provided the short-term destination is chosen carefully. Thomas Tuchel could not have designed a better holding area than Crystal Palace, a team discovering its exciting new identity after years of enforced but necessary stagnation, nor a more suitable interim custodian than former midfield general Patrick Vieira. Conor Gallagher is thriving at Selhurst Park with the Frenchman’s guiding hand, offering Chelsea hope of a bright future when they most need it.  2) Jose Sa (Wolves) The departure of Rui Patricio seemed potentially ruinous for Wolves, such was their initial position as punchers in this relationship when the Portuguese signed upon promotion in summer 2018. The club’s previous regular starting goalkeeper in the Premier League had been Wayne Hennessey so a European Championship winner with almost 100 international caps and substantial experience in continental competition was as close as they were going to get to securing that presence of mind without bringing the Welshman back to Molineux. But Patricio’s exit for Roma, especially when coinciding with Nuno Espirito Santo’s farewell, warranted a changing of the guard. Bruno Lage has been an inspired hire and Jose Sa perhaps an even bigger upgrade in his position. He has the highest save percentage of any Premier League goalkeeper this season, emphasising the “massive impact” Gary Neville recently said Sa had had at Wolves since joining. That performance against Leeds was bloody weird but to sell and replace a guaranteed starter in any position is difficult enough; improving your goalkeeper at almost half the price as the one you’re letting go is transfer witchcraft.  1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace) Perhaps it is a coincidence that the worst performance of this Crystal Palace season came in the only game Marc Guehi missed. Tottenham eased past the Eagles on Boxing Day as Joachim Andersen and James Tomkins struggled and Wilfried Zaha was sent off. Vieira missed a game that Covid-hit Palace forlornly tried to have postponed despite making a solitary change to the starting line-up from their previous match. Andersen for Guehi was the one alteration. Chelsea only possess the option to match any bid on a defender they sold for £18m in the summer; whether they have the facilities to rival what would surely be a monstrous bid is another matter. But it is funny to see their current mild panic over another position they voluntarily weakened. And in any event, Guehi and Palace seem understandably enamoured with one another, while the occasional captain has more than four years left on his contract. That will not stop clubs from trying to pry him away from south-east London as a defender with no discernible weakness continues to shine in his first season of senior top-flight football. He really shouldn’t be this good, particularly when you consider he has played 2,610 Premier League minutes this season and the only five other centre-halves under the age of 22 to feature (Andrew Omobamidele, Charlie Cresswell, Wesley Fofana, Nathan Collins and Jarrad Branthwaite) have 1,568 between them.

Raphinha joined the West Yorkshire club in 2020 after they were promoted back to the Premier League. FA as regulators? They have done enough damage already He has been terrific since moving to England. Last season the 25-year-old scored six goals and provided nine assists as Leeds finished ninth in the league. Raphinha has carried last term’s form into 2021/22 having scored nine goals in 27 top-flight appearances. Barcelona and Liverpool have both been linked with the Brazilian international. Fabrizio Romano revealed on Sunday that Barca have been in ‘advanced talks’ with Raphinha’s agent Deco since February. Meanwhile, Sport reckon that Leeds turned down a €35m bid from the La Liga giants, with the player keen to play under ‘brave’ coach Xavi Hernandez. And the club’s former goalkeeper Robinson believes that his old club should look to cash in on Raphinha at the end of the season. “I’d sell him, I’d let him go,” Robinson toldMOT Leeds News. “I think the way that he’s performed and his attitude this season has been in and out. “You know what a top-quality player he is and what a brilliant talent he is. But he hasn’t done it on a regular basis this year. “And if they can bring in £100million – or near £100million – for him, that money will go straight back into the squad to rebuild in the summer. “I don’t think that would be a bad bit of business.” Elsewhere,Leeds are reportedly interested in signing Manchester United youngster James Garner, who is currently on loan at Nottingham Forest. The 21-year-old progressed through the ranks at Man Utd. He made his senior debut for them during the 2018/19 campaign. Phil Hay ofThe Athletichas revealed that Garner has been ‘mentioned recently’ as a ‘target’ for Leeds. The West Yorkshire outfit will likely have to stay up if they are to have any chance of signing the midfielder on loan. ",positive

This was a huge win for Spurs, one in which a team that has become renowned for its determined inconsistency and tendency to lurch from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again somehow managed to make it four wins from the last five league games. They still look unlikely to pip Arsenal to fourth but are now in pole position for fifth and exceedingly well placed for a top-six finish after last season’s seventh place marked their first failure to get there since 2009. West Ham looked understandably weary after Thursday night’s 120-minute effort against Sevilla, and Spurs were at their lethal best on the counterattack. All three goals were created by Harry Kane. Two were finished by Son Heung-min, who was also there to pressure Kurt Zouma into diverting the ball into his own net for the opener.  But for all that Kane and Son doing their thing produced the goals, this Spurs performance was built on the foundations provided by a couple of more recent arrivals. Spurs have been an utter shambles in the transfer market for years. They made a total mess of it in the second half of Mauricio Pochettino’s reign and haven’t done much right since his departure. Since the summer of 2015 when Son and Toby Alderweireld arrived for a combined fee only a shade north of £40m and the following year’s acquisition of Victor Wanyama for £12m it has not really gone well. Lucas Moura has been decent enough. Your Hojbjergs and Sanchezes and Llorentes have had their moments, but it’s been mainly a tale of woe. The most high-profile of those failures, Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele, came in for big money and were among those shipped out on deadline day in January. But another assured defensive display from Cristian Romero and stylish midfield marshalling from Rodrigo Bentancur showed that Spurs, while still capable of a Bryan Gil-shaped brainfart, might finally be getting things right. Romero arrived initially on loan in the summer and Antonio Conte has already confirmed they will take up the £42m option to make that permanent at the end of the season. It’s a bargain for a fantastic defender who just as importantly is also tremendous fun and a worthy heir to Erik Lamela in the key Spurs role of “Argentinian p*ss-boiling sh*thouse”. Bentancur is already the best central midfielder Spurs have had since Mousa Dembele, a crucial cog in those peak Poch years. That under-rated crucialness has already been talked about enough to enter the realm of cliché, but that’s because it’s true. Spurs have never since then had a player capable of doing all the midfield things at once. Bentancur also carries himself and moves around the field precisely like Dimitar Berbatov, which again is a bonus. Factor in the impact made by Dejan Kulusevski and you have to consider the frankly alarming fact that Spurs, having bumblef*cked their way through January missing out on target after target and inadvertently helping out Liverpool actually managed to do something that is fiendishly difficult to do in January: significantly upgrade the first XI in two places at reasonable cost. Both Bentancur and Kulusevski are clever and technically proficient players. Those have been in short supply at Spurs in recent times beyond the obvious brilliance of the Kane-Son axis. It’s no coincidence that that pair’s productivity has increased since that pair came along. Spurs remain a fascinating and beguiling team. At their best, as they were today, they do look really very good indeed. They pose an obvious counterattacking threat that must forever be on the minds of opponents and today looked resolutely solid against a team that poses plenty of questions of its own. West Ham’s goal came from their only shot on target and the only real lapse as four Spurs players went for the same ball from a corner leaving Said Benrahma unmarked at the back post to cleverly steer the ball past Hugo Lloris. Even at 2-1 there wasn’t really much sign that West Ham would get back on terms, with a counter-attacking Spurs third always looking more likely. Only the banterous history of clashes between these two teams gave real promise of anything dramatic occurring here. Spurs will acknowledge this was a good time to meet the Hammers, who have done a superb job of balancing league and European endeavours this season but may find that harder and harder on the run-in. They still have three of the top four to face in their remaining eight league games. But that caveat should not take away from the quality of Spurs’ performance. They flew at West Ham early, expecting and pouncing on that weariness. The scoreline flattered the visitors in the end as Spurs overpowered a direct rival for European qualification. On this evidence you see the basis of a side that might not quite get fourth this season but can absolutely challenge for it next year. And yet there remains a fragility to the whole thing. Antonio Conte was delighted here and grinning wildly as he gave his players post-match bearhugs. But you still sense that one bad result or transfer snafu could see him decide to leave. A job swap with Pochettino still feels not only possible this summer, but also one that would suit all parties. One in which everyone is more where they belong. What is clear, though, is that for all their faults and for all the doubts over the long-term future, Conte at Spurs could yet really work. Or it could all be over two months from now. And right now both seem equally plausible outcomes. ",positive

The Arsenal winger has been consistently linked with a move to Liverpool of late. Jurgen Klopp is said to be a huge admirer of the Englishman. This is understandable as Saka has been in sensational form for the Gunners over the past couple of seasons. Liverpool have ‘quirky German’ and Man Utd in ninth? The 20-year-old has grabbed eight goals and five assists from his 27 appearances in the Premier League this term. Arsenal are able to demand a significant fee for Saka as he is under contract until 2024. Meanwhile, Salah’s situation remains up in the air. His deal is due to expire next year and he is yet to commit his future to Liverpool. Robinson believes Liverpool are a “big draw” and that Saka would be a suitable replacement for Salah: “He’s a top player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “There is always a draw with Liverpool, especially when you see the relationship Jurgen Klopp has with his players. You can see his man-management skills. Who wouldn’t want to play for him? “Liverpool are competing for every major honour. It is a big draw to play for that club right now. “If they can finance a move for Saka, that would be the level of player they should be looking at to replace Salah if he left.” Elsewhere, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City are reportedly interested in a move for Torino star Gleison Bremer. The Premier League sides have a ‘presence’ in the chase for the Brazilian centre-back, along with Inter Milan, Juventus, AC Milan and Bayern Munich. That’s according to TuttoMercatoWeb (via Sport Witness), who claim the Torino are ‘awaiting the auction’ in the summer for the 24-year-old. Tuttosport have added to the speculation on Thursday, claiming many clubs have ‘lined up’ for the ‘complete player’. The report states that an offer of €25m would be sufficient to persuade the Torino to part with Bremer, but the Serie A side must decide whether to ‘monetise as much as possible’ or accept a player as part of the defender’s sale. It’s said that chairman Urbano Cairo would prefer to sell the star to England for ‘cash’.

Jesus has been heavily linked with a move to the Gunners of late. Fabrizio Romano revealed back in March that he would be available for around £50m. Man City paid £27m to sign Jesus fromPalmeiras in 2016. He has grabbed 95 goals and 46 assists from his 232 outings for the English side. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Jesus has been in fantastic form in recent weeks. He scored four goals against Watford last month and he netted against Real Madrid at the Etihad. Meanwhile, Man City are closing in on the signing of Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. Di Marzio has suggested that Jesus would be “difficult” to replace if he joined Arsenal: “Seeing [Gabriel Jesus] playing against Real Madrid, I don’t think Guardiola will allow him to leave, even if they sign Haaland. Which they will, because they are very, very close,” Di Marzio told wettfreunde. “They still need another striker. A different type of striker. Haaland is a different type. [Gabriel Jesus] will stay because it’s difficult to find a player like him. Manchester City doesn’t need to sell a player in order to get funds to buy another player. They have the possibility to buy all the players they want. “It depends on Gabriel Jesus in the end and if he is okay with playing less with Haaland coming. It depends on his attitude, knowing another incredible striker like Haaland will arrive.” Di Marzio went onto suggest that Haaland may not “arrive and play immediately” next season: “When Jack Grealish arrived last year for £100m, Gabriel Jesus stayed, and now he’s playing and Grealish is on the bench. So nobody knows if Haaland will arrive and play immediately, and be one of the ‘untouchable’ strikers of Guardiola. “You never know with [Guardiola]. If you don’t do the right tactical movements that Guardiola wants, then you stay on the bench. “I think Gabriel Jesus is in the perfect situation now in Guardiola’s system.

The Toffees currently sit 18th in the Premier League table. They are two points behind Burnley, who have won their last two games. Four reasons why Everton fans are firmly behind under-fire Frank Lampard Lampard’s side have only won two of their last ten games in the league. They have some tough fixtures coming up. The Merseyside club face Chelsea, Leicester City, Watford, Brentford, Crystal Palace and Arsenal before the 2021/22 season ends. Richards thinks Burnley are “more equipped” than Everton “to cope with a relegation fight”: “People should not be looking at Lampard to produce attractive patterns of play or anything like that now — this is an unforgiving battle for survival and Everton have to secure every point possible in any way they can,” Richards wrote for The Daily Mail. “Style means nothing at this stage if you are the wrong side of the dreaded line. “What makes me most anxious for Everton is Burnley’s change in momentum. I was critical of the decision to sack Sean Dyche, I couldn’t understand it, but Mike Jackson has galvanised his team and they look a proper threat. “With all respect to them, too, the players will not be flustered about being down in that part of the table. They are perhaps more equipped to cope with a relegation fight and have experience of dealing with what it is required to stay afloat. “This, clearly, is unfamiliar territory for Everton, whose sequence of 14 defeats in 19 games earlier in the campaign had me drawing parallels with Aston Villa. “There will have been moments then, like when they beat Arsenal and Leeds, they thought everything would be fine. “Nobody, unfortunately, can say they will be fine now. On Sunday they face a huge challenge against a Chelsea team who will be determined to take the frustrations they felt following their draw with Manchester United out on them. “If Everton have to play as they did against Liverpool to get a point, who cares? It would enable them to build belief for the next game at Leicester before a critical trip to Watford. “Slip up and the confidence that is already fragile will be zapped further. This is a fight they cannot lose.” ",negative

Lukaku failed to take a golden chance on Wednesday night after being brought on as a second-half substitute in the Blues’ 3-1 loss to Real Madrid in the firs leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Karim Benzema’s stunning hat-trick handed Real total control at the midway point of their quarter-final with the defending champions. Brilliant Benzema highlights why Chelsea must bin Lukaku Lukaku has scored 12 times in 36 appearances in all competitions this season with his last Premier League goal coming back in December. But Richards defended Lukaku after the Belgium international missed a key chance for Chelsea on Wednesday and hailed him as a “top quality player” who is lacking confidence. “He missed a bad chance today,” Richards said on CBS Sports‘ coverage of the game. “It’s what the manager gives you. At this moment in time, he’s not played at the level, he doesn’t feel loved. He’s come out and done his interview.” Carragher, though, disagreed that you can pin the blame on Thomas Tuchel over Lukaku. Richards’ fellow pundit said: “It’s not down to the manager, it’s down to Lukaku. It’s not about the love from a manager. You spend £100million on a player to make a difference in these games, and he can’t even get in the team.” But Richards continued by insisting that Lukaku is “obviously low on confidence” although he did admit that the Chelsea striker needs to improve. The former Manchester City defender added: “But at the same time, if you don’t feel loved somewhere… a breakdown in communication has happened somewhere. “Today, he came on and he missed a sitter. It’ll be on all the socials and everyone will be taking the mick out of him. He’s a top quality player, he’s just going through a tough time at this moment.” What is going on with Romelu Lukaku?

Carragher added: “His goal record is fantastic, if you look at his numbers. But I always feel whenever we’ve spoken about Lukaku, he gets a lot of goals but there’s always been a ‘but’. “Even his record in the Premier League, if you look at the teams, it was never against the biggest teams. “He’s a very good player, but when you’re talking about [Karim] Benzema, when you’re talking about Harry Kane, when you’re talking about [Robert] Lewandowski, for me he’s just always been a bit below that. “I don’t question the manager at all in that situation.

But the fans should know better than that.” Fellow pundit Carragher revealed his concern over displays such as this “creeping into our game”, claiming there’s no escape for footballers now due to social media.

The Gunners were not shy in their pursuit of the Serbian striker after ostracising Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang following a disciplinary breach. How to embarrass Qatar, English moralising and… After failing to land Vlahovic – who joined Juventus for around £73m – Arsenal decided to let Aubameyang join Barcelona. Mikel Arteta is short of options up front after letting the Gabon captain leave. Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette are now the only out-and-out strikers in his first-team squad. The Spanish manager appeared to put all of his eggs in one basket as he pursued Vlahovic. After he joined Juventus, Arsenal did not go after an alternative No. 9. And speaking in his Daily Mail column, Richards has said the signing of the 22-year-old – who has 21 goals in 28 Serie A matches this term – would have made the January window a “perfect” one for the Gunners. “Football is evolving, and Arteta is from the new school of managers, a man who not long ago was playing and can understand what a dressing room needs to run smoothly,”wroteRichards. “He will know what his squad needs to keep them happy, on and off the pitch. “You should not forget, either, that Arteta has been brave. It was a big call to allow Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s sale to Barcelona in January. If he had signed Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina as his replacement, the transfer window would have been perfect.” Meanwhile,William Saliba has once again discussed his Arsenal future, revealing his desire to “play as a starter” next season. “They are often in contact with my agent,”Saliba – who is currently on loan at Marseille – toldL’Equipe.“They send me messages. They watch my matches. They tell me that we have to continue like this. “I haven’t played much with the Gunners. The coach has made his choices, that’s life. I left on loan, I put the matches together, and I became an international. What happened to me forged a tougher mind, it is not because you have cost €30m that you are playing. I take it positively, even if there are times that you wonder.” Saliba added:“Of course, I can’t be happy on Arsenal’s bench. I want to play as a starter.

Coutinho leftLiverpoolfor Barcelona in January 2018 for a fee which would rise to £142million if all conditions were met. But the Brazilian has struggled to find consistent form in La Liga and spent the 2019-20 season on loan at Bayern Munich. Gossip: Juventus never saying never on Mo Salah move The Brazil international is now back in the Premier League and on top form once again playing under former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa. Micah Richards and Alan Shearer both picked Coutinho in their top ten list of best number 10s to play in the Premier League, with host ofBBC Match of the Day Top 10 Podcast, Gary Lineker, also praising the Brazilian. “Coutinho, he’s a breathtakingly talented footballer. He didn’t quite do it at Barcelona though did he? We saw him at Liverpool, bending them into the top corner,” said Lineker. “Sometimes when players go to a monster of a football club, it can be a little bit too much for you. People think there is a lot of pressure on players in clubs in this country. I got off to a good start [at Barcelona] and quite enjoyed that side of things. The best part of my game was my mental strength. To understand what it is like there, it is so much bigger than anything here.” And Richards added: “I’m surprised it didn’t work out for him though, I thought it would have been perfect for him. When he left [Liverpool], he was the best player in the league wasn’t he?” Meanwhile, former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson thinks Arsenal should sign Coutinho permanently in the summer transfer window. “If Arsenal got the chance to sign him then they need to sign him,” Johnson toldBettingOdds. “He would be the best number ten they’ve got without a shadow of a doubt. I think the move is a possibility if Arsenal get fourth. I should be Coutinho’s agent as I’ll never stop singing his praises. “When this player enjoys his football then he’s got all sorts in his locker.

Last month, it was reported that the two players were embroiled in a ‘power struggle’ at Man Utd. Maguire signed for United in 2019 from Leicester City for around £80m. He has been their captain since January 2020. Gossip: Man Utd want £24m Palace star; Neymar to Newcastle The Red Devils have struggled this season and Maguire’s form has declined in comparison to his previous campaigns. Ronaldo meanwhile has been one of their only bright sparks. He returned to the club last summer from Juventus. He netted a hat-trick earlier this month as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 at Old Trafford. The 36-year-old has popped up with some vital goals this term. If they did not have him, they would arguably be lower in the Premier League table than fifth. Richards thinks a “break” from being captain “would do Maguire good”. He also believes Ronaldo should take the armband because he can deal with the responsibility: “The captain… basically becomes the scapegoat [when a team is struggling],” Richards wrote for The Mail. “I’m pretty sure if Liverpool were in United’s position — not competing for trophies and labouring in the Premier League — Jordan Henderson would be in a similar position. “I’m not calling for Harry to be stripped of the role completely. Perhaps he could do with having the weight off his shoulders for the rest of this campaign. He hasn’t stepped out of line, he shouldn’t be punished. But perspective needs applying to what he is experiencing and the impact it is having on his form. “For the moment, a break from the responsibility would do him good. He needs support to return to being the outstanding defender we know and expect him to be again.” Richards added:“When Ronaldo returned last summer, the one question everyone asked was: ‘Is he going to be captain?’ he said. ‘Hindsight suggests United should have headed it all off and given him the responsibility because, if things aren’t going right, he knows how to deal with it with his big personality. “More often than not — and his stunning hat-trick against Tottenham last week was the latest evidence — Ronaldo has been the man to step forward; he’s built differently to everyone else in that squad. It’s not a criticism of them, it’s a reference to the fact Ronaldo is one of a kind.” ",positive

One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Erik ten Hag has been confirmed as the club’s new permanent boss ahead of this summer. Rangnick has only won ten of his 26 games in charge of Man Utd across all competitions. They exited the Champions League and they are five points adrift of the top four. It was announced on Friday that Rangnick will be Austria’s new manager. It is worth noting that he will continue working for Man Utd in a consultancy capacity. Jordan believes that “the whole outlook is wrong” at Man Utd currently: “I felt [Ralf] Rangnick would go into Manchester United and he would be a sea change, and have the courage of his convictions to be able to put his foot down,” Jordan told talkSPORT. “I think it is much more difficult than that, the entire culture at Manchester United is wrong. The fabric of the playing squad is wrong, they have bought the wrong players, and they are going to have to change it. “I think if you put Pep Guardiola in for six months, he would have struggled with the current crop of players. “The attitude and outlook of disposition of that football club from the owners, to the fans, the whole outlook is wrong. “The fans are not satisfied because of the Glazers and the performance of the team, but anybody could have done it for six months. “But why would he want to be a consultant? He is a person who makes decisions and wants to implement them. “The problem is that he wasn’t involved in the selection process of the manager – he obviously has not been as Erik ten Hag has not spoken to him. “As a consultant, he basically parachutes in and looks at other people’s work, and let others implement his decisions.” Jordan went onto suggest that Darren Fletcher and John Murtough should be “working a little bit lower down the food chain”: “Darren Fletcher is not fit for purpose in his role, and neither is John Murtough – you need to get the best in class. “I am sure they are very decent individuals, but perhaps they should be working a little bit lower down the food chain inside Manchester United, so the club can start to bridge the gap. “Not just on the pitch, but off it, because off it will influence what happens on it.” ",negative

Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down Asked at a press conference if he knew whether Walker would return this season, Guardiola said on Friday: “I don’t know right now.” Man City are at a critical juncture in their season, with little margin for error, as they chase domestic and European glory. With five Premier League games remaining they hold a one-point lead over Liverpool at the top of the table. Their tie with Real is also delicately poised after Tuesday’s compelling 4-3 draw against the Spanish giants at the Etihad Stadium. With a number of crunch fixtures ahead, Guardiola said it was important to focus on the players he knew were fit. He said: “He’s injured – unfortunately for all of us and him especially – but I don’t pay attention. He has to work to come back as soon as possible. I am focused on the rest of the players.” Fellow defender John Stones is also unavailable this weekend after hobbling off in the first half in midweek but could be in contention by Wednesday. Guardiola said: “For tomorrow John is out and we will see for Wednesday.” With the title race heading for a tight finish, Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was named as Football Writers’ Association men’s player of the year on Friday. The Egyptian, who has scored 30 goals for Jurgen Klopp’s quadruple-chasing Reds this season, beat City’s Kevin De Bruyne into second place. Guardiola offered his congratulations to Salah but hinted at possible frustration as he did so. He said: “Congratulations to Salah. Jurgen said they have the best keeper, the second-best keeper in the world, the best central defender, the best holding midfielder, the best striker – so it’s normal they win all the awards.” Klopp this week signed a new contract with Liverpool, committing himself to the Anfield outfit until 2026. Guardiola’s contract at City expires at the end of next season but he insists Klopp’s situation will not prompt him to try to hurry his own renewal decision. The Spaniard said: “I don’t know. The focus is on Leeds. That’s the important thing. “Congratulations to Jurgen and Liverpool. I think it’s really good for the Premier League. I wish him all the best for the future. My future is Leeds, our future is Leeds and then the end of the season. “I’m enjoying this part of the season and after we’ll have time.

Jesus and Manchester City should consciously uncouple Guardiola says he has “so much respect” for 13-time European champions Real Madrid and insists City can not compete with the La Liga club’s history. “We arrive how we arrive,” the Spanish manager said (via the Manchester Evening News). “Different competitions, it’s an honour to be here in a semi-final against top teams like Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern (Munich), Liverpool. They’ve been here many times, we have in recent years. It’s an honour to be here. “Now I feel how nice it is to be there with the best teams in Europe. Try to be ourselves, do two exceptional games to reach the final. We can do it. We have so much respect for Real Madrid, how good they are. “You want to reach the final, like Liverpool and Villarreal, but never underestimate what we have done to be here. “If we have to compete with their history, we don’t have any chance. It speaks for itself. “We have the desire to compete with them. It’s a chance to improve, we want to try it. Try, suffer when we suffer, stick together. Try to attack best as possible. Before the last decade we were never here, reaching the final is always a good lesson for us. An honour 🙌 #ManCity #UCL pic.twitter.com/JRHzwtYwdH — Manchester City (@ManCity) April 25, 2022 “The fact they have been here many times, always I said two times in the row being in semi-finals is so difficult. Many good teams are not here, one day we won’t be here. “So demanding, you have to be so precise. I told players to enjoy this moment. We don’t know if we’ll be back in this position. Enjoy it and try to be ourselves in good moments and bad moments.” Guardiola continued: “The two games against Sporting, the first game against Atletico we played to not concede. The second leg we couldn’t have conceded, they were better. We have to defend well. (Karim) Benzema scores lot of goals in his career, fantastic player.” The City boss insists that he will never stop striving to reach new highs in his managerial career, with the Premier League leaders chasing their first Champions League triumph. He said: “As far as being a manager, personally my accomplishment will never be accomplished, I’ll have another dream to reach. We decide together with the club, everyone says good, bad, accomplished or not.” Guardiola is facing a selection dilemma and is yet to decide his line-up for Tuesday’s match at the Etihad. He adds that Kyle Walker and John Stones are unlikely to feature. “They are doubts, Kyle didn’t train last ten days, John since Brighton. That’s why I don’t know if they will train. We see how they feel, tomorrow take a decision. “We have a training session today and see how the players are. Tonight, tomorrow, decide the line-up. I wait for the training session to see how they feel. I’m sure players will play in positions they aren’t used to but they will do their best.”  ",positive

Arsenal paid £27m to sign the centre-back from Saint-Etienne in 2019. He is yet to make his debut for the Gunners. After spells at Saint-Etienne and Nice, the 21-year-old joined Marseille on loan before this season. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Saliba has been one of the standout players in Ligue 1 this term as he has played 49 times for Marseille across all competitions. His form for Marseille led to him making his senior debut for France earlier this year. The defender stated last month that there is ‘a chance’ that he will spend another season at Marseille. Henry feels for Saliba as he was forced out on loan before making an error for Arsenal: “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” Henry told Amazon Prime. “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” Elsewhere,Darren Bent has said that he would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” ",positive

The Switzerland international has been linked with a move to Manchester United since Jose Mourinho’s time at the club. MEDIAWATCH: Proof Man Utd > Liverpool as ‘secret’ manager decision made Akanji opened the door to a future move to Old Trafford in an interview in October 2018. He said:“Many know that Manchester United has been my favourite club since childhood. “It would be nice to play there, but that’s not an issue right now. “I am very satisfied in Dortmund, I want to win titles with BVB and compete in many more big tournaments with the Swiss national teams.” And with United said to be on the lookout for defensive reinforcements, particularly with the increased scrutiny over the performances of Harry Maguire, Fichajes (via Caughtoffside) claim a deal for the Dortmund star has already been ‘tied up’ as a replacement for the club captain. Akanji’s contract expires in the summer of 2023 and a report in February claimed the centre-back was eyeing a bigger contract than Dortmund are willing to offer. United boss Ralf Rangnick was said to be leading the charge for Akanji, with the Red Devils offering a four-year deal with a salary of€15m, three times what he currently earns with the Bundesliga side. Meanwhile, a report claims the Unitedboard have whittled a list of potential new permanent managers at Old Trafford down to four –Mauricio Pochettino, Erik ten Hag, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique. Multiple sources admit they would “be surprised ifPochettino or Ten Hag were not at the helm”. And reports linking Thomas Tuchel with United were labelled “media talk not reality”, with it expected Chelsea’s new owners will make keeping Tuchel their priority at Stamford Bridge. United’s new permanent manager will be derived from the four-man shortlist unless “there is a massive change in circumstance and a top manager that fits the long-term direction suddenly becomes available.” They want a new manager in place ahead of the new season, but suggestions that a pre-agreement could be struck by the end of this month are “overly optimistic.” ",positive

The Scottish champions stunned the Bundesliga outfit with a 4-2 win in the first leg of the knockout round play-off in Germany last week and the return game in Glasgow was equally pulsating. UEFA must act now that Russia has done the same in Ukraine Gers skipper James Tavernier scored from the spot in the 22nd minute but goals from England international Jude Bellingham on the half-hour mark and striker Donyell Malan had the super-charged Bundesliga visitors ahead at the interval. Tavernier turned anxiety back to joy when he levelled in the 57th minute and Rangers tightened up in the nervy second half where Ryan Kent had a ‘goal’ chopped off through VAR but at the end of a frenetic night the Light Blues fans celebrated one of the finest European outcomes in the club’s history. It was all set up for one of the great Euro nights in Govan but there was always the chance of things going wrong, given the level of opposition. Dortmund went into the game on the back of a morale-boosting 6-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday but star striker Erling Haaland was again missing with an abductor problem. From the side which lost in the first leg, Emre Can, Thomas Meunier, Nico Schulz and Thorgan Hazard came back in while Giovanni Van Bronckhorst named the same Gers team that started in Dortmund. Before the game dozens of travelling fans spilled on to the pitch and had to be restrained back into their section by police and stewards, adding a sense of menace to the night. On the pitch, as boss Marco Rose promised, the visitors attacked and as Dortmund swarmed all over the home side the Gers goal survived early scares with an effort from Bellingham hitting a post before the ball was eventually cleared. Respite came from a rare foray when Gers winger Kent was tripped just inside the box by Julian Brandt, referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz pointing to the spot. The Famous Glasgow Rangers 👊#RFCBVB | #UEL pic.twitter.com/nQ7B0mlPhb — Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) February 24, 2022 Ibrox erupted when Tavernier slammed the penalty high past keeper Gregor Kobel, beating him again from 12 yards as he had last week. Moments later, as Dortmund came storming back, Brandt’s powerful drive from the edge of the box drew a terrific save from Allan McGregor but the visitors were not to be denied and when Bellingham found himself with only the Rangers keeper to beat after a mistake by Connor Goldson and the English teenager stroked the ball past him with assurance. The home side were still mostly defending but when midfielder Joe Aribo slipped in Scott Arfield on the break his shot from close range was parried by Kobel and Gers striker Alfredo Morelos blasted the rebound against defender Mats Hummels as Dortmund escaped. However, there was no escape for Rangers when they were again pressed back into their own box with Malan getting a touch to a Bellingham flick to slide the ball past McGregor from 10 yards. Leon Balogun replaced Borna Barisic for the start of the second-half where Morelos hit the side-netting with a drive before Kobel saved a decent effort. However, again it was Tavernier who came up trumps when he flashed a deep cross from rampaging defender Calvin Bassey in from six yards. Kent then had the ball in the net in the 67th minute from a Morelos pass on the break but after looking at his VAR monitor, the referee controversially ruled it out, judging a foul on Can by the Colombia striker. Dortmund were throwing everything at Rangers and Kent then had a breakaway halted by the impressive speed of Schulz. The game stretched and the home side enjoyed more positive possession but were happy to keep the scoreline as it was on what was a great night for Rangers and Scottish football. ",positive

The centre-back’s contract expires in 2023 and the Bundesliga are struggling to persuade him to sign an extension. READ MORE: Ranking Premier League clubs on subs used this season Akanji currently earns around€5m a year and club chiefs are reportedly willing to up his pay to€8m. That’s according to Bild (via Sport Witness), who claim the Switzerland international is holding out for at least€10m – a deal that would put him among the top earners at the club. But Dortmund are said to be unwilling to stretch to the 26-year-old’s demands and ‘this problem could now solve itself’ with United ‘serious’ about signing the defender. It’s claimed United boss Ralf Rangnick is leading the charge for Akanji, with the Red Devils offering a four-year deal with a salary of€15m. A transfer fee of around€25m is said to be ‘under discussion’, for a player whose ‘dream’ is to play in the Premier League, with United his ‘dream club’. The report states that if United want Akanji a transfer is ‘very likely’ in the summer. Meanwhile, United legend Paul Scholes claims his former side have been “very lucky” under Rangnick. Anthony Elanga came off the bench to secure a draw in Madrid on Wednesday night, but United were second best for much of the game against Atletico. Rangnick was frustrated with his side’s display but Scholes believes it was a “typical performance”. “When you say strange performance, I don’t think it is a strange… it is a typical Man Utd performance these days, since November when this manager came in,” he said on BT Sport. “It’s been very much the same, they have been very lucky to get through games and win games but you have to say his record is very good. I think his substitutes as well, on Sunday he made a big call bringing Fred on [and] Fred scores the winner. “Tonight he has made a big call, we were all looking thinking “these subs look a little bit strange” and then Elanga comes on and scores a goal. So it is not strange for me, it is just a typical Man Utd performance tonight.” ",positive

In an incredible encounter in the Westfalenstadion, Gers captain James Tavernier scored a VAR-awarded penalty for handball in the 38th minute before striker Alfredo Morelos knocked in the second three minutes later. Barcelona look worryingly at home in the Europa League There were only 10,000 fans inside the ground due to local Covid-19 restrictions and the 9,500 home supporters could barely believe what they were witnessing as Light Blues midfielder John Lundstram guided in a third after 49 minutes, only for England’s teenage international Jude Bellingham to pull a goal back for the German giants a minute later. Morelos’ drive from 12 yards was helped in by home defender Dan-Axel Zagadou – who conceded the penalty – to stretch the Scottish champions’ lead again before Raphael Guerreiro’s 82nd counter made it 4-2 which leaves Giovanni Van Bronckhorst’s men with the advantage going into the return game at Ibrox next Thursday. After changing the whole team for the Scottish Cup win over Annan Athletic at the weekend, Van Bronckhorst brought all the big guns back with only left-back Borna Barisic keeping his place. There was a boost for Rangers before the game with the confirmation that Dortmund’s star striker Erling Haaland remained sidelined with an adductor problem albeit there were plenty of familiar faces in the home side. The Ibrox side started encouragingly with their high press unsettling the hosts and they should have taken the lead in the 10th minute when attacker Ryan Kent slipped in Barisic. 💙 TEAM pic.twitter.com/gqdzDb7Eea — Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) February 17, 2022 The full-back raced into the box but his close-range shot struck the foot of goalkeeper Gregor Kobel and spun out for a corner which came to nothing. Five minutes later, Dortmund defender Zagadou had a free header from a Julian Brandt corner but failed to connect properly and visiting goalkeeper Allan McGregor gathered the ball gratefully. Dortmund appeared to settle and – in the 26th minute – Guerreiro’s cut back found no takers. There was another let off for the away side in the 32nd minute when a back-heeled effort from home captain Marco Reus made its way towards goal before Barisic cleared at the second attempt. Then came real drama. There was some puzzlement when French referee Clement Turpin stopped the game before going over to view the monitor in a VAR check and, when he saw that Zagadou had clearly handled a Tavernier corner, he pointed to the penalty spot. The Gers right-back sent Kobel the wrong way with his spot-kick to send 500 visiting fans wild with delight. Morelos’ shot from an angle was spilled by Kobel for a corner and when Tavernier’s delivery came over, midfielder Joe Aribo flicked the ball goalwards, the striker had the easiest of tasks to tap in from almost on the goal line. Dortmund teenagers Giovanni Reyna – son of former Rangers midfielder Claudio and named after current boss Van Bronckhorst – and Youssoufa Moukoko came on for the second half to replace Axel Witsel and Brandt and they watched helplessly after Kent displayed some dribbling magic before setting up Lundstram to curl the ball into the net from 22 yards. A minute later Bellingham reduce the deficit with a goal similar to that of Lundstram’s effort, a lifeline, taken away in the 54th minute when Morelos’s shot went in off Zagadou after an incisive breakaway led by Kent. It was breath-taking stuff. Desperate Dortmund tried all they could to get back and – with eight minutes remaining – Guerreiro beat McGregor with a tremendous long-distance drive but Rangers saw out five additional minutes for a sensational result which will reverberate around Europe, albeit it would be folly to think the tie is over.

Following a brief spell at Tottenham Hotspur, Broja progressed through the ranks at Chelsea. The 20-year-old made his senior debut for the Blues as a late substitute against Everton in March 2020. Warnock’s talking sh*t – Chelsea are ‘lucky’, not Azpilicueta This is Broja’s only appearance for Chelsea. He impressed for Vitesse last term and he is currently on loan at Southampton. The Albanian international has scored six goals for the Saints from his 20 Premier League appearances. Chelsea are under no pressure to sell their striker as he is under contract until 2026. It was revealed earlier this week that Arsenal are interested in him. The Sun are now reporting that Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have now ‘joined the chase’ for Broja. They state that the Bundesliga duo are ‘monitoring his progress’. Kevin Campbell has suggested that Broja could be difficult to get out of Stamford Bridge: “The thing is with Chelsea, they have so many players,” Campbell said. “They might well say they don’t want to sell him to a rival. But if the young man wants a career, then he won’t want to be going out on loan all the time or stuck in the reserves – he’ll want to move. “I don’t know how strong the interest is, but he’s certainly performing brilliantly at Southampton. He looks a right handful and he’s a young striker, which ties into the model at Arsenal right now. “I don’t know what their stance is on selling to a top-four rival, but Chelsea won’t be able to keep everybody happy this summer – that’s for sure.” Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards was blown away by Broja’s performance against Man Utd as Southampton drew 1-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday. Richards was impressed by his ability to bully two experienced centre-backs, he said on BBC Sport: “Broja, I know we’ve mentioned him before, but he’s bullying not only Maguire but he’s bullying Varane as well, which I couldn’t quite understand for someone so young.” ",positive

In the end it was also a little question of luck, with (a chance for) Rafa Varane, the header of Cristiano Ronaldo, the header of Harry Maguire. “But again, in the end, one point for a performance like this is just not enough.”  ",positive

When asked if Pulisic could leave in the next transfer window, Lebouef told ESPN: “Yeah, it’s possible.

Ronaldo has scored 23 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this campaign after joining from Serie A side Juventus in the summer transfer window. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Erik ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” ",positive

The Daily Express claims that Arsenal ‘are now looking to finally part ways with the former Lille winger, and they are even offering him to Premier League rivals to get him off their books’. It is understood that the north London club is ready to sell him for £25m, which would be a £47m loss after just three years. Pepe has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal with emergence of youngsters like Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli with reports that West Ham are interested in him. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has seen‘no advancements’ from Pepe this season and he is ‘ready to sell’ with the 26-year-old entering the final two years of his contract at the end of the season.  NEWCASTLE FLASHING THE CASH Newcastle United have made a ‘huge’ offer to tempt Paulo Dybala to St James’ Park in the summer transfer window, according to reports. Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham have all been linked with a move for the Juventus striker, who is out of contract in Turin at the end of the season. Dybala has bagged 114 goals in 288 appearances – including 14 this season – for Juventus since joining from Palermo in 2015. Football Insider insist that Newcastle ‘have submitted a blockbuster offer’ for Dybala as they use ‘their Saudi backing to sensationally try and win the race for the playmaker’. A Magpies source has told the website that the Geordies ‘are willing to make him their highest-ever paid player to lure him to England’ in a deal worth more than £200,000 a week. As well as top Premier League sides, Dybala is ‘wanted by top Italian and Spanish clubs’ and Newcastle are described as ‘unlikely contenders given their season spent trying to avoid Premier League relegation’. It looks unlikely Dybala will renew at Juve with talks over a new contract recently breaking down.

Lukaku returned to Chelsea last year. They splashed out £97.5m to bring him in from Inter Milan. The Belgium international shone in Serie A in 2021/22. He grabbed 24 goals and eleven assists from his 36 appearances. Chelsea need stability and clarity as Thomas Tuchel exit rumours begin to swirl again The forward has struggled since returning to England. He has only managed to score five Premier League goals so far this season. Back in December, Lukaku revealed in an extraordinary interview that he was not happy at Chelsea. Spanish outlet MARCA are now reporting that Lukaku is ‘entering the equation’ for Barcelona. With deals for Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski ‘more complicated’, Barcelona are ‘ready to launch Plan C’ to sign Lukaku. It is stated that ‘everything indicates that he will leave London’ this summer. ‘Several teams’ are understood to be interested in him. Elsewhere, Thomas Tuchel has revealed Sunday’s Goodison Park clash with Everton will be his first in-person meeting with Frank Lampard. Tuchel’s Chelsea predecessor Lampard sent the German coach a good luck message when the former Paris St Germain boss took the Stamford Bridge helm in January 2021. Lampard is now battling to keep Everton in the Premier League, with the struggling Toffees managing just one win in six matches in all competitions. Tuchel admitted he’s excited to meet Lampard after Chelsea’s record-goalscorer sent him a good luck message when he took over the club. “He sent me a very kind, respectful message after I took over at Chelsea that meant a lot,” said Tuchel, of Lampard. “I was a huge fan of him as a player and he is and will remain a legend at our club and this is a given. “I was very happy when he wrote me that message and it was very gentlemanly. “We didn’t have the chance to go out and have lunch and he took the chance to go and take charge of Everton. “He took an assistant from us, Joe Edwards, we were not so happy! Just joking. We will meet some friendly faces with Joe and Ashley Cole and Frank, who I have never met in person. “It is a very exciting week for me, I would love to meet him.

The Belgium international came off the bench for the last 20 minutes against the Red Devils at Old Trafford but failed to impact the game. Lukaku has now failed to score in his last ten appearances in the Premier League with his last goal in the competition coming at the end of December against Brighton. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” 🗣 “His attitude doesn’t seem right.” Roy Keane on Romelu Lukaku’s performance for Chelsea tonight pic.twitter.com/jd0dp8EZZp — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 28, 2022 Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was frustrated that his side didn’t take all three points against Man Utd on Thursday with the Blues failing turn their chances into goals. “A little bit (frustrated not to win),” Tuchel said with a smile. “We were very strong on and off the ball, very dominant on the ball, very aggressive off it. “A lot of ball wins, a lot of deliveries, a lot of half chances, a lot of spaces we found around the box. “But unfortunately we lacked precision in the box, a bit of determination to finish it off, even very early in the match, but also throughout the whole match. “Unfortunately when we had it we gave it away in one minute, so it started all over again. “But reaction was good again, so I am very happy with the performance because it was a huge team effort. “I think we showed what it needs to win on a big stage, in a big stadium, like on the focus level and the physical input level. “We played with a huge team effort with a lot of quality, but unfortunately we don’t have what we deserved, so we have to live with a point.”  ",positive

So it is no wonder that the Manchester City striker is the subject of some Monday morning Gossip. Jesus has managed 17 league starts this term but his playing time looks set to be restricted further next season if Pep Guardiola gets his hands on Erling Haaland. The Brazilian was asked about his future on Saturday but he preferred to enjoy the moment after his four-goal haul. Arsenal, though, are making plans to open their hearts to Jesus this summer. The Daily Mail puts the 25-year-old on the list of strikers Mikel Arteta is targeting before the start of next season and with only a year left on Jesus’ deal at City, the Gunners reckon there is a deal to be done. Arteta knows all about the striker from his time serving as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at City. Arsenal are also being linked by Gazzetta dello Sport with a move for Victor Oshimhen, while CBS Sports says Napoli have officially valued the striker at £67million. 16 Conclusions: Liverpool 2-0 Everton  BARCA, JUVE, PSG ALL IN FOR MAHREZ Jesus isn’t the only City forward being eyed up for a summer move. Riyad Mahrez is attracting the attention of some of Europe’s biggest hitters. The Algerian is City’s top scorer this season with 23 goals in all competitions, which Fichajes says has been enough to tempt in Barcelona, PSG and Juventus. Apparently, Mahrez could be expendable as City look to find ways to fund the deal for Haaland.  CONTE FANCIES REPLACING POCH AT PSG If Mahrez opts for PSG, he could find himself playing for Tottenham’s current boss. Despite clinching the title at the weekend, reports in France suggest Mauricio Pochettino will be sacked imminently, with his pay-off currently being discussed. It was assumed that Zinedine Zidane was ready to fill the void but Le Parisien reckons Antonio Conte has been approached over taking over at the Parc Des Princes and the Spurs manager is said to fancy the prospect.  INTER WANT LUKAKU BACK ON THE CHEAP Calciomercato mentions that Conte could take Romelu Lukaku with him to PSG – but the Chelsea flop would rather return to Inter Milan. The Italians are willing to take Lukaku back, a year after selling him to Chelsea for £97.5million. But there are conditions. Firstly, Inter cannot afford to buy the Belgian so any return would be facilitated by a loan deal. Inter also cannot afford to match Lukaku’s current salary so the centre-forward would have to take a pay-cut. A big one, somewhere in the region of 50 per cent. ",positive
100,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-united-woodward-murtough-judge,"Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots?","Manchester United are switching their senior management about, but will United supporters get the transfer guru that they’ve craved for years? Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

Monday marked a year since the postponement of the Red Devils’ home clash against Liverpool, when fans made their anger at the ownership clear in the wake of the European Super League debacle. F365 says: Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Supporters have protested at each of United’s final three home games and the anti-Glazer sentiment was clear before and during the victory against Brentford at Old Trafford. This was the first match that Thomas Frank’s Bees had lost with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up and there were times before and after Bruno Fernandes’ early opener that the Dane threatened to unlock the hosts. A narrow offside decision denied Cristiano Ronaldo before half-time, but the veteran would get on the scoresheet after converting the spot-kick foolishly given away by Rico Henry. Raphael Varane hooked home a deflected third as fans gave standing ovations to departing Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata as they were substituted on their final Old Trafford appearances. There were renewed chants against the Glazers in the 73rd minute, when a few departed rather than the mass exodus planned ahead of a huge summer in every department at United. Brentford may find the scoreline hard to swallow given the impressive moments they showed during their first competitive match at Old Trafford since 1975. Eriksen pulled the strings from the outset and put Bryan Mbeumo behind dozy Alex Telles in the opening seconds of a match that saw the Stretford End applaud the Denmark international at their first corner. Brentford played with confidence under the Old Trafford floodlights but United would strike an early blow, with Diogo Dalot sending Anthony Elanga scampering down the right. The 20-year-old – one of few bright spots for United this term – fizzed over a cross that Fernandes crashed home in the ninth minute. Eriksen attempted to catch out David De Gea with a snapshot when Brentford returned to the attack and provided a brilliant cross that Ivan Toney headed over from close range. While the Brentford playmaker probed, Ronaldo was proving a handful at the other end. From backheels to forcing David Raya into an awkward save from a long-range free-kick, then furiously claiming he should have had a penalty following Mads Bech Sorensen’s challenge. Referee Chris Kavanagh was unmoved. Next Ronaldo smartly flicked into Mata, who lashed narrowly wide of the near post on his first Premier League start of the season. Mbeumo flashed wide as the Bees swarmed forward and Eriksen continued to impress, only for United to celebrate a second. Mata broke down the left and sent a low cross that Ronaldo squeezed past Raya. Provider and scorer celebrated together, only for the goal to be ruled out following a VAR review. That decision gave Brentford renewed hope of a famous result and De Gea denied Eriksen’s stinging 30-yard free-kick in the second half, then stopped Toney with his feet. But it was not all one-way traffic and Raya tipped a Dalot effort onto the woodwork after a one-two with Ronaldo, who had strayed offside in the build-up. Fernandes fizzed across the face of goal having been found by Matic before United created breathing space in the 61st minute. Ronaldo was bundled over in the box by Henry and the veteran sent Raya the wrong way in front of an elated Stretford End. There were standing ovations for Matic and Mata as they were substituted in the final home match before their contracts expire, with the latter able to celebrate a third goal before being replaced. Pontus Jansson nearly turned a Ronaldo cross into his own goal but it went behind for a corner, which Telles swung over for Varane to hook in via a deflection. The planned walk out 17 minutes from time saw some exit but not the masses some expected as flares filled the air and chants increased in volume. Substitute Edinson Cavani looked desperate to score on what is surely his last Old Trafford appearance, but the closing stages petered out and Brentford failed to score a consolation. ",positive

Without a permanent boss since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s exit in November, the Old Trafford giants initially worked under caretaker Michael Carrick before Ralf Rangnick took over on an interim basis for the rest of the campaign. MAILBOX: Reasons for optimism over the state of Man Utd… United have been interviewing with a view to appointing their new permanent manager before the summer to aid their much-needed rebuild, with Ten Hag chosen as the man to lead the club forward. The impressive Ajax boss is looking to wrap up a third Eredivisie title before moving to Old Trafford on a three-year deal, which includes the option of a further year. Ten Hag said: “It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. “I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. “It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.” Ten Hag met with United in March as the Premier League club spoke to candidates about the Old Trafford vacancy. Long-admired Paris St Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino was initially considered favourite to succeed Solskjaer, only for the Dutchman to get the nod having impressed the powers that be. Football director John Murtough said: “During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team’s attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. “In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. “We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer.” ",positive

But Ferdinand thinks it is more important he gets the culture at the club right with all the players pulling in the same direction. Ferdinand said on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel: “I talk about the culture all the time, and that’s number one on my list. The culture has to be right, because you need to see, first and foremost, a work ethic. “You need to see a culture of people not wanting to get beat. You need to see a culture of it (losing) hurting people. “You need to see a culture of discipline in the group, nothing getting out. Stuff that we’ve got in the papers, the manager (Sir Alex Ferguson) would pull the squad in immediately, and I don’t think this happens now.” On how it would’ve gone if Sir Alex Ferguson had found out about leaks coming from the dressing room, Ferdinand added: “The manager would get that squad in, tight group, get in a circle. ‘What’s going on here? If I find out who is leaking stories to the media.’ “You’re standing there thinking: ‘I hope and I’m going to find out that no one in my team has spoken to anyone in the media, because I haven’t.’ “At the moment, there’s a mole in the camp. There’s leaks coming out far too often that suggests this squad ain’t like that (puts hands together). This squad ain’t there (tight-knit). “Setting the culture is just an absolute gimme. It’s an absolute must. You can’t have a culture at the club, which is right now of, players aren’t in fear of bad performances. “The culture at the football club isn’t that of fear of disappointing the hierarchy, the manager, and stuff like that. “It’s like: ‘I don’t play well, it’s not my fault, it’s his.’ There’s no repercussions. At the moment, at the football club, there aren’t consequences for actions on and off the pitch.” On why getting the appointment of a new manager was so important, Ferdinand continued: “It starts there (gestures to the top). That’s why the manager is so important. People keep going: ‘It’s the players.’ All of it needs to be working together, but the manager sets the tone.” ",positive

Especially in terms of their recovery and how they make themselves better. I’m taking in all the information I can and trying to put it into my game.” Sancho went onto insist that rest and recuperation is important for Premier League players: “For sure, I feel like that’s very important, especially when you’ve got games back to back. You need your legs and especially when you’re a winger – I need to get up and down the pitch. “I definitely need my legs to recover as quickly as possible to go again. It’s definitely important and I’m just trying to be a better version of myself.” Elsewhere, ESPN have claimed that Carlo Ancelotti has emerged as a candidate for Man Utd as they ‘explore contingency plans’.

The most important thing is you want to win. “In a cup like this you know that you don’t have another game to win if you don’t win this one so you have to perform and leave all your energy on the pitch.

We are looking forward to it.” Varane is mentally and physically prepared for the match to go beyond 90 minutes on Monday, with the third-round tie to be settled on the night under the Old Trafford lights. “I think they’re a really good team and we have to be prepared to play against a team who know how to play on the counterattack and who play well with the ball,” he said. “So physically and tactically… everything will be important in this game because we know we face a good team.” Varane feels up for the challenge and is hoping to kick on at Man Utd,having dealt with some injuries since joining in the summer. “I feel good,” the France international told the club website.“I feel better every day and I want to stay like that and improve and help the team. “I have to say the medical team and the physios have helped me a lot and I’m very happy to be back and I’d like to say thank you to them for the help with my recovery.”  ",positive

Gordon was able to alleviate the pressure that was on Everton after their 3-2 loss against Burnley on Wednesday. Neither side were at their best but Everton did enough to move four points clear of the bottom three. Gossip: Man Utd battle for £267m Premier League quartet Ralf Rangnick made half a dozen changes from the side that drew 1-1 against Leicester last week – Lampard himself made four – as Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford were restored to the starting XI. The bustling Rashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon’s shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Everton, up until that point, were lacking in inspiration but they noticeably grew in stature after going ahead, when the mood around Goodison Park dramatically changed, although they were given relatively few scares by a United side that have won just one of their last five top-flight fixtures. Given both teams are low on confidence, it was perhaps little surprise that it was a cagey opening few minutes, complete with stray passes and the sides loose in possession, although Everton were particularly hesitant, with United getting on top and having two early sights at goal through Rashford. The hitherto out-of-form forward was lively on the left and had a snap shot parried away by the outstretched Pickford, who moments later excellently got down low to deny a header from the England forward as Gordon snuffed out any danger on the rebound. Everton appeared listless and lethargic, with their fans growing restless, but the atmosphere and momentum changed as they took a 27th-minute lead following some sluggishness at the back from United. Richarlison’s attempted cutback to Alex Iwobi broke just outside the area for Gordon, who prioritised placement over power and was grateful for a wicked deflection off Maguire, wrongfooting De Gea, as the ball sailed into the net. The goal galvanised Everton, with Michael Keane heading over shortly afterwards while another deflected effort, this time from Richarlison, had to be tipped over by De Gea. United were forced into a change before the break, with Fred seemingly nursing an injury and withdrawn for Paul Pogba, whose first meaningful contribution saw him upend Gordon on halfway to go into the referee’s book after the interval. Moments earlier Rashford had ghosted in behind the Everton defence and while he was unable to make contact with Bruno Fernandes’ pass, the ball only just trickled wide with Pickford out of position. It was to be Rashford’s last involvement as he and Nemanja Matic were hooked for Anthony Elanga and Juan Mata, with Ralf Rangnick using all three of his substitutes within 64 minutes. United gradually started to exert pressure in the closing stages, with Everton throwing bodies in the way when the ball was worked into the box, although Pogba forced a smart save from Pickford late on. Pickford was again called upon in time added on to deny Ronaldo on the half-volley after being teed up by Maguire before the referee’s whistle for full-time was greeted by an eruption of noise. Lampard pumped his fist on the touchline, and no doubt breathed a sigh of relief, following a momentous win – just the third in his tenure in the league in 10 attempts. ",positive

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” ",positive

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role. There has always been an understanding that Rangnick would move into a consultancy position at Man Utd after his period as interim manager came to an end – but there was no expectation from fans that he would be doing another job at the same time. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time. Laser-focused, clear lines, people staying in their lines understanding what their roles are and actually communicating that to a fan base, this is a real change, this is different than it has been for the last 10 years.”  ",positive

Konate signed for Liverpool last summer from RB Leipzig. The Red paid around £36m to bring him to the Premier League. The centre-back has been a bit-part player this term. This has largely been down to the form of Joel Matip and Van Dijk. Klopp’s Liverpool contract: Great for the Premier League, bad for Premier League clubs The 22-year-old has still impressed when given the chance though. He has started 20 games across all competitions. His latest start came against Villarreal at Anfield in midweek in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Carragher thinks Konate will be playing more regularly next season as he is a “fantastic” talent: “[Konate] is great, isn’t he? Joe Gomez is having a very hard time getting back into the team – he is playing right back at the moment,” Carragher said on the ‘It’s a Funny Old Life’ podcast. “But the three now, wow. I think Konate, next season, might become the first choice to partner Virgil van Dijk. “He may just edge Matip, not that Matip has done anything wrong. I just think Konate is that young and he is that good that you have to just go and let him play. “He’s getting a lot of games now – but he is fantastic.” Elsewhere, Jurgen Klopp believes him signing a new contract is the start of a new era at Liverpool: “We don’t think about changing the team in the next two or three years or whatever, but you have to prepare the little things so that you are ready for the future as well,” he said. “That’s why I really think it’s a really good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place. “We cannot wait 10 years. We have to do it now. It’s no threat. This is only the start, to be honest. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. “There’s nothing guaranteed, it’s why we have to enjoy the journey. The journey so far is a great one but we don’t know if we will win anything.” ",positive

Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started…. Football’s greatest mystery How can a team spend a billion to become this bad? Opposition players must be p*ssing themselves laughing how easy it is to play against United!Manyooligan (Do Telles and Rashford even realize the problem is on their flank???) SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season. I can count atleast 10-12 separate occasions where he has won us some points and carried us in a game. On the other hand you got 100m Lukaku, 71m Havertz & 50m Werner who all combined still do not possess half the skill Ronaldo does, or else it would have been 5-1.Aman (Great ball by Matic though, twice in two weeks now)   ",positive

The Toffees are battling against their first relegation in 71 years and are two points adrift of safety – which could become five, albeit with two matches in hand – by the time they kick-off at home to Lampard’s former club Chelsea on Sunday. Everton have managed just three Premier League wins since the former England midfielder replaced Rafael Benitez at the end of January and a drop into the Sky Bet Championship is now a worrying reality. Four reasons why Everton fans are firmly behind under-fire Frank Lampard Asked whether he would continue as manager if the team were relegated Lampard said: “I don’t want to get drawn on that question but what I will say is I’ve loved every minute at this club. “I’ve been welcomed incredibly well by fans. I’ll give it everything for as long as Everton want me here.” His job, however, has been made slightly more difficult by the loss of defender Ben Godfrey for potentially the remainder of their relegation battle. The defender injured a thigh muscle in the warm-up ahead of last weekend’s Merseyside derby defeat at Anfield and with fellow centre-back Yerry Mina having only just returned from more than two months out Godfrey’s absence is a significant blow. “Ben’s out and will be a few weeks out,” added Lampard. “We would love to get him back before the end of the season but it will be a close call.” 💙 | “Our fans are brilliant – it’s their life. If we get together in this moment it will make us stronger.” Frank Lampard is backing the message from Fan groups and Supporters’ Clubs to gather on Goodison Road/City Road from 12pm on Sunday to greet the players. pic.twitter.com/bmchTHsJu3 — Everton (@Everton) April 29, 2022 Lampard is also missing midfielders Donny Van De Beek (groin) and Andre Gomes but will be able to call on striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose injury-plagued season continued as he sat out the last two matches. Following the defeat to Liverpool the club wrote to Professional Game Match Officials Limited to register a complaint about the way a penalty appeal against Anthony Gordon was handled. It was the second time they had cause to take such action, having received an apology from PGMOL boss Mike Riley last month after the failure to award a potential penalty equaliser against Manchester City for a handball against Rodri. But there has been no such response this time around. Lampard said: “I didn’t expect there to be another one, to have two apologies in critical games against the two strongest teams in the country. Against Manchester City that cost us a point on the day. “Against Liverpool who knows what that cost us if we get a penalty and go 1-0 up, that’s hard to gauge. “But they are things which can clearly affect you in a relegation battle.” The FA also wrote to Lampard this week asking him to explain his comments about the officiating in the derby. “They wrote to me, I wrote back to them. At that point, I haven’t heard anything further,” he said.  ",positive

The Reds beat Chelsea on penalties at Wembley earlier this year to win the Carabao Cup. They are also in the running to lift the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Klopp’s side beat Newcastle United 1-0 on Saturday to remain one point behind Premier League leaders Man City. On Tuesday night, they face Villarreal in Spain in the return leg of their Champions League semi-final. Liverpool won 2-0 at Anfield last week in the first leg. Ahead of this midweek game, Alexander-Arnold has admitted that he is hoping he and his teammates “will be in the history books again”: “I did say one trophy a season minimum and that is in a season that isn’t our best, but we are in fine form and have been able to win in different ways,” Alexander-Arnold said (quotes via Irish Examiner). “When you are staring down the barrel and looking at more trophies, where if we win every game we are looking at more silverware, that is what we are looking at. These kinds of games are exciting for us. “This time last year we were trying to fight back into the top four and secure the Champions League. Now we are second in the league — a point off [Manchester] City — and in the FA Cup final. Who can complain? “This is a very special season for us all and hopefully we will see it through, and at the end we will be in the history books again.” Alexander-Arnold went onto suggest that Liverpool are “thriving off” treating each game as a cup final: “I feel like we thrive off it. This is always the best time of the season. Every game is a final, pushing on all three fronts. “These are the exciting games: You want to be playing in these, you want everything on the line, you want every game to feel like you have to win it.

It was first reported back in February that Arsenal and Newcastle United are interested in Leao. The winger has previously had spells at Sporting Lisbon and Lille. AC Milan paid around £19m to sign him in 2019. Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI… The Portugal international has been in great form for AC Milan this season. He has been involved in 20 goals from his 37 appearances. Milan are challenging for the Serie A title. They are two points clear of second-placed Inter Milan with three games to go. La Repubblica (via Sport Witness) are reporting that Leao’s agent (Jorge Mendes) has received the ‘most decisive courtship’ from Newcastle United and PSG. Leao currently earns€1.5m a year and his deal runs out in 2024. It is noted that the most AC Milan would be able to pay him is€4m. Newcastle and PSG meanwhile ‘would be willing to quadruple’ his wages so he would earn €6m each year. Elsewhere, Newcastle were beaten 1-0 by Liverpool on Saturday afternoon. Eddie Howe said post-match that there were positives to take from this loss: “I think Liverpool were probably not at their best but we weren’t either and when you play these games you have to be. We competed well but lacked the quality that could have got us a goal. “It is difficult to it consistently against Liverpool as they have the quality to produce a counter-attack out of nothing. We were much more aggressive in the second half but did not have any concerted pressure in the game. “We were not at our best today but we were still in the game right to the end, so there are positives to take. But we set our standards very high and next week we have to do much better. “I don’t think we quite got going. I thought we made a bright start to the game but we’re slightly disappointed with our own performance. “Individually I don’t think we hit our top levels, which meant collectively we didn’t quite hit the levels we have recently. We probably didn’t quite have that sustained pressure we were looking for. The second half was better without that big chance ever really coming. “There were one or two bright sparks, but it’s slightly disappointing compared to our previous levels. I’ve seen progress from where we have been, but on the other side there’s a lot of work to do. We’re probably where we were before the game.” ",positive

The England international shone for West Ham in the second part of last season after joining David Moyes’ side on loan for six months. Instead of pursuing a move away from the Red Devils in the summer he decided to stay and fight for his place despite slipping down the pecking order under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Despite making 22 appearances under Solskjaer and interim boss Rangnick this season, only four of those have come from the start of a match. And Lingard – who did reportedly look to leave in January – will now leave Old Trafford on a free transfer in the summer with Man Utd looking to clear out a number of players. Juan Mata, Edinson Cavaniand Phil Jones, who are also likely to leave in the summer, were given minutes as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night but Lingard was left on the bench by Rangnick. And the Manchester Evening News claim that Lingard was ‘upset’ with Rangnick in the aftermath of United’s win against the Bees after not being able to get on the pitch for a farewell appearance at Old Trafford. The newspaper’s sources close to Lingard insist that the winger ‘was dismayed by Rangnick’s decision to send on Edinson Cavani ahead of the academy graduate’ with Man Utd finishing the season with two away fixtures. Lingard’s brother,Louie Scott, took to social media after the match to hit out at Man Utd and their “classless” treatment of the winger. “20 years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,” Scott said on Instagram. “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league OK. “Class of ’92, Busby Babes, you’re run by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, god bless! Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send-off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” ",positive

Tchouameni has been coveted by a number of clubs around Europe with both Manchester United and Chelsea linked in recent months. The 22-year-old has played at every age group for France from under-16 all the way up to under-21 before making his first senior appearance in September last year. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Tchouameni completed a move from Bordeaux to Monaco in 2020 and has scored six goals in 92 appearances in all competitionsfor theMonégasques, from a mainly defensive midfield position. And now Liverpool – who have put a brilliant squad together in recent years – are ready to bid for the Frenchman this summer, according to Romano, with the Reds “targeting a new midfielder”. “Aurelien Tchouameni is certainly a player being monitored by Liverpool,”Romano wrote on Anfield Watch. “Who have had conversations with the agent of the Monaco midfielder. However, the €45 million price tag – set last summer – is no longer valid. A far higher offer will be needed to prise Tchouameni away from France. “But the 22-year-old is planning for a different experience this summer and that is undoubtedly why Liverpool may be ready to make their move. However, Real Madrid has been following Tchouameni for some time, and the Reds will face competition from other top clubs interested in the French international.” A deal for Fulham attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho, which collapsed on deadline day in January, is understood to be close with Liverpool to pay “around£5m plus £2.7m in add-ons”. Romano added: “Klopp will also be involved in all the transfer decisions in the coming months and he has already given his green light for the signing of Fulham’sFabio Carvalho. The deal is already closed, the paperwork has been completed in recent days and there is no doubt: Carvalho will soon be announced as the first new signing of the 2022/2023 season, with a long-term contract until June 30, 2027. “The Portuguese talent has already been to the AXA Training Centre to meet with Klopp and he extensively explored Liverpool’s facilities before completing a medical – with Fulham’s permission. “Liverpool will pay around £5m plus £2.7m in add-ons, including a sell-on clause for 20% of Carvalho’s future sale. Liverpool faced competition from other clubs, who had tried to enter the race for his signature in February following the collapsed deal between Liverpool and Fulham on Deadline Day, for reasons of time in completing the contract. “But Carvalho has respected his agreement with the Reds, and the club themselves have an excellent relationship with Fulham after agreeing to keep the terms of the agreement reached in January instead of signing Carvalho on a free transfer this summer. The move has been particularly appreciated at Craven Cottage and future ties between the clubs are likely to be friendly. “Carvalho’s programme for the future is very clear: as things stand there is no planned return to Fulham on loan next season. Liverpool intend to keep Carvalho in the first team and consider him part of the group, but the final confirmation will come during pre-season after Klopp has the chance to assess his new midfielder.” ",positive

Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Diaz has hit the ground running for the Premier League outfit. He has grabbed four goals and three assists from his 20 outings. The forward was involved in two of Liverpool’s goals as they beat Man Utd 4-0 at Anfield last month. Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off.

It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London.

Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister.

Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him.

Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” ",positive

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive

The Spaniard is currently on loan at Udinese after leaving the Premier League side in the January transfer window. Top 10 Premier League finishers defying their xG Having struggled for game time in the first half of 2021/22, Mari was allowed to depart four days after the Gunners’ league game against Tottenham was postponed because Mikel Arteta did not have enough players to field a team. The 28-year-old has made eight appearances in the Serie A this term and admits that he is loving life in Italy. Mari believes it is the ‘right league for him’, admitting that he “would like to stay in Italy”. “When I arrived in January, I had a clear and precise idea,” he toldGazetta dello Sport (via Arseblog). “I told the coach and [club owner] Gino Pozzo that I was coming to play. But I realized that I had to earn the job day after day, workout after workout. [Coach] Cioffi was the first who welcomed me, well, here. “It’s the right championship for me. Very tactical. I try to bring the attacker towards me. “I really like having the ball and here it can be done and then there is the battle and I like having a battle on the pitch. I would like to stay in Italy.” Mari added: “I’m very well at Udinese and I’d be happy to take the club even higher in the standings. Of course, I still have a two-year contract with Arsenal. “I’ve resumed playing continuously after the operation on my left ankle where I was out for five months.” Meanwhile, Wolves playmaker Ruben Neves is a ‘top summer transfer target’ for Arsenal, according to Sky Sports. The Gunners are looking for a long-term partner for Thomas Partey in midfield and Neves is seen as an upgrade on Granit Xhaka. Aston Villa defensive midfielder Douglas Luiz is said to be another midfield option for Arsenal. ",positive

Following their pulsating 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday the two sides are still only separated by a single point going into the final seven matches of the season. The run-in suggests City – who are currently top – have the greater advantage as they face Brighton, Watford, Leeds and Newcastle – all teams in the bottom half – before facing Wolves, West Ham and then Aston Villa away on the final day of the season. Big Midweek: Werner, Atletico v Man City, Emery, Liverpool Liverpool, by comparison, have to play top-seven sides Manchester United and Tottenham as well as Merseyside rivals Everton, while also having to tackle Villa, Wolves, Newcastle and Southampton. There are bound to be more twists and turns before the end of the season but Murphy thinks another Man City title triumph would be “tedious and boring”. “The way Liverpool and Klopp have done it is remarkable, in that they keep finding diamonds in the rough and polishing them up to become superstars,” Murphy said on talkSPORT. “And although the admiration is there for what Pep does with Man City’s players, because even though he brings in readymade players, he still makes them better. “They both deserve credit, but I think the way Liverpool have done it is more admirable in that respect, in their recruitment and the type of players they bring into the system and build them. “I think as well from a neutral point of view, you’ve got to want Liverpool to win it, really. “If City win it again it will be four titles in five years. “You don’t want a one-team dominance in any league in Europe, because it becomes tedious and boring!” And fellow talkSPORT pundit Simon Jordan agreed with Murphy but reckons Man City will have too much. “I enjoy watching Liverpool far more than I enjoy watching Man City,” Jordan added. “Man City are a sophisticated and very elegant team but Liverpool are a potent, grab you by the throat, get you out of the chair sort of team. “So if you want me to tell you who I want to win, I’d like Liverpool to win the league because I just enjoy watching them more. “But who do I think is going to win?

The 25-year-old joined Wolves in 2017 for £16m while the Molineux club were in the Championship. Top ten outsiders who will decide Premier League title race After making his debut in the Portuguese top flight and Champions League at the age of 17, it was no surprise that Neves excelled in the second tier of English football. In October 2015, the Portugal international became the youngest captain in Champions League history when he wore the armband in a group stage game againstMaccabi Tel Aviv at the age of 18. He has been a mainstay in the Wolves team since arriving and it is no surprise to see him linked with a move away from Molineux. Arsenal are in the market for a new central midfielder and Neves reportedly fits the bill, with numerous reports claiming the Gunners are keen on signing him this summer. However, Erik ten Hag – who is reportedly close to being announced as the new Man Utd manager – is prioritising the signing of Neves should he take over at Old Trafford. The Premier League pair might have to fight off Barcelona, who are showing ‘considerable interest’ in the midfielder, as per Sky Sports News. Barcelona are struggling financially and have primarily been working in the free agent market. Their financial troubles resulted in the loss of legendary forward Lionel Messi last summer. It is said that Arsenal are ‘encouraged to pursue a deal for Neves’ due to Man Utd’s managerial situation. They are also interested in Aston Villa’s Douglas Luiz. Meanwhile,Bukayo Saka has named Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets as his toughest opponent, recalling an occasion when the midfielder “embarrassed” him. Saka has come up against Busquets just once, in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. The Arsenal winger said: “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer.

Klopp helped the Reds to their first title in 30 years in 2020 and has also won the Champions League and League Cup during his time at Anfield. Despite no success in the Champions League yet at City, Guardiola has won three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and four League Cup trophies since 2016. Big Midweek: Werner, Atletico v Man City, Emery, Liverpool But former Liverpool midfielder Hamann insists you can’t “compare them” as Klopp has proven himself to be a far superior manager. Hamann told talkSPORT: “If you look at what Carlo Ancelotti has done over the last 20 years with the clubs he won the Champions League with, Mourinho won it with Inter Milan and before that with Porto. “Pep won it with Barcelona, but in Munich he took over a Champions League winning side and was there for three years and didn’t get to the final, he got knocked out of the semis three times – and two or three years after he left they won it again! “At City now, up until last season he had not been past the last eight and if you look at the moment, the fortunes City have spent, I don’t think it’s enough. “My point is that he hasn’t done anything somebody else before him hasn’t done already. “If you look at Klopp, he took Borussia Dortmund to a Champions League final and the Bundesliga title – which hasn’t been done since. “And obviously he won the league for the first time in 30 years for Liverpool – he really galvanised that football club. “I just don’t think you can compare them. I think what Klopp has done at Liverpool rates far higher than what Guardiola has done at City. “Everybody is going on about Guardiola that he’s the Godfather of managers, but if you actually look at his record over the last three years – yes he’s done great with City to get 100 points in a season, but Klopp didn’t spend half the money, he’s probably spent a quarter of the money and they have been running them close with 98 or 99 points, and this season it’s the same thing. “Pep has spent nearly half a billion on centre-backs alone, and obviously last year they got to the Champions League final and I’ve got to sayhelost the final, because he didn’t play Rodri. “So I don’t understand how people can say ‘what Guardiola has done for football’. Yes, they might play a different brand, but then again, if he hadn’t had Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi in his Barcelona team, he probably couldn’t have played that way. “He has always managed the best teams and for the clubs he’s managed, and the teams he’s had and the money he’s spent over the years, I think it’s not enough.”  ",positive

TuttoMercatoWeb recently reported that Torino are willing to cash in on Bremer this summer and have slapped a€25m asking price on the Brazilian. Inter Milan, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea have all been linked with the 25-year-old. Reports in Italy and Brazil (via Sport Witness) state that the Reds ‘want to sign’ Bremer and are planning to submit an offer to secure his signature. However,Sport Mediaset journalist Marco Barzaghi reckons Inter have ‘found an agreement in principle’ to sign the Torino defender. He does state that ‘there is a great deal of competition from English teams, Liverpool above all’. Jurgen Klopp has plenty of options in central defence as things stand. Last summer, the Premier League club brought in young defender Ibrahima Konate for £36m. Konate has only played eight times in the league this campaign with Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk being favoured in the heart of Liverpool’s defence. Joe Gomez is another Liverpool centre-half who has struggled for game time this season. He has made 17 appearances across all competitions in 2021/22. With Gomez and Konate struggling for minutes this term, it is interesting to see the Reds linked with another central defender in Bremer. Meanwhile,Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold accepts they are relying on another team to produce a surprise against Manchester City and do them a favour in the title race.

Redknapp told the Daily Mail: “I find this title race impossible to call. I’ve got this feeling Liverpool v Tottenham on May 7 will be significant. Can Klopp’s crew navigate that one? That might be the match which poses them a major problem. But what a rivalry this is. “Some people say City pass the ball too much. Others adore that about them. Some people say Liverpool’s high energy is a thing of beauty. Others don’t think they play football that’s pretty enough. It’s like the age-old debate over who you prefer between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. “Whatever your view on City and Liverpool and their styles, I think we can all agree that it is incredible to watch these winners strut their stuff.” And Redknapp thinks Liverpool supporters will have been “nervous” watching their team defend a high line against Manchester City. Redknapp added: “Both sides stood by their philosophies. The high line of Liverpool should come with a Government health warning — I bet there were more than a few fans in Merseyside who were nervous seeing all of that space in behind their back four. “Liverpool are so good at playing that way but when you’re facing forwards as rapid and relentless as City’s, it can be a killer. Raheem Sterling thought he had got the winner but his shoulder was just behind. “Klopp will probably tell us that’s an example of his system working to perfection — the defence held its line and Sterling was off.

Chelsea bounced back from that defeat to destroy Southampton 6-0 on Saturday with Werner – who has often been criticised for not contributing enough goals – scoring a brace.

His pace and movement can combine well with the guile ofKai Havertzto cause Real Madrid plenty of issues. “Despite not trusting him defensively, Thomas Tuchel would be wise to call upon Marcos Alonso who can provide the European champions with an extra dimension going forward.” Sutton added: “If Tuchel’s defeatist attitude is genuine and he does indeed think they’ve got nothing to lose, isn’t it worth throwing Werner into the mix? Why not? “Chelsea need goals, and though Werner hasn’t set the world alight since signing, he’s guaranteed to work his socks off. “Lukaku hasn’t travelled to Madrid so Werner and Havertz playing off one another could represent their best bet of striking early in this European encounter. “Of course Real won’t be as naïve as Southampton were at St Mary’s.

Maguire has come in for a lot of criticism this season with the centre-back under more scrutiny than any of his team-mates despite their collective poor performances. Weirdly, the Man Utd captain’s name was jeered at Wembley when the players’ names were read out ahead of their 3-0 victory over Ivory Coast last month. Ronaldo phone incident offers telling visual metaphor Maguire has been brilliant in an England shirt, helping the Three Lions to a Euro 2020 final appearance last summer and becoming one of the first names on the teamsheet under Gareth Southgate. And Ferdinand has likened Maguire’s situation to that of Gerard Pique’s when he was at Man Utd before the centre-back left Old Trafford and went on to win numerous trophies with Barcelona. “In an England shirt he’s been nothing but phenomenal. He’s been unreal. You can’t say he’s a dead player, he’s been unbelievable for England,” Ferdinand said on hisVibe with FIVE YouTube channel. “What I’m saying is, for England he’s been great, but they play a particular way of football that probably suits him. “Gerard Pique was at Man United, you could argue that he might not have had the career that he’s had at Barcelona if he stayed at Man United because of the way he plays. “It’s like boxing, styles make fights – it’s the same in football. The way of Man United’s football, and the way that they are trying to play, hasn’t suited him. “But also form and confidence. His confidence has taken a big knock and I don’t care who you are, you could be Messi, Ronaldo, Zidane, Mbappe all these players – if their confidence is low they are not the same player.” Their 1-0 loss to Everton on Saturday now means Man Utd are six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham with seven matches of the season remaining. When asked if he spoke to former England team-mate Frank Lampard – who is now Everton boss – before the match, Ferdinand replied:“I did actually, I spoke to him on text [before the game] and I spoke to him this morning actually on a call. “Like he said, this Man United isn’t the Man United that he was playing against, so you approach the game very differently. “I think we’ve seen many times in recent months that Man United have spells in games every now and again, they’ll play well and you think, ‘Oh, this is Man United, this looks good!’ “But then very quickly, minutes later, they undo all that good work with a crazy individual error or the team just falls back and it becomes a negative situation. “When you’re an opposing manager to Man United now you think you’re going to get chances, it’s about whether they can be clinical, and whether they can stop United’s forwards scoring goals.” ",positive

Top ten outsiders who will decide Premier League title race Erik ten Hag seems set to take over as the new permanent boss at Old Trafford in the summer but Ferdinand thinks they need to improve their recruitment if anything is going to change. “I just feel that, when you look at it, Man United – you can talk about training grounds and all that stuff – but please, you’ve got to get the football stuff right,” Ferdinand said on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel. “You’ve got to get the culture at the football club right, you’ve got to get the players that you recruit right. “And if you look at the players that have been coming to this football club for the last eight or 10 years, if you were going to do a list of all of them on paper, how many of these players have come to this football club and actually grown in value or got better?” When claimed that Bruno Fernandes is the only Man Utd signing that has increased his reputation over the last decade, Ferdinand agreed: “I would 100 per cent agree with that. “I don’t know any others that have come and you actually go, ‘Oh he’s actually miles better! We’ll get more money for him now!’ There’s none. “And that goes down to coaching, that goes down to recruitment, and so those areas need to be improved drastically for us to be able to improve. “Because you could go in and buy three or four players this window, but if we’re going to continue in the same vein as what was before, those players that you bring in are going to be declining rather than getting better and improving your team – so that needs to be changed.” On the performance against Everton, Ferdinand added: “In terms of chances, they don’t look like creating chances, they don’t look like they’re getting anywhere near creating any good chances. “And the problem is as well, they put the ball in the box and Cristiano Ronaldo is on his own half the time, by himself – for a centre-back [it’s easy].” ",positive

It’s affected him more than it’s affected me, so I have put everything to him to make his own mind up on – he doesn’t want to go to United, he doesn’t want to go to see Ronaldo.

Man City’s name has also been thrown in the mix by El Confidencial. The Spanish midfielder has a release clauseof €60m (£50m) and is under contract with Sociedad until 2025. City will play in the Spanish capital on Wednesday night when they take on Atletico Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final. After supporters of the Spanish side were caught on camera appearing to perform Nazi salutes in the first leg, UEFA ordered Atletico to close a part of their stadium for Wednesday’s tie. The La Liga club must also display a banner containing the wording ‘#NoToRacism’, in addition to the UEFA logo. The decision of UEFA’s appeals body read: “To order the partial closure of the Club Atletico de Madrid stadium during the next UEFA competition match in which Club Atletico de Madrid would play as the host club, for the discriminatory behaviour of its supporters. “Club Atletico de Madrid shall inform prior to the match, the sector(s) to be closed, which shall at least comprehend 5,000 seats.” ",negative

The Red Devils re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo last summer after extending Edinson Cavani’s contract for another year. Ronaldo phone incident offers telling visual metaphor Ronaldo has scored 18 goals in 34 appearances this season, meanwhile, Cavani has only started seven times due to numerous injury problems. The Portuguese’s goalscoring record in 2021/22 is far from poor but is a far cry from his usual high standards. Marcus Rashford has struggled for form this term and Mason Greenwood has been unavailable for several months, meaning that Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have both relied heavily on Ronaldo for goals. United are currently six points behind Tottenham in fourth with their hopes of a top-four finish quickly fading and Berbatov believes the Red Devils’ lack of striker options is a big reason they are struggling. “When you put it like this, I think it’s a bit short of options,” Berbatov told theclub’s website. “Cristiano Ronaldo still can score goals and I’m pleased with everything he’s doing so far. “Anthony Elanga is emerging on the scene and he’s a great talent. I hope Marcus Rashford can find his footing and get into the form we know he has. He can score goals and terrorise defences. “I can agree we are not scoring enough goals to win the games. I can clearly remember, and Wes [Brown] can back me up here, when winning 1-0, 1-0, 1-0 down the road was enough to get three points. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen at the moment and, because of that, we are suffering and losing points where we should win points.” Meanwhile,United are ready to trigger Erik ten Hag’s release clause at Ajax and announce his arrival next week, according to Football Insider. There have been a number of reports over the last week indicating that the Dutchman is now the overwhelming favourite to be appointed the new permanent manager at Old Trafford. The reportclaims thatMan Utd are ‘set to trigger’ Ten Hag’s release clause at Ajax ‘after deciding to make him their new manager’. A source has told the website that the 52-year-old is ‘expected to accept their offer to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick’ before the Premier League club finish ‘finalising negotiations with Ajax’.

Saint-Maximin has surprisingly been linked with a move away from St James’ Park. Championship winners and losers as Forest fly Magpies boss Eddie Howe dismissed speculation that the Frenchman will leave the club, however. He said: “He’s an incredible talent and yes, of course he has a long-term future at the club.” With rumours of the fan favourite being sold, Newcastle have been linked with numerous wingers. The Daily Mail claim they are looking to replace Saint-Maximin with Trossard, Moussa Diaby or Brennan Johnson. Johnson has been excellent for Nottingham Forest this season and is attracting lots of interest from the Premier League. As is Diaby, who has scored 16 goals and provided 11 assists in 37 appearances across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen this term. The report claims that Trossard is looking to leave Brighton at the end of the season. He has 16 months left on his contract at the Amex. Newcastle are expected to be very busy in the summer transfer window and have also been linked with West Ham attacker Jarrod Bowen. 90min report that the Magpies ‘are ready to compete with any side in the running for his signature’ this summer. It is also suggested that Howe was a ‘huge fan’ of Bowen when he was the manager of Bournemouth. Elsewhere,Mateo Kovacic has backed “amazing” Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric to still be plying his trade at the top level into his 40s. The Croatia team-mates will line up on opposite sides when Chelsea travel to the Bernabeu for the second leg of their quarter-final clash on Tuesday night. “He was always as good as he is now, for me as far as I know in the last five, six or seven years he’s on the same way level, which is amazing,” said Kovacic. “Why is that good? It is because he loves football so much. He lives it every day. He’s a professional and if he keeps going like this, I see him still playing three, four more years on such a high level.” ",positive

Their safest remaining passage is Steven Gerrard. Villarreal (Champions League semi-final first leg, home, April 27) Liverpool have only lost the first leg of a European knockout tie when playing at home twice in their entire history. Chelsea advanced from the Champions League quarter-finals in 2009 by defending a 3-1 victory at Anfield with that ludicrous 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge; Leeds reached the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1971 after Billy Bremner scored the only goal of the two games in front of the Kop. Villarreal are excellent but both history and the context of Jurgen Klopp having constructed one of the strongest teams on the continent make a setback unlikely.  Aston Villa (Premier League, away, May 10) The wildcard. The head says Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory togetherso should be dispatched with aplomb. The heart protests that a volatile combination of narrative and vibes makes this trip remarkably treacherous. It really ought to be navigated with relative ease and no breaking of the Divock Origi emergency glass. But good lord, the build-up is going to be tiresome. ‘Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard insists his Aston Villa side will not hand the Reds an advantage in the title race,’ etc, so on, ad infinitum.  Southampton (Premier League, away, TBD) There has been no official confirmation yet but the limitations of the Gregorian calendar and uncompromising restrictions of time itself dictate that Liverpool’s journey to Southampton will have to take place on May 17 or 18, sandwiched in the midweek between the FA Cup final and last match of the domestic season. Liverpool did lose on their most recent visit to St Mary’s but things were a bit weird then and Jordan Henderson and Fabinho probably won’t reprise their central defensive partnership. Saints were swatted aside 4-0 at Anfield in November, when Diogo Jota opened the scoring after 97 seconds and Virgil van Dijk rounded it off well before the hour. Even without expecting exactly the same outcome, Liverpool should be confident.  Wolves (Premier League, home, May 22) Klopp wins the final game of Premier League seasons, except that time he stuck Adam Bogdan, Brad Smith, Cameron Brannagan, Kevin Stewart and Sheyi Ojo out at West Brom for a Hawthorns draw before the Europa League final in 2016. Otherwise, Liverpool’s aggregate score on the last weekend under the German is 14-1, including matches that were crucial for Champions League qualification and even, in 2019, a home game versus Wolves that required victory to stand any chance of overhauling the slender advantage that defending champions and leaders Manchester City had built up at the top. It is simultaneously true that Wolves always provide a tough challenge, yet Liverpool have beaten them 10 times straight in the Premier League while conceding only twice.  Villarreal (Champions League semi-final second leg, away, May 3) In their previous two Champions League knockout ties this season, Liverpool established solid first-leg leads away that granted them room for manoeuvre at home, losing to Inter Milan and drawing with Benfica. Villarreal will offer them no such breathing room: Unai Emery’s side kept things tight at El Madrigal by drawing with Juventus and deservedly beating Bayern Munich 1-0, consummately defending those advantages in the return leg. The Reds will be favourites but concentration and patience is crucial. Klopp: ""I already respected Emery a lot, but now… wow. It's impressive"" ""We have analyzed Villarreal a lot."" pic.twitter.com/64DZN413gT — The Football Index 🎙 ⚽ (@TheFootballInd) April 26, 2022   Tottenham (Premier League, home, May 7) This looks a whole lot less daunting than it did about a fortnight ago, when Tottenham boasted the single greatest attacking trio ever devised in sport and Antonio Conte was staying for life. Now Spurs cannot muster a shot on target across 180 minutes against Brighton and Brentford and Conte is off again. Liverpool’s record in Premier League fixtures directly after European games this season is solid enough – P10 W7 D2 L1 F28 A8 – but Tottenham have beaten Manchester City twice this campaign and forced a 2-2 draw at home to the Reds in December. They are capable of any madness, good or bad, across the spectrum.  Newcastle (Premier League, away, April 30) In a Premier League table comprised solely of results this calendar year, Liverpool lead second-placed Newcastle by six points. Eddie Howe understood the assignment and subsequently refined a disorganised defence, devised a competent attacking system and installed a reliable brilliance at the Magpies’ core. Liverpool laboured past Newcastle with their stabilisers on in December; this confident and coherent version of the club is a genuine threat.  Chelsea (FA Cup final, Wembley, May 14) The absolute state of that Carabao Cup final. Chelsea had three goals ruled out for offside, hit the post and forced some fine saves from Caiomhin Kelleher at Wembley before Kepa Arrizabalaga did some things. Liverpool were excellent and had their own chances but it was damn close and Thomas Tuchel loves a knockout tournament. He has faced Klopp’s Reds four times since moving to Stamford Bridge, losing only on penalties in February, drawing a couple of wonderful Premier League meetings this season and winning at Anfield last March. Outside of a possible Champions League final, it is the most daunting obstacle remaining on the route to unprecedented glory. ",positive

Two spots could be set aside in the new-look competition from 2024 for teams with the best co-efficient ranking, which is based on their results in Europe over the previous five seasons. Modric majesty is finally almost impossible to ignore The two teams with the highest co-efficient score who finish immediately outside the regular Champions League qualification places would be eligible, under refined proposals presented by UEFA to members of the European Club Association last month. A final decision will be taken by UEFA’s executive committee on May 10. But a year on from 12 clubs announcing they had formed their own Super League, fans have expressed concerns that big clubs’ interests still hold too much sway at UEFA. Ronan Evain, the executive director of Football Supporters Europe, says the governing body must decide whether to appease Europe’s big clubs or play its role as a regulator. “There’s obviously a contradiction between the collective action of last year (to block the Super League) and to protect the European model of sports, sporting integrity and sporting merit, and the principle of these coefficients,” he told the PA news agency on the one-year anniversary of the Super League launch. “UEFA has to make a decision between appeasing big clubs and addressing their interests and concerns on one side, and stay true to what has been their position last year. They can’t get it both ways, it’s a choice between the two.” UEFA’s executive committee did approve a new format, featuring 10 matches instead of the current six and which included the two co-efficient places, at a meeting on April 19 which was completely overshadowed by the Super League launch hours before. The co-efficient proposal has been tweaked since then after concerns were raised by domestic leagues that teams could leapfrog over rivals with a lesser European pedigree into qualification spots, but Evain is surprised that, essentially, the same proposals are on the table now despite the opposition the Super League faced. “Adopting the exact same reforms as last year, or with some cosmetic changes, certainly doesn’t send the right message,” he said. “The decision is still unclear and it’s not too late for UEFA to make the right decision. And the right decision from a sporting integrity point of view is to scrap the co-efficient. “Domestic performance should be the one and only criteria (for qualification).” Asked whether he could envisage supporters protesting against the reforms, if passed as currently presented, he said: “It’s hard to tell. The risk of this reform is that it’s progressive, it’s opening the door to coefficient seats now and then God knows what happens in four years’ time. It’s death by a thousand cuts. “That has been the strategy of the big clubs for years – gaining a little bit of terrain progressively. We would hope UEFA will put an end to this so that’s definitely off the table.” ",positive

They lost it against Atletico…,"We counted six congratulatory references to ‘cool Manchester City heads’ in the BT Sport studio at the end of the game. What nonsense. City lost it and are very fortunate to be in the Champions League semi-finals. Atletico Madrid were positively gung-ho compared to the first leg. Sure, they had 30% possession in the first half and it took them half an hour to have their first shot – we’re not saying they went bonkers – but they pressed gradually more and more as the game went on, and Joao Felix had more and more company in the City box. In the second half, City were rattled.More perhaps than they have ever done, Pep Guardiola’s side were easing pressure through booting it long, and it kept coming back. Antoine Griezmann had a shot deflected behind, he had a second excellent effort from the edge of the box sail just wide, Felix perhaps should have done better with a free header,Rodrigo De Paul had a couple of chances, John Stones was forced into a magnificent block. It was entirely one-way traffic and Diego Simeone and his players will rightly feel aggrieved not to have won this game. The City players failed to heed the advice of the peerless football polymath Jake Humphrey, who told them from the BT Sport studio before kick-off that “the best way to beat Atletico is to play brilliantly”. They couldn’t keep possession, couldn’t get out, and the forward players, Riyad Mahrez apart, all had a bit of a stinker. The Atletico Madrid centre-backs, in the absence of their favoured target Jack Grealish (though he still managed to get his hair pulled by future pen pal Stefan Savic), directed their finger-pointing and whispered sweet nothings at Phil Foden. Simeone was also clearly well aware of the main Manchester City dangerman when, in the 15th minute, he made a stretcher gesture to the fourth official with Foden prostrate on the floor following ‘a challenge’ by Felipe, who received the first of his two yellow cards for his trouble. Simeone was suggesting that maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t safe for Foden to continue. But with head cummerbund adding to his comic strip character appearance, the Bash Street Kid played on and illustrated the effects of contagious shithousery in the first of what turned out to be 11 minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game. Having been kicked by Felipe, who received his marching orders as a result, Foden rolled onto the pitch having been at least a couple of yards off it. He knew what he was doing and so did Stefan Savic, who was a very angry boy. In the purest, best example of shithousery across both legs, Foden got one centre-back sent off, sent the other one absolutely batsh*t so that he should have been sent off, and completely disrupted the momentum that looked for all the world as though it was building to an Atletico equaliser. Well played, Phil, well played. The City players celebrated wildly at full-time, at least as much because they wanted to rub it in the faces of their opponents as their actual joy at getting through to the Champions League semi-final.And the majority of what’s said and written about this game will likely be about City’s grit and determination, as well as the way they kept their cool in the heat of battle against the toughest of all European opponents. But did they really keep their cool?  Sure, they didn’t have anyone sent off, but is that the only measure of cool? It’s a word frequently used to describe this City side, and rightly so, they ooze cool most of the time, but this was not a performance resembling anything like what we’re used to seeing from them. Their indignation at the typical antics of Atletico Madrid, which despite the late nonsense was in the most partnot proportionate to the antics themselves, appeared to affect the part of their brains that allows them to pass, make runs and create chances. After Ilkay Gundogan hit the post in the 30th minute, they created nothing until the same man should have sealed victory right at the end of the game. As Atletico piled on the pressure, City didn’t revert to type but attempted to survive playing exactly the way Atletico wanted them to. City could and should have passed them to death, but instead lost their heads and were fortunate to escape the Wanda Metropolitano alive.  ",positive

Ajax v Tottenham Hotspur, 2019 Having knocked out Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus in the previous round, Ajax were riding a wave of momentum coming up against Spurs in 2019. Donny van de Beek secured a first leg win for the Dutch side and they were the favourites coming into the reverse fixture. In the second leg Spurs were 2-0 down after just 35 minutes and their odds of making to the final had drifted to 43/1 as they were 3-0 down on aggregate. Step forward Lucas Moura. With star man Harry Kane injured, it fell to the Brazilian winger to step up to the plate, and step up he did in spectacular style. Spurs sealed their place in the final with Lucas slotting in a 96th minute winner to send Spurs through on away goals.  4. Liverpool v Ac Milan, 2005 Probably the most famous comeback on the list, this final will live long in the memory. AC Milan’s star-studded side found themselves 3-0 up at half time and had totally outclassed Liverpool. Steven Gerrard then managed to ignite a second half comeback and the rest is history. While they were 3-0 down, Liverpool had drifted to 99/1 to win the Champions League and they managed to seal it in an iconic penalty shootout.  3. Roma v Barcelona, 2018 Barcelona have made quite the name for themselves when it comes to throwing away leads in the Champions League, but their 2018 defeat to Roma was a massive shock to the system. The Spanish champions somehow managed to let a 4-1 lead slip and Roma defied the 199/1 odds to oversee a second half comeback. Kostas Manolas headed home the winning goal and Barcelona have never quite been the same since.  2. Barcelona v PSG, 2017 Appearing twice on today’s list, this time for a comeback of their own, Barcelona’s demolition of PSG will forever be iconic. Having been humiliated 4-0 in the first leg, Barcelona served up one of the best comebacks we have ever seen in the competition. The Spanish side were backed at 349/1 at one stage to qualify and Sergi Roberto’s 95th minute winner saw Barcelona win the tie 6-5 on aggregate.  1. Dortmund v Malaga, 2013 Having drawn the first leg in Spain 0-0, Dortmund found themselves 2-1 down at home heading into stoppage time. Jurgen Klopp’s side needed two goals to qualify, with just three minutes added on. Marco Reus made it 2-2 in the 91st minute and Felipe Santana stepped up just 60 seconds later to secure Dortmund’s 3-2 win in the last minute. The German side managed to defy the odds of 659/1 as they scored twice in two minutes to secure their place in the semi-final. ",positive
144,https://www.football365.com/news/uefa-accused-out-of-touch-fans-champions-league-proposals?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,UEFA accused of being out of touch with fans over CL proposals,"UEFA has been accused by a Premier League fans’ group of being out of touch with supporters over its Champions League reform proposals and of seeking to create a Super League by the back door. European football’s governing body and its president Aleksander Ceferin praised supporters for their role in thwarting attempts to form a European Super League almost a year ago. However, those same fans feel new proposals from UEFA to increase the number of Champions League group stage matches from six to 10 from 2024 and to reserve two qualification berths based on historic European performance rather than domestic achievement will create a “cartel” of rich clubs and damage domestic competitions. Top ten outsiders who will decide Premier League title race The Football Supporters’ Association’s Premier League Network says these proposals should be rejected by UEFA, whose ruling executive committee is expected to make a final decision on the Champions League revamp in Vienna on May 10. “We are united in opposition to proposals to reform the Champions League that are a back door attempt at a return to the discredited idea of a European Super League,” the Network’s statement said. “Last year, it was our supporter groups that united to force the collapse of the European Super League. At the time, UEFA told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans’ views would be centre stage in deciding what came next. “So it is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year ‘UEFA Club Co-efficient’. “These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrifice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games.” UEFA’s executive committee initially approved reforms to its men’s club competitions, including the Champions League, on April 19 last year, but to very little fanfare or publicity as it happened in the hours after the Super League had been launched. The increase from six matches to 10, plus a further play-off round to determine eight of the last 16, along with the inclusion of two-co-efficient places were approved at that time. The group stage would increase from 32 to 36 teams, with all teams playing in one big league and facing other teams under a seeded ‘Swiss system’. UEFA has looked at the plans again in the wake of the Super League collapse, however the proposals clearly still provide far too many concessions to the big clubs in the view of Premier League fans. Under its latest proposal, teams could only qualify via the co-efficient if they finished immediately outside the regular Champions League spots, to avoid them leapfrogging rivals who finish in a higher position. However, it is understood teams could also win the FA Cup and qualify via co-efficient, whereas FA Cup winners with a lesser European pedigree would not. “It is irresponsible and out of touch to even consider doubling the number of home games that fans will have to attend before the last -16 knock-out round begins,” the Network added. “This will be compounded by the cost of living crisis that is hitting Europe. Furthermore, we do not see how increasing the requirement for teams and fans to fly around Europe is compatible with UEFA’s environmental commitments. “Premier League fans do not want 10 group games involving a small cartel of rich clubs further distorting competitive balance. We want strong, competitive domestic leagues, an equal opportunity for all to qualify for UEFA competitions based on sporting merit, along with a fairer distribution of the game’s wealth from the revenues those competitions earn. “Last year we engaged in constructive discussions with UEFA President Ceferin who made a commitment that fans would be listened to in this process. Our collective voice is unified and our position clear. “We call on UEFA to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family.” European Leagues, the umbrella group which includes the Premier League among its membership, has sought since the beginning of the consultation to limit the increase in matches to eight rather than 10, and to grant the two extra Champions League qualification places to the domestic champions of countries not currently represented in the group stage, rather than on club co-efficient.

145,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpools-pursuit-of-history-creates-its-own-stress-at-villarreal,Pursuit of history creates its own stress as Liverpool Quad-chasers survive Villarreal scare,"The Quad dream is still alive, but further scares like Villarreal are inevitable for Liverpool in the games ahead… Liverpool will now, at the very, very least, play every possible game this season as their quest for An Unprecedented Quadruple reaches its final hurdles. They have the League Cup done, and now a Champions League final to go with the FA Cup showpiece. This particular hurdle, though, proved far tougher than anyone could have expected or the final scoreline suggested. With a 2-0 first-leg lead safely in their pockets from Anfield, all Liverpool needed to do in Villarreal – which is, and you won’t hear this in the so-called mainstream media, quite a small place – was avoid disaster. For 45 minutes, they flirted dangerously with just that. Now it does need saying that in those first 45 minutes Unai Emery’s happy-go-lucky ragtag bunch of Premier League rejects were absolutely magnificent. Etienne Capoue, who would end the evening collecting the most ‘head’s gone’ second yellow of all time for a pointless lunge at Curtis Jones, was the best player on the pitch by a frankly absurd margin. He got the assists for both goals, the second scored by another familiar face in Francis Coquelin, and there were heroes in yellow all over the pitch. We’ll state with some confidence now that no current Spurs players will give Liverpool as much gip on Saturday night as Juan Foyth and Giovani Lo Celso did here. The biggest compliment one can pay Villarreal’s first-half performance is this: it made Liverpool feel what pretty much everyone else feels playing against Liverpool. Just a relentless, unending examination where no pass is unpressured or straightforward and no respite is offered. Villarreal could hardly have offered a more different display in those first 45 minutes than the passive side with no answer or apparently plan in the first leg. Yet at three-quarters distance they had got themselves level in the tie and if momentum is a thing then they held all of it.  But for all that Villarreal excellence, and for all that they played with the abandon and courage that was their only possible route out of the almost impossible position they found themselves in, this was all about Liverpool. Most prosaically, a half where Liverpool were really, properly poor. Without caveat or mitigation, they played badly. Yet while there can be no excuse for being quite as ponderously, distractedly crap as they were in that first half, there is plenty for why they weren’t Full Liverpool. A probably inevitable by-produce of trying to achieve what Liverpool are currently trying to achieve is accepting the necessity of certain nights being made more difficult than you would ideally like. When you’re trying to win every competition then, unless you happen to find yourself in a Bayern or PSG position where the league is a formality, you have to take a different approach. Liverpool can’t really afford to drop any Premier League points from here on out, so resting players or dialing down the effort in those games is fraught with risk. Just about the only time you can even potentially do it is in cup competition second legs where you have a handy advantage already. This wasn’t even a new thing in this run. Liverpool have been dominant enough and good enough in the two previous rounds that they haven’t really had to get out of second gear in the home legs against either Inter or Benfica. The results on the night in those games weren’t great, but they served Liverpool’s greater needs. Get the job done, expend as little energy as possible, move on to the next job. That’s what the plan was again here, but Liverpool took it too far and Villarreal far exceeded expectations in that captivating first half. And yet even here there lies justification for Liverpool’s approach. They could hardly have played worse in that opening 45 minutes nor Villarreal better. And yet still Liverpool were able to turn things around without ever really having to hit top gear. The second half was a completely different story to the first, with Villarreal perhaps having committed the cardinal sin of scoring too early; their gameplan simply didn’t seem to have a contingency for wiping out the two-goal deficit as fast as they did. Villarreal came out for the second half with none of the energy of the first, while Liverpool had none of the negative passivity that characterised their opening 45. Liverpool didn’t so much roar back from 2-0 down on the night to win 3-2 as saunter. However much they were helped out by some extremely generous goalkeeping for the actual goals, Liverpool never really seemed in any serious danger from the moment the second half got under way. Villarreal were held at arm’s length and even without clown school netminding you still fancy Liverpool would have got at least one goal somewhere in that second half to get the job done. And that’s what Liverpool are doing right now. They are getting the job done. It isn’t always as thrilling to watch as they are at their absurd best – although their absurd worst in the opening half was quite entertaining in its own way – but right now all that matter is doing enough without leaving yourself too exhausted to do it all again in a few days’ time. They did it tonight, they will probably continue to do so. But there will almost certainly be more scares like this in seemingly unexpected places along the way. ",positive
146,https://www.football365.com/news/pochettino-better-manager-spurs-conte-opinion,Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte?,"Making the emotional case from the heat for a Pochettino-Spurs reunion is easy. But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs. Really all that we know is that he wasn’t right for this specific one of the biggest jobs. The criticism is unsurprising, but what is strange is that there also now seems to be some negative retrospective reappraisal of his time at Spurs, much of it coming from Spurs fans themselves. Nothing that has happened to either Spurs or Pochettino since his departure appears to support this view, but it’s definitely there. And that’s because, inevitably, the news of his imminent Paris exit sparks talk of a Spurs return. The timing is key here, because even a couple of weeks ago it would not have played out quite the same. When the Manchester United job was still available and Antonio Conte’s Spurs appeared to have struck gold by simply scoring four goals every week, the talk would have been more in the direction of United. But Erik Ten Hag is in at Manchester United, and Spurs have gone two moribund games without a shot on target against Brighton and Brentford. Conte is once again making eyes at the exit door and uncertainty has returned. Champions League football has also gone from ‘probable’ to ‘unlikely’. So would and should Spurs consider bringing Poch back? The case from the heart is easily made. There is without doubt unfinished business on both sides here, and Pochettino has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day. The appeal of just running with the energia universal vibes and bringing him back, re-signing Christian Eriksen and re-swapping Bryan Gil for Erik Lamela should be obvious even to those dreary trophy-counters turned trophy-dismissers. But is there an argument to be made with the head? We’re saying yes. And it’s this. Antonio Conte is a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, but is he a better Spurs manager at this moment? That’s less clear-cut.  The reports of his interest in the PSG job coming moments after news that Pochettino was likely on his way out are the key. His camp moved to brief against those reports, but the fact is that even if not true they are entirely believable and plausible. He is not a manager for the long haul at even the biggest clubs, and certainly not at Spurs. He has achieved a lot in a short space of time in the “painful rebuild” that was already overdue when Pochettino left Spurs in 2019 and became more and more urgent as Jose Mourinho huffed and sulked around the place for a year and a half. If he were a manager Spurs could realistically keep for five years, then everything Conte has done since November would be fine and dandy. From where he found them they had no business being in Champions League contention this season. If this was stage one of a proper new five-year plan they would be ahead of schedule. But with Conte, Spurs are always against the clock. His contract runs only to the end of next season and even that looks a long way away. The possible 12-month extension to that contract even more so. There is no escaping the sense that however things are currently going in what has been an up-and-down five months he has always had and will always have one eye on the exit door. Spurs will always be in this curious stalled position while Conte is manager. He’s not going to instantly turn them into top-level contenders again because nobody could, but any improvements he does make – and there have been plenty – are caveated into oblivion by the near-certain knowledge that he won’t be around to finish the job. Under Conte, Spurs are far better than they were without him, but it all feels oddly directionless. He is laying solid foundations for a palace that will never be built. Under Pochettino, Spurs would at the very least have the prospect of a manager who might still be around to finish what he started. And even if it did go horribly wrong, as the “never go back” truism and the fact this is Spurs suggest is quite likely, the closure that would provide – even if painful – is something both club and manager need to properly move on. It’s not as strong as the case from the heart, admittedly, but it’s there. There’s no denying an element of Tobias Funke “but it might work for us” to it all. Yet it’s hardly damp-eyed delusion to look at Conte and Pochettino and conclude that both men are probably better suited to the other’s job. And even then, wanting to stick with Conte is a perfectly viable position that it should be entirely possible for Spurs fans or anyone else to hold without having to denigrate what Pochettino achieved and could still offer. At the very, very least, Pochettino’s likely availability and keenness given the closing-off of alternative avenues offers the security of a better and cheaper back-up option than Spurs could realistically hope for should Conte’s wandering eye take him elsewhere.

147,https://www.football365.com/news/rangers-back-out-of-controversial-australia-friendly-against-celtic,Rangers back out of controversial Australia friendly against Celtic,"Rangers have pulled out of the controversial Sydney Super Cup tie against Celtic after claiming the organisers were “unwilling to fulfil their commitments” to the Ibrox club. Fans of both Glasgow giants had protested against their clubs’ decision to sign up to play a friendly in Australia during the break in domestic football for the World Cup. Manchester United finally put women front and central Rangers have now announced they will not take part – three days before Celtic visit Ibrox in the cinch Premiership. A statement read: “Rangers can confirm the club will not be participating in the Sydney Super Cup in November 2022. “After it became clear the tournament organisers were unwilling to fulfil their commitments to Rangers, we have, with immediate effect, terminated the club’s agreement with the organisers.” Rangers can confirm the Club will not be participating in the Sydney Super Cup in November 2022. — Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) March 31, 2022 It is understood Rangers cited issues with branding and payments, plus the timing and manner of the initial announcement. A number of Rangers supporters were unhappy at the perception they would be playing support act to a homecoming jamboree for the Parkhead club’s Australian boss Ange Postecoglou. Gers supporters disrupted the cinch Premiership win at Dundee several times before the international break by throwing toilet rolls and tennis balls on to the pitch. Club 1872, a fans’ group which owns about five per cent of the shares in Rangers, had also criticised the Australia tournament amid other concerns with the Ibrox hierarchy. The withdrawal comes ahead of a crucial period in Rangers’ season, with their Europa League quarter-final against Braga and a Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic to come in April along with a trip to face St Mirren. Some Celtic supporters had also criticised their club’s decision to sign up to a friendly against their city rivals. The Glasgow teams had been due to meet on November 20 at the 83,500-seat Accor Stadium as part of a tournament also featuring A-League teams Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers, following an invite from New South Wales Government. Rangers commercial director James Bisgrove had claimed his club would earn the equivalent of a season’s worth of domestic broadcast revenue by featuring in the competition. “So it is something that the board have unanimously seen as a positive opportunity for Rangers Football Club,” he added in early March. Rangers are believed to be exploring other commercial opportunities for the World Cup break. ",positive

Pochettino’s future has been under speculation ever since the French side crashed out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage and winning the Ligue 1 title last weekend has not stopped talk about his position. MAILBOX: Liverpool are still great even if they win only Carabao Cup this season Tottenham boss Antonio Conte has been strongly linked with taking over from the Argentinian at Parc Des Princes in the French media this week. France international Mbappe is out of contract in the summer and talk of a move to Real Madrid has been running all season. Pochettino, however, said that as things stand he expects both men to be in Paris next season. Asked in a press conference what the likelihood of him and Mbappe being at the club next term was, he replied: “100 per cent in both cases.” Pochettino, who was overlooked for the Manchester United job, later added: “That is how I feel today. That is what I can say to you today. I can’t say anything else. That is how I feel right now. “This is football and we never know what might happen. But I have to answer the question based on how I feel today. And that is what I have done.” Pochettino revealed there have been no formal talks about his future with the PSG hierarchy. “There haven’t been any concrete talks, beyond what is normal in terms of our plans and what we have been doing so far,” he said. “We have a natural relationship. We communicate depending on the circumstances at the time. “But the relationship and communication are good. We keep working hard, not just bearing in mind the present, but also with the responsibility in this job which is to think about the future. So that is what we are doing.” ",positive

But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs.

The former Chelsea boss replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at Spurs back in November. Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took over. He has won 17 of his 31 games in charge across all competitions. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? Spurs are in the running for a Champions League place. They are two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go. It was reported earlier this week that Conte has ‘offered himself’ to PSG. The Ligue 1 side are currently managed by former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentinian is under pressure at the moment. PSG are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Athletic have noted that reports linking Conte with PSG have ‘irritated’ Levy. Tottenham experienced a similar ‘distraction’ in 2020/21 when Harry Kane announced that he wanted to leave before the season concluded. They add: ‘There is generally a desire at the club to block out the noise and get on with it. ‘There is also an acceptance that volatility is part of the package when you appoint Conte, and that the focus has to be on the team overcoming their recent blip and qualifying for the Champions League. It’s also inevitable that when you have one of the game’s elite managers, they will be linked with other clubs — especially when you are not in the Champions League yourselves. ‘That said, there are some who feel Conte has hardly dampened speculation over the last couple of months, given the way in which he’s refused to talk about his future at Spurs beyond the immediate term. ‘As for the players, with no midweek fixture they were given pre-arranged days off on Sunday and Monday, and are not expected to have been too affected by the reports. ‘In general, Conte is very popular with the players, though there have been times, most notably after the post-Burnley meltdown in February, where they have been unsettled by the up-and-down nature of their head coach’s mood.’ ",positive

Conte has done well to turn around Tottenham since being appointed as Nuno Espirito Santo’s successor at the beginning of November with Spurs currently competing for fourth place. There have been times where Conte has admitted he has a massive job on his hands but their form since the turn of the year has been pretty good. ‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox… And nowLe Parisien (viaGet French Football News) that with Pochettino’s exit from PSG ‘imminent’, Conte has thrown his hat into the ring. It is understood that Pochettino and the French club just need to come to an agreement on compensation with it potentially costing PSG€15m to sack the former Spurs boss. It is understood that PSG want to make Zinedine Zidane their new boss as he would be their ‘ideal replacement’ but it is claimed that the former Real Madrid head coach would rather wait for the French national team job. Conte ‘has already offered himself up’ to PSG on a two-year deal whileGet French Football News sources insist that ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has ‘continued incessantly in recent months’. The report adds that Levy is ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’ after sacking the Argentine in November 2019. Tottenham have taken a small dip in form over the last couple of games after losing to Brighton a week ago before being held to a goalless draw at Brentford at the weekend. But Conte has reminded everyone about the “big trouble” Spurs were in a few months ago with the club still in the race to finish fourth. “I think also for this reason today, with five games to play we are talking about Tottenham are in the race for the Champions League [places],” Conte said. “The people have not to forget in November the big trouble that Tottenham was. Now to stay with five games to go the possibility to stay in this race means the players improved a lot and we are doing a great job. “But we have to know in this last month maybe if we gave 120 per cent maybe it’s not enough, we have to try to increase and go 150 per cent to try to reach this target.” ",positive

The Red Devils confirmed on Thursday that Erik ten Hag will become their new permanent boss at the end of the season, replacing current interim manager Ralf Rangnick. Former Tottenham boss Pochettino was believed to be in the running for the Man Utd job along with Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui. Of course these Man Utd players. They just don’t believe… However, Man Utd were impressed by Ten Hag in the interview process and opted for the Ajax boss to take them forward. And Neville reckons Pochettino – who reached the Champions League during his time at Tottenham – was no longer the “oustanding choice” because of his time at French giants PSG. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I think ultimately Pochettino has been the outstanding choice for a number of years. Losing in the Champions League this season, not winning the league in France last year… “Let’s be clear, PSG is not an easy club to manage. [Chelsea manager] Thomas Tuchel had problems over there. Tuchel wasn’t the statesmanlike like figure he has been at Chelsea at PSG. “So I think purely what has happened with Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain has cost him. “He’s got great experience of the Premier League, he did a brilliant job at Southampton and Tottenham. “But the current mood is absolutely key and Ten Hag is the man of the moment. Look, United have spoken to both of them and the club have determined that Erik ten Hag is the right man to take the club forward.” On the job Ten Hag has in front of him at Man Utd, Neville added: “What we’re seeing at this current moment is unacceptable. “That needs to be dealt with initially and Ten Hag has got a big job to get the club back up to those minimum standards that they need to achieve, which is attitude, work ethic, belief, confidence and then hopefully you start to think about winning trophies. “But honestly, I wouldn’t be putting too much pressure on Ten Hag in the first one or two years to win a trophy at the club. It would be great if he did and he’d be overachieving, in my opinion. “It will be: get into the top four, re-establish Man Utd in the Champions League, attract the players into the club who can play in the way he wants to play, and then get a system of belief. “It took Jurgen Klopp four or five years to win a Premier League title, as great a job as he’s done. I wouldn’t be putting pressure on Ten Hag in the first two or three years to win a Premier League title. “They’re a million miles away from that currently. At the end of last season, I thought they were getting closer. But it’s all collapsed and fallen to pieces. I don’t know why that’s happened. Ten Hag gets to pick up the pieces. “So initial phase: build the foundations of what he wants to achieve then year three, four, five is when you start looking at him to win trophies.” ",positive

Erik ten Hag is expected to be appointed at Old Trafford after an extensive process, which included an explosive pair of interviews with the Dutchman. But the club are said to have considered seven other candidates before deciding on the 52-year-old. The candidacy of Bayern Munich head coach Julian Nagelsmann and Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel were briefly examined but, as ESPN report, ‘it became clear almost instantly that neither would be a realistic target’. Nagelsmann was said to be an ‘impossible’ target, while Tuchel only briefly seemed availabledue to uncertainty over Chelsea’s future. Zinedine Zidane was a serious prospect until it was discovered that the only remaining club role the Frenchman would find appealing was Paris Saint-Germain. Brendan Rodgers became a contender as Manchester United were ‘keen to assess the best domestic option,’ only for Leicester‘s drop in form around the winter to quickly discount him. With Antonio Conte almost immediately ignored because ‘his demanding and detailed approach would not work’ with the squad, that left Old Trafford chiefs with a final four-man shortlist of Ten Hag, Mauricio Pochettino, Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui. Luis Enrique seemed the favourite at one stagebut a source suggested“the World Cup killed them”. Lopetegeui, meanwhile, was contemplated ‘because of his tactical and technical abilities’ but ruled out on the basis that he could be “another Unai Emery” – an accomplished coach with ‘smaller clubs’, albeit one that lacks true success at the highest level. Champions League semi-finalist with four European trophies, by the way. That left Pochettino and Ten Hag in the running. The former was an attractive applicant, but Real Madrid’s likely summer interest in the Argentinean and the substantial compensation package required to extricate him from Paris Saint-Germain proved too much of an obstacle in the mind of the Manchester United hierarchy. They found the ‘freshness’ of Ten Hag, unproven at the highest level but also not ‘tainted by failure’, to be the decisive factor. Rio Ferdinand, however, fears the job could be too big, telling hisVibe with Five YouTube channel: “We’ve seen many managers now with far more experience, who have won much more than Ten Hag, bigger reputations, who have come in and been chewed up by this football club and spat out. And the players are still the same. “So he has to find a way of getting in there and managing the characters, the personalities and the egos that are in there. And I know I sound like a broken record but the thing he has to do first is change the culture, bring the new culture and drive it. He has to do that, it’s a massive part of if he’s going to be successful.” ",positive
154,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-pochettino-nagelsmann-victims-entitlement-crisis-europe,Pochettino and Nagelsmann are both victims of football’s entitlement crisis across Europe,"Pochettino has been the subject of protests while Nagelsmann received hundreds of death threats. The biggest clubs just don’t seem very happy. The predictable finishes to some European league seasons has provoked much comment, largely about how damaging it might be for the game across the continent. But less seems to be said of whether it might be damaging for those who work at those clubs, or perhaps even the clubs themselves. Because if there’s one thing that can be said for many of these super-clubs, it’s that so many of them seem to be so unhappy for so much of the time. The appointment of Mauricio Pochettino at PSG at the start of last year was the best of appointments and the worst of appointments. Despite a failure to win any silverware with Spurs, his talents were widely acknowledged, while Pochettino got to work with some of the world’s best players, and at a club with an unlimited budget for shiny new ones. PSG have won Ligue Un at a canter this season but they tripped up again in the Champions League, and that’s where they set the bar for success now. Supporters boycotted their title celebrations. With three games of their league season left to play, they are 14 points clear at the top of the table. Meanwhile in Germany, the one-sidedness of club football is even more severe than in France. Bayern Munich have just won their tenth Bundesliga title in a row, a remarkable achievement in a country that can hardly be said to be wanting for big and storied football clubs. But again, that bar is set so high as to be almost unmanageable, as can be seen from the 450 death threats that head coach Julian Nagelsmann received after his team was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Villarreal. Bayern Munich are currently 12 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Both of these stories are particularly troubling because of the scale of the anger. In the case of PSG, the nature of their capitulation to Real Madrid in the Champions League inevitably caused anger among supporters (it was, let’s face it, embarrassing), but the fact that it’s still hanging in the air more than six weeks later surely can’t be healthy for anyone concerned. For there to be talk of Pochettino leaving after they’ve just won the league title seems ridiculous. When PSG are talked of as being ‘unmanageable’, we usually mean their expensively assembled cadre of mega-players, but when fan protests are thrown onto this bonfire as well, it looks more like the entire club. The concern is similar yet different for Bayern Munich. They should have beaten Villarreal, but the scale of such vituperation against Nagelsmann after this defeat is startling. 450 is a lot of people prepared to send death threats. Pochettino leaving PSG come the end of the season now seems inevitable, and this period will likely be considered a blot on his career, despite having won two trophies in a year and a half. Where he goes from here is just about anybody’s guess; Spurs still feels like it was an ideal fit for both parties, despite the way in which it ended before. Perhaps he could return, end this faintly absurd relationship they have with Antonio Conte in which every bad result seems to prompt him to threaten to leave the club, and Spurs can just run on vibes.  Julian Nagelsmann, meanwhile, is just 34 years old. He is at the stage in life where most players would be about to embark upon what they would hope to be a long managerial career. Nagelsmann has already been coaching to some degree for 12 years, and has been managing for six. He has shown no inclination towards leaving Bayern, but where do either party go if the modern management meat-grinder spits him up and chews him out by the time he’s, say, 37 or 38? Bayern Munich’s longest-ever serving coach was Udo Lattek, at eight years and 295 days, and it took him two spells at the club to achieve that. Do those 450 who sent those death threats have a better solution than Julian Nagelsmann for Bayern Munich? If they feel strongly enough about it to send a death threat, perhaps they should run for the club’s board. After all, Bayern are 82% fan owned. This unhappiness seems to be almost everywhere. In England, a bomb threat was made to the Manchester United defender Harry Maguire. In Scotland, fans protested the idea of a Rangers vs Celtic ‘friendly’ in Australia to a point at which the idea was abandoned. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus still seem to be trying to push through a European Super League, whether anyone else wants one or not. And if we strip away what people are so angry about and whether they’re right or wrong, it surely can’t be doing anyone much good that so many people feel this way. Furthermore, as that bar continues to rise, as expectations continue to grow, the number of Champions League trophies that can be given out at the end of each season remains exactly the same. Perhaps it really is as simple as that it’s all become too easy and that this feeds boredom, and consequently anger. There have been plenty of times throughout the history of PSG when the club would have given anything to be anywhere near the top of Ligue Un, while it’s not difficult to see how it might be difficult for Bayern Munich supporters to get anything like as excited about their tenth consecutive Bundesliga title as they did over their first. In England, there remains just enough plurality to give an illusion of competition, but even that now seems restricted to two – at a push, three – clubs. Manchester City and Liverpool have each other to keep themselves competitive, and that seems to be paying dividends in the Champions League. But Liverpool’s success has been despite a huge degree of inequality, and Manchester City have the bottomless pockets of Abu Dhabi to fall back upon. There are few guarantees that Liverpool will be able to keep up with City indefinitely. Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann will never struggle for work; they are elite-level coaches and it shouldn’t be necessary to worry about their future prospects. But we should worry about a football culture that is simultaneously narrowing the horizons of what it means to be successful while making it prohibitively expensive to try to achieve it. The blunt instrument of the accumulation of trophy players hasn’t been enough to deliver a Champions League trophy for PSG, and winning the Bundesliga repeatedly doesn’t seem to have done much for Bayern Munich in this competition either. They’ve won it once in the last nine years. But perhaps the point is that once in nine years should be enough for one club in a pan-continental tournament. If football needs a reset, perhaps that should be the first aim – to lower expectations, to make football feel more competitive again, and to make silverware feel like something that has to really be earned than something that just falls into your lap every May. To return some rarity value. It’s true to say that this level of anger is at least as much a reflection of an increasingly angry world as it is of football in splendid isolation, but that doesn’t mean that the game itself shouldn’t work harder to try and mitigate it. Because setting these increasingly unmeetable expectations for clearly talented coaches such as Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann and then becoming incandescent when they can’t achieve them doesn’t seem to be doing anybody any good.

Say what you like about Eintracht Frankfurt, but they sure know how to make an entrance. Before the start of their Europa League semi-final first leg against West Ham United, thousands of their supporters marched to The London Stadium, singing as they went. It wasn’t difficult to see how they’d taken over Camp Nou a couple of weeks before. West Ham United have finally started to feel like a club with an identity after several shapeless and often unhappy years after leaving The Boleyn Ground, a decision that got increasingly unpopular as its implications became increasingly clear. But The London Stadium might be starting to feel like home, and this year’s Europa League has been a big part of that. Semi-finals can be when the fireworks fly. There is a tendency in cup finals for teams to become too fearful of losing, leading to matches becoming underwhelmingly cautious, but semi-finals seem to tap into a different part of the brain, the part that shouts, ‘We go hell for leather, and damn the consequences!’ so loudly that it can’t be ingored. Consider, for example, the recent Champions League semi-final between Manchester City and Real Madrid. How likely would it have been for that to happen in the final? Admittedly, this was a first leg which the coaches might even have considered an exploratory mission before the main event gets underway back in Germany in a couple of weeks. Full-time was half-time this evening. This one had a strange sense of history about it. European club football is, as we all know, highly stratified, with the usual suspects sitting at the top table, intending to remain there in perpetuity, as though it’s some sort of weird birthright. But European club football used to be less lop-sided than this, and some would argue still is. The Champions League is just one of three semi-final first legs being played in this one week, and the other clubs have stories to tell too. It’s been 42 years since West Ham United last won a trophy, but in 1976 they reached the final of the European Cup Winners Cup. It was the last time they won in the semi-final of a European competition and their opponents were… Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht Frankfurt are, of course, A Big Club, as demonstrated by the march on Stratford that took place before this game, and they are also storied. They were the team on the end of one of the European Cup’s great performances, Real Madrid’s 7-3 win against them at Hampden Park in 1960, and even now their name evokes a feeling of greatness, a feeling that this is a club that has its own European pedigree – they won the UEFA Cup in 1980 – that it can summon forth when it needs. That spirit took over Camp Nou in the previous round and seemed to catch Barcelona off-guard. Within 50 seconds at The London Stadium, they’d summoned up a ghost of Hampden Park, Ansgar Knauff drifting behind Pablo Fornals to catch Rafael Santo Borre’s cross from the left and head it back across Alphonse Areola. It was a perfectly-placed header, especially considering how early it in the game it came. 1-0 to Eintracht, 179 minutes to play. The goal caused an unsurprisingly delirious reaction from the travelling supporters, who had been making some considerable noise themselves prior to kick-off. Otherwise, The London Stadium fell silent. This certainly didn’t seem to have been in any of their scripts.  But to their considerable credit, West Ham hauled their way back into the game. They were level before the midway point in the first half when, having already hit the post through Jarrod Bowen, Manuel Lanzini crossed from the left. Kurt Zouma, whose presence in the team had been something of a surprise following an injury, headed the ball back across the goal and, with a scramble threatening to break out, Michail Antonio headed goalwards. For a second it looked as though the Eintracht goalkeeper Kevin Trapp might have scooped the ball out, but the goal line technology confirmed the ball as well over the line and the replay confirmed it. There would be no repeat of Scott Parker’s recent outburstthis time around. It had been a perky opening, but the teams couldn’t continue at that pace. West Ham looked dangerous on set-pieces, while Eintracht looked dangerous every time they broke, but by half-time the teams were at stalemate. But nine minutes into the second half, Eintracht were back in front, and this time it proved to be decisive. Djibril Sow combined with Borre – that left-hand side again – and Areola could only palm his shot straight to the feet of Daichi Kamada, who tapped the ball into an empty net. For a moment, the West Ham defence had frozen, and initally arms were raised in the hope (or initially expectation) of an offside flag, but Kamada was level with Sow when he took the shot in the first place. The move deserved a goal; the pass from Borre back to Sow was particularly delicious. But this time around, West Ham didn’t seem able to get back into the game in the same way they had in the first. The volume levels around the ground didn’t really return until there were 13 minutes to play, when substitute Said Benrahma, whose introduction midway through the half did breathe some life into an increasingly stale-looking West Ham team, blasted wide, only for Eintracht players to react angrily to an off the ball collision between Declan Rice and Martin Hinteregger, for which no foul had been given. Two minutes later, Kamada’s shot took a slight nick off Craig Dawson’s calf and hit the post. And ninety seconds into stoppage-time, West Ham almost forced what would have been a sensational late equaliser. Declan Rice crossed from the left and Jarrod Bowen leapt to fire an acrobatic overhead kick against the Eintracht crossbar. It was an extraordinarily powerful shot. A couple of inches lower, and it would have been a goal. It might even have bounced out at a slightly different angle, hit Trapp, and bounced in. But it didn’t, and barely a minute and a half later the full-time whistle blew. What was very clear and noticeable about this match was how much it mattered to both teams. West Ham United and Eintracht Frankfurt have both put a lot into this year’s Europa League, and matches come to feel important when they feel important to the two competing teams. West Ham will be extremely disappointed to now be travelling to Frankfurt for the second leg with so much work to do. The one-goal deficit certainly isn’t insurmountable, but having come this far and embraced the competition to the extent to which they have, to lose at home at this stage of the competition will be galling. But Eintracht Frankfurt put in an assured and classy performance, and will make daunting opponents for the second leg. They know how to make an entrance, and on this occasion they exited London with one foot in the Europa League final. ",positive

The forward progressed through the ranks at Chelsea. He netted 18 goals from his 47 appearances across all competitions in 2019/20. Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard at the start of 2021. The German rarely used Abraham during the latter part of the 2020/21 campaign. Chelsea need stability and clarity as Thomas Tuchel exit rumours begin to swirl again Abraham departedChelsea before this season. Jose Mourinho’s Roma splashed out around £34m to sign him. The 24-year-old has been in sensational form for the Italian side this term, scoring 24 goals from his 46 outings. Abraham’s Roma face Leicester City in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. Before the first leg on Thursday, Abraham has reflected on his time at Chelsea: “I was the (joint) highest scorer in the FA Cup (with four goals) and to be told I wasn’t in the squad for the final, you can only imagine how I felt,” Abraham told The Athletic. “It wasn’t a nice feeling. But I was there to support the boys. I would always do that – good times and bad times – and the same with the Champions League. I just wanted my team to do well and win. “I’ll admit it was a very low point in my career. It did mess with me mentally for a bit. It got to a point towards the back end of the season where I was stropping, I was annoyed, because I’m working hard in training and I wasn’t getting the chances. “I was doing the best I could, getting in early and finishing late, training drills, finishing drills, and still wasn’t getting a look in. “I could understand if I wasn’t in great form or wasn’t training well or had a bad attitude. I just didn’t understand. I was working so hard. I was having players coming up to me saying, ‘You were unbelievable today in training’. That was the hardest part.” On his relationship with Mourinho, Abraham added: “I’ll never forget Jose’s first few words to me. He said: ‘Do you want to stay in rainy England or come and enjoy some sun in Rome?’ “We laughed and had a good chat. He played a massive part in getting me here. I call him my uncle of Italy.” ",positive

The newly-crowned LaLiga champions head into the second leg of their semi-final against Manchester City on Wednesday trailing 4-3 on aggregate after a remarkable first encounter at the Etihad Stadium last week. Real trailed by two goals to a dominant City three times but repeatedly fought back in an absorbing encounter. Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham They followed up by clinching their domestic title at the weekend and, after staging recoveries in the previous two rounds, are in bullish mood as they return to the Bernabeu. Ancelotti said: “We have scored three goals against Paris St Germain, five against Chelsea and three against Manchester City. “Sometimes you have to take a little risk but we have the quality to do it. “They have the advantage and we have to improve. It is difficult but we have an incredible opportunity to play another final after having won LaLiga. “The mood is very good and we can do it.” Real are without key defender David Alaba through injury but the influential Casemiro is fit to feature in midfield. Casemiro’s availability, having only been fit enough for the bench last week, gives Ancelotti a selection poser over whether or not to retain the in-form Rodrygo, who has scored four goals in his last five games. Rodrygo took Casemiro’s place last week but moved into an advanced position alongside Vinicius Junior and the prolific Karim Benzema – the two goalscorers – with Federico Valverde dropping into midfield. With the experienced pair of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in the centre, Real will not lack the quality needed to prevail against a formidable City side. Modric, the former world player of the year, feels it is now a case of turning it on. The veteran Croatia international, speaking alongside Ancelotti at the pre-match press conference, said: “We have to go out there and show a lot of belief, personality, energy, aggression and show that we’reReal Madrid, the best team in the world. “As always, theBernabeualso has a part to play and we’ve got to make sure we get our fans in the game right from the off.” 👑 King of the #UCL! 9️⃣ @Benzema ⚽ 14 goals 📆 21/22 pic.twitter.com/2ShQThCjX7 — Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) May 3, 2022 Real faced the prospect of elimination against both PSG and Chelsea at the Bernabeu but turned both ties around. While some may suggest they have ridden their luck, Modric looks at it as a show of character. The 36-year-old said: “To get here and be in I don’t know how many semi-finals and winning the Champions League, you cannot only have luck. “There is an opinion that we have won and don’t know how. That is a little unfair. We have to laugh but everyone can have their opinion. “We are concentrating on us and not what is said from outside. “We expect an opponent of the highest level, like Chelsea or PSG. I cannot say if it will be more difficult, but they are a very good team with big players. We expect a very difficult game.”  ",positive

Abraham swapped Chelsea for Roma in the summer transfer window in a deal worth £34m after not being given sufficient playing time at Stamford Bridge. And the England international has showed what he can do this season in Serie A with 18 goals and four assists in all competitions for Roma. Ranking every Premier League No. 1 by ball-playing ability Arsenal were reportedly interested in signing him last summer but eventually decided against a move – but his form this term has reportedly persuaded them to pursue a deal. Italian website Calciomercato (via Sport Witness) claims that Arsenal have ‘placed’ Abraham ‘at the top of the list’ for strikers this summer. After Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left the Gunners at the beginning of February, Mikel Arteta now faces the possibility of losing Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah on free transfers this summer too. It is understood that Arsenal will attempt to sign two new strikers this summer with Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus also high up their list of priorities. But Calciomercato continued by insisting that Abraham remains a key part of Roma’s ‘three-year project’ and they would be reluctant to let him leave in the next transfer window. If Jose Mourinho remains at Roma then Calciomercato insist that Abraham will also stay for ‘years to come’ with both the Serie A outfit and the former Chelsea striker wanting ‘to continue together for a long time’. Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit thinks Abraham would be a great fit at the Emirates Stadium but admits Abraham made the right decision to move to Roma. “Abraham reminds me of Emmanuel Adebayor, his physical presence in the penalty area,” Petit said earlier this month. “Abraham’s reaction when he arrived at Roma has been brilliant because he’s scored 15 [league] goals and has so many assists, so he’s enjoying his football there. He went to Italy with the feeling of revenge for what happened at Chelsea. “He’s not stupid, he will see what’s going on with the strikers at Chelsea with Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, they’re struggling. So maybe he’s thinking, ‘it would have been worse for me if I had stayed at Chelsea’. He made the right decision and he’s having a great season with Roma. “I’m pretty sure he wants to come back to England and he would fit perfectly at Arsenal because he’s a different player to Alexandre Lacazette with a different style, different physique and he’s a goalscorer. “Even at Chelsea he was scoring goals, not as many as he wanted, but he’s 24 years old so he still has a lot to learn.” ",positive

Brentford offered Eriksen a chance to play in the Premier League again at the end of January after he was released by Serie A giants Inter Milan. He returned to England just seven months after suffering a cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020. Eriksen has found some of his best form again since moving to Brentford with lots of speculation that he could make a big summer move to a team higher up the table. In particular, his former club Tottenham have been heavily linked over the past couple of months. But now the Daily Star claim that Ten Hag – who will take over at Man Utd at the end of the season – has added Eriksen to his ‘transfer wish-list’and believes he ‘would be the perfect signing to launch his revolution’. Eriksen will be available on a free transfer again in the summer after agreeing a short-term deal at Brentford which ‘makes him even more attractive to the Premier League elite’. Man Utd could be without Champions League football next term as they continue to struggle in the Premier League but ‘Ten Hag is still optimistic of persuading Eriksen that his huge project to revive the fallen Premier League giants is a challenge worth taking on’.  GUNNERS TO MAKE THEIR MOVE Arsenal are getting ready to offer a £50m package to persuade Roma to sell star striker Tammy Abraham, according to reports. Abraham only made 12 Premier League starts for Chelsea last campaign under Thomas Tuchel and he decided he needed a move in the summer transfer window. Roma swooped in and bought him for £34m and have reaped the rewards this term with Abraham scoring 18 goals in all competitions for theGiallorossi. Arsenal are on the lookout for a couple of new strikers in the upcoming transfer window with Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah out of contract at the end of the season. And now the Daily Star insist that the Gunners are ‘ready to renew their interest’ in Abraham after Mikel Arteta was ‘desperate’ to sign him a year ago. The north London club are currently leading the race to finish fourth this season with Arteta’s side now two points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham and six points ahead of Man Utd. If they manage to secure Champions League football then the Daily Star adds that Arsenal will ‘present the Serie A outfit with a £50million offer once this season ends’ for Abraham. It is claimed that Roma ‘might be tempted into bagging a quick profit’ and, despite Abraham being happy with life in Rome, he also ‘wouldn’t be averse to returning to London where he has family and friends’.

We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

However, according to Gazzetta dello Sport (via Caught Offside), Italian side Juventus are reportedly already in contact with the players agent and have offered a contract that would see him earn around £6.2m-per-year. Due to Pogba’s contract expiring in the summer, he is eligible to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs, so a potential move back to Juve could be concluded sooner rather than later.

De Ligt has been linked with a move to Chelsea as Thomas Tuchel faces a crisis in the heart of his defence. Four of the Blues centre-backs – Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen, Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva – are out of contract at the end of the season. READ MORE: Premier League winners and losers – and some who fit both The club are optimistic that Silva will extend his deal, but clubs have been heavily linked with both Rudiger and Azpilicueta, while there are also doubts over Christensen remaining at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea will likely return to Sevilla with a fresh offer for Jules Kounde, after they agreed personal terms with the Frenchman in the summer. But should more than one of the out-of-contract stars leave, Tuchel will require further reinforcements in that area of his squad. One defender to be linked with Chelsea is De Ligt, who joined Juventus from Ajax in 2019 but has found the transition to Serie A difficult. With Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci still performing at a high level, the 22-year-old has struggled for consistent game time. Chelsea would have to stump up significant funds for the Netherlands international, who moved to Juve for £77million. But they will have been encouraged by Raiola, who recently told NRC (via TEAMtalk) that his client“is ready for a new step… he thinks that too.” Meanwhile, Gary Neville says Thomas Tuchel, despite having “credit in the bank”, will be a “little bit worried” about his future at Stamford Bridge. Neville said:“I know it’s a club that does things very differently, but I’d hate to think that Thomas Tuchel is under pressure and they’re thinking of making a change, I can’t believe that to be the case. “I think he’ll be a little bit worried. I think mentally when you try to get a game called off and you’re then told to play it, I can’t think that will help the mindset in that game. “I know they didn’t have a full bench, and we’ll have to ask later why more young players couldn’t come onto it, but it was a strong Chelsea team.” ",positive
168,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-career-mino-raiola-demonstrated-absurdities-modern-football,The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football,"Raiola was loved by his clients and made himself a lot of money, but the influence of agents in remains at best mixed for the game. In the end, he died as he lived: bullish to his final breath and shrouded in controversy. At a human level, the death of Mino Raiola at the age of 54 is obviously a tragedy, and a sobering reflection upon how fragile life can be. And that shouldn’t be forgotten as we pause to reflect upon his life. But he was also one of the most divisive figures in one of the most divisive part of football’s universe, and that cannot be ignored either. Even his actual passing had an air of hyperreality. His death was first reported in the Italian press early on Thursday morning, only to be contradicted by a tweet from Raiola’s official account which read: ‘Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in four months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate.’ Later the same day, Jose Fortes Rodriguez, a close colleague, told reporters that “he’s in a bad position, but he hasn’t died”. But on Saturday afternoon, his death was confirmed; this time the confirmation came from his official Twitter account and there have been no subsequent contradictions. Raiola inspired polarised opinions and this is hardly surprising. In one respect, he fitted a stereotype: overweight, usually wearing shades and jogging bottoms, seldom (if ever) seen in a suit, and more often than not with a mobile phone pressed to the side of his face. And he was famously abrasive, with a tendency to berate anybody who got in the way of him negotiating the best deal possible for his clients or those who criticised him. He certainly seemed plenty aware of this perception. When he decided to purchase a property in Miami, he spent €9m on the former home of Al Capone. But he also polarised opinion because he was amongst the most successful agents, at least in terms of making himself a lot of money. It’s always been the case that the transfer of an elite-level player can change the course of a club’s history, and the growing influence of agents as power-brokers within the game has had a strange effect on others. Raiola found his name being sung by fans of clubs desperate to sign his clients, but has also found himself being criticised live on television in post-match discussions. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the players with whom he was most closely associated and a player with a similarly abrasive way of dealing with the outside world, was a close personal friend. Those who criticise agents as ‘leeches taking money out of the game’ (or variants thereupon) are almost missing the point; in this day and age, agents are very much part of the game and its inner workings. Consider, for example, the influence of Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the club having won promotion to the Premier League and established themselves in the top half of the Premier League, with European football under their belt. We might not like the fact that agents hold this much influence, but it doesn’t make it any less true. But the career arc of Paul Pogba does ask questions of whether the influence of the agent is always beneficial to the player concerned. Pogba won four Serie A titles in a row by the time he was 23 with Juventus, but his £89m sale to Manchester United in 2016 has seen his career stall (at least at club level), and it remains likely that he will be leaving Old Trafford at the end of this season with just a Europa League and a Carabao Cup medal to show for the six prime years of his career, although who might now be representing him now is unknown. But the facts are stark. Manchester United didn’t get anything like what they were expecting from him and the player doesn’t seem to have had an especially happy time there, but Raiola was reported to have earned himself €27m from the deal.  Right to the very end, Raiola was understood to be working feverishly to complete the transfer of Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but his death comes with this contract not having been completed and there were even reports that Manchester City had visited him in hospital to get it over the line. What happens to that deal now – or to any of his clients – is a question for another day, but with the end of the season and the opening of another transfer window on the horizon, that other day will have to come sooner rather than later. There is a case for saying that agents are good for football. Players need representation when contracts are being signed, and few would question that they would be highly vulnerable to exploitation if that representation didn’t exist. And there’s a case for saying that redistributing football’s vast wealth to players is better than it staying in the hands of those who run clubs, even if the distribution of those wages isn’t particularly even. And even criticism of the Paul Pogba career arc should be tempered by the fact that Pogba never asked Raiola to stop representing him. If the player thinks the agent is doing a good job, that’s all that matters, right? Well… not quite. What the life and death of Mino Raiola exposes is the absurdity of modern football, a world in which an agent will have their name sung from the rafters if he brings a client to your club but is a game-sucking leech if he doesn’t; a world in which transfers are often treated as more important than matches, in which being abrasive and obnoxious is perfectly okay, so long as that person is throwing shade upon someone else that you disagree with; a world in which grotesque inequalities and the commoditisation of people – including children – are simply accepted as if there’s nothing that can be done about them, and in which millions of not-very-wealthy people pay substantial money in season ticket money and pay-TV subscriptions, only for a fair proportion of it to end up with already very wealthy people who often seem to love football while holding it in contempt. There’s every possibility that, wherever he is right now, Mino Raiola is having a good old laugh to himself over the absurdity of it all – including the reporting of both of his deaths – and he’d be absolutely right.

Fans showed their anger at the Glazer family as their team earned themselves a 3-0 win against Brentford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

In spells we were too hectic. “But OK, fair play to Man United. I think they hit a very high performance first half – some of their better performance that I have seen so far so they did well. “Second half much more the Brentford team I want to see, much more front footed. “We had momentum with chances and half chances and we were definitely on top and then we make a stupid mistake for the penalty, an unnecessary mistake and that of course killed the game off I would say. “If you want to win here at Old Trafford, we can’t make a penalty and concede on a set piece.”  ",positive

GET RICH OR DIE TRYING It rather sums up the precarious situation at Everton that while supporters can revel in victory over Chelsea, club suits are rubbing their hands together at the prospect of the scorer’s value going up. Richarlison netted his fourth goal in five games in that 1-0 win; that rich vein of form is being welcomed in more than one way at Goodison Park. There is hope on Merseyside that an offer of £50m or more can now be attracted for the Brazilian. Football Insider cite only ‘arecruitment source’ as saying the club ‘will accepts’ such a bid and ‘are increasingly confident’ it will come. Richarlison ‘has made up his mind’ on leaving and so Everton could be seen as simply preparing for the inevitable, particularly with their financial struggles. It is not made expressly clear who will be throwing £50m at Frank Lampard’s feet but Richarlison will have his suitors.  NEVER SAY NEVES Manchester United might be able to spin one of their senior scout’s attendance at Brighton’s thrashing of Wolves as a positive, despite Ruben Neves ostensibly being the player watched. The Portuguese returned from a knee injury for his first game in gold since the defeat to Leeds six weeks ago, but was substituted at half-time in the 3-0 defeat. Perhaps that will bring his valuation down. Bruno Lage has mentioned a £100m price tag for the midfielder on a couple of occasions over the past few weeks but the Birmingham Mail suggest something a little more reasonable. While Wolves are unlikely to demand a nine-figure sum, they will ‘expect a significant increase’ on the £41m received from Liverpool for Diogo Jota in summer 2020. This comes from the ‘growing belief’ that after five years at Molineux, Neves might move on to pastures new. It has to be said, Ruben Neves is the best player I’ve seen in a Wolves shirt  in 53 years of watching the team. Grealish at £100M does not impact or control a game like Ruben does so any potential suitors can start the bidding at £100M plus or feck off. #wwfc — Phil Hough (@Phil_Hough) April 28, 2022   MART BUSINESS Neves will have a couple of years remaining on his contract by the end of the season. That makes him a far simpler target to procure than Lautaro Martinez, who extended his deal with Inter to 2026 in October. Yet Manchester United have not been put off and, according to Italian journalist Marco Barzaghi, are trying to kill two transfer birds with one stone. As well as bringing in a new and excellent forward, Manchester United attempted to offload Anthony Martial in a part-exchange, Barzaghi told his YouTube channel. “There’s talk of Manchester United making an offer of €50million plus Martial for Lautaro Martinez,” he said. But “Inter aren’t interested in it it as they would only want cash,” which would help in their pursuit of Paulo Dybala. This comes after the recent claims that Martial could be in line to have the rest of his Old Trafford contract paid out, thus easing the process of his protracted departure. A £12m pay-off should do it. Ouch. ",positive

He has a lot of quality,” Ronaldinho told Sport. “He would fit in very well with Spanish football due to his playing characteristics.” Elsewhere, Arsenal legend Ian Wright thinks that Kalvin Phillips wants to leave Leeds United to “win things”.

Five PL outcasts who staked their club claim for their countries The Brazilian has been an asset to Leeds over the past two seasons. He has grabbed 15 goals and twelve assists from his 59 outings. The midfielder’s contract expires in 2024. In recent days he has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona. Merson thinks Raphinha is “capable of playing for the big boys”: “Raphinha is a player who has generated a lot of transfer talk in recent weeks, with Barcelona reportedly interested in snapping him up this summer,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “I think he’ll leave Leeds regardless of what happens – he’s capable of playing for any of the big boys in the Premier League. “Real Madrid and Barcelona still have the charm when it comes to foreign players – when either of the two clubs come for a player, they inevitably end up getting them.” Elsewhere, Jesse Marsch says he is determined to get the best out of Raphinha: “He is a massive talent and my challenge, despite all of the talk outside, is to have the relationship where we can focus on his development in helping the team while he is here. “I haven’t had a word with him about Deco or Barcelona. It (Barca’s interest) should be out there because he is fantastic. “I just want him to become the player I know he can be. Everyone here wants to enjoy the football he can play. Of course we want him to stay as long as possible. He’s a fantastic player and very good person.” Marsch also confirmed both Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper were in contention to start this weekend but said neither are “90 minutes fit”. “I don’t think we can start both of them. Because it becomes two subs we may have to make,” Marsch said. “I’ve spoken to both of them and they are both feeling good. They’re looking even better.

The Brazilian has been attracting interest from a number of top clubs around Europe with Liverpool and Barcelona the most heavily linked in recent months. Raphinha has contributed 15 goals and 12 assists in 57 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in England. There has been speculation that Catalan giants Barcelona have agreed a four-year contract with Raphinha and now they just need to agree a fee with the West Yorkshire club. Gossip: Updates on three Liverpool winger targets Reports have claimed in recent months that the winger has a £70m release clause in his contract, which reduces to £25m if Leeds are relegated from the Premier League. However, Orta has rubbished claims that Raphinha can be bought for £70m and insisted that he only has a clause if Leeds don’t survive in the Premier League. Speaking to Radio Marca (via Football Espana), Orta poured cold water on claims that Barcelona are closing in on signing Raphinha, he said: “Fortunately, the person managing his career knows what he is doing and that is Deco [Raphinha’s agent].” “In this case, he helps me. I can’t say all agents do but in this case he is a help to me. The only target he has placed in front of his client is to help Leeds survive – everything else in the future will come after that.” He added: “I say this because a transfer guru said that he had a clause, sometimes that guru is wrong. Raphinha does not have a release clause if Leeds stay in the Premier League.” Meanwhile, Leeds confirmed some more bad news on the injury front this week with Patrick Bamford out for at least another six weeks. Leeds’ head of medicine and performance Rob Price said on the club website: “(Bamford) has played with a plantar fascia injury for the last 12 months. “Despite treatment and a prolonged period of rehabilitation, the injury has progressed from a partial tear to a full rupture. “Injuries to the plantar fascia are notoriously difficult to manage, but all concerned are confident that he will make a full recovery from this injury in good time. “What (Bamford) needs is a period of rest and rehabilitation to allow his body to fully recover.” ",positive

Arsenal have looked a little bit short in central midfield this season, with their squad depth in that position not as good as in other areas and a swoop for Tielemans would go a long way to solving that. In other Arsenal transfer news, Fabrizio Romano has insisted that Arsenal have joined the race to sign Leeds United star Raphinha. Romano insists that it will be tricky for the Gunners to sign the Brazilian due to Barcelona “leading the race” but the north London club have serious interest. “I can tell you that Arsenal also ask for information about Raphinha of Leeds,”Romano told the Here We Go Podcast. “Barcelona are leading the race for Raphinha. But also Arsenal ask for information for Raphinha. “They are not leading the race. They are looking for that kind of player. “So [Cody] Gakpo is a player they are following, but also Raphinha is a player they like. But it’s really complicated because Barcelona are leading the race.” ",positive

THREE IN FOR PORTUGAL HERO Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United have all been credited with an interest in Otavio (a new name in the gossip column!), the 27-year-old Porto midfielder who played on the right wing against both Turkey (he scored and assisted) and North Macedonia this week. His price is said to be just £17m, presumably because in football terms he is a little on the old side. Otavio has been credited with an impressive 12 assists in the Portuguese league this season, which has catapulted him into the Portuguese national team. It is said by Fichajes that Liverpool see him as an option in central midfield while Manchester United are attracted to the price and see him as a utility player who can play in central midfield and also on the right wing.  RODRYGO AVAILABLE TO REDS Real Madrid are prepared to sell Rodrygo this summer as they prepare for the potential arrivals of Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, according to Sport. Mbappe is expected to arrive this summer, with Haaland possibly following him a year later if they can persuade him to wait in Dortmund. The Brazilian international has long been linked with Liverpool and now could be available for as little as £34m, which would constitute a bargain for the 21-year-old, who has had an underwhelming year at Madrid but could blossom under the tutelage of Jurgen Klopp. Marco Ascensio is also available as Madrid try and pull off a long-overdue clear-out.  RAPHINHA BID INCREASED Leeds were never going to take £30m for Raphinha, regardless of how much the Brazilian might want to swap Yorkshire for Barcelona, so according to Sport, they have come back with another offer. And what’s that offer? Well, it doesn’t sound quite so spectacular as to be irresistible – it’s an initial £34m with an extra £8m in add-ons if certain criteria are met. ‘The Barça club will not enter any auction and will not move from there,’ claim Sport, who point out that Leeds’ relegation will see Raphinha available for just £21m, which sounds like it might lead to a conflict of interest for the Brazilian. Meanwhile, the Here We Go podcast suggests that Arsenal are interested in Raphinha and are watching events closely.  ",positive

The Brazilian signed for Leeds from French outfit Rennes and has been a key player for the Whites in the Premier League. Jesse Marsch’s side have struggled this term but wins in their last two league games has left the West Yorkshire side seven points above the drop zone. West Ham United attempted to sign the 25-year-old in January for around £50m.He has also been linked with a move toLiverpool, Chelsea, Tottenhamand Barcelona. Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season Raphinha’s Leeds contract expires in 2024 and ex-head coach Marcelo Bielsa had spoken this season about the club’s desire to tie the Brazil international down to a new deal. However, it looks more and more likely that Raphinha will end up elsewhere in the summer with Liverpool and Barcelona reportedly showing the most interest. And now Spanish publicationNacional claims that Barcelona already has a ‘completely closed agreement’ with the player but must convince Leeds to sell him. The Catalan giants see Raphinha as an ‘undisputed starter’ for them and they have received encouragement from the Premier League star, who has ‘asked to leave’. Raphinha has ‘rejected all the renewal offers that have been presented to him’ and is ‘determined to change scenery’ in an effort to win titles. Leeds ‘understand’ his request and ‘will not oppose his departure’ but want€75m from any club to make a deal happen this summer. Barca are ‘not willing to pay’ that amount for the Brazilian but the West Yorkshire outfit could would be willing to ‘accept a significant reduction’ if the La Liga side include Manchester United flop Depay in any deal. Barcelona do have that ‘bargaining chip’ with Marsch seeing the Netherlands international as the ‘perfect successor’ to Raphinha. President Joan Laporta has already ‘given the approval’ to Depay’s exit, while Barca boss Xavi ‘will not object’, but there is a problem as the 28-year-old wants to ‘prioritise other options long before going to Leeds’.

It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason.

Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive

Pursuit of history creates its own stress as Liverpool Quad-chasers survive Villarreal scare However, Klopp’s side outplayed their opponents in the second half to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate. Liverpool will face Real Madrid or Premier League rivals Manchester City in the Champions League final in Paris as they chase an unprecedented quadruple. “It is outstanding,” Klopp told BT Sport. “We made it pretty tricky for ourselves. We knew before that these kind of things can happen. In life it is always about how you react when things don’t go your way. A goal conceded after two or three minutes is obviously the opposite of what you wanted. Momentum on their side.

They put us under pressure, man for man all over the pitch. “We did not play football at all. I told the boys ‘they have momentum but they don’t own it, we can get it back’. We had to play in the spaces and force our way into a game that did not start well. All of a sudden, when we broke the lines and found spaces and were more flexible and not fixed on positions, all of a sudden we were in the game. We scored goals and made it happen. “The thing at half-time is that we knew what was wrong, it was obvious, but we did not have a situation to show when it was right. We were calm. If Villarreal play the second half like they play the first and we do the same they will be in the final. But we are still here so I think we could give it a try. This is what we did. “Yes I will watch it [the other semi-final]. Whoever it will be it will be massive. Whoever wins tomorrow will enjoy it and then face each other in Paris.”  ",positive

Keita’s assured first-half finish was enough to claim a 1-0 win at St James’ Park on a day when Reds manager Jurgen Klopp was able to rest Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from his startling line-up ahead of Tuesday’s decisive Champions League semi-final trip to Villarreal. 50 stats to separate Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League title race Liverpool might – and probably should – have won more comfortably in front of a boisterous crowd of 52,281 as they held the upper hand for much of a contest which saw the Magpies’ hopes of a fifth successive league win and a seventh on the trot at home wilt in the face of almost constant pressure. Eddie Howe’s men were never able to build up the kind of head of steam which has eased them clear of the relegation battle, perhaps a reminder of how far they have to go before they can once again compete with English football’s best on a sustained basis. The game kicked off amid a raucous atmosphere which might have increased had Jonjo Shelvey managed to make a better connection with a second-minute shot. Diogo Jota was similarly unable to make the most of a half-chance as the ball dropped to him inside the Newcastle penalty area, but Keita had keeper Martin Dubravka scrambling across his line as his first-time strike flew inches wide of the far post with eight minutes gone. Jordan Henderson volleyed high over from Andy Robertson’s corner with the Reds menacing in possession, which they increasingly started to dominate as Henderson and James Milner were allowed to dictate from the middle of the field. 𝐆𝐄𝐓 𝐈𝐍 ✊🔴 pic.twitter.com/dCdSzZFTGx — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 30, 2022 They took the lead with 19 minutes gone when, with the home side appealing in vain for a free-kick following Milner’s challenge on Fabian Schar, Henderson and Jota combined to feed Keita, who stepped inside before dispatching the ball past the helpless Dubravka. Newcastle’s response was tepid with Allan Saint-Maximin dragging a 28th-minute effort harmlessly wide as the visitors denied Bruno Guimaraes time and space to effectively limit his creativity, and Dubravka had to get down well to keep out Sadio Mane’s shot after Luis Diaz had raced away down the right 11 minutes before the break. Miguel Almiron thought he had levelled with six minutes of the half remaining after rounding Alisson, only for an offside flag to dash his hopes, and it took a fine fingertip save by Dubravka to prevent Jota from increasing the visitors’ lead as the whistle approached. Newcastle returned with greater intensity, but with key men Guimaraes and Saint-Maximin still largely curtailed, were unable to cause enough problems to trouble Alisson and his defence unduly, and Dubravka had to be alert to deny Jota and Robertson in quick succession as the hour mark approached. Mane might have killed the game off with 27 minutes remaining but steered his shot wide, and Dubravka had to save from substitute Salah and Jota as Liverpool eased to victory, although Alisson had to be vigilant to keep out Guimaraes’ late strike.

189,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-newcastle-0-1-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-quadruple-keita,Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency,"Jurgen Klopp rolled the dice with five changes but the Liverpool boss can do no wrong while the Reds edge towards immortality… Given their trip to Newcastle had been billed as their toughest remaining Premier League assignment, the efficiency with which Liverpool eased to yet another victory bodes extremely well as the Reds ace another test in their quest for immortality. The Magpies have got closer than anyone else to matching Liverpool’s remarkable points haul in 2022 and their renaissance underEddie Howe was enough to exacerbate whatever smattering of pessimism that may remain in the minds of the visiting supporters. If Newcastle’s resurgence wasn’t enough to make the Reds fans edgy, Jurgen Klopp heightened the jeopardy by making five changes to his starting XI. For the first time this season, his side featured none of Mo Salah, Fabinho or Trent Alexander-Arnold, with Thiago also given most of the afternoon to recharge his batteries amid a relentless and potentially history-making run. Jurgen Klopp reaction: ‘I loved it, we controlled the game in so many ways’ Klopp, though, can do no wrong at present. Liverpool simultaneously achieved almost complete control at St James’ Park while four of their most important players rested for the most part before seven more matches which could see the Reds become the first side in Europe to win a Quadruple since Celtic’s Lisbon Lions in 1967. With those changes, Klopp came up trumps. Naby Keita made the most tangible impact by scoring the winning goal, the midfielder showing the touch of Salah as he danced around Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal, which was only made possible by James Milner’s tackle to win back possession with Newcastle centre-back Fabian Scharr way out of position. Newcastle wanted a foul for Milner’s challenge and upon first glance it seemed they had a case. But Milner’s sliding tackle was as clean as his polished performance in a Liverpool midfield that dominated their hosts. Lack of jeopardy in this Liverpool run is astonishing. They have trailed in only three of their 28 games in 2022, for a total of 53 minutes in 2520 mins of football (excluding injury time) – 7 mins v Shrewsbury– 29 mins v Inter (but led on aggregate)– 17 mins v City — Adam Crafton (@AdamCrafton_) April 30, 2022  Milner, Keita and Jordan Henderson all earned Liverpool the control Klopp craved, with the slender scoreline no reflection of their dominance. Klopp could have enjoyed a much more serene afternoon on the Tyneside sunshine if his forwards were as sharp as his midfielders. Sadio Mane missed gilt-edged chances in either half, while Dubravka denied both Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz. Given the stakes and precarious nature of their lead, Liverpool would not have been blamed for showcasing a degree of edginess as the clock ticked down, but on the rare occasions Newcastle broke through Klopp’s engine room, his back four blocked the path to goal.  Not until the 86th minute was Alisson troubled and even then, the Liverpool keeper dealt with Bruno Guimaraes’ shot from outside the box with the minimum of fuss. That was the closest Newcastle were allowed to Alisson – none of the four shots they attempted were within 25 yards of the Liverpool goal. To highlight their dominance, the Reds rattled 24 shots towards Dubravka, 17 from inside the box. Howe’s side can hardly be blamed for their pragmatism against Klopp’s all-conquering Reds, but they made little of what few opportunities they had to test the Liverpool defence. The passing into Allan Saint-Maximum while he played in a central role was shoddy with his team-mates seemingly forgetting his strengths and playing into his feet with his back to goal rather than down the sides of Liverpool’s centre-backs. On the few occasions the black and white units linked up, Liverpool simply stepped up and Newcastle never fathomed how best to break a high line without straying offside. Aside from a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal, Klopp’s players did everything else necessary to alleviate the risk in the manager’s approach. But as with seemingly everything else at present, Klopp got his calculations right and Liverpool move on to Villarreal for the second leg of the Champions League semi-final while turning the screw on Manchester City with the absolute minimum of fuss.

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night to move six points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham – who have a game in hand on Rangnick’s men – but it’s unlikely that that the Red Devils will now finish higher than sixth position. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Ten Hag has a huge job on his hands to get Man Utd competing for Premier League titles again and Neville has set out his timeline of expectations for the Dutchman. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” Year 1-2 | #UCL qualification Year 3 | Title challengers Year 4-5 | Premier League Winners 🏆 Gary Neville lays out the timeline that he expects Erik ten Hag to achieve things at Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/yd4KtSvhgc — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 Fellow pundit Roy Keane thinks the main thing Man Utd need to improve on is their recruitment with a lack of the right characters in the Old Trafford dressing room. “Whatever their problems, they have to look at where Man City are, where Liverpool are,” Keane added. “Man City, Liverpool and these other teams aren’t going to take it easy over the summer. They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it? The biggest frustration for me, when they’ve had these disappointments, is the reaction they’ve shown.

Liverpool fans are the luckiest in the world, bad for city if Everton go down and… And Crouch claims he is struggling to pick between the two of them for the end of seasonPFA Player of the Year award. Crouch wrote in the Daily Mail: “Now I like being on the right side of history, so I don’t think it’s particularly wise to pick a Player of the Year before we know who has won what. “I’m often left surprised by how early they are generally done. The winner has to come from the best team and the best team is often unknown until May. “All the awards should be left as late as possible and I always thought voting for the PFA Player of the Year was done far too early, often months before the season finishes. “It seemed strange timing to me, with so much of the league left to play, and I could never quite get my head around why voting was not electronic either. There should be an app for your phone that takes 10 seconds to complete. More players might vote then, too! “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season. Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks. “Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them. If the two clubs trade trophies, Salah pips the others in my view for his sheer weight of goal contributions.” ",positive

The 29-year-old has been in brilliant form again this season with 30 goals and 14 assists in all competitions for Jurgen Klopp’s men. That takes the Egypt international’s tally since he joined the club from Roma in 2017 to 155 goals in 248 appearances. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Salah will have one year remaining on his contract at the end of the current season with no sign of a breakthrough in talks between his representatives and Liverpool. The Egyptian has repeatedly claimed that he wants to stay at Liverpool and recently insisted that the slow progress in negotiations is not “about the money”. Salah told FourFourTwo last month: “I don’t know, I have one year left. I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. “So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly. I have one year left and the fans know what I want. “I’m not worried, I don’t let myself worry about something. The season didn’t finish yet, so let’s finish it in the best possible way – that’s the most important thing. Then in the last year, we’re going to see what’s going to happen.” But the Daily Telegraph claim that Liverpool are now heading into ‘forced to sell territory’ with such little time on Salah’s contract and the fact that he will be able to leave next summer on a free transfer. The report adds that Salah is ‘tempted to move on for a new challenge, possibly in Spain, maybe in Paris.’ Liverpool boss Klopp recently signed a new deal until 2026 but he dismissed the idea that his decision to remain will be a deciding factor for the likes of Salah and Sadio Mane to commit their long-term futures to the club. Klopp said: “That is more a question for the boys, what it exactly means for them but all fine, my relationship with them is great. “My point is in life there are more important things to think about, not only who is the manager but knowing who the manager and coaching staff is is important thing because when you know what you have with other clubs where you could go, you don’t know exactly. “There is no 100 per cent in this business but I think it is pretty likely I will stay for a little bit longer because other coaches are there at other clubs. “If it is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. “It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.” ",positive

No one comes close to them, they’re great. “His co-comms is fantastic too, but he’s obviously got a problem with the hierarchy at Man United, which I get, and as the majority of Man United fans do. I understand all of that. “And I don’t mind him or Roy Keane having a pop at the club in the studio before the game or at half-time. If he wants to go on Sky Sports News a week later and give his views – absolutely fine. “But when the game is on and he’s on co-comms duty, I just want him and Martin Tyler to talk about the game I’m seeing.  “Talk about the tactics, the mistakes, and if Martin Tyler wants to bamboozle me with stats, even better, I love all that when I’m watching the football. “But what I got constantly in the first-half on Thursday night from Gary Neville was just, ‘he’s an appalling player’, ‘he’s no good’, ‘this club needs to pull their socks up’, ‘that’s a disgrace’. “There was one bit – this is what Gary Neville said last night: ‘This Man United team, you almost want them to get beat. They set a really poor example around the work ethic and trying hard. This lot get paid a fortune and they’re walking on a football pitch. I’m embarrassed’. “If you want to say it afterwards, that’s absolutely fine, but I don’t see that as part of his co-comms duty, I really don’t.And the fact that he said he ‘almost wants Man United to get beat’, I’ve never wanted United to get beat. “I have never, ever thought that about my club.” ",positive

Plus, Champions League changes, war analogies, greatest ever signings and more… Get your views in totheeditor@football365.com… “History is great but it’s only to remember” I am a Man United supporter and I am desperatelyhoping that Liverpool does the quadruple. Heresy? Perhaps, but I feel the only way for this club to move forward, and kill off the nostalgia/banter club we have become, once and for all, is for Liverpool to do that unthinkable feat. We’ve already reached a playing low point, and a Liverpool quadruple would represent anorganisational nadir as well. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom… The quadruple wouldbe the mirror that this club needs. Ferguson, the Treble, and 2008–amazingtimes, but that is the past. This is from Jurgen Klopp’s first interview as Liverpool manager in 2015: “At the moment, all of the LFC family is a little bit too nervous, a little bit too pessimistic, too often in doubt. They all celebrate the game, it’s a great atmosphere in the stadium, but they don’t believe at the moment. They only want to see five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. History is great but it’s only to remember.” This is both eerily familiar, and prescient. So, come on Liverpool, you might just be doing us a favor. Keegs, Singapore(Ok, maybe just do the Treble then.) Champions League changes… On the subject of Ian King’s article, my first point would be that one legged semi finals would be turgid affairs with neither team wanting to lose much more than either wanting to win. So a football take to begin with. I knew as soon as the anger at something the majority didn’t really understand, died down, and UEFA started to do as they please, people would think “hold on, maybe that Super League thing was better” for the masses, because it absolutely was. Bin off the big 6 (from this country and the big X from others) and all the money, and suddenly you’ve got a much fairer system and sport. I’ve always said that UEFA weren’t angry purely because it was happening, they were angry because they weren’t profiting from it. They wish they’d got there first. I’d bet that the majority of UEFA officials don’t even watch football unless they’re told to go to a game, they’re too busy lobbying for more corrupt funds. They’ve never made a single decision that benefitted fans and they never will. I wouldn’t he surprised if they joined Russia in killing innocent Ukrainians if they were offered a fiver. The main anger is that I think the fight is done, and we lost. I think we’re well past the point where football can be saved, it’s now the equivalent of a futuristic dystopian city in a sci-fi movie. The sooner it explodes, the better. Just to see UEFA die a public death. Chris T. (LFC)  I was reading Ian King’s article about the new proposed plans, and have to say I actually agree with this plan for the last stages of the Champions League. I should point out I hate the new plan for the group stages, but this is good. I love the Champions League, the latter stages are played when summer is starting so it’s nice weather, and it adds some excitement and build-up to it to have it that way. I think there are more cities than the ‘handful’ claimed and the good thing with all those cities is that they are all in different countries: Lisbon, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, London, Berlin, Milan, Rome and many others could feasibly host it. Dublin, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Athens, Vienna, Turin, Manchester could host it. The part about it maybe being hooligans is extremely drab; that’s like saying there shouldn’t be a World Cup or Euros or Afcon for the same reason. Or like saying you shouldn’t go outside because you might get hit by a car. Obviously there would need to be a extra planning, but a lot of money would go into the economy of these cities too. Even if United weren’t in the latter stages (doubt they will be for a while) it would be a great football experience to go, and I’m sure you’d see just general football fans willing to go to Lisbon for a week if they could get tickets for a match or two. It could also give a third-place match, which is great because it’s usually between two great teams. Also don’t know what the problem is with the two-legs of knockout games, I think it’s brilliant that they have home and away. When it’s like that you can have comebacks like Liverpool or Roma to Barca, or Villareal beating Juve away, or finely poised games like City going to Madrid but only with a one goal advantage. I think the difference to domestic cups being one-legged is that those teams usually play each other at least twice in the league season anyway, you’re just getting the cup version. In Europe, teams can go years or decades without being drawn against each other again, playing twice is much better. And if they are one-legged, then I’m assuming they’d all have to be played at neutral venues? So that would mean players, fans and teams don’t get to experience other stadiums. So no Anfield for a European knockout night again? No Bernabeu or Dortmund except for the group? That’s also a little drab. I disagree with a lot on Uefa, but this is good. James, Galway  Greatest ever signing? Greatest ever signing? For me, It’s Dennis Bergkamp. I remember hearing about his signing and thinking, ‘we just don’t sign players like him’. I didn’t truly believe it until I saw him pull on the red and white and even then he looked like a prize stallion surrounded by mules. Sure, the other players had won the last European silverware Arsenal have managed to bring home, but Dennis, well, everything about him was different. He didn’t drink 10 pints on a Tuesday. He actually cared about nutrition before Wenger even arrived and he caressed the ball like his feet were hands. I’ve been talking nonsense about Arsenal for years – from mailing the F365 mailbox to talking to complete strangers about what Arsenal should or should not be doing. But the one player I never shouted advice to from the stands such as ‘hit it long’ or ‘Paddy’s open’ was Dennis and that’s because whatever he decided to do with the ball was always way better than I could have ever imagined. There is no better example of this talent than that goal against Newcastle. In the last season at Highbury it was almost impossible to get tickets and my last match at the old ground was a Champions League (remember that?) game against FC Thun. Dennis scored a late winner and I vowed I would never return to Highbury again as I wanted my last memory of the place to be Dennis working his magic. Adams is Mr Arsenal. Henry scored the most goals. Rocky is my favourite Arsenal player of all time but our greatest signing? It’s Dennis every time. Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London  War With regards to the match last night between Man Utd and Chelsea. Look, I love Roy Keane’s punditry, we all do, it’s must watch tele and often hilarious. But can we please stop this ‘this is war’ nonsense, it’s not just Keane who uses the war analogy, how many times over the years have we heard the sentence ‘you’d want him next to you in the trenches’ after a defender (invariably an English player) has made a ‘vigorous’ challenge on an opponent. As if the ability to tackle and / or clench your fist and simultaneously shout at someone on a football pitch automatically converts into you being a fighting machine on a battlefield. It’s not war, it’s just a game, if you lose it might be disappointing and lead to angry calls to TalkSport but no one is going, or should ever, lose their life because of a football match. Pardeep  A referee answers Minty’s question Dear Ed, Minty asks could Salah’s low number of fouls per statistic be a race issue? It’s equivalent to suggesting that there is conscious or subconscious racial bias from Premier League referees. Is this possilble, yes. Is it likely? I don’t think so. Does football have problems with racism? Yes, without a doubt. All the time any fan, coach, official or player experiences abuse, yes, we have a problem. Are there racist referees? Yes, and there are grassroots referees who struggle to deal with diversity and inclusion. Does refereeing overall in the UK face problems with racism, diversity and inclusion? Yes, and there is a lack of diversity in UK refereeing, especially noticeable in the professional leagues. If you look around the world at refereeing you will find incredible diversity and a group built, trained, managed and promoted on principles of diversity and inclusion. You just can’t referee to a high level without being fair, the whole profession is built on it. Dean, Atkinson, Mariner, these people are absolute heroes. Think about the abuse they put up with. The OP is suggesting there is racial bias in their decision-making. No. You are barking up the wrong tree. Absolutely not. And for that Minty, you are off the Xmas card list. I’ll ask Minty a question back: What is your role in promoting diversity and inclusion in refereeing – do you think stigmatising, accusing and abusing referees in the media and on the terraces will help improve diversity for future generations? Anon.(LFC grassroots ref who thinks Salah is strong, stays on his feet, is so quick and dangerous in and around the box that defenders are very, very careful not to foul him – also that LFC want to keep playing, so when there is a minor holding foul on Mo while he has his back to goal, refs just let them keep the ball and get on with it)  ",positive

The Magpies have got closer than anyone else to matching Liverpool’s remarkable points haul in 2022 and their renaissance underEddie Howe was enough to exacerbate whatever smattering of pessimism that may remain in the minds of the visiting supporters. If Newcastle’s resurgence wasn’t enough to make the Reds fans edgy, Jurgen Klopp heightened the jeopardy by making five changes to his starting XI. For the first time this season, his side featured none of Mo Salah, Fabinho or Trent Alexander-Arnold, with Thiago also given most of the afternoon to recharge his batteries amid a relentless and potentially history-making run. Jurgen Klopp reaction: ‘I loved it, we controlled the game in so many ways’ Klopp, though, can do no wrong at present. Liverpool simultaneously achieved almost complete control at St James’ Park while four of their most important players rested for the most part before seven more matches which could see the Reds become the first side in Europe to win a Quadruple since Celtic’s Lisbon Lions in 1967. With those changes, Klopp came up trumps. Naby Keita made the most tangible impact by scoring the winning goal, the midfielder showing the touch of Salah as he danced around Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal, which was only made possible by James Milner’s tackle to win back possession with Newcastle centre-back Fabian Scharr way out of position. Newcastle wanted a foul for Milner’s challenge and upon first glance it seemed they had a case. But Milner’s sliding tackle was as clean as his polished performance in a Liverpool midfield that dominated their hosts. Lack of jeopardy in this Liverpool run is astonishing. They have trailed in only three of their 28 games in 2022, for a total of 53 minutes in 2520 mins of football (excluding injury time) – 7 mins v Shrewsbury– 29 mins v Inter (but led on aggregate)– 17 mins v City — Adam Crafton (@AdamCrafton_) April 30, 2022  Milner, Keita and Jordan Henderson all earned Liverpool the control Klopp craved, with the slender scoreline no reflection of their dominance. Klopp could have enjoyed a much more serene afternoon on the Tyneside sunshine if his forwards were as sharp as his midfielders. Sadio Mane missed gilt-edged chances in either half, while Dubravka denied both Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz. Given the stakes and precarious nature of their lead, Liverpool would not have been blamed for showcasing a degree of edginess as the clock ticked down, but on the rare occasions Newcastle broke through Klopp’s engine room, his back four blocked the path to goal.  Not until the 86th minute was Alisson troubled and even then, the Liverpool keeper dealt with Bruno Guimaraes’ shot from outside the box with the minimum of fuss. That was the closest Newcastle were allowed to Alisson – none of the four shots they attempted were within 25 yards of the Liverpool goal. To highlight their dominance, the Reds rattled 24 shots towards Dubravka, 17 from inside the box. Howe’s side can hardly be blamed for their pragmatism against Klopp’s all-conquering Reds, but they made little of what few opportunities they had to test the Liverpool defence. The passing into Allan Saint-Maximum while he played in a central role was shoddy with his team-mates seemingly forgetting his strengths and playing into his feet with his back to goal rather than down the sides of Liverpool’s centre-backs. On the few occasions the black and white units linked up, Liverpool simply stepped up and Newcastle never fathomed how best to break a high line without straying offside. Aside from a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal, Klopp’s players did everything else necessary to alleviate the risk in the manager’s approach. But as with seemingly everything else at present, Klopp got his calculations right and Liverpool move on to Villarreal for the second leg of the Champions League semi-final while turning the screw on Manchester City with the absolute minimum of fuss.

196,https://www.football365.com/news/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-contract-extension-2026,Jurgen Klopp signs Liverpool contract extension to keep him at Anfield until 2026,"Jurgen Klopp has signed a Liverpool contract extension that will keep him at Anfield until 2026. Klopp and close members of his staff are already tied down until 2024, and The Athleticreported on Thursday afternoon that they have agreed to prolong their stay for a further two years. MAILBOX: Liverpool are still great even if they win only Carabao Cup this season It was thought last season, as Liverpool fell off the pace hugely as they attempted to retain their Premier League crown, that Klopp would take a sabbatical after the 2023-34 season. But the 54-year-old has been ‘re-energised’ this term as his side chases an unprecedented quadruple. Mike Gordon, president of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the Liverpool owners, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday and watched Klopp’s side beat Villarreal 2-0 in their Champions League semi-final first leg. But Gordan had an ulterior motive for the visit and sat down with Klopp to discuss the terms of an extension. FSG have always been keen to tie Klopp down and waited to make their move until the German boss ‘made noises’ confirming his desire to stay at the club. 👀 pic.twitter.com/PkDRRnsSIg — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 28, 2022 This was two-year extension wasconfirmed by the club on Thursday evening. Speaking on this news, Klopp said: “There are so many words I could use to describe how I am feeling about this news… delighted, humbled, blessed, privileged and excited would be a start. “There is just so much to love about this place. I knew that before I came here, I got to know it even better after I arrived and now I know it more than ever before. “Like any healthy relationship, it always has to be a two-way street; you have to be right for each other. The feeling we were absolutely right for each other is what brought me here in the first place and it’s why I’ve extended previously. “This one is different because of the length of time we have been together. I had to ask myself the question: Is it right for Liverpool that I stay longer? “Along with my two assistant managers, Pep Lijnders and Pete Krawietz, we came to the conclusion it was a ‘Yes!’” Klopp won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2019 before winning the Premier League in 2020. He’s already guided them Carabo Cup glory this term, they sit one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League, will play Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and are hot favourites to progress to the Champions League final for the third time in five seasons.

197,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-liverpool-press-villarreal-champions-league-quadruple-klopp,Liverpool press to depress opponents as Klopp keeps complacency completely at bay,"Liverpool treated Villarreal with the utmost respect and dispatched them with consummate brilliance. Jurgen Klopp has them laser-focused. All of the pre-match talk was courteous. Liverpool were not going to underestimate Villarreal. The Spaniards had just beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich and the Germans were hardly on the charm offensive before or after being dumped out. Dani Parejo reminded them that if you spit in the wind, it can fly back in your face. Don’t depth charge this yellow submarine with insults. Emery acknowledged that his semi-final opponents were far better at etiquette than Bayern: “What we have heard from Liverpool, the things they have said have been very intelligent, the respect they have shown – they know us, they know that it will be hard, the potential we have. They’re favourites but with respect.” When he arrived in L4, Emery went into magnetic detail about how Liverpool are an improvement and an upgrade on the version he played before as Arsenal boss – and they were “magnificent” even back then. He was only telling the truth but there was absolutely no way his opponents were falling for that supersize dessert of praise. These Reds work harder than hard. It’s the only way in Klopp’s kingdom, which has now extended its reign by popular demand. Liverpool set traps for other teams but they rarely fall into a pothole of their own making. They are a crack professional unit with all pistons in sync. There’s no complacency and no careless talk, no prodding of the hornet’s nest to give other teams more reasons to beat them. There’s lots of counter-press though. Lots. “They are munching…they are eating people,” exclaimed Rio Ferdinand. Peter Crouch said “they are making chances off the counterpress”. Des Kelly added: “The press was relentless all night.” It was depressing for Villarreal. Sucked the life out of them. Giovani Lo Celso should have stayed on the floor a bit longer to recover from that ball in the face. Etienne Capoue knew what was coming, clearly remembering the battering Klopp’s 2018 version handed out at Anfield to Watford: “They have this ability to transcend themselves, to cause you nothing but problems, all the time, in any part of the field. They never stop, they rush you all the time, they only want to score goals, and even when they score, they carry on. They want to knock you out. They just want to kill everyone and that’s it.” “Étienne, you said [before tha game] that it was like hell coming to Anfield. What was it like tonight?” Étienne Capoue: “Did I lie?” pic.twitter.com/J20uXCZFC5 — Issam (@betterthanfigo) April 28, 2022  Gosh. It’s a raw explanation but it was so pure. These Reds are marching through April with all that they have, as Klopp might say. Good things come to an end but there’s nothing to suggest that the peak of the mountain is ever in view with this level of bloody-mindedness. The hunger and (legal) harassment on the field keeps rolling in waves. There’s a visceral power and beauty about the sheer brutality to commit fully to everything. Here’s the thing: Liverpool used to do the basketball games back and forth. In contrast to Manchester City’s manic 4-3 win over Real, the Reds were a calm and composed ruthless machine. It was City that did the histrionics and pinball with Pep Guardiola bouncing on the touchline like an exploding firework. In the last few weeks, the Reds have stepped down hard on the accelerator. Villarreal’s yellow flags might as well have been a signal to bring the safety car out to clear the pitch from projectile travel sickness. It was Lionel Messi who warned Barcelona’s exhausted players after a 3-0 first-leg win over the Reds three years ago that he couldn’t play at that pace again. He was right.  Liverpool suffocated their prey on that famous night at Anfield three years ago, just as they had at Wembley a few weeks ago against City. The reset has already happened for Newcastle and next Tuesday. “Nothing has happened yet,” Klopp said. “It’s 2-0 at half-time and we have to be completely on alert and 100% in the right mood. We have to play the second half like the first half, as though there is nothing to defend.” You believe him when he says it. There is a desperation for other teams to try and resist the force and play on their terms. Even the thoughtful Emery was reduced to making knee-jerk promises he probably can’t keep, suggesting that events will be fine-tuned by the Spanish accordion next week. Good luck with that. Klopp didn’t even do the fist pumps on Wednesday. There is work to be done. Liverpool are in the mood to chase the prizes down anytime, anyplace, anywhere. ",positive
198,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-16-conclusions-manchester-city-liverpool-de-bruyne-jesus-jota-mane,16 Conclusions: Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool,"Man City made Liverpool look so vulnerable, yet that inability to properly put them down could hand the advantage back. It remains poised. 1) There are many ways to skin a cat. It just so happens that the preferred method deployed by managers in Premier League matches bestowed the moniker of ‘title decider’ was slow, meticulous and often painfully conservative. So many of the most fondly remembered such games in the modern history of England’s top flight – Manchester City against Manchester United in April 2012, Manchester United versus Arsenal in March 1998 and Liverpool at home to Chelsea in April 2014, to name a few examples – were characterised by at least one but often both teams striving not to lose rather than trying to win. It often came at the expense of genuine viewing entertainment but that was never the risk-averse priority with trophies on the line. The shift from that to the current adventurous era has been stark. Liverpool are the common denominator: 2-2 draws against Manchester City at Anfield and the Etihad, to match the same result at Chelsea in early January when the Blues were second, have exposed their weaknesses yet accentuated their strengths. Two teams confident enough in their own ability to win, so assured of their approach that they refuse to intrinsically change it. Perhaps there is a lack of needle between Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola that prevents this from being categorised as an authentic feud, but it is historical all the same – and something that will only be fully appreciated once both have left their dynasties in far better condition than when they found them. Do not take for granted how fulfilling, refreshing and ultimately rewarding it is to have these games so consistently live up to the billing. It used to be considerably different and the coaching perpetrators of those former crimes against footballing humanity would have been squirming at the fearlessness. The two teams have high defensive lines, giving chances for counterattacks — Rafa Benitez Web (@rafabenitezweb) April 10, 2022   2) After all the build-up, the geography-based conspiratorial fury over officials, the bait-drenched and contextually ignorant combined XIs, the subjective deconstruction of pure rivalry and whether it can exist without projectile pizza, sliding tackles that would reduce VAR to a quivering wreck and coerced piggyback attempts, the tiresome void of an undercard finally gave way to the main event. The deferential coaches had exchanged niceties once more and the players were poised to deliver on days and weeks of rising suspense. Then Jordan Henderson played the kick-off straight back to Joel Matip, who lumped it to the left flank and out of touch. That was the first of three consecutive Manchester City throw-ins, each gaining more territory to the point they found themselves adjacent to the Liverpool box within the opening minute. It came to nothing but it was a joy to see this generation-defining fixture between two elite sides at the absolute peak of their powers instantly reduced to bare Sunday League basics.  3) One common thread ran through Liverpool’s last three Premier League victories over Manchester City. In a 1-0 win at Anfield in December 2016, it took them eight minutes. That became nine for their 4-1 home humbling of Guardiola’s side in January 2018. Then in November 2019, the Reds set a new personal best when Fabinho scored after six minutes. It is far easier said than done but the early burst out of the blocks was a specific tactic upon which they had found success against this particular team, stopping them from settling into a rhythm while simultaneously landing a sizeable mental blow. But it was notable how rarely Manchester City had managed to turn the tables. Guardiola’s side have faced Klopp’s 14 times in the Premier and Champions League, but only once did their opening goal come before the 20th minute – and that was in an eventual 2-1 European quarter-final defeat. Even when beating them 5-0 and 4-0 in recent years, Manchester City scored their first goals in the 24th and 25th minutes respectively. It was a surprise, therefore, to see how rapidly they began. Liverpool had no chance to establish themselves and find their footing. They looked uncomfortable, panicked, rushed. Alisson saved excellently from a low Gabriel Jesus cross but Liverpool failed to clear their lines. Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mane had opportunities to relieve the pressure but neither proved capable and the Reds, so often the ones riding the crests of waves, were submerged. De Bruyne’s effort from range was deflected past Alisson by the leg of Joel Matip, yet two teammates can claim an understated combined assist. Kyle Walker’s determination and footwork was crucial in winning first possession and then a free-kick; Bernardo Silva overrode the system to take it quickly, from a promising position but well before Liverpool could return to their shape. De Bruyne will take the credit but both actions that preceded his were vital and without either, Liverpool might have withstood the initial barrage.  4) The defending from Liverpool was amateurish, exacerbated by Manchester City’s urgency and directness. Fabinho conceded the free-kick by dangling a lazy leg at Walker, then jogged back and allowed De Bruyne to ghost past him into a fine shooting position on the edge of the area. Jordan Henderson, meanwhile, was too busy remonstrating with the referee to block a quick pass into the unmarked Belgian. The Liverpool captain was completely switched off and considering the standard of Sadio Mane’s first-half performance, it felt fitting that it was actually his awful touch from Henderson’s pass as the foul was called that gave Silva the ball. The Portuguese placed a hand on it to reset the move, played it to De Bruyne under no pressure and Manchester City led six seconds later. Liverpool’s rank incompetence and uncharacteristic lack of street smarts undid them as much as anything else in that moment.   5) But their character is ludicrous – Liverpool are the most durable, hard-wearing team in Europe – and after resisting a potential penalty claim when Jesus provided the filling to a Van Dijk and Alisson sandwich, the visitors jerked from their slumber to strike. In a variation of the coveted full-back to full-back goal, Andy Robertson salvaged a loose ball in space and clipped it to the far post for Trent Alexander-Arnold. His presence of mind not to try and lash it across goal but to cut it back first time to the roaming Diogo Jota was sumptuous and Liverpool had an equaliser from their first meaningful foray beyond the halfway line. And there can be no doubt that Alexander-Arnold meant that pass. As Robertson’s cross came in, it was so weird to see Jota, coming back from an offside position after an earlier delivery, stand rooted to the spot with no defender taking notice. The forward watched the ball curl from left to right, only reacting when he noticed the attack unfold with Alexander-Arnold’s advancing run in his peripheral vision. The Liverpool right-back did not have a straightforward afternoon but it is unusual for his forward-thinking in one area not to outweigh his defensive fragility in the other and this game was no different.  6) Some of those passes, particularly in the first half, really were remarkable. An incisive centre from Robertson almost concurrently played in one or both of Mane and Mo Salah; Thiago’s ludicrous, press-mocking switch to Alexander-Arnold was the basis of the equaliser; Silva threaded one sublime through ball into the path of Walker; John Stones homed in on a Joao Cancelo run to create a De Bruyne chance. The combinations varied in personnel each time but the quality was never compromised, whether it was a centre-half finding a right-back or a left-back seeking a wide forward. There was space to be exploited behind both defences but it required precision in the execution of the pass, as well as awareness and movement in the timing of the run. In the innocent brilliance of that period before half-time, it was striking to see how many of those high-margin moves came off for both teams, before those sensible fellas in the dugout deemed that our fun was had and the pitch had to be shrunk somewhat.  7) It is possible to sympathise with Joe Hart – “It was a two-hour conversation that kind of ended with him saying ‘I can’t see this working’. I said ‘I don’t agree with you’. He said ‘I’ll be the first person to be proved wrong but what I see in you isn’t what I want from my goalkeeper’. I was like ‘It’s only fair I be given the opportunity’. He said ‘of course you’ll be given the opportunity, but…’. As soon as there are any ‘buts’ at the end you know there’s a decision. I wanted the opportunity to be coached by one of the best at it. Of course I didn’t know how to do it, why would I know how to do something that I’d never been asked to do or taught to do?I suppose he was right, I couldn’t do it, he couldn’t just drop me into a team to play like he wanted to at that moment in time” – while both understanding Guardiola’s point of view and laughing uproariously at the idea of the current Celtic starter moonwalking across a tightrope with his eyes closed quite like Ederson did in the 23rd minute. Condemning Liverpool to a spot of shadow-chasing, Manchester City passed the ball around the back and waited for the next pocket to appear. Walker rolled it towards his goalkeeper, justifiably without a thought for what might transpire next. But as Jota closed the lane to Silva, Ederson took a touch that only slightly delayed the ball’s path towards goal. Whether what unfolded then was a dummy or a course correction after deducing that his pass would be risky given he was stretching, the Brazilian calmly slid it over to Aymeric Laporte and nonchalantly strolled away from the scene of his self-inflicted goal-line clearance. Keepers are a different breed; Ederson is a whole new organism. And he will be the toughest component of this team to replace. Look how calm he is. Ederson isn’t normal. pic.twitter.com/xJGNWaHt2c — . (@Nigerianscamsss) April 10, 2022   8) Liverpool had almost forced a vital mistake but their pressing was actually quite disjointed early on. The duress came entirely from Manchester City, whose work off the ball was exemplary. Alexander-Arnold and Mane were caught more than once on the ball in their own defensive third. Fabinho was flat. Virgil van Dijk was not explicitly snared by any of the pressing traps but so many of his passes put teammates in jeopardy. Liverpool were making some peculiar, often downright terrible decisions in possession. The worst of those, however, curtailed an ostensible counter-attack. De Bruyne drew a foul and a booking from Robertson after yet another diagonal was launched into the left-back’s area, but the subsequent free-kick committed the cardinal sin of failing to clear the first man. Salah played a quick pass into Alexander-Arnold as the two raided towards and beyond the halfway line. But as the Egyptian continued a run that would surely take him beyond the defence and through on goal, Alexander-Arnold shot from the centre circle. It didn’t help that he slipped at the same time, giving Ederson a save so simple that it was a surprise not to see a Rene Higuita tribute. Yet it was precisely the sort of choice Liverpool could hardly afford to make and are usually too proficient to even consider. That effort might have best summed up how uncomfortable Manchester City made them.  9) A few minutes later, Liverpool were given the harshest possible lesson in turning such slivers of opportunities against this team into chances. Manchester City’s first and second goals bore no immediate similarities in either conception or implementation, but they were both built within one solid framework: a sustained series of attacks that rely on incredible rest defence to engender a sense of team-wide panic and an increasing number of ordinarily avoidable but completely inevitable mistakes until a goal is scored. Again, it is far easier said than done but one hell of a cycle to lock an opponent in, turning even the very best sides into haphazard fodder. There was a poor kick from Alisson. Then a low De Bruyne cross with no-one in the vicinity that Matip felt obliged to tap behind for a corner. That was cleared only as far as Cancelo, who whipped a delivery back in to Jesus at the far post for a fine finish. Alexander-Arnold had played the Brazilian onside then and Cancelo for the concession of another corner a minute earlier as those errors were compounded to an inescapable crescendo. Liverpool have had these moments of vulnerability strangely often recently, but never to this extent and often unpunished. It takes a special team to do it to them twice in one half.  10) Jesus scoring from a cross around Easter was good fun. It was pretty much his archetypal display: justifying his surprise inclusion with impeccable work-rate and a goal, yet also proving that faith to be unjust with some foolish decisions. The Brazilian’s first start since New Year’s Day should have been a cause for more celebration but two moments in the second half underpinned his display with frustration. He should have released the ball far sooner when De Bruyne was running through around the hour mark, but delayed the pass and was fouled by Thiago – who was weirdly not booked. A little later, De Bruyne returned a favour he never received by slipping Jesus in on the right but instead of completing the one-two and pulling it back for his teammate on the penalty spot, the Brazilian fired into the side-netting. In between, Jesus wriggled into a shooting position after skipping past two players, but even then he should have squared it to one of the players waiting in more favourable areas. There are times when he feels like the perfect Guardiola forward – and he absolutely still has a place in this squad – but there is no squinting required to see why he is not fully trusted. Unfortunately we didn't get this important win, but great game everyone. Let's keep fighting! 🙏🏽💪🏽🤙🏾#gratidão#alômãe#doperi pic.twitter.com/RA4BZwYE71 — Gabriel Jesus (@gabrieljesus9) April 10, 2022   11) The momentum was with Manchester City by half-time. They had opened the scoring in 22 previous Premier League games this season and won each time. Liverpool had not trailed at the break for exactly a year, so were in unfamiliar territory at a ground they had not won in in a domestic match since November 2015. The hosts had been far better than the visitors, who looked overwhelmed and unlikely to rebound again. Yet one thing did count against Manchester City. Six of the 19 goals they had conceded in the Premier League this campaign came between the 46th and 60th minutes. If games were broken down into 15-minute segments then that is the only one Guardiola’s side did not have an eight-goal advantage in. That was a possible chink in this otherwise imperious armour. Kloppprobablydidn’t lead on that in his half-time team talk but Liverpool scoring 47 seconds after the restart was no coincidence. The Reds transposed those aforementioned quick starts against Manchester City to spring a surprise and draw level when the prior 46 minutes barely warranted it. They will hope to have uncovered a possible weak spot for future opponents to explore.  12) Salah and Mane had been anonymous and atrocious to that point; they were onymous and ominous for the goal. The former collected an Alexander-Arnold pass, turned and released the latter within three touches as Walker desperately tried to recover lost ground. The assist and finish were both perfect, particularly considering the dreadful displays the perpetrators of both had turned out before then. Klopp was immediately rewarded for his biggest decision of the game: choosing to make no decisions. He would have been excused for changing the players, the system or both after the first half yet the German persisted with a plan he would have devised for this game long ago and it paid off. Discussing substitutions is almost exclusively based on outcome bias but in this instance, Klopp making no changes until the 70th minute was a masterstroke that highlighted his faith in these players and their personalities.  13) The forward play from both teams was obviously the most eye-catching aspect of this game but some of the defending was spectacular. Van Dijk ushering Raheem Sterling away from danger like a lost child when De Bruyne released the Manchester City winger into acres of space. Laporte sliding in to prevent Jota from shooting or passing when a goal looked certain late in the first half. Matip standing firm to tackle Jack Grealish and keep another swarm at bay, before potentially getting a touch on that late Riyad Mahrez chip. A 2-2 draw never usually reflects well on the backline of either team but in this instance, keeping it down to four goals was testament to both defences.   14) Manchester City‘s finest achievement in this game might be in their response to Liverpool’s second equaliser. It came at the worst possible time yet the hosts only conceded three more shots in the rest of the game, preventing that flow and thrust that so often follows a goal for the Reds. Ederson saved from Jota soon after Mane’s goal, Salah curled an effort just wide after a deflection off Laporte – and weirdly no corner – and Henderson tried to channel 2015 with an xG-ridiculing shot from outside the area. That, with 13 minutes and injury time remaining, was Liverpool’s last attempt, and absolutely not for the want of trying considering Luis Diaz, Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino were all introduced. The hosts had their moments: Sterling’s offside goal, Jesus having his effort blocked by Van Dijk near the line and Mahrez hitting the post from a free-kick. But Guardiola must be pleased with just how well his side contained the best attack in the country.  15) The five substitutes that came on were signed for a combined £278.75m. That is daft.  16) Both teams will be content with the result. Manchester City remain in control with that point advantage, as well as a run-in that looks kinder. Liverpool maintain their most familiar role: chasers and underdogs. The hosts might feel they landed a psychological hit by making their rivals look so mortal; the visitors may believe that an inability to land that proper decisive blow gives them the advantage. The Treble and the Quadruple persist into mid-April at the latest, with seven Premier League games that offer varying degrees of treacherousness and jeopardy and Champions League hopes still in the offing. As phenomenal as this match was, it lacked one thing which their next meeting guarantees: a clear winner and a definitive loser. Wembley will be fun.  ",positive
199,https://www.football365.com/news/salah-insists-its-not-all-about-money-in-liverpool-contract-negotiations,Salah insists ‘it’s not all about money’ in Liverpool contract negotiations,"Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah has insisted it is not all about the money in his contract discussions with the club. The Egyptian star is out-of-contract at the ned of next season and, so far, is yet to agree new terms with the club. Reports suggest that Liverpool are not willing to break their wage structure to keep Salah. Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man Utd, Merseyside derby, Eriksen Salah is widely recognised as one of the best players in world football at present and has been in fine form this season, despite a recent drop-off. The winger leads the Premier League goalscoring charts, notching 22 time so far this season, five more than next best Heung-Min Son who has 17. He also co-leads the assists leaderboard, alongside teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold and his performances have been key to helping Liverpool challenge on all fronts. Having wrapped up the Carabao Cup in February, Jurgen Klopp’s side are still in with a chance for a unprecedent quadruple as they fight for the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. A 3️⃣0️⃣th goal of the season for @MoSalah ❤ 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹. pic.twitter.com/CfsriVGtFk — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 19, 2022 However, one of the main talking points around Liverpool remains Salah’s contract situation but the 29-year-old has insisted it’s not all about money. Speaking to FourFourTwo, Liverpool’s talisman said: “I don’t know, I have one year left. I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. “So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly. I have one year left and the fans know what I want. “I’m not worried, I don’t let myself worry about something. The season didn’t finish yet, so let’s finish it in the best possible way – that’s the most important thing. Then in the last year, we’re going to see what’s going to happen.” Salah did admit the club, which has helped win the Premier League and Champions League in the past me, means a great deal to him. “Yeah. This club means a lot to me – I’ve enjoyed my football here more than anywhere, I gave the club everything and everybody saw that. I’ve had a lot of unbelievable moments here, winning trophies, individual goals, individual trophies. It’s like a family here.” The forward spoke further on his connection to the club, revealing that when he does leave the club, whenever that may be, it will be a really sad occasion for him. “Of course. To play in that atmosphere and to see the fans always behind me… I have banners in the stadium, two or three, and they’re always singing my song. It’s going to be a really sad moment.”  ",positive

An own goal from Pervis Estupinan and Mane’s 20th of the season did the damage at Anfield. This was a comfortable night for Liverpool as they were much the better side against Villarreal. Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Under Unai Emery the visitors had lost just one of 12 away games in Europe, in stoppage time at Old Trafford last September, and had beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach their first Champions League semi-final since 2006. Villarreal were perceived as presenting an easy option – by virtue of them not being Manchester City or Real Madrid – and Liverpool’s dominance from the off suggested that would play out with LaLiga’s seventh-placed team failing to register a shot on target in the game. A big first-leg performance from the Reds 💪#UCL | #LIVVIL pic.twitter.com/jLEMjlQxDr — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2022 Even a goalless opening 45 minutes which set a new competition record for first-half shots without scoring in a semi-final was more down to the hosts’ inability to find the net than their opponent’s powers of resistance. The dozen attempts they made surpassed any other team since the data was first collected in 2003-4, with the closest they came being Thiago Alcantara’s 25-yard effort off the post. Mane, whose combination with Mohamed Salah looked back to its best, had three efforts, Salah himself had a couple while Luis Diaz cut in from the left to blast a right-footed effort at Geronimo Rulli who unconvincingly claimed at the second attempt. The movement of Liverpool was incessant and multi-faceted with Diaz tracking up and down the left wing but also dropping inside, Jordan Henderson often playing on the shoulder of the last line of defence and Trent Alexander-Arnold popping up in the number 10 position to win a free-kick 25 yards out, which he hit into the wall. One move almost produced one of the goals of the season when the excellent Thiago sprayed yet another 50-yard left-to-right diagonal for Alexander-Arnold to hit first-time into the path of Salah whose own volley went over. And while they reached the interval without scoring – Villarreal’s one chance seeing Tottenham loanee Giovani Lo Celso lob wide from Dani Parejo’s long-range free-kick – there was never the sense that the breakthrough would not come. Five minutes after the interval Fabinho forced the ball home only to be flagged offside, and Diaz headed weakly at Rulli before a stroke of good fortune brought the 53rd-minute opener. In a flowing move which started close to the halfway line on the left by Andy Robertson and involved Thiago and Mane ended with Salah playing in Henderson wide on the right. The England international looked to stand a cross up to the far post only for the ball to take a deflection off Estupinan and float over the goalkeeper and inside the far post. It was the piece of luck they needed as one quickly became two when Alexander-Arnold combined with Salah on the edge of the penalty area and he slid a perfectly-weighted pass for Mane to poke past Rulli. At that point it seemed a question of how big a lead Liverpool wanted to take to Spain next week as Robertson volleyed home Alexander-Arnold’s cross only for it to be ruled out for offside. However, a raft of substitutions followed as Klopp rotated his players with a Saturday lunchtime kick-off at Newcastle to think about as his side’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple continues with a return to Premier League action.

201,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-still-great-even-win-only-carabao-cup-this-season-mailbox,Liverpool are still a great team even if they win only Carabao Cup this season,"Liverpool and Manchester City are the best ever; there’s no shame in coming second and winning only one trophy. Send your mails to theeditor@football365.com If Liverpool are second-tallest man, they’re still tall For the record, I do not think Liverpool will do the quadruple. I think Man City will win both the Premier League and Champions’ League. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea lift the FA Cup. However, even if they do, would the loss of the league by a point or two, and two cup finals mean this Liverpool team is not great. I often hear how in order to be considered one of the greats, this Liverpool team need to win more. I find this reductive. It’s analogous to saying the second tallest man alive today should not be considered tall, as he is not the tallest. Turns out he’s taller than all other men that lived before, he just happens to have lived at the same time as the very tallest. Make no mistake, if it wasn’t for Pep and City, Liverpool would be winning a hell of a lot more. I hear how Arsenal’s Invincibles team cannot be matched. However, can any neutral actually, honestly tell me that a record of 26 wins and 12 draws, amassing 90 points is a more impressive Premier League season than 30 wins, 7 draws and 1 loss, amassing 97 points? Considering that one loss came away at Manchester City and was decided by that famous 11mm? Simultaneously, the Invincible record was only possible because of Pires cheating against Portsmouth. If you can, you’re not being honest with yourself. Whilst we would all rather have a shiny (golden) Premier League trophy in the cabinet than a second-place medal around our necks, the point remains that the team and the squad achieved a more impressive league run, they were just up against a behemoth. So in short, the ridiculous claims that this Liverpool squad can only be considered great if they win more are simply that. This squad is fantastic and may well win more, but they are up against the very best Premier League team/squad of all time, were City to win a double this year, it makes Liverpool no less great. We are witnessing the two best English clubs of all time right now.Dom Littleford  LIVERPOOL WIN ‘EASY’ SEMI! 📭 F365 ‘Mailbox Live’ – 28th Apr 2022 https://t.co/Q60ZLAmk2n — Football365 (@F365) April 28, 2022   Draws are easy when you’re this good Everybody accusing Liverpool of having an easy draw in the Champions League this season seems to be missing the obvious. People usually consider a draw easy if one side is significantly better than the other. For the past four years Liverpool have been better than just about every other club in world football. Therefore every draw they get will look easy. As for people accusing Man City of always getting the easiest draws in domestic cups could that be because every team who we’d consider slightly more difficult seem to throw the cups? It’s only this season that Man Utd, Tottenham and Arsenal were eliminated by lower league opposition, while whenever Man City face these teams they make such short work of them we forget they ever played. Can you really accuse them of easy draws when all the sides who could make things a little more difficult keep getting eliminated? On a final point are Liverpool now favourites rather than outsiders for the quadruple? They’ve won just about every game they’ve played this year and are showing no signs of slowing down; the only exceptions to their winning run being dead rubber 2nd legs and a draw against City, who they blew away a couple of weeks later. There’s an inevitability about every game they play right now, while City still feel vulnerable in one off games and Chelsea seem to be running on fumes. Real Madrid feel like the only potential obstacle given Benzema’s Herculean form but they’ve been far from convincing in the knockout stages this season. I assume Liverpool supporters might feel differently, from the outside though they appear utterly unstoppable.Kevin (fearing for Newcastle at the weekend), Nottingham  Beginning of the end for Pep? As Barcelona limped to a defeat against mid table Rayo Vallecano a 15 point gap opened up between them and table topping Real Madrid. A win at home to Espanyol will see them wrestle back the La Liga title from their neighbours Atletico. So when City come to town next week, they’ll be facing the newly crowned champions, at their home ground. With Benzema on fire and the likely return of Casemiro in midfield I think it’s not unlikely that Madrid will make the final. Whether City make the final or not, they will again have to go all guns blazing in Madrid for the second time the season, perhaps even go into extra time if Madrid nick an early goal and the scores are level at the end of regular time. If City don’t make the final and Liverpool do, I think it might cause a ripple effect where they drop points in the league as well. Should this happen and Liverpool go top, hang on to 2-0 lead at Villareal and play the final in Paris at the end of may. By then they could also have beaten Chelsea in the FA Cup to claim at least two trophies of a possible four. How does Guardiola recover his team from there? I think that if City don’t win the CL but do win the PL it might be the end of the line for Pep. I also think if Klopp wins four trophies he should call it quits, epic legacy right there.Stijn (Ten Hag, not Ten HAAG) Ajax, Amsterdam  On those Salah race claims Szymon Marciniak was born in 1981 in Poland. He wore two hats, one as an amateur footballer, and one as a referee. In 2006 he became a professional referee, and his career has been on an upward trajectory ever since, due in no small part to his commitment and diligence to his job. The pinnacle of his career so far was perhaps officiating the European Super Cup final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in 2018, but he also took charge for three games in Euro 2016 and games at the 2018 World Cup. He is on UEFA’s panel of referees and regularly takes charge of Champion’s League games. In referee terms, he is elite. Tommy Tuchel was upset at him being jovial with Ancelotti after Chelsea were knocked out of the Champion’s League this season, but apart from that. I can’t find much controversy about his refereeing performances, and I gave it a damn good Googling. He seems like a decent enough man, trying to walk his own path, and making a pretty good job of it. Why am I telling you all this, you ask? Well, according to mailbox stalwart Minty, Marciniak has a terrible secret. Minty says he’s a racist. See, last night, after Liverpool utterly dominated the Champions League semi-final, and won at a canter, Marciniak apparently singled out Mo Salah, and didn’t rule in his favour once. And the reason for this is, apparently, because Salah is not Caucasian. And if indeed this is the reason that Salah didn’t get decisions, then the only reasonable conclusion to draw is that the man who makes those decisions has a prejudicial view of non-white people. I mean, Minty didn’t actually drop the r-bomb when referring to Marciniak, but he strongly implied it. I’ve said it before : I despise racism. I despise any form of inequality or inequity. I’m a proper old school leftie, and this has led me to challenging people, you know, in actual real life, when they display bigotry. It makes for an unpleasant conversation, because bigots aren’t usually very keen on identifying as bigots, despite their bigotry. They go through some form of mental gymnastics that justifies their bigotry, but that is invariably because they aren’t terribly bright and lack self-awareness. My position here is crystal clear. I. Despise. Racism. But if you are going to accuse someone of being racist, then you need to have considerably more ammunition than a white guy didn’t give a non-white guy a penalty. Slurring someone who has worked hard to reach a level of respect and standing in their chosen career based on lazy insinuation without a shred of evidence isn’t just appalling, it is counter-productive in the fight against racism. This is the kind of thing that white supremacist arseholes love, because it makes a victim out of the white guy. And they love making a victim out of the white guy. Why the f*** you couldn’t just enjoy the fact that Liverpool breezed past their opponents and are strong favourites to get in yet another Champions League final like it was just another day at the office is beyond me. All that we as Liverpool fans have to celebrate and appreciate right now Minty, and your big take away is to try and trash the career of a stranger because he didn’t give a debatable penalty for a player that we all now has gone down way too easily in the past?Mat (You’ll deny it, but it’s there for all to see)  …Felt compelled to reply to Minty and his view that Mo Salah does not get free kicks or penalties as frequently as Anthony Gordon because the colour of his skin. Now a couple of things – Firstly is he suggesting that ALL refs are racist as Liverpool games aren’t being reffed by the same guy every week and secondly if you look at the most fouled players in the Premier League this season (who get the most free kicks / penalties etc) it is a list that contains names right at the top such as Zaha, Ayew, Sarr and Ivan Toney. My son (similar skin tone to Salah) plays football every weekend, he gets kicked all over the park some weeks – sometimes he gets the free kicks and sometimes he doesn’t, it doesn’t mean that the ref is racist it probably means that he’s a bit shit. Minty will probably conclude now that its the players committing the fouls that are racist or anything else that he thinks will provoke a reaction.Tee LUFC  …I know that Minty LFC likes to air his thoughts on all things Liverpool but the man has had an absolute mare with his mail this morning. To suggest that Salah is not given pens because his isn’t white is ridiculous. To believe this to be the case we have to believe that all officials in the EPL, as well as Europe (given it’s in this context that he’s mentioned it), are all racist and favour white players. Dear me. And then to use Gordon as an example of a favoured white player is odd given he wasn’t given a pen at the weekend, that many people thought was, after he was “fouled” by (checks notes) a non-white player. Minty, feel free to drivel on about Liverpool every single day but stop sending in this nonsense please. It does not help legitimate discussions about racism at all.J  …Salah doesn’t get enough free kicks because of racism? 4 players most fouled in the Premier League Wilfrid Zaha, Ivan Toney, Ismaila Sarr and Jordan Ayew, so shut your row up. I’d like to start an immediate campaign to ensure poor old white players get their fair share of free kicks too as there’s such an obvious imbalance!Mark (The last sentence was tongue in cheek so don’t write in saying it’s racist, it’s not. (Thanks Alan))  …Right, so racism is preventing Salah from getting free kicks? So, how does that explain Sarr, Toney, Zaha and Ayew being 4 of the most fouled players in the league? D’uh. Engage brain first, pal.Mat, Leeds  …Are referees racist? Maybe, probably some are. It’s ever present in our society and chances are there are some are. Does Salah not get as many fouls as other players simply because he is not white? Funnily enough Mane, also not white, has been in the top 10 most fouled 2 years running in the premier league, in 19/20 the top 3 were all non-white. Almost every season there is a healthy mix or in the top most fouled players lists. So yea maybe some referees are not all top blokes, but Salah doesn’t get less decisions because he is not white. Maybe he draws less fouls? Maybe he is just so good defenders don’t get a chance to foul him as often? Unless Minty LFC has some other proof or evidence, I am inclined to disagree.Rob A (nervous for derby day already) AFC  Salah does not get fouls though So there was a lot of people referring to Salah as a diver who wins free kicks a lot. But just how true is that? A data analyst has done the hard work for us and compared how often speedy, skilful wide forwards are given decisions by referees. As you’d imagine certain players are awarded decisions quite often with Grealish leading the way getting a decision every 20 mins of play followed by Madison, Moura and Jota with decisions every 24,25,26 mins. Finally the top five is rounded off by Messi who get one every 30 mins. On average players win a free kick every 39 mins or so. With the player winning the least getting one every 80 mins (gnabry and b. Silva). Actually I lied then. The player who is awarded free kicks the least is only given an award every 100 mins. That player is Salah. So the average player wins a free kick every 39 mins but it takes one of the world’s best, fastest and most attacking forwards 100 mins. In fact, according to refs, Salah is only fouled 1.3 times every three games. Does that seem right? Grealish, a good player but not on Salahs level gets one every 20mins he plays…. Salah every 100 mins. It takes him 20 mins longer than even second and third place. Is it just that every tackle on Salah is a perfectly timed steal or slide? That doesn’t seem very likely. Salah got booked for diving once in his entire career, in 2014 against Chelsea. And that tag stuck with him so much that now even when teams kick the shit out of him he never gets a decision. He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact. What is also interesting is teams with English players win more penalties than teams with foreign players and English players are 3x more likely to be awarded pens than foreign players. There is a strong correlation in this area. If we take the last completed season the top 5 teams for penalties awarded were; Leicester, Man United, Chelsea, city and Brighton. All teams with a fair amount of attacking English players (except city). No really relevant to Salah, I just found that interesting. Is Salah a diver? Not really no. He gets challenged and tackled as often as any other top forward but he receives decisions 5x times less. And that’s over the course of three seasons too.Lee   …I see Minty’s mail this morning has stirred a few definitely not racist people who don’t believe that racism could possibly exist, as they don’t like Salah, and he’s just a pansy who dives, unlike our brave soldiers from this shore, such as Gordon, who was brutally taken out by Matip at the weekend. Now I’m not saying there is definitive proof of racism, but something is amiss, and I will use everyone’s favourite – statistics – to prove it. Mo Salah is obviously a very good attacking player, using stats from fbref, compared to all other attacking midfielders/wingers: He is in the 99th percentile for goals, shots and shots on target. He’s threatening, so you may want to foul him more often. His xG is also 99th percentile, so you don’t really want to have to rely on your keeper. But he’s not just a threat when shooting, 93rd percentile for xA, 74th for key passes, and 96th for through balls. Even when further away, it’s best to pay him close attention. What about when moving? Not quite as high, 68th percentile for number of dribbles (though 82nd for completed ones), 76th for number of players dribbles past. All this points to a dangerous player you would expect to win fouls. Maybe an average to above average number? 10th percentile. 90% of attacking midfielders/wingers in Europe win fouls more often. 0.88 per 90 mins. So every 102 minutes. When comparing Salah to the 5 players most statistically, we have Sterling (for a premier league comparison) and even Diaz. Sterling is fouled 2.02/90, Diaz 1.79. Both more than twice as much. There will of course be people who just say he dives, but that doesn’t explain why he doesn’t get fouled in the first place. Are players not tackling him at all? Is he particularly exposing the ball when in possession? If so why does he score so many goals? This isn’t a conspiracy mail by the way. I do not think referees favour big clubs or small clubs or clubs in red or clubs in blue etc etc. Liverpool get their fair share of favourable decisions and their fair share against them, but Salah is a statistical anomaly with a track record of multiple seasons, and there must be an explanation somewhere. Personally, I do think him looking different does affect it. You can see the way fans talk him down all the time, he is judged harsher than similar players, despite having one of the best records of all time in the league. I don’t think a lot of this is conscious (though some undoubtedly is), but people just don’t like people that look different.KC (Elneny is 19th percentile for fouled drawn p90, and 99th for fouls committed)  …Interesting assertion by Minty but he’s got his stats wrong (see end of my mail). There is something weird going on with the treatment towards Mo Salah from referees in the Premier League (in Europe its slightly better) and I think this stems from media and fans alike. For eg Graeme Souness said Mo Salah is the most selfish player he’s ever seen – yet who is top of the PL assist charts? Which is it Graeme? Then Adrian Durham and Simon Jordan on Talksport say he’s a diver and Frank Lampard said that he would have won a penalty if he was in Gordon’s position on Sunday. Hilariously this just shows how bad British football punditry and analysis is. Here’s some facts and statistics: Mo Salah is the 240th most fouled player in the Premier League – Norwich’s Ben Gibson has been fouled more times apparently – 57 players have had more touches than him, none of them are attackers. Anthony Gordon won 4 free kicks in the first 20 minutes of the game against Liverpool – Mo Salah has won 4 free kicks in his last 900 Premier League minutes. In those 20 minutes, Mo Salah touched the ball twice as many times as Gordon. Here’s a list of players and the fouls they win per touches vs the % of their touches that are dribbles Richarlison – 12 – 7.4% Gordon – 17 – 7% Grealish – 19 – 4.2% Zaha – 19.8 Kane – 20.1 – 6.9% Saka – 21.5 – 6.1% Sterling – 25.9 – &% Son – 40 – 5.7% Salah – 62.9 – 8.6% Salah gets fouled at 30% of what Grealish does and dribbles twice as much (credit Simon Brundish for the statistic) When Salah did get a penalty this season – Cascarino said Nobby Stiles would be turning in his grave seeing this, Garth Crooks (who hates Salah for some reason anyway) said he was a blight on the game. Literally since Mo Salah came to the Premier League nobody gets less penalties. In the past 5 years – most dribbles into the box per foul, most touches in the box per foul, he must be superhuman to avoid contact from defenders it seems. I’d love the Premier League pundits, all these buffoons on Sky Sports, Talksport, BT Sport, whatever sh*te is employing Tony Cascarino to explain the above. If Salah dives that much why does he not get as many fouls (or yellow cards)? Or is Salah that good that he never gets fouled? In recent times people absolutely hate the media for creating narratives that don’t fit what they see or the stats that exist, an above is a prime example. If I was Salah’s manager I too would be wondering, is it because he’s an Arab, is it because he’s brown, is it because he’s a nice guy? Is he allowed to be choked by defenders, is it a new addition to the laws of the game? Funnily enough, a world leading analyst at a world-renowned university did charting on previous seasons (last 5) on fouls per minute vs attacking play in the top 5 leagues and found a huge anomaly that made him do extra analysis on refereeing bias towards overseas players in the Premier League. Every single player fell between 20 (Grealish unsurprisingly) and 80 minutes except one – Mohammed Salah – 120 minutes. At the time of analysis for this season he had fallen to 100 minutes (but is now back at 120 due to the 4 fouls in 10 games). Racism? Incompetence? God knows but people like Cascarino are a blight on the game and the media is complicit along with PGMOL (statistical analysis has proven they have a clear bias against overseas players).Ash Asani, Krakow Dragoons FC  It’s a Liverpool thing The referee for the Villareal game often seems to let fouls go, in the games I’ve seen him at least. In the Premier League, however, Salah gets so little because he plays for LFC. A lot of people in England harbour a mild to strong distaste for both the club and the city and this translates to referees. I attempt to account for my bias’ but still perceive that the likes of Fernandes, Rashford and Sterling find it much easier to be awarded a foul than the likes of Mane or Salah. No point being bitter about it and it has probably helped Liverpool in the development of their current mentality. IMOMatt, LFC ",positive

President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… Jurgen Klopp’s side ran out 2-0 winners on the night but Gordon had an ulterior motive for his visit, according to The Times. His priority was to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension to his current Liverpool deal. FSG were encouraged by ‘positive noises’ from Klopp, who has been ‘re-energised’ this term having felt drained by the events of last season, which sawLiverpool’s title defence undermined by injuries to key players such as Virgil van Dijk, while the slog of touring empty grounds due to the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’. Meanwhile, Klopp saidafter his side’s 2-0 victory over Villarreal that they “had a lot of good moments”, but warned that it’s only half-time in the semi-final. “It was a brilliant game. The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp claimed. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive

Plus, Everton relegation would be bad for the city, Tottenham without Son Heung-min or Harry Kane and more… Send your thoughts totheeditor@football365.com… Liverpool fans are the luckiest in the worldSo, here we are, at the start of May, and (as you may have heard), Liverpool are still in with a shout of an unprecedented quadruple. Literally no-one has been in this position before in the history of English football. Yesterday was our 42ndwin of the season, equalling a club record, and should we reach win number 45, that will be a new record in the English game. And that win was just about as comfortable a one-nil win that you are likely to see, against a team that has won its last six games at home, and on form, are one of the best teams in England right now. With five changes, resting players like Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago and Salah (although three of them did get a run out eventually). When Klopp took over, the squad he inherited was maybe a top eight squad. And in six and a half years, he has now developed a squad that is literally World class, on a net budget of a little over £100m. I know that lots of people get weirdly bent out of shape by the mention of net spend, but it’s very relevant here, because Liverpool’s owners were never going to spank half a billion on players. That this net spend is, relatively speaking, so low, is a testament to how well the club has been run in the last few years. Dominic Solanke + Jordon Ibe + Danny Ward + Mamadou Sakho + Rhian Brewster = £96m, or to put it another way these sales roughly equal Salah (arguably best player in the World), Fabinho (arguably best defensive midfielder in the World and Andy Robertson (arguably best left back in the World). You’ll have to forgive me for a little cherry picking there. Klopp has not built a team with this £100m; he’s built a squad, one where he can chop and change, and whoever comes in slots in near perfectly to the system. This is his real genius, the fact that he has built a spirit and a level of excellence that is probably unmatched in World football right now. What do you think would have become of Andy Robertson if he hadn’t signed for Liverpool? Would he be lauded as one of the best players in his position in World football and Scotland captain, or would he have been on the path to be perfectly decent journeyman, having a career that most of us could only dream of, that would have been ultimately been unremarkable? We’ll never know, but I am sure he understands the debt he owes to Klopp. Anyway, we probably won’t win the quadruple, let’s be realistic. City seem unlikely to drop points in their remaining four games, and even if they do, it’s not a banker that Liverpool will win their games. Who knows what kind of Spurs will turn up next week, for instance? A Champions League final berth seems likely as I type, but a final is a one off, and as such, is entirely unpredictable. The same can be said about our next trip to Wembley. So it is entirely feasible that for all the promises and dreams that this season has that it will ultimately be underwhelming from a trophy perspective, and if that does happen, the ABLs (and even the non ABLs, because I think it’s only really Liverpool fans that want us to win all four, because let’s face it, if we do we will be insufferable) will be queueing up to crow, and we’ll just have to take that on the chin, because it’s the nature of sport. But make no mistake, literally every single one of them – perhaps City fans aside (but only perhaps) – would swap places with us in a heartbeat. Success and failure are just imposters (thanks to Rudyard for that) – they are fleeting moments on a long journey – and personally, I believe that this journey is more important than a temporary destination. Much more important. I support a team (albeit plastically, from a different country now) that has given me unfettered joy and thrills for the last four years, and what we have experienced as a disparate collective has been incredible. The drama has been constant. Christ, even when the wheels came off they came off like they had never come off before, and we still managed to manufacture something out of the season that has been integral to this one. Liverpool fans are the luckiest fans in the World, and that’s a hill I will happily die on.Mat (bring on the naysayers, it’s all a part of the ride)  Go well, ToffeesI’m happy to be corrected, but I’m pretty sure the Mailbox’s very own Richard Hammond aka Paul ‘Afcon’ McDevitt has previously mentioned that he is a Chelsea fan. I believe he referred to them in a mail as ‘my team’ . Again. I’m happy to be corrected. But even if he isn’t.. Given his latest attempt to jump to the front of the queue for whomever is getting a kicking that week (Frank Lampard) and his love for telling fans of every other team what to feel/think/dream/eat/drink, I look forward greatly to hearing his thoughts on this afternoon’s game at Goodison. My own opinions on Everton are irrelevant. I’m just an Irish Liverpool fan. But I don’t enjoy the glee being taken by some fellow fans in the prospect of their relegation. I firmly believe that the best thing for Liverpool as a city would be to have 2 successful Premier League clubs. Times are hard enough and Everton going down takes jobs with it no doubt. And anyway, LFC should back themselves to always be top dogs. If Manchester can have two, why not Liverpool? Anyway, take care of yourselves folks and enjoy the Bank Holiday.Brian Morrissey. Waterford  Harry and Heung-min are goodSpurs are interesting. They have 2 world class elite players in Son and Kane. They would get into every other team on the planet, more or less. Very few other teams in the world can claim to possess 2 players of that high quality. The gap between them and the rest of Spurs’ squad is enormous. Without these two Tottenham would finish in the lower half of the league. Spurs fans should be extremely grateful to have these immense talents playing for them.Joel  Hairline fractureNorf London x northerners Aaron Ramsdale ribbing Rob Holding about his new hairline is the banter I’m here for.Simon, Norf London Gooner “It only took six years!” 🤣 Aaron Ramsdale jokes about Rob Holding’s first Premier League goal in Arsenal’s vital win 😅 pic.twitter.com/A4MjV0cIsJ — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 1, 2022  P.S.

I saw Ivan play at Fratton Park a few times for Peterborough and he’s one of a very few footballers outside my own team I have genuine warmth for. As well as being a tremendous player he always played with a smile on his face and looked like he was enjoying himself and would banter with opposition fans. I know it’s effectively just a high pressure job but he made a refreshing change. The other player who always looked similarly happy playing is Ade Akinfenwa, proper legend, and sadly missed now he’s hung up his boots.

I laugh. The concern from Liverpool fans as to where and when City can falter is ridiculous. Be very worried about a Tottenham side, very much in the battle for 4th place, coming to Anfield. They can steal a point, or do a “city” on you! And end the race quickly. I believe that match to be the most difficult of matches remaining for either City or Liverpool. City going out (surprisingly) of the champions league this week at the hands of Real Madrid will also make the dream of winning the title next to impossible. I don’t believe they’d want to mess up a straight lane now (pisff! doing the same thing I’m accusing Reds fans of?)Isaac  Poor Stewie You have to feel sorry for poor old Stewie, you just know that he has his latest diatribe listing Arsenal’s failings and how we should have stuck with a manager who he himself chastised in previous missives, or how clubs x and y are far superior all ready to go, but against the odds they’ve won their last three games, don’t worry Stewie, I’m sure they’ll lose against Leeds to send you into a frenzy.Andrew Goonerabroad Brown  16 conclusions…Seriously, you didn’t do a 16 Conclusions piece on the Palace v Chelsea semi-final at Wembley (but did the other semi) and yet, when I open my laptop today and click on F365 there, right at the top, is 16 Conclusions on – wait for it – West Ham v Arsenal???

The German was placed in charge for the remainder of the 2021/22 season following the exit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November. Erik ten Hag will come in as permanent Man Utd successor this summer, when Rangnick will become manager of Austria. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford But the German will still work for the Old Trafford giants in the consultancy role agreed when he took over. In a statement, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” The PA news agency understands Man Utd have been supportive of Rangnick taking the job with Austria, with the advisory position always holding the option for the 63-year-old to take on parallel roles. Rangnick has been given an initial two-year deal that will automatically be extended by a further two years if Austria qualify for Euro 2024. Lars Kornetka will be his assistant. Speaking after Man Utd drew 1-1 against Chelsea last night, Rangnick was coy over the possibility of managing Austria. Asked if he had accepted that job, he said: “Tonight is about our game against Chelsea and I don’t want to speak about anything else. “Please accept that and respect that, so please only ask questions about tonight’s game.” Pushed on the Austria role, Rangnick said: “No (I won’t comment on it). Let us speak about the game. “What I can tell you and confirm is that I will definitely continue with my consultancy role at the end of the season for the next two years and I am very much looking forward to that. “We haven’t spoken, Erik and myself, but we have spoken with the board about the content and the profile of the job. “The content of that consultancy role we spoke about. That’s why I can now confirm that I will definitely continue with that at the end of the season.” ",negative

Man Utd go into this game in terrible form. They have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions. Their only win in this stretch came against bottom-placed Norwich City. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as they won 3-2. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope Ralf Rangnick’s side drew against Chelsea last time out. After Arsenal and Tottenham won on Sunday, United are eight points adrift of the top four. Brentford meanwhile have fared well after being promoted to the Premier League. They sit on 40 points after 34 games and they are eight points clear of the bottom three. The Bees were beaten 3-1 by Man Utd when the sides met earlier this season. Merson thinks they will draw 2-2 at Old Trafford: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game. They’ll have a go at Manchester United and I think they’ll cause them a few problems this weekend.” Elsewhere, Man Utd are reportedly interested in Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez and are looking to include Anthony Martial in a swap deal for the striker. The Argentine has been terrific for the Nerazzurri since joining from Racing Club. He has scored 69 goals in 176 appearances. According to Italian journalist Marco Barzaghi, United are keen on bringing Martinez to Old Trafford. He claimed on his Youtube channel (via the Express) that the Premier League giants have offered Martial – who is currently on loan at Sevilla – and £42m to sign Martinez. Inter have reportedly rejected the offer with incoming United boss Erik ten Hag preparing for a busy summer transfer window. Martial joined the Red Devils for a reported £54m fee and has impressed in fits and starts but has struggled to justify the transfer fee that made him the most expensive teenager in football. His loan spell at Sevilla has failed to revitalise his career having drawn a blank in all eight of his La Liga appearances. ",positive

Liverpool reached the Champions League final in his first season at the club before winning the competition the following campaign. Van Dijk was also crucial as the Reds won their first Premier League title in 2019/20 andis now regarded as one of the best central defenders to play in the top flight of English football.

But with Van Dijk, as a centre-forward, I look at him and think: what do you do against him? “He’s bigger than everyone, he’s faster than everyone, he’s stronger than everyone, he’s brilliant on the ball, he scores goals. I’ve never seen anything like it. “The only thing that goes against Van Dijk at the moment – and I stress, at the moment – is his winners’ medals. He’s only won one Premier League and one Champions League. “People like Rio and [Paolo] Maldini and [Franco] Baresi and people like that who you might consider the greatest, they’ve all got numerous.

Divock Origi is the player in question. The 27-year-old signed for Liverpool in 2014 from French side Lille. He has been a bit-part player over the years as he has played just over 100 times for the Reds in the Premier League. Big Midweek: City v Real, Danjuma at Anfield, West Ham, Rangnick, Forest Origi has become a cult figure at Liverpool though. He netted in the 2019 Champions League final against Tottenham Hotspur. The Belgium international is out of contract this summer and he is being linked with AC Milan. It looks likely that he will leave with him yet to start in the Premier League in 2021/22. Origi has still been able to score some vital goals for Liverpool this term, though. His latest came against Everton at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. His goal helped Liverpool beat Everton to remain a point behind league leaders Man City. Owen thinks Origi has clearly got a “great attitude”: “If you are in a rhythm, the easy bit is coming on and making an impact as a sub,” Owen said (quotes via Liverpool Echo). “Everyone is tiring and it’s a free punch, that’s the easy bit. “The hard bit is the never playing bit. You get out of rhythm. Your mindset is not playing. “You go to bed on a Friday and you don’t even expect to play. “If you keep doing the right things, keep eating the right food, go to bed at the right time, and training perfectly. And you keep getting disappointed every weekend, then something switches off, at some point. “For him to stay at that level and that sharpness, and every single time he is called upon he comes on and makes a difference is quite staggering. “He doesn’t lose his fitness, his sharpness, he doesn’t lose anything, appetite and his attitude. “If I kept coming on and scoring, and being brushed aside and not starting and not playing, I’d start to get sickened by it. “So fair play to him, [he’s got] a great attitude.” ",positive

United are going for a rough spell at present and look set to miss out on the top four following a week of poor results. Erik ten Hag by the numbers: games, trophies, signings Following a 3-2 win over Norwich last weekend which saw United gain points on top four rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, they have suffered back-to-back defeats which have all but ended their hopes. A 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool was followed by a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal and it now looks more than likely that new manager Erik Ten Hag will not have Champions League football next season. Ten Hag, who is currently in charge at Dutch side Ajax, was announced on Thursday as the next permanent boss at Old Trafford and will take over from Ralf Rangnick in the summer. The 50-year-old has dominated the Eredivisie and overseen some deep Champions League runs in charge of Ajax, however, former United striker Owen isn’t too enthralled by the appointment. As quoted by the Express, Owen said: “Based purely on CV it doesn’t strike me as ‘wow, that’s the next Manchester United manager.’ You look at his wins, but it is in the Dutch league and it is being the manager of Ajax. Whilst United continue to struggle, rivals Liverpool are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple having already won the Carabao Cup this season. Liverpool boss Klopp has been a key factor in Liverpool’s success in recent years, helping them end their 30 year wait for Premier League success and also adding their sixth Champions League trophy. Now, Owen, who played for both Liverpool and United, has claimed Klopp would be able to turn things around at United like he did at Liverpool, in two-three years. “I think if you swapped Jurgen Klopp and the Manchester United manager, I think give it two or three years and you’d be seeing similar performances from the Manchester United players that you see from Liverpool players,” Owen said. “Bear in mind the thoughts we all had about Liverpool when Klopp took over and some of the players.

They are playing big roles in that, Konate is a good example for that, he has come in and scored goal after goal, and as a manager it is a dream scenario at the business end of the season.” Thousands of friends all round about you ❤ pic.twitter.com/ADmd4tj8m7 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2022 Michael Owen added: “It is a Champions League semi-final so of course you are going to play your best team, but I think Matip all season has been number one all season, but I think the goals that Konate has scored in the past few games, he does add something different.” Peter Crouch went onto suggest that Liverpool will be helped by Konate’s “dominance” in the air against Villarreal: “I think it is their strongest team, I think the only position you could argue is between Matip and Konate. “But he has brought in (Jordan) Henderson for (Naby) Keita, and (Luis) Diaz, for (Diogo) Jota and I think for me that is the strongest squad available. “The reason I think Konate has been brought in is for his dominance aerially at set pieces and he as proved to be dangerous at set-pieces in previous rounds and that can be an influence on these games.”  ",positive

The rivals face off at Anfield on Sunday with the Reds looking to keep the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the table,whilst the Toffees fight relegation. Graft but no guile as Man Utd go down to shaky Gunners… The derby has seen a number of red cards in the past and Liverpool defender Matip has urged his teammates to keep their emotions in check when they face Frank Lampard’s side. Speaking to Liverpoolfc.com, the Cameroonian said: “I enjoyed really every game against them because you see how it means a lot to the people, to the Liverpool supporters here in the town. “Everywhere, you meet Everton [fans] and you know these kinds of talks. We can give our fans a big pleasure, a big favour if we win again. “It’s a more emotional game but we have to concentrate on keeping on playing our game. Emotions can push but we should not be distracted by it. “We have to keep on going and concentrate on the stuff we are doing, keep playing the way we play and just put more in. “They have a lot of quality, a new coach and they will go for everything because for them it’s a big chance to make a big turnaround. For them it’s a big chance but we also know our chance and we have to knock them down.” Liverpool are not only battling in the Premier League as they attempt to win four trophies this season. They face Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final next week and despite the importance of that game, Matip is just concentrating on each game. “We have experience with it but nevertheless, we just concentrate on the next game – that’s how we did it the whole season and it worked out for us. We want to deliver and we have to deliver. We are in good shape so let’s just keep on going. “This is something special, to be at the end and still be there in every competition and be in range or in a good position. Exciting time.” Matip has been in fine form this season and has remained relatively injury free, something he has failed to do in previous season. He has admitted his joy at being available more often but believes it is just down to luck. “I’m really glad I could play the season without any big injuries. I just have to keep on going and hope I stay fit and still can help the team. “Of course, I’m really happy every time I’m on the pitch and can wear the shirt. “I think sometimes it’s the luck. We worked the whole time through, we adjusted always a few things and worked on a lot of things. But now I’m staying fit and hopefully it stays like this. “Sometimes at the end you don’t know what the reason is but we have a lot of great staff in the medical team and they really take good care of me. Hopefully it stays like this. “As you’re getting older you get a little bit of experience with these kinds of things and with your body maybe too, and this helps. You know when you maybe have to step down a little bit and when you can go. ",positive

The Dutch boss revealed in an interview with RTL that he has been battling prostate cancer. MAILBOX: Man Utd only have three physical players Despite 25 radiotherapy treatments, Van Gaal managed to keep his diagnosis hidden from his players. On his players, Van Gaal said: “They don’t know. They see a blush on my cheeks and think, ‘what a healthy (person) that is’. That is of course not the case.” He added: “I’ve been through a lot with illnesses, including with my own wife. So that’s just part of life. “(I) as a human being have probably become richer because of all those experiences. I thought that should also be in the film.” Van Dijk admitted Van Gaal’s revelation was a “big shock” but wasn’t surprised his manager kept it hidden. Asked if it summed up the person Van Gaal is that he kept his diagnosis away from his players, Liverpool centre-back Van Dijk told a press conference: “Yes definitely. “I was also in shock last night when I heard his interview. He’s getting his film out next week, so I was just wondering how he would promote it a little bit and speak about his life, and then obviously that was a big shock. “I messaged him after the interview. It definitely says a lot about him. I said to him as well, he’s probably not that type of guy that needs a lot of sympathy, that’s how he is. “But I told him as well that we are definitely going to be there for him as a group whenever he needs it, and hopefully we can also make it for him a World Cup to never forget.” Van Gaal managed Manchester United in the Premier League for two seasons and the club tweeted their message of support. ‘Everybody at Manchester United is fully behind our former manager, Louis van Gaal, in his battle against cancer. Sending you strength and courage, Louis.” Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: Sending best wishes and hopes for a full recovery to Louis Van Gaal, who announced on Dutch television tonight that he’s battling prostate cancer.’ Barcelona also paid tribute to Van Gaal – who managed the club between 1997 and 2000 and again from 2002 to 2003. ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to former Barca manager Louis van Gaal, who has been diagnosed with prostate cancer,’ the club said on Twitter. ‘Stay strong, Louis, and get well soon.’ ",positive

The national side looked shaky playing a 3-4-1-2 system in their 4-2 in over Denmark on Saturday, leading Van Dijk to declare he prefers a 4-3-3 like he plays in under Jurgen Klopp at Anfield. MAILBOX: Spare Ukraine the ignominy of a World Cup we all should boycott… And Van Gaal has bitten back, claiming they’ve aready discussed the Liverpool defender’s reservations, before insisting he makes the decisions. Van Gaal said: “I know he has that preference, he always said this publicly. “We already had this debate when I came here. The manager decides the tactics.” Van Dijk had previously said: “Until today we have been training hard, with lots of tactics and meetings.There are good times but also things to improve. We will analyse this. “Of course, we are playing in a new system, different things are required of the players. But I think we showed a lot of good things. “Do I like the system? Well, I’m still in favour of 4-3-3 but I’m not the national coach and the national coach has a very strong opinion about it.” Van Dijk played in a back three alongside Nathan Ake and Mattijs de Ligt, both of whom also generally play in a back four for Manchester City and Juventus respectively. Van Gaal has won six and drawn two of his eight games back in charge of the Netherlands, having had two previous spells at the helm, qualifying for the Qatar World Cup in the process. The manager has hit out at the decision for Qatar to host the tournament, describing FIFA’s decision as “bullsh*t”. “Now, everybody knows that I find that ridiculous,” Van Gaal said. “It’s ridiculous that we are going to play in a country – how does FIFA say it? – To develop the football there, to develop it better there. That is b******t. “And how are you doing that? By organising a tournament in that country. But it doesn’t matter, it’s about money, commercial interests. That’s the main motive of FIFA “Why do you think that I’m not a member of the commission of FIFA? Because I have always taken my distance against these kinds of organisations. It’s not right, but I can say this directly about Qatar, but this does not help the world get rid of this problem.” ",positive
217,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-liverpool-2-0-everton,16 Conclusions: Liverpool 2-0 Everton,"Relegation-haunted Everton gave Quad-chasing Liverpool more of a game than might have been expected at Anfield, but ultimately it’s as you were at the top of the table while things have take a distinct turn for the bleak at the bottom for the Toffees… 1. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of football knows that the first thing that happens in any derby match is that the formbook takes a short, sharp flight straight out of the nearest window. It’s an overplayed trope, of course, but not without a kernel of truth. Derby games are different. Derby games dofeel different. If they felt like other matches they wouldn’t be a thing, and they are. The deeply concerning thing for Everton, though, is that the rapidly diverging current statuses of these two rivals mean that only losing 2-0 in a game where they posed the Quad-chasers really serious problems for a good hour probably does constitute the formbook going out the window. Liverpool had won their last 11 home games in the Premier League, including two 4-0 wins against Big Six opposition, another against Southampton and a 6-0 against Leeds. Everton came here with comfortably the worst away record in the division and a run of seven straight defeats on the road including a 5-0 stomping at Spurs and a 4-0 FA Cup shellacking at Crystal Palace. The Toffees avoided humiliation and that was far from certain at 4.30pm.  2. One similarity for these two teams on different trajectories coming into this match, though: their situations had got worse through no fault of their own since they last played. For Liverpool, two Manchester City wins turning a two-point lead at the top into a four-point deficit. For Everton, two Burnley wins plunging them into the bottom three. Even here, though, it’s far more damaging for Everton. Those Burnley wins were far less predictable than City’s, for one thing, and Liverpool are able to respond in a way Everton right now simply cannot. You’ll hear plenty of talk from precisely the sort of people who like to tell you about defenestrated formbooks that if Everton can play like this every week they’ll be fine. But they can’t and they might well not be. For all today’s endeavour, it’s another away defeat. So, so much now rides on their three remaining games at Goodison – and the first of those is against Chelsea next week.  3. But that’s not to say Everton’s performance was without merit or credit. Losing Ben Godfrey to a quad injury in the warm-up made an already mountainous task even tougher, a reshuffle forcing Lampard to bring Michael Keane back into the starting line-up as a struggling defence had to cope with more changes. That the rejigged backline helped deliver the first-half gameplan pretty much faultlessly was a definite tick in the book for players and coach, while in Anthony Gordon Everton also possessed the most influential player on the pitch for the first hour.  4. For the first 10 minutes, Everton predictably flew into everything, flying around the pitch and trying to get stuck into Liverpool. It worked after a fashion, denying Liverpool the wide open spaces they exploited to such deadly effect in the early stages against Manchester United but the 10-minute passing stats told a story. Everton completed seven passes in that frantic opening. Liverpool 98.  5. The next 10 minutes offered some actual encouragement for Everton, whose high tempo, high energy was showing signs of genuinely unsettling Liverpool. Midfield passes went astray, Trent Alexander-Arnold endured a couple of notably awkward moments, first fortunate to escape punishment for what appeared a clear push in the back on Gordon in a dangerous spot before giving away a less threatening free-kick moments later. Small victories for Everton, but the first 20 minutes went about as well as the Toffees could possibly have dared to hope. A long-range Sadio Mane effort that whistled over Jordan Pickford’s bar on 21 minutes represented Liverpool’s first shot of any kind.  6. Gordon was giving Liverpool problems and providing a much-needed outlet for Everton to launch their occasional counter-attacks. But his first half was tarnished slightly by a yellow card for simulation. It looked a fairly harsh call. While he no doubt went looking for the dangled leg and initiated contact, there have been far more egregious acts of mischief go unpunished and even rewarded. Would VAR even have overturned it had Stuart Attwell given a penalty? Perhaps more important than such unknowable counterfactuals is another imponderable: did it in any way influence the decision not to award Gordon a pretty clear-cut spot kick early in the second half when the game was still goalless?  7. As the first half drew to a close, we were treated to the fable of the The Richarlison Who Cried Wolf. Having hit the ground ‘injured’ for the third time in the half, this time neither referee nor Liverpool were minded to stop play. This time, replays suggested he actually was hurt having gone over on his ankle. But you could totally understand Liverpool’s response given his own formbook, which very much had not gone out of the traditional derby window. Abdoulaye Doucoure in the end had to take a yellow for a transparent hack just to halt play as Richarlison remained prone and Liverpool threatened to pick a route through the suddenly depleted Everton ranks. Mane then also got booked for getting needlessly involved. Richarlison’s most significant contribution to the first half coming from spending 30 seconds lying on the floor holding his leg.  8. Everton’s successful first-half sh*thousery ended with a little wink from Jordan Pickford to the Liverpool fans as, not for the first or last time, he conspicuously and almost comically ate up precious seconds with some nakedly transparent time-wasting. It really was a fine first half for the visitors, with that late Mane booking the perfect microcosm of how successfully they had dragged Liverpool away from a football match and into a fractious derby rumble. This is entirely a compliment to Everton and their manager Frank Lampard who may not be as overtly objectionable as Jose Mourinho but still learned an awful lot from the great man.  Half time team talks will probably consist of Klopp coming up with some tweaks and Lampard telling his players to carry on as they are with the time wasting, the feigning of injuries, the dives and everything else that any self respecting fan should be embarrassed about. — Jim Boardman (@JimBoardman) April 24, 2022  9. That said. this sort of take from Liverpool fans is absurd. Jurgen Klopp is not above such sh*thousery out of some kind of philosophical purity, but instead because of the fact his Liverpool team are nearly always better at football than their opponents so would stand to gain little from turning a football match into a scrap. But let’s not pretend there are no dark arts in Liverpool’s play or anyone’s for that matter. More to the point, put him in charge of this Everton against this Liverpool and he’d have done exactly what Lampard did and been just as happy to see the half-time whistle blow without a single shot on target for either side.  10. Everton’s first-half strategy was one of hard-earned survival, but having achieved that they showed more willingness to attack Liverpool’s high defensive line after the break. Again, Gordon was the catalyst for all Everton’s good work. Twice he got in behind in the first 10 minutes of the second half. The first should probably have earned him a penalty that really could have been not just game-changing but season-changing for both teams, the second should have produced more than a dragged effort across the face of goal that ultimately was neither cross nor shot.  11. The third time Gordon got away he streaked past Naby Keita and was hacked down by Alexander-Arnold for another booking. As Gordon recovered, Seamus Coleman came over and started excitedly, almost angrily, prodding the badge on Gordon’s chest. This was for Everton. This, dare we say it, meant more. Gordon is already Everton’s biggest (only?) positive of this season horribilis and did much to burnish that reputation here. Getting the better of Alexander-Arnold as he did so consistently and thrillingly is no mean feat.  12. And so, finally, to Liverpool and a decisive final half-hour. It’s deliberate that we’ve spent most of this discussing Everton because curiously they spent most of the game as the more significant team. The game was being played on their terms not Liverpool’s. It was a ragged, slow-slow-quick sort of game where Everton’s counter-attacks were starting to look at least as threatening as Liverpool’s often unusually anodyne domination of possession and territory. That all changed after an hour with a Klopp double-substitution and from there it really felt like when and how many rather than if. Off went Mane – disappointing today after some fine recent form – and Naby Keita and on came Luis Diaz and Divock Origi. Liverpool switched to a genuine 4-2-4 and within a couple of minutes had the lead. Origi was – quite literally – central to it as he offered the kind of target and passing option Mo Salah had craved all afternoon and helped create the crossing opportunity from which Andrew Robertson would arrive like a true wing-back to head back across Jordan Pickford and break the deadlock just as Everton were growing in confidence and nerves were starting to fray around Anfield. The relief was palpable, the joyous chants of “Going down, going down, going down” instant.  13. Having got the goal, Liverpool turned on the style for the next 15 minutes in a way few other teams can. A switch was flicked and suddenly Liverpool were zipping forward and swarming over the Everton defence. The Toffees somehow held out and again began to find some sort of foothold. Klopp decided with around 10 minutes remaining to revert to a 4-3-3 with Jordan Henderson replacing Diogo Jota. Without wishing to patronise Everton, both Liverpool’s formation changes reflect well on the visitors. They made Liverpool work and they made them try something different. Klopp clearly gets the most credit because both his changes worked so dramatically, but far better teams than Everton have asked far fewer questions of this magnificent Liverpool team. 14. As if to highlight the potency of Klopp’s second-half tinkering, all three substitutes combined for the clinching second goal. Henderson’s cross was sent back across goal – probably intended to be sent at goal in truth – by Diaz and Origi was there to head home. Here, finally, was a proper objective failure of Everton’s shape and plan as Michael Keane and sub Dele Alli in particular were slow to react. Origi and Fabinho were both quicker off the mark to react to the ball coming back across the six-yard line and either could have scored. That it was Origi was no shock. Liverpool looked far better for his introduction and his 22nd Premier League goal for Liverpool was his sixth against Everton. The role he is asked to play is far harder than most credit, and he is a truly clutch player. There can be few bit-part players so widely adored at a club of Liverpool’s size and current quality. Origi has been so key to so many of their very greatest moments. Given how much playing time he actually gets, it’s a remarkable and rather wonderful thing. There are so few comparable players.  15. A word here for Alisson’s response to Pickford’s first-half antics. Claiming a tame Richarlison shot in injury time, he immediately fell to the floor with the ball and wasted half a dozen of the few remaining seconds. It wasn’t quite the biggest cheer heard at Anfield – they really were quite relieved to get that first goal and fair enough too – but it was still sizeable. It is at least definitely the best thing Alisson has ever done in injury time of a crucial Premier League match.  16. So it’s as you were at the top of the table, Liverpool having done all they could in response to City’s response to the marker Klopp’s men laid down against Manchester United. Liverpool get to make the first move next weekend, though, taking on Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime with top spot there’s for the taking at least until City take on Leeds five hours later. A significant change at the bottom of the table, though, and a strong case to be made that by far the more significant and damaging result for Everton came not at Anfield but two hours earlier and 45 miles away at Turf Moor. Losing to Liverpool was an overwhelming likelihood; Burnley defeating Wolves was not. Frank Lampard is right to talk about Everton taking care of their own business and not worrying about anyone else, but that’s far easier to say than do in the midst of a relegation battle. Especially when you find yourself in the bottom three and your next game is against Chelsea and the in-form team just above you have a trip to a Watford side that has lost every home game since November. For all their worthy effort and endeavour in a futile cause here, things really could get worse for Everton before they get better, if they ever do. ",positive
218,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-mo-salah-fouls-everton-lampard,If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions…,"One Mailboxer reckons racism is blame for Mo Salah being given fewer fouls than Anthony Gordon. Also: Lampard, Liverpool’s route to the final, and Poborsky. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Refs racist towards Salah Villareal were obviously very well organised and were probably thinking they would take a 0-0 draw back home quite happily. Whilst their attempts to slow the game down were good they were playing a ridiculously dangerous game. Whilst we didn’t score we had 10 corners and 12 shots in the first half. They literally couldn’t keep hold of the ball and it became a training exercise in counter pressing. In a way if the away goals rule existed then they probably would’ve tried harder to score but maybe that’s a thought for another day. I understand why Emery set them up that way but you have to find a way to not concede chances against this Liverpool if you want to cede territory and possession. If you give up that space and time to this Liverpool they will eventually find a way to hurt you. If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls as he does. I can’t believe he didn’t get a penalty tonight. I saw something that he gets a foul every 60 minutes whilst Anthony Gordon gets a decision every 30 minutes. It’s not because Gordon is more talented or gets on the ball more in dangerous positions, it’s because he’s white. Great that Trent and Mané got a little bit of rest given our schedule literally doesn’t stop for a bit longer. Trent was well marshalled tonight but Mané continues to find a new lease of life through the middle. Amazing that Klopp has managed to get him so accustomed to that role so fast because a few weeks ago he looked a little sketchy in that central position and today looked a natural.Minty, LFC  Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe  Easy, easy, easy I see that anti-Liverpool supporters are already getting in their “easiest route to the final ever” (not seeing City fans saying this, tbf). Not withstanding a tricky away leg at Villarreal to come (and I’d definitely prefer villarreal to Madrid), but I’m not sure how it’s easier than City’s route? Groups: Brugge, PSG and Leipzig harder than the (before a ball is kicked) “group of death” AC Milan, Atletico and Porto? Then Sporting Lisbon (behind Porto in the league) or Inter Milan (Italian champions)? Then Atletico Madrid (already dispatched twice by Liverpool – so must have been really easy) or Benfica? Finally, Real Madrid and Villarreal (who’ve beaten Juve and Bayern). To be fair, I’m glad Liverpool aren’t playing Bayern, but they didn’t get through so what exactly are Liverpool supposed to do, ask for a Villarreal v Bayern rematch? Real and Villarreal have both had the toughest routes to this point and are both now losing at half time. But City and Liverpool are two of the best teams in the world right now, and they can only beat who is in front of them. Thing is, both of them would beat most teams and the league, champions league and fa cup have proved that. Forget the “but they had an easier run” because they’ve both had their moments of fortune. It should be a City v Liverpool Champions League final and there’s a big chance it still might not be, but they are the best teams in Europe right now and it could be an epic final. For anybody else moaning about how easy Liverpool or City have had it, and you don’t support Real or Villarreal, if it’s so easy, why isn’t your team going for the league or Champions League? CheersRob, Worthing. PS. Yes I’m drunk  Stupid questions There’s this growing trend of asking what the point of certain clubs is? What’s the point of Everton? – they’ve been an ever present in the Premier League but have never finished in the top 3. What’s the point of Burnley? – a club that seems happy to merely exist in the top flight and even what’s the point of Arsenal? – London’s most successful club in terms of league titles but less relevant than Notts Forest on the European stage. But then I think of an old friend who’s a Dagenham & Redbridge fan. This guy goes to every home game and attends away games when he can. He knows his club are highly unlikely to ever play European football or even emulate Burnley by reaching the promised land of the Premier League. But not so long ago his club was threatened with going out of business and I could see the emotion of what this club meant to him as a fan who goes home and away to watch the mighty Daggers. You could not tell him there is no point to his club. So while some of you bask in the reflected glory of a club’s success you’ve hitched your wagon to, don’t belittle those whose club may seem to you pointless – there’s a point to every club across the world because they truly matter to someone somewhere. It would be so easy to cut club football down to franchises operating in certain regions – more money concentrated at fewer clubs – so you could watch the London Prides take on the North West Thunder for example – but does anyone really want to watch that? I know I don’t.Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London  …Wikipedia has a lot to answer for. It gives hard brains somewhere to go to load up on ammunition when they want to prove some utterly inane point such as “Everton have never actually won the League Cup which puts them in the shadow of such luminaries as Oxford United, Stoke, Swansea, QPR, Swindon, Luton, Birmingham and West Brom”. Wikipedia will also tell you, for example, that since QPR won their single trophy in 1967 Everton have won 3 First Divisions, 1 FA Cup and 1 Cup Winner’s Cup and probably most impressively have never dropped down a division. This is of course ignoring the fact that the only people who use the League Cup as a major trophy are fans of the team that’s just won it or people on the internet trying to suggest that league and European trophy winners Everton are in the shadow of Oxford United. This is all irrelevant though, anyone who asks what the point of a football club is isn’t capable of understanding anyway. If you can boil a club down to the honours section of their wiki page then you’re not a football fan and you’re a social miscreant. The key thing about football clubs is the word “club”. They’re about so much more than winning but it’s pointless to debate it because if you don’t know you’ll never know. If the only thing you enjoy about football is to look at league tables at the end of the season then your opinion isn’t wanted, I feel sorry for you and you should take your interest elsewhere. If you feel like Everton are pointless then you also feel like your own club is pointless because no club wins everything and who wants to listen to someone who thinks like that. I find it frustrating that in the past few weeks we’ve had people writing in to mourn the sacking of Mr anti-football Sean Dyche and writhe in smugness about the prospect of Everton getting relegated. I challenge anyone outside of Burnley supporters to say they’ve ever enjoyed a single Sean Dyche match and I challenge anyone to say they’ve never been entertained by Everton.SC, Belfast  Failing Frank As a player, I had no great strength of feeling either way on Frank Lampard, but as a manager? I can’t stand the bloke. Following the Liverpool game, they’ve demanded another apology for a decision; that’s the second time in his short tenure, and he spoke to Dyche privately to get another for Dyche’s “comments”. He’s so painfully, laughably thin-skinned. The entitlement is genuinely nauseating. Throw on top of that, he’s a rubbish manager. “But… but…. he did a good job at Derby!” they say. He came 6th whilst having in Tomori a CB that’s now AC Milan’s best defender, one of the best players currently in the championship in Wilson, and Mason Mount, a player valued at £100m+ that plays in Champions League and Euros finals. True to form, he did succeed in crying his eyes out about Bielsa’s “spying” and demanded another apology, so there’s that. At Chelsea, he scraped fourth with a low points tally for the position (66, 60 is lowest to achieve it) when Arsenal and Spurs both had dreadful campaigns. They scraped through the CL group stage behind Valencia and then were annihilated 7-1 on aggregate by Bayern in the knockouts. He achieved the absolute bare minimum requirements for the season (top 4 and knockouts) and even then, only just, One of my best mates is a toffee, he’d have been furious if they’d appointed Ole or Steve Bruce after Rafa’s sacking. Both are better managers (note, not good, just better than Lampard). Everton are a complete mess, Rafa was a ludicrous appointment that was doomed to end in tears from the start, but to bring in Lampard… I should be grateful really, because it’s nice to know that there’s a club in the league even more dysfunctional and mismanaged than my own.Lewis, Busby Way   Eveton p*ssed away their lottery win Thoughts on Everton Football Clusterf**k: 1. We absolutely deserve to go down and deserve all the stick we get in the process. Won the lottery and absolutely p*ssed it away. Give any of the other Prem teams our investment over the past few seasons, no way do they end up close to where we find ourselves now. 2. Having said that, no way do we end up where we find ourselves now if Carlo had remained faithful when the Spanish harlot crooked her finger. However much we hate ourselves, I hate Real more. 3. Back to all the anti-Everton sentiment. Can’t argue with (most of) it. Also, can’t think of any other Prem teams outside the so-called Big 6 that would elicit the same response in our predicament, so I’m smugly satisfied that our Big Club credentials are firmly in place, drop or no. Bless you all. 4. Silver lining of a drop is that at least our chances of breaking our silverware drought next season would got better. (They do give a trophy for the Championship winners, don’t they?) Mind you, after this season the other Championship teams must be licking their chops at the thought of playing us, so prob not a whole lot better. COYBBrad  Skills to pay the bills Good question Graeme, Glasgow. Off the top of my head, I can think of the “Maradona spin”, where he used to dribble at speed and drag the ball between the soles of both feet, pirouetting 360 degrees and evading the flummoxed defender. The same technique was beloved of Zidane, who may now have lent his name to the manoeuvre too. Going back a bit, there’s the classic “Stanley Matthews” shoulder-drop and accelerate past the full-back. One for the grandads out there! Plus the Ronaldinho “flip-flap” skill Graeme referred to, I think, used to be named after 70s “samba star”(TM The Tabloids) Roberto Rivelino. In more recent times, France ’98 saw the birth of the “Blanco” thanks to the Mexican Cuauhtemoc Blanco holding the ball between his feet and ‘bunny-hopping’ away from defenders. Then about a decade later, a similarly lesser-spotted Latin American skill was perfected by nailed-on future Brazilian superstar (and early YouTube sensation) Kerlon. Kerlon produced the seal-dribble, or “The Kerlon” by juggling the ball on his head as he dribbled into the penalty box against Argentina, I think, in an under-17s game! He faded into obscurity almost immediately, but thanks to his audacity and the growth of the internet, The Kerlon has gone down in football folklore! My all-time favourite skill. Hope that helps!Lee, Master of The Kerlon  …In response to Graeme in Glasgow…if you don’t scream “Henry!” whilst opening up your body and curling an effort into the bottom corner then you’ve done your Sat/Sun/5 a side game a massive disservice. Honourable shout out to anyone who does the Drogba double arm pump celebration.Ronald, London  …In response to the question from Graeme about who else has skills named after them, I am no doubt showing my age but one example immediately shot into my brain, and that was the insanely amazing lob that Karel Poborský scored for Czech Republic against Portugal at EURO ’96. The playgrounds & pitchs of my youth were full of kids trying to replicate it and shouting his name as they did. To this day, if I try and lob a keeper I hear ‘Poborský!’ in my head. If you have no idea what I am talking about, go watch the loft wedge like brilliance for yourself.Neville (Liverpool fan in Melbourne who put a sizeable bet on the quadruple months agoand is now worried that that bet will somehow jinx it)  ",positive
219,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-liverpool-sidestep-obstacle-villarreal-manchester-city-title-boost,Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe,"Villarreal provided some decent resistance for a time but Liverpool found an inevitable breakthrough that could even boost their title hopes. Everton merely adopted the dark arts but Villarreal were born in it, moulded by it. Both teams dragged Liverpool to half-time with sanity, reputation and clean sheet intact. Neither side could hold out for much longer after the break, soon succumbing to the inevitable abyss in ambition and chasm of quality. It took 17 minutes for Andy Robertson to breach the resistance on Sunday and just over seven to sink the Yellow Submarine in an overwhelmingly one-sided Champions League semi-final. After the breathless rollercoaster that was Manchester City against Real Madrid, this was an exclusively downhill snuggle for Liverpool. Therein lie further positives beyond the basic joy a 2-0 win in a monumental game. While their main rivals for the Premier League title were drained emotionally and physically by 90 demanding minutes which guaranteed yet more high-stakes football, the Reds could ease off somewhat with more than half an hour remaining, resting the legs of four key starters with early substitutions. Whether or not Jurgen Klopp alternates his pack as drastically as he did with a two-goal advantage against Benfica in the quarter-final, the domestic matches against Newcastle and Tottenham which sandwich the return leg no longer have to be viewed through that European lens of rotation. Liverpool games ranked from least to most difficult as Quadruple appears on horizon In their entire history, only twice have Liverpool lost the first game of a two-legged European tie when playing at Anfield. Chelsea’s 2009 vintage and the Leeds United of 1971 never looked likely to be joined by Unai Emery’s Villarreal, whose first and last shot was steered harmlessly wide by Giovani Lo Celso after 36 minutes. The Tottenham loanee was joined in this side by PervisEstupinan and Etienne Capoue, both of whom were signed directly from Watford, as well as former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma and north London outcasts in Juan Foyth and Francis Coquelin. Villarreal’s starting XI cost £68.3m to assemble; at least Goliath had a fitting David this time, in comparison to the expensive rabble of Everton and Manchester United. But the outcome was the same. Liverpool knocked, tapped and rapped at the door before eventually growing tired and meticulously removing the hinges. Their first-half playbook featured a couple of routines they returned to more than once: Mo Salah drifting into the official Kevin de Bruyne half space on the right before finding Sadio Mane’s late run behind the defence with a floated cross; Luis Diaz cutting in from the left and forcing Geronimo Rulli into unconvincing parries. Thiago hammered a post. Trent Alexander-Arnold just started delivering volleyed first-time crosses at one point. Villarreal defended with every sinew. The way Trent Alexander-Arnold crosses on the volley/first time is something else. Unreal technique! — Emma Sanders (@em_sandy) April 27, 2022  Yet last-ditch defending and such focus under constant pressure is almost impossible to maintain in these circumstances, particularly when Liverpool showed so few signs of frustration or relenting. In the first 20 minutes of the second half, the hosts scored four times. Two offside efforts from Fabinho and Andy Robertson sandwiched the crucial goals that crushed Villarreal’s spirit. The only outfield Liverpool starter not to have a single shot – Jordan Henderson – compelled the first into existence with a cross from the right, deflected by Estupinan and clawed into the net by Rulli, with three players waiting to convert. Salah and Mane combined again almost immediately after to establish the most comfortable of cushions. From there, the game and most likely the tie was settled. Liverpool and Villarreal shared a single common thread: both prepared for only one eventuality. The key difference was that the former’s came to pass and the latter always needed to navigate a tightrope in a tornado to achieve theirs. Klopp, his players and many a cautious Liverpool supporter will reach new heights in performative deference ahead of the second leg, insisting that Villarreal must be taken seriously, the tie is not over and this is only half-time. And all of that rings as true as ever. But no jinx powerful enough to overturn this lead exists and considering what happened after the break here, those journeys to Paris are probably worth booking.  ",positive

Liverpool hosted Unai Emery’s Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final tie on Wednesday night. The Spanish side knocked out Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach this stage of the competition. Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Villarreal were able to frustrate Liverpool in the first half as the game was goalless at the break. Thiago came close to scoring as his long-range effort struck the woodwork. Liverpool made the most of their dominance in the second half. An own-goal from Pervis Estupinan made it 1-0 in the 53rd minute. This came as Jordan Henderson’s cross from the right flank was deflected into the goal by the defender. Sadio Mane doubled Liverpool’s lead two minutes later. Following a neat interchange with Mohamed Salah, Mane tapped the ball home past Geronimo Rulli. Liverpool were unable to extend their advantage further ahead of next week’s return leg in Spain. Up the Reds ❤ pic.twitter.com/25wkVHXq9K — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2022 Klopp stated after his side’s victory that they “had a lot of good moments” versus Villarreal: “It was a brilliant game. The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp claimed. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” Henderson insisted post-match that “the game is still alive” and he is expecting a “tough” second leg: “They are a very organised team and we knew they would make it difficult,” Henderson acknowledged (via BBC Sport). “It was just important that we kept going and believe that we would eventually break them down. We did that with two good goals. “First one was a bit lucky. Good build up but a bit lucky, in off the defender and keeper I think. But you need a bit of luck when a team plays with a low block. “We got that and it lifted the crowd. The majority of the game, the counter-press was really good. It made it difficult for them. But the game is still alive and it will be tough in Villarreal.” ",positive
221,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-juan-mata-shows-man-united-wasted-beautiful-old-trafford-swansong,Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong,"Juan Mata came, he conquered, and was forgotten about. The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive

The Gunners are currently occupying that all important fourth spot and are three points above Spurs and four above United with a game in hand on both of them. READ MORE: Ronaldo and Michael Edwards in line for football Oscars Arsenal will take on United at the end of April in what could be a vital clash in the race for Champions league qualification and Collymore expects Mikel Arteta’s side to falter. “I’m going for United or Spurs to pip them to the post, though, because I suspect Arsenal’s young team will choke on the final stretch,” the former Liverpool striker said via TeamTalk. “If they prove me wrong, I will happily wear an Arsenal shirt with ‘Arteta 8’ on the back and post a picture of it on social media on the last day of the season.” Collymore has never been entirely convinced by Arteta and earlier this month urged Arsenal to replace the spaniard with club legend and current Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira. Collymore insists that he is ‘not dismissing what Arteta is doing’ by saying he should lose his job for meeting, if not exceeding expectations. He simply says he is ‘convinced’ that Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli ‘would all learn more about heart, desire and winning with ruthless efficiency in a week under Vieira than they would in three seasons under the Spaniard’. Saka has eight goals and five assists in 23 Premier League starts, none as a striker. Smith Rowe has been outscored by only eight players. Martinelli has arguably too much heart, desire and ruthless efficiency for a 20-year-old. Collymore does not go into great depth about Vieira’s suitability and quality, merely saying he ‘has gone under the radar as a manager’ and ‘was made in the Premier League’ as a player, which ‘stands him in such good stead to manage here’. But the Frenchman ‘would inherit those three mercurial players and give them all more spirit, more feistiness’ and ‘show them how to be routine winners’. Arteta, good as he is, can only help Saka, Smith Rowe and Martinelli become ‘very good players for Arsenal’. Vieira ‘is a different beast’ who can turn them into ‘Premier League legends’. Collymore also ‘wouldn’t be at all surprised if Arsenal weren’t tracking his progress and if at some point they didn’t decide to pull the trigger on Arteta to take Vieira back home,’ which is an awful lot of double negatives that might actually cancel out what he wants to say. ‘It will all depend on him getting Palace into the top 10, though, that’s the first glass ceiling he has to break through,’ he says.

Collymore, who seems to have panicked upon learning of the imminent deadline for his latest Daily Mirror column, reckons taking Palace from 14th under Roy Hodgson last season to 10th this campaign is an achievement of such magnitude that Arsenal simply could not resist appointing Vieira. Arteta has taken the Gunners to fourth, one point ahead of Manchester United with three games in hand, which obviously equates to a sackable offence. Nothing can prepare you for Arteta’s shock Vieira ‘admission’ ‘Whisper it, but Crystal Palace are in the Premier League’s top 10 with 10 games to go and, if they can stay there until the end of the season, it will be the first time they have achieved a top-half finish,’ Collymore writes, understandably banishing from memory the tenth-placed finish Alan Pardew engineered in the 2014/15 season. Arsenal came third then but Arsene Wenger should obviously have made way for The King. Collymore insists that he is ‘not dismissing what Arteta is doing’ by saying he should lose his job for meeting, if not exceeding expectations. He simply says he is ‘convinced’ that Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli ‘would all learn more about heart, desire and winning with ruthless efficiency in a week under Vieira than they would in three seasons under the Spaniard’.

There are many ways in which Tuchel’s press conference comment may be interpreted: What can I do? I don’t know. We have to deal with it. The data is out there and the data speaks a certain language. He was not involved in our game, it’s sometimes like this. It’s, of course, not what we want or Romelu wants but it’s not the time to laugh about him and makes jokes about him. ‘It’s not the time to laugh about him and makes jokes about him’ is open to broad interpretation, but one of those is, ‘please respect that this player may be undergoing serious confidence issues’, and that should be given respect. Sow how have the tabloid newspapers reported Tuchel’s comments this morning? TOUCHY (The Mirror) ROM COM! (The Sun) DON’T LAUGH AT HIM (The Daily Mail) DON’T LAUGH AT OUR LUKA (The Daily Star) This isn’t a matter of ‘cancel culture’, or anything like that. It’s about how we respond to Tuchel’s comments, and shouting ‘DON’T LAUGH AT HIM’ from your back pages the following morning in direct reply to them probably isn’t the most appropriate way to do so. Tuchel’s response was actually excellent management, answering the question in such a way that it calls for respect from those of us observing from a distance, and for us to question ourselves and our own responses to what we see on the pitch.  A mountain of MartinIt is a bumper day in the back pages, with many having brought out their big guns to reflect on the weekend’s football, so let’s kick-off in the Daily Mail with Martin Samuel, who luxuriates out into a page and a half and and no fewer than nine different stories. Samuel opens with a contrarian piece titled ‘Lukaku’s letting his team-mates down… not the other way round’, which seems like a very binary position to take. As has been pointed out elsewhere, football is a team sport, and when players aren’t giving the ball to someone who is on the pitch to that extent, perhaps that responsibility should be shared a little. Confidence issues notwithstanding, football is a team game and this is baked into its very nature. Samuel acknowledges that the Match of the Day team of Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Dion Dublin, who reviewed Lukaku’s performance was ‘close to a retired strikers club’, but rather than putting much thought into the analysis of four people who played more than 2,000 club games between them, he instead dismisses it by saying, ‘That’s too easy, blame the supply line’, as though they may consider their membership of the strikers’ union to be more important than analysing to the best of their abilities. It’s extremely bad faith to assume that this is the only reason they could reached the conclusion they did. At points, Samuel’s use of statistics can be… somewhat selective. Saying that ‘(Timo) Werner scored three goals for Chelsea under Tuchel last season, but of the 24 games in which he started, Chelsea won 16 and drew five’ leaves Mediawatch wondering why he should have decided that only Timo Werner’s appearances under Tuchel should be considered. Because just like every other Chelsea player, of course Timo Werner’s win, lose and draw record over the second half of last season was very good. The team’s record was very good. Ultimately, Samuel is engaging in a little revisionism here. In May 2021, he wrote himself of Werner that, ‘Whatever Chelsea have been doing has to change’. He also describes Tuchel’s claims that strikers have often struggled at Chelsea as ‘weird’, even though, four pages on in the same newspaper, there is a big table of strikers signed by Chelsea over the course of Roman Abramovich’s ownership, of whom substantially fewer than half – 9 out of 23, to be precise – have a goalscoring record better than a goal every four games. For a club that wins very regular silverware, that is eye-catching. And if that table is anything like reliable, it certainly doesn’t seem ‘weird’ for Tuchel to have said what he said. ‘It will be argued Tuchel needs to make Lukaku work’, he concludes, ‘but it is the player who must get cracking’. Martin Samuel was saying exactly the same thing about Timo Werner in May 2021. He stops short of saying that Werner should replace Lukaku in the team, but the implication is clear. ‘God loves a trier’, he writes of Timo Werner now. ‘He looks an athlete, a sprinter, a hard worker, and these are fine attributes; but for a goalscorer they are the base’, he wrote about Werner at the end of last season. Why leave that important qualifier off the end of the argument this time around?  A jazz pedant writesIn The Sun, meanwhile, Andrew Dillon is having quite a morning with his columns, one of which jokes that: The Holland squad list from Euro 2020 could be the line-up of a Blue Note jazz quartet as much as a football team. On sax is Denzel Dumfries, featuring Quincy Promes on piano, with Memphis Depay and Wout Weghorst completing the the ensemble and taking centre stage for a glittering night at Ronnie Scott’s. It’s well known that Dutch can sound highly unusual to British ears, but obviously ‘just go and read the Wikipedia squad list for any Eredivisie team’ doesn’t allow for badly photoshopped pictures of the players mentioned playing musical instruments. Mediawatch will (reluctantly) allow this fluff, but cannot allow ‘Take Scat’ as the headline for it all. Scat is a vocal style, so why have three them been plonked down at musical instruments? One of them has got a saxophone in his mouth, for God’s sake. It’s kind of the point of scat that your mouthis the musical instrument. Scatman John (RIP) must be turning in his grave.  Stan Collymore’s logical fallacy‘I fully support Arsenal and West Ham LGBTQ supporters in their protest against Saudi Arabian owners at Newcastle’, opens Stan Collymore in The Mirror. There’s a ‘but’ coming, isn’t there? ‘They have profile too, with Holly Johnson, of Frankie Goes To Hollywood fame, and campaigner Peter Tatchell.’ Still no ‘but’, though. ‘But [KLAXON IN THE F365 OFFICE GOES OFF] where are West Ham fan protests against David Sullivan and his X-rated empire which arguably exploited men and women of all sexualities? Or Gooners protesting against Rwanda, a club sponsor whose human rights record abuse is poor?’ Collymore is into logical fallacy territory with this sly bit of whataboutery, the logical fallacy of attempting to discredit an opponent’s position in a debate by charging hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving the argument made. Mediawatch is prepared to believe that Collymore just hasn’t thought this through rather than that he is deliberately seeking discredit, but Stan should already know that playing anywhere adjacent to whataboutery can be like playing with fire. Martin Samuel goes down a similar cul-de-sac in the Daily Mail. The furore over Kurt Zouma has reached the phase of circularity, and Samuel is keen to keep it spinning. ‘Zouma can still be the cat-kicker and have a very good game’, reads the headline and well… yes, yes he can. He then launches into a tirade about what BT Sport didn’t say about Zouma’s performance for West Ham against Newcastle. Of course, because Samuel is talking about what BT Sport didn’t say, he can’t provide any direct quotes, so… he makes up some of his own. ‘No doubt there were sermons prepared had he fallen apart and gifted Newcastle three goals’, he writes, ‘but the editorial line seemed to be based on the idea that, if Zouma played well, viewers at home couldn’t handle the truth’. What’s this about ‘the truth’, Martin? Because all Mediawatch can see from here is a bunch of opinions being shouted very loudly, and opinions aren’t the same as facts. He also adds that, ‘So Zouma performed impressively and anyone who says so must like kicking cats’, as though it’s impossible to hold the thought that people shouldn’t commit acts of animal abuse and play well in a game of football in our heads at the same time. Has anyone said that other than in jest or for points-scoring bantz? Or is Martin effectively inventing his own quote, the wildest and worst opinion that he can think of, just so that he can dismantle it?  Phwoar analogiesJarring juxtaposition of the day goes to The Mirror. On page 52, they give up a page to an excellent and important article by John Cross on the reignition of the debate over head injuries in the game, which has come about following the injury to Leeds United’s Robin Koch during their game against Manchester United. But directly opposite their headline reads, ‘PHWOAR OF THE ROSES’, referring to a post-mach interview with Bruno Fernandes (don’t ask us to make actual sense of the headline – it’s probably a reference to the ‘amazing support’ that he made, but since when did tabloid sport headlines bear any similarity to the English language?). It’s probably the fault of Mediawatch for still buying paper editions of newspapers, but seeing ‘PHWOAR OF THE ROSES’ opposite a large picture of Koch being helped from the pitch at Elland Road with his head swathed in bandages is… unfortunate, even if it’s clear that the picture and headline from two separate stories.

And Stan Collymore is done with Marcelo Bielsa again. Hot coefficient Those celebrating Tottenham’s exit from the Europa Conference League – including Tottenham fans themselves – will be incredibly embarrassed when they see this story from The Sun website: ‘Tottenham’s Conference League KO sees Prem clubs slip below French & Dutch giants in Uefa rankings in huge seedings blow’ Well that is both ‘huge’ and a ‘blow’. There is no doubt about that, particularly when the opening two paragraphs explain how the demise of Tottenham ‘has seenEnglish clubs slip behind their French and Dutch counterparts in Uefa’s rankings’ in a ‘slide’ that ‘could deal a huge blow to Premier League seedings in future European competitions’. That Premier League ‘slip’ and ‘slide’ means they are less than 0.3 coefficient points behind Ligue Un and Eredivisie in the 2021/22 season so far specifically. Tottenham will see their own ranking suffer, of course – it ‘could see them get a lower seeding in future competition draws’ – but the idea that ‘English teams could feel a knock-on effect down the line’ and ‘in the long-term, this may threaten the Premier League’s four Champions League spots’ is, quite simply, b*llocks. 1) The Premier League has a current rolling five-year ranking coefficient – the system on which Champions League place allocation is decided – of 99.783. La Liga is next on 89.885. That is a massive gap to second place, and the top four leagues all get four Champions League places. Ligue Un is fifth on 56.081. There is not even a vague chance that they catch the Premier League any time soon, if ever. 2) England still have six clubs involved in European competition (only Spain have more, with seven). No country has more teams in the Champions League last 16, with the Premier League boasting the first, third and fourth favourites to win the entire competition. 3) The Premier League has a better current coefficient for the 2021/22 season than La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga, who comprise the rest of the top four member associations. If one team being knocked out of the Conference League could ‘threaten’ England’s four Champions League places, what does that say for Germany’s prospects when Union Berlin and Wolfsburg have been eliminated from European competition altogether already? Put it this way: Chelsea, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and West Ham could all lose their next European knockout games and England would still be comfortable coefficient leaders. That tends to happen when it is based on the last five years and there was an all-Premier League Champions League final and English Europa League runner-up literally not even seven months ago.  Full English That scaremongering article is made even funnier by these extracts from a piece Martin Lipton wrotefor The Sun on December 6: ‘THE Prem big four have made mincemeat of their Champions League rivals. ‘But across the rest of Europe it is the sound of falling giants that is echoing.’ But what of the coefficients, Martin? ‘It has been easy street for the Prem quartet – helping to extend English football’s huge lead at the top of the Uefa coefficient table.’ Oh. ‘It all puts the English group stage canter into perspective. We really are producing the best teams in the world.’ Yeah but Tottenham are out of the Conference League so the Premier League had better prepare to lose a Champions League qualification place, ‘best teams in the world’ or not.  Hard cel Considering Pep Guardiola is doing pretty well right now, Stan Collymore has to turn hisDaily Mirroropprobrium to that other unbending ‘football zealot’: Marcelo Bielsa. He is ‘done with the excuses Leeds fans are coming up with to defend their Messiah’, which will undoubtedly be difficult to take for said Leeds fans. A brief glance at their list of injuries suggests some of those ‘excuses’ are quite fair and legitimate, but Collymore’s wider point is, of course, about that stubborn sod whose ‘bloody-mindedness’ might get Leeds relegated. ‘How, after a 4-1 against Arsenal, a 7-0 against City, can you not put your hands up and say I will revise my style and show a little pragmatic streak?’ Maybe he has. He wouldn’t have to tell you, Stan. And if he doesn’t, it’s probably because Bielsa has faith in the approach that has delivered him great success, and won’t let one bad month undo all that. Also, ‘pragmatic’ doesn’t mean what you think it does. It’s not a synonym for ‘defensive’. ‘We should not be painting him up there with a Shankly or Ferguson or Sacchi.’ Mediawatch finally finds something to agree with. Now just to find literally any one person who is ‘painting’ Bielsa as ‘up there with a Shankly or Ferguson or Sacchi’. ‘The notion that you don’t ever change from a core set of values despite what you are seeing on the pitch almost deserves you the sack at some point.’ Absolutely. Remember when Liverpool handed Jurgen Klopp his P45 at the start of March? ‘Why, aged 60-odd, did he think having such a small squad was prudent, given this league is like a Grand National – exhausting, with loads of hurdles?’ Because he guided a small squad to ninth last season. The best bit is Collymore wondering whether it is ‘worth suggesting to Bielsa that an old dog can be taught new tricks. Otherwise Leeds could go down, although I don’t think they will.’ In summary: Leeds fans are stupid for continuing to back Bielsa, who absolutely has to change his style but probably won’t go down anyway even if he doesn’t.  Leeds by example Collymore is also incredibly eager to get one particular point across: ‘Leeds have invited me to their training ground to see what Marcelo and the club are all about, which is very kind, and I’d love to go.’ Then… let them know? ‘I’d love to take up that invite to Thorp Arch, see training and pose some questions.’ Mediawatch gets the sense that Collymore is happier to weirdly flex in his newspaper column about being invited to watch Leeds train, than he is to actually watch Leeds train.  Chelsea dagger Elsewhere, Collymore has some shots to take at the entire concept of Chelsea: ‘It’s an absolute disgrace that Chelsea named only four players on the bench for Sunday’s 0-0 draw at Wolves. ‘Why? This is a club with 22 very talented players out on loan, a vibrant academy and a huge squad.’ Not sure those loan players could be recalled specifically to sit on the bench over Christmas. And that ‘vibrant academy’ was perhaps not deemed necessary to risk suddenly exposing to a COVID outbreak across said ‘huge squad’, from which only Lewis Baker, Charly Musonda and their combined 35 career Premier League minutes, were available but not picked. ‘The club insisted COVID had decimated the squad – they were seven players down – and they were left with no choice. But that’s why we have academies and a 26-man squad.’ That’s not really why we have academies – to suddenly fill a squad at senior level despite no prior experience at that level and no chance of actually playing. ‘The fact Chelsea CHOSE to not put a full bench out is worthy of a fine.’ It is truly important to keep perspective in such uncertain times, so thank you, Stan. And good luck to whoever tries to fine Chelsea for not making three teenagers sit on a bench for 90 minutes while Thomas Tuchel quite understandably ignores them because he has no sodding clue who they are.

Thomas Tuchel’s side dropped to third place in the Premier League after their 3-2 defeat to West Ham on Saturday, but remain just two points behind league leaders Manchester City and are top of their Champions League group.

Collymore wrote in his column for the Mirror: ‘If you go back to the start of the 2019-20 season, after Liverpool had won the Champions League and had been runners-up on record points in the Premier League, I saw a really cold, business-like attitude from them when they reported back for pre-season. ‘I remember seeing videos of players and it was just a handshake, a little smile, and very much a feeling of, “We’re back on it, this is going to be a big season for us and this is where the work really starts”. ‘I remember watching Virgil Van Dijk almost on a loop with a deadpan face saying: “We’ve achieved nothing yet”. ‘There was a humility and a grounded nature about such as Van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold that I’m not seeing and hearing from some Chelsea players. ‘And it makes me wonder if what is essentially a young Chelsea team are enjoying the success they have had even one per cent too much. ‘There seems to be a feeling of, “Ah, we’ve won the Champions League so it’s an absolute shoo-in that we’re going to be in the conversation for the league”, and that’s not the right mentality, because it only takes three players to start thinking or feeling that way for it to become a bit of problem. ‘What I want to see now, then, is footage of Mason Mount on the training ground drilling balls into the back of the net instead of him smiling and telling me how lucky and blessed he is. ‘I don’t want to hear about Jorginho and the Ballon d’Or, and I don’t want to hear about Antonio Rudiger being the best defender since Franz Beckenbauer or whoever. ‘The only person at Chelsea I want to hear from is Thomas Tuchel and when that’s the case every team they come up against will know their ruthlessness is back.’ ",positive

Ranking every Premier League No. 1 by ball-playing ability Howe won a game at the fourth time of asking, beating Burnley 1-0 on matchday 15 in the Premier League. The Geordies have drastically improved under the 44-year-old’s stewardship and are set to become the first team to avoid top-flight relegation after failing to win any of their opening 14 encounters. They spent over £90m in the winter transfer window thanks to their new Saudi-led ownership, bringing in Dan Burn, Chris Wood, Kieran Trippier, Matt Targett and Bruno Guimaraes. Newcastle are now ninth in the Premier League and are one of the most in-form teams since the turn of the year. The club’s former striker Saha believes the Magpies’ turnaround should see Howe named Premier League manager of the season. “I think so, yeah,” Saha said when asked if Howe deserves the award (via The Shields Gazette). “When you have competition like Guardiola, Klopp and (Thomas) Tuchel, it’s hard, but it shows he’s done an amazing job. “When he arrived, they were favourites for relegation, and he’s built a dynamic team, played some very exciting football and defended well. “The players he brought in had an impact and credit to him, and to the club who had the guts to make that decision at the right moment. It’s very important to recognise the immense impact Eddie has had.” Elsewhere, Ally McCoist believes Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard would be an excellent signing for Newcastle. The England midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season and has struggled for game time at Old Trafford in recent seasons. “I think it would be a great move for both parties,” McCoist said. “Jesse, please get out of there and start playing football, it’s what we want to see, it’s what you want to do, it’s what you need to do. “We saw your talent when you went down to West Ham, that’s what you’ve got to do – get back playing for yourself. A move to Newcastle, a team that are on the up and are going places, I really do think it makes sense.” ",positive

The Magpies have been in fine form in recent months, steering clear of the relegation zone and advancing into the top half with a win over Norwich on Sunday. Gossip: Man United suffer setback but Ten Hag forces U-turn Many of Newcastle’s wins in their run of good form have been due to solid defensive work and moments of quality in the forward areas. However, they showed on the attacking potential they have at Carrow Road running out 3-0 winners thanks to a brace from Joelinton and another goal from January signing Bruno Guimaraes. Speaking after the game, Howe admitted the ‘shackles came off’ in the win and he hoped that was a good sign for the future. “We were very good after we scored. The opening stages were very tight. We knew it would be coming here. Norwich are a good team and were motivated to do well today. We knew we had to see out the early stages of the game. “We were very keen today to extend the good run we are on and not fall into any lull or falling of standards. That is the most pleasing thing of the day, that we have come here and been very professional. “We gave it our all to win a match. Some of the quality of our play, especially after we scored, was the highest level and we scored some good goals. “We have been playing under the pressure of trying to stay in the league and we have got a lot of results playing resilient, organised football. “Today, for the first time the shackles came off a bit. The confidence on the ball was high and hopefully this is a glimpse of the future. “Joelinton started as a nine and scored his two goals off the left. Both really good finishes. He showed his versatility and quality and he is someone we are really pleased with. “There is a very good feeling in the group. A good relationship between staff, players and supporters. “If you have that unity and quality footballers it is a good mix.

Two seasons ago, the 44-year-old was unable to prevent the club he had led from League Two into the top flight slipping back into the Football League, prompting the end of his eight-year second spell in charge on the south coast. Euro 2022 can move the needle but it deserves better stage However, he used him time out of the game before he was appointed head coach at St James’ Park in November last year to reflect on what had gone wrong, and that has proved key to the Magpies’ revival. Asked how much that experience had helped, Howe said: “A massive amount, I would say. “All my years of management before then were, I’m not going to say successful, but pretty much successful. “That was the first big failure for me and it was very, very painful. But sometimes through those experiences, you learn so much and I certainly did a lot of self-reflection in my time out. “That period out of the game was hugely important for me. In hindsight, I might look back in 10 years’ time and say it was the best thing that happened to me personally. “Certainly I would never say that for the club because it was hugely painful and the impact of relegation is huge on any club and any town, especially with my feelings for Bournemouth. That’s why it was so painful for me personally.” Newcastle had just five points when Howe was appointed, but now sit on 40 after Wednesday night’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace, their sixth in succession on home soil, and while safety is not mathematically assured, they head for bottom-of-the-table Norwich on Saturday knowing only a remarkable sequence of results would shatter the relative calm which has descended on the club. The job he, his staff and players, backed by a £90million January investment by Newcastle’s new owners, have done during the intervening period has been hugely appreciated by a fanbase left disillusioned by years of under-achievement. Howe was still signing autographs and posing for photographs at St James’ almost two hours after the final whistle on Wednesday evening, but he sees that as a welcome part of a job which consumes him. He said: “It’s a 24/7 job, that’s how it is. You have to be that ingrained, for me, to be successful and that’s how I’ve always been. I drive here early, I leave quite late and even when I’m not here, I’m working. That’s pretty much it. “I had a supporter turn up as I was driving in – I think it was about 6.20am – and they said, ‘We wanted to catch you, we’ve been here since 5.30am’. “That’s the kind of devotion and passion people here have for their football club, and it’s brilliant to experience and to be part of.” ",positive

Forest are big Championship winners while Bowyer tops losers Victory over Crystal Palace on Tyneside on Wednesday evening would take Newcastle to 40 points, the traditional finishing line for those battling relegation, although many believe they are already safe with a 12-point advantage over the chasing pack. Asked where that would rank as an achievement, Howe, who nevertheless still believes there is work to be done, said: “It would be right up there, right up there. “I’ve been so focused week on week and the job’s not done yet.

Howe said: “It was difficult at the time to see it, but looking back now, you think that was a potential turning point for us. “The Saudi trip was a brilliant thing for the group, and we came back in a much better place, united, ready to start the fight to stay in the division.” Three points against beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Palace would see Newcastle secure a sixth successive home Premier League win for the first time since April 2004 under Sir Bobby Robson, with supporters having been reminded of those heady days by the atmosphere which greeted Bruno Guimaraes’ last-gasp winner against Leicester on Sunday. Howe, who revealed the club is closely scrutinising every detail in areas such as nutrition, sleep and analysis as it plots a way forward, said: “To do that would be an incredible thing for us. “To do anything related to the name Sir Bobby Robson and to try to achieve one of his milestones would be brilliant for us. “Playing at home, as we’ve always said, is such a unique thing here.

We don’t want football without wonderful Luka Modric Newcastle are now 15th in the league with eight wins on the board and are ten points above the bottom three with their top-flight safety all but secured. Howe is doing a stellar job having spent over £90m in the January transfer window. The Geordies brought in Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Matt Targett, Bruno Guimaraes and Dan Burn. Despite his backing from the board in the transfer market, Jordan insists Howe won’t take Newcastle to the “next level”. “Of course, he was given a helping hand with £93million of spending in January,” Jordan said on talkSPORT. “But Eddie Howe’s reward surely, surely can’t be that someone gets to step in his shoes without having a fair crack at dissuading people like me that he’s going to take Newcastle to the next level. “I don’t think Eddie Howe will be the beneficiary of the ultimate unleashing of Newcastle’s potential.

The Citizens raced into a 2-0 lead in a pulsating first-leg encounter with goals from the irrepressible Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus in the first 11 minutes. Champions League? You’re having a right f***ing laugh Real responded through the prolific Karim Benzema before Phil Foden and Vinicius Junior traded goals early in the second half. Bernardo Silva gave Man City a two-goal advantage but Benzema scored a cheeky penalty – his 41st goal of the season in as many appearances – to cut the deficit once again. Both sides spurned numerous other chances in a compelling and breathless clash that set the stage for a fascinating second leg next week. Man City may regret not making the most of a number of early opportunities as they stormed out of the blocks. They could almost have put the tie out of sight in the opening half-hour but Real, after fine comebacks against Paris St Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds, fought back again. Real were sluggish and sloppy and continually left spaces for the hosts to exploit. Some of Foden’s touches were exquisite and De Bruyne’s throughballs were a constant danger. It was De Bruyne who got City off to the dream start, heading their opening goal after just two minutes from a Riyad Mahrez cross. The atmosphere crackled and City took further inspiration, doubling their lead nine minutes later. Foden showed great control before laying off to De Bruyne, who drilled a low ball into the box for Jesus. The Brazilian had his back to goal but, buoyed by the four-goal haul against Watford that earned him a place in the side, was too quick for David Alaba. He turned sharply, wrongfooting the defender and blasted a low shot past Thibaut Courtois. Another 𝙗𝙞𝙜 shift! 🇧🇷🤙#ManCity pic.twitter.com/fXKbNJLSqd — Manchester City (@ManCity) April 26, 2022 City went close again as Oleksandr Zinchenko fired wide and Mahrez infuriated manager Pep Guardiola by hitting the side-netting rather than squaring for Foden, who later shot wide himself. Yet as well as City were playing, they did look vulnerable at the back. Guardiola’s gamble in rushing back John Stones from injury to play at right-back in the absence of Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker also backfired. The England international struggled and was caught out as Benzema crossed and Alaba glanced a header wide. City failed to heed that warning and Real scored through the same route, this time Ferland Mendy crossing for Benzema to divert in. Stones was replaced by Fernandinho moments later. City upped the tempo after the break and hit the post through Mahrez. Foden’s follow-up attempt was blocked by Dani Carvajal but he made no mistake in the 53rd minute as he got on the end of a fine cross from makeshift right-back Fernandinho to head City’s third. Yet again from a position of control, City allowed Real back into the game. Vinicius turned Fernandinho out wide and was too quick for the rest of the defence, racing into the box to slot into the bottom corner. It could even have been 3-3 soon after as Eder Militao found space but aimed his header at Ederson. Such was the tension that Guardiola was booked for coming out of his technical area. City were determined to add to their tally and their fourth came after referee Istvan Kovacs played a good advantage when Toni Kroos felled Zinchenko on the edge of the area. Real stopped expecting the whistle to be blown but Silva played on and smacked a shot into the top corner. They pushed on even after that, with Mahrez inches away from another. Real were not done and pulled another one back eight minutes from time with a Panenka penalty from the cool Benzema after Aymeric Laporte handled. Karim Benzema is having the season of his life. 👏 pic.twitter.com/EuATxpc0Ad — Football365 (@F365) April 26, 2022  ",positive
235,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-decide-premier-league-title-race-spurs,Top ten outsiders who will decide Premier League title race,"One point separates Manchester City and Liverpool with seven Premier League games left, with a Spurs pair among those that may prove decisive. 10) Fabian Delph (Everton) Now hold on. At least hear us out. Don’t click on that. Please stay. Why does this keep happening? It’s so lonely here. Someone out there must be able toaccept that Fabian Delph(born 21 November 1989) is an English professionalfootballerwho plays as acentral midfielderforPremier LeagueclubEvertonand theEngland national team, and he can help decide the fate of the title in the year of our Lord 2022. Everton, beaten home and away under different managers by Manchester City and humbled at Goodison Park when Liverpool made the short trip in December, could still help split the two. They will aim to dispatch a pair of gargantuan fowl with a pebble when visiting Anfield in just under a fortnight, with the derby potentially transforming the table at either end. Victory over Manchester United eased Everton’s survival hopes and it was achieved in no small part thanks to the anchoring of Fabian Delph, making his first Premier League start in four months and carrying out the f**king basics of football like only a champion can. That included communicating to Michael Keane the need to “waste time” while celebrating a goal in the 27th minute. Liverpool should not underestimate such experience and Manchester City will hope for a favour from their former employee.  9) Raul Jimenez (Wolves) The two-game suspension has been served and Wolves neither advanced nor regressed without their talismanic centre-forward. Supporters and detractors of Raul Jimenez can use the victory and defeat secured and suffered in his absence in whichever way suits their argument. But it is notable that in games against Aston Villa and Newcastle with Fabio Silva flanked by Francisco Trincao and either Hwang Hee-chan or Daniel Podence, the top Wolves goalscorer was Jonny Otto, level with Ashley Young. Jimenez will surely reprise his role at the first opportunity and considering the run-in puts Wolves in the firing line of both Manchester City and Liverpool, his chance to make a mark is imminent. Pep Guardiola’s side are yet to have their Molineux visit rearranged, while Jurgen Klopp would have picked a more favourable final-day opponent than Wolves at home if given the choice. Jimenez has two goals in six appearances against the pair of them – although the Mexican’s best performance versus either was in October 2019, when he selflessly and brilliantly laid on two Adama Traore strikes at the Etihad.  8) John McGinn (Aston Villa) Three teams face both Liverpool and Manchester City before the end of the Premier League season. Wolves, Newcastle and Aston Villa are the most common obstacles in this race. Klopp will be particularly relieved that is not a literal description, considering his summer surprise at John McGinn’s stamina levels. The Liverpool manager was said to have once asked whether the Scot ‘ever stopped running on matchday’, having previously publicly referred to him as a “super player”. Guardiola will be no stranger to McGinn, the scorer of the quickest Premier League goal Manchester City have ever conceded under the Spaniard when he netted after 20 seconds in April. Villa lost their December meeting with the Blues 2-1 and the Liverpool match two weeks later 1-0. Steven Gerrard will be keen to slip into the conversation and his team have shown an ability to at least make things as difficult as possible for them. 7) Jarrod Bowen (West Ham) There are four players with at least eight goals and assists each in the Premier League so far this campaign. Mo Salah and Harry Kane would ordinarily expect to comprise half that field, while Mason Mount has quietly put together an impressive season amid Chelsea turmoil. But completing the set is Jarrod Bowen, whose West Ham exploits have justifiably not gone unnoticed. Liverpool are known to be interested; a decisive goal against Manchester City in the penultimate game could certainly help grease those wheels. Bowen assisted twice in a dramatic 3-2 win over the Reds at the London Stadium but was substituted early in the return fixture and managed understandably little in a minor cameo during an Etihad defeat in November. He has the ability and versatility to cause problems in any defence, even if the Europa League final falling three days after hosting Manchester City could prove too almighty a distraction for the Seville-bound Hammers.  6) Kalvin Phillips (Leeds) Liam Cooper could quite easily take this place; Leeds have lost just one of the last nine Premier League games their captain has started and Jesse Marsch’s defensive revolution only took hold upon the centre-half’s return from a lengthy injury. But Kalvin Phillips is likelier to prove a direct difference in more pivotal midfield battles against Fabinho, Thiago, Jordan Henderson, Rodri, Bernardo Silva and Kevin de Bruyne. The 26-year-old’s tentative comeback from a hamstring problem has been gradually building from a place on the bench against Wolves, to respective 24 and 31-minute appearances to help procure four points from Southampton and Watford. The next logical step for Phillips would be a start and considering their next Premier League game is not for another fortnight, he should be up to speed by the time Manchester City visit on April 30. Phillips was painfully absent for the 7-0 shellacking Leeds were subject to in December and he has actually yet to ever be beaten by Guardiola’s side. The only two times he has faced the reigning champions was in the 2020/21 season, as the stable foundation upon which a win and a draw was built.  5) Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle) “Next season I believe we will strengthen very well to seek, who knows, a spot in the Champions League, in the Europa League. From now on, it’s a team to compete to be champions of the Premier League,” Bruno Guimaraes said in March. Newcastle will have their opportunity to lay down an early marker when they host Liverpool and travel to Manchester City in consecutive weekends. It was not pretty for the Magpies when that double header was reversed in December and they came away from Anfield with a 3-1 defeat before holding a 4-1 loss at home to Guardiola’s side three days later. Newcastle have grown since then and Guimaraes best encapsulates their change in attitude and approach. He has started four Premier League games since signing in January and each have been uncharacteristically decided by a solitary goal: 2-1 and 1-0 wins, with a couple of 1-0 defeats. The 24-year-old has been an inspirational addition and his blend of attributes should threaten the challengers.   4) Harry Kane (Spurs) It does not really need explaining but this should suffice: four goals and five assists in his last six Spurs games; the third-most goals and assists in Europe’s top five leagues so far this calendar year; one goal against Liverpool this season; a record of a goal every other game in 14 matches against the Reds. It’s Harry Kane. He’s only higher than Fabian Delph on a technicality.  3) Heung-min Son (Spurs) Pretty much the same energy. Heung-min Son is more effective against Manchester City, beating them in eight of 15 meetings, while scoring seven goals and setting up three. The South Korean is not quite as impactful when facing Liverpool but netted at home to them earlier this campaign and away in December 2020. His and Kane’s record against the top two dovetail impeccably and their attacking fusion, especially when combined with the stylings of Dejan Kulusevski, adds a remarkable degree of jeopardy to that Anfield visit on May 7. The wide-held supposition that Manchester City and Liverpool will simply relentlessly win all of their remaining fixtures does rather overlook how the latter face a transformed Spurs and arguably the continent’s most in-form attacking trio, a matter of days after a potential Champions League semi-final second leg.  2) Ruben Neves (Wolves) Bruno Lage sounded more hopeful when issuing his latest Ruben Neves injury update, suggesting the Portuguese’s knee problem was “not as serious” as had been feared. Even then, the initial prognosis could have provided him with a basis for a grandstand finish as it was predicted that Neves could return by May – the month when Wolves take on both Manchester City and Liverpool. In addition to the obvious motivators, Neves could be prompted to perform and impress in the hope of firming up an approach from either Arsenal or Manchester United. The 25-year-old featured in 1-0 losses to both title contenders in December and any semblance of revenge would be either the prelude to a welcome career development, or proof that Wolves are on the sort of track he is willing to commit to following.  1) Philippe Coutinho (Aston Villa) Hadn’t properly considered it until now, yet it suddenly feels absolutely right. Aston Villa welcome Liverpool on May 10, then pop up to Manchester City on the final weekend 12 days later. The discussion will be inevitably dominated by Gerrard but a captivating subplot centres around Philippe Coutinho. Five goals in seven games against the current leaders is a quite stunning return and any repeat of that 2014 winner would likely guarantee Michael Edwards his statue outside Anfield for the most enduring transfer masterplan long game ever. But that tantalising prospect of a butterfly flapping its wings – Liverpool selling Coutinho to Barcelona for £142m – in January 2018, only to cause an eventual hurricane of narrative-laden schadenfreude when the Brazilian scores the goal that kills the Quadruple more than four years later, is quite something. The muted celebration alone would be spectacular. ",positive
236,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-five-players-ready-for-transfers-relegated-everton-burnley-norwich-watford,Five players who’ll stay up if their clubs go down…,"It looks like being three from four in the Premier League relegation scrap. But this quintet should stay up regardless… Dominic Calvert-Lewin Should Everton’s descent continue all the way to the Championship, there will be an exodus from Goodison likely led by the manager. Where Frank Lampard goes from there, who knows? But we know already that he won’t have as many offers as his leading centre-forward. The queue for Calvert-Lewin began forming two years ago, when Manchester United positioned themselves towards the front. Since then, Arsenal seem to have jostled their way to the head of the line, with the Gunners in dire need of a striker when their two remaining centre-forwards become free agents in the summer. United seem rather more keen on Richarlison these days, despite his poor form this season. Calvert-Lewin’s recent body of work is hardly impressive – he’s missed most of the season because of injury – but memories of both terrorising Premier League defences are fresh enough to ensure they will get the moves necessary to spare them the ignominy of playing in the second tier. The sale of Calvert-Lewin would suit all parties, even if Everton manage to pull up from their nosedive towards the bottom three. The Toffees will need the cash, especially in the wake of losing their Russian-linked sponsorship agreements, and Calvert-Lewin will be ready for the next step towards a Big Six club to further his England hopes.  Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season  Jordan Pickford The same goes for Gareth Southgate’s No.1… Pickford might not enjoy everyone’s trust and doubts in the Everton goalkeeper are understandable after some ropey form for the Toffees this season and last. But he remains one of Everton’s most-sellable assets. His international status will ensure plenty of interest in Pickford, who has yet to make an error that has led to a goal in 42 England appearances. Despite competition from the likes of Nick Pope and Aaron Ramsdale, he remains Southgate’s firm first choice. To maintain that standing, Pickford will need to be playing in the Premier League, especially if Ramsdale’s reputation continues to grow. Any serious dip in status or form at club level could have catastrophic effects for the former Sunderland stopper’s international prospects ahead of the World Cup at the end of the year. Who would take him? Tottenham might. Spurs have been linked with Pickford in the past and still they need a long-term successor to Hugo Lloris, even if the France keeper has signed a deal for next season.  Maxwel Cornet Burnley’s summer signing is playing first to keep the Clarets in the Premier League but secondly to save his own skin if Sean Dyche’s side cannot claw their way out of the bottom three. To do either, Cornet needs to be fully fit, which has not been the case for a few months now. After signing from Lyon last year, the attacker bagged five goals in six games, making it appear that Dyche had unearthed a £15million gem. But Cornet’s output has slowed amid numerous disruptions. Covid, injury and AFCON involvement have all hampered the Ivory Coast star’s efforts to maintain his flying start. Dyche needs him to finish the season just as strongly. Do that and there will be no shortage of clubs willing to at least give Burnley their money back if it is not enough to keep them in the Premier League. The queue for Cornet will surely be longer than the line for Dwight McNeil, with the 22-year-old having offered just a single assist in 27 games this term. Emmanuel Dennis It seems certain that Ismaila Sarr will be on his way and since it was speculation linking him with Newcastle that prompted this piece, we’ve looked elsewhere in Roy Hodgson’s squad for a player who’ll have no trouble staying up if the Hornets go down. Slim pickings though it was, Dennis stands out as one whose top-flight status will be secure. The 24-year-old is Watford’s top scorer with nine goals while offering five assists. Only one of those goals, however, has been scored for Roy Hodgson. The new-ish Watford boss’s priority upon taking over from Claudio Ranieri was to tighten up a leaky defence, which he has managed to do, but at the expense of restricting the Hornets’ creativity somewhat. Since Arsenal need a couple of strikers, they could do worse than supplement a top-class centre-forward with Dennis, who can play anywhere across the front line.  Max Aarons If we must include a Norwich representative in this list – apparently we do – then Aarons is likely to be the next cab off the Canaries’ rank, following Emi Buendia and Ben Godfrey in making a big move. Aarons might have been surprised to start the season as a Norwich player given the intense interest in the right-back from some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Two year ago, Barcelona wanted to sign him. In January last year, it was Roma who submitted an offer, while Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have also been linked. Those were just the continental teams tracking the 22-year-old. So it should be inevitable that, after one more year at Norwich as a Premier League player, Aarons will be on his way this summer. But has this season enhanced his credentials? Under Dean Smith, Aarons has had to adjust his game, reining in his attacking instincts somewhat as the Canaries look to solidify their base. While that means his efficacy in the opponents’ half has dropped off, it has allowed him to showcase a more rounded game. There will be takers for Aarons, but his suitors might not be as grand as they once were. ",positive

The Premier League champions are chasing their first-ever Champions League trophy with their semi-final second leg against Real Madrid taking place on Wednesday. Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham City have won 13 major trophies since 2011 but glory in Europe’s elite club competition has eluded them. They made their maiden final last year when they were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea. De Bruyne told a press conference ahead of Wednesday’s match in Madrid: “I think it (winning the competition) would change the perspective from outside. “Obviously as a player you want to win the trophies, and you want to win this one. But I think the fact we’ve been fighting for numerous years and getting to the latter stages means that we’ve been doing really well. “It’s a cup competition and the quality is very high so it’s very, very difficult to win it, and there’s different circumstances that happen. “I think in the end if you look back at the way we performed, or I performed over seven years with the team, we did really well. But obviously we didn’t win it, and I think winning it would just change that little narrative.” Ready for another big #UCL night in Madrid! 💪#ManCity pic.twitter.com/k85wgA37KH — Manchester City (@ManCity) May 3, 2022 The Belgium midfielder added: “I think we are in a very good way. Obviously the fact that we’ve not won it yet, I think that will probably be the only criticism we can get. “I think for the rest, we’ve been there loads of times, and we’ve been always fighting to win this competition. So the consistency we have as a club has been amazing, I think pretty much as good as anybody else. But we just need to try to get over the line, and tomorrow is another step.” In 2015/16, Real Madrid knocked City out in the last four.De Bruyne, who was in his first season with City at that point, said: “I’m thinking we’re in better shape now. “I think I remember when we played that game, we didn’t have the greatest of end of seasons, and Madrid was the powerhouse at the time. I know we lost 1-0 in the end with an own-goal but I think it was a pretty boring game if I remember correctly. “I think we’re in a different shape right now, I think we’re better set up as a team, we play better and I think we have more experience in this stage, so hopefully we’ll be better prepared.” City beat Carlo Ancelotti’s men 4-3 in the first leg after an enthralling encounter at the Etihad last week.

238,https://www.football365.com/news/top-ten-most-creative-players-premier-league-grealish-salah,Top ten most creative players in the Premier League,"Manchester City and Liverpool players dominate the top five, with Jack Grealish top despite his headline statistics being poor. We’re not counting the assist-makers because that relies on the chances being taken and we’re not counting the key passes because that is also pretty narrow; we are all about the SCA (Shot creating actions), defined as ‘the two offensive actions directly leading to a shot, such as passes, dribbles and drawing fouls’ byFBRef. We have taken out those who have played just a few minutes or games. These are the season leaders per 90. 10) Pascal Gross (4.14 SCA per 90)A first Premier League assist since August came in last weekend’s defeat to Newcastle United, but that says as much about Brighton’s misfiring forwards as it does about the German, whose set-piece prowess is up there among the best in the Premier League.  9) Bukayo Saka (4.24 SCA per 90)Tops this very specific list.Six of his goals and three of his assists have come since the start of December in a 10-game run of eight wins, one draw and a harsh defeat to Manchester City. He is really rather good.  8) Hakim Ziyech (4.32 SCA per 90)His creativity is actually way down on last season and yet he still sits second on a creative Chelsea list this season.He was sorely missed in the Carabao Cup final after scoring in his last three Premier League appearances.  7) Martin Odegaard (4.49 SCA per 90)Logged a ludicrous eight SCAs from open play v Watford on Sunday and two of those led to goals. This Arsenal side really is astonishingly good when in full flow, with Odegaard (23) the oldest of four players who have scored five Premier League goals.  6) Bruno Fernandes (4.52 SCA per 90) No Premier League player has produced as many SCAs through an open-play pass this season as Fernandes, who has somehow been at his most creative in defeats to Aston Villa and Leicester under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He’s probably the only Manchester United player who could reasonably expect to step up from the club.  5) Mohamed Salah (4.54 SCA per 90)He takes an awful lot of shots and rather a lot of those shots lead to other shots, but he also creates chances (for himself and others) with passes and dribbles. He has enjoyed a simply brilliant season with 19 goals and 10 assists.   4) Callum Hudson-Odoi (4.77 SCA per 90)Another currently injured Chelsea player missed in that Carabao Cup final defeat, though his critics would point to a Premier League season with only three goal contributions. His critics probably include his manager.  3) Trent Alexander-Arnold (5.02 SCA per 90)Nobody has more assists in the Premier League this season. Nobody has created more chances in the Premier League this season. He remains one of Liverpool’s most potent attacking threats, particularly with his set-piece delivery. Measured on this particular metric (SCA), he has never had a better Premier League season.  2) Kevin De Bruyne (5.23 SCA per 90)An astonishing 30 players have been credited with more Premier League assists than De Bruyne (3) this season but that simply proves that assists are no real measure. Against Manchester United on Sunday, he was simply phenomenal.  1) Jack Grealish (5.38 SCA per 90)Everybody at Manchester City keeps telling us to ignore the headline statistics of two goals and two assists and this is why. The glory belonged to De Bruyne after the derby but Grealish was credited with nine SCAs, illustrating the wisdom of overloading the left side of City’s attack. ",positive
239,https://www.football365.com/news/premier-league-winners-losers-man-city-liverpool-de-bruyne-werner,Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool,"There was no real winner from the Etihad, though Kevin De Bruyne was brilliant. As was Timo Werner on Saturday. Winners Timo WernerAn unwanted hat-trick and a welcome double. Werner contrived to hit both posts and the bar. He also managed to score twice in Chelsea’s 6-0 rout of Southampton, which trebled his tally of league goals for the season. As they have all come against Southampton, he seems a specialist in this fixture, if all too few others. But if Saturday showcased one of his weaknesses, with his profligacy, it also illustrated his strengths: the pace to exploit high defensive lines and the persistence to get in scoring positions. Perhaps it is too late for him to alter the direction of his Chelsea career, to become the prolific scorer he was for RB Leipzig. Yet he suffered when Romelu Lukaku was starting and, with Kai Havertz now the pivotal figure in the forward line, Thomas Tuchel reunited last season’s Champions League final starters, with Mason Mount and Werner completing the attacking trio. They proved a devastating combination. It gives him reasons to pick them together again, whether with Werner as the striker or Havertz as a false nine.  Fabian Delph Delph’s last three starts at Goodison Park came in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Everton have an unfortunate habit of signing injury-prone players and he can seem a case in point. And yet, if it is easy to call him an example of what is wrong at Goodison, he instead provided much of what was right on Saturday. Everton were callow in defeat to Burnley. A fit-again Delph brought an immediate sense of authority: streetwise and tough, he helped make them look readier for the fight. Ben Godfrey looked a better centre-back with Delph ahead of him. Everton, who had to used defender Mason Holgate as an ersatz anchorman at Burnley, instead had two defensive midfielders, with Allan used in more of an advanced role, and proved harder to break down. Manchester United were beaten in part because of a former Manchester City player. As Delph had also impressed on his previous outing at Goodison, against Tottenham in November, Everton’s chances of survival depend in part on keeping him fit. Which, given his past injury problems, may be a cause for concern.  Tottenham’s new front threeThe 2022 charts are dominated by Tottenham. Heung-Min Son’s hat-trick at Aston Villa made him the division’s top scorer in the calendar year, just ahead of Harry Kane. Yet a potent trio have been completed by the arrival of Dejan Kulusevski. In Spurs’ last nine games, they have scored 28 goals. The Swede has scored three and assisted six of those. If it still makes him less prolific than his sidekicks, he has dovetailed well with them, doubling up as winger and penalty-box player, looking a marked upgrade on Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn and offering an endorsement of managing director of football Fabio Paratici. Even if his recruitment policy consists of raiding his old club Juventus, Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur show the wisdom of that policy. Kulusevski has both reduced the reliance on Kane to score while freeing him up to create. It is remarkable Spurs have nine goals in two games without Kane getting any of them. Son’s golden run, with six goals in three games, has not merely given Spurs a firm grip on fourth place: he has ensured the Golden Boot is not a coronation for Mohamed Salah, as it long looked, but a competition where the South Korean has the momentum.  Enock MwepuAfter a stunning goal at Anfield came a match-winning assist and goal, a crisp, classy volley, at the Emirates Stadium. Mwepu has been a bit-part player at times this season, but maybe the Zambian is shaping up as Brighton’s resident big-game player. Certainly he ended their slide, displaying an ability to get into the final third and the quality to pose problems there, showing the blend of the physical and the technical to suggest he has a high ceiling. The sense is that Albion may have a midfield makeover in the summer, potentially with Yves Bissouma leaving. Like Moises Caicedo, who made an auspicious Premier League debut in victory over Arsenal, Mwepu is a sign Brighton have got their future planning right.  Leeds, finally keeping a clean sheet Leeds had conceded 53 goals since their last clean sheets. The vast majority, of course, were under Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch had begun to improve their defensive record. But a shutout at Watford was a reward for more conventional tactics, for abandoning man-marking and populating the area in front of the back four – which was often vacated as markers were dragged everywhere – with defensive midfielders.  Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel JesusSome of Pep Guardiola’s surprise selections against Liverpool have backfired in the past: Aymeric Laporte has played left-back and Ilkay Gundogan on the right wing at Anfield, neither with conspicuous success. A manager who jokes he overthinks decisions confounded many a prediction by picking Gabriel Jesus on Sunday, The least prolific of his forwards duly scored in style, set up a glorious chance for Raheem Sterling and played terrifically well. Albeit not as well as De Bruyne, simply because no one else on the Etihad Stadium pitch did. Liverpool have been remarkably frugal in 2022 but De Bruyne specialised in defence-splitting passes, opening them up at will. Mohamed Salah is very likely to win the individual awards for the season, and deservedly so, but when De Bruyne plays like this, he feels the best player in the division. Read 16 Conclusions on a phenomenal game.  Sadio ManeA 30th birthday to remember; should Liverpool overhaul Manchester City by the narrowest of margins, his equaliser will assume a still greater importance. But after a brilliant performance by Luis Diaz on the left wing against Benfica, this was a reminder the man who has occupied the position for most of the last five years is arguably still more devastating. And, after Senegal triumphed at Egypt’s expense in the Africa Cup of Nations final and then in World Cup qualifying, Mohamed Salah’s wonderful pass to him felt particularly generous.  Bruno Guimaraes A January signing secured Newcastle victory and, in all probability, another season in the Premier League on Friday. Yet well-taken as Chris Wood’s penalty was, and while he won it himself, he was not the game’s classiest player. Guimaraes was. Eddie Howe took a gradual approach to integrating his biggest buy, leaving the Brazilian on the bench when Jonjo Shelvey, Joelinton and Joe Willock formed an effective trio. But Guimaraes scored a glorious goal at Southampton and, even in defeat at Everton, looked a player of far greater pedigree. He was the best player on the pitch against Wolves. Newcastle’s five January arrivals can be divided into two categories: the pragmatic recruits who did a short-term task, in Dan Burn, Matt Targett and Wood, and those with the ability to play for teams far higher up the league, in Kieran Trippier and Guimaraes. And given the difference in their ages, the midfielder is likely to be in the team for far longer than any of his sidekicks in the new regime’s first batch of signings.  Brentford, staying upIt is getting to the point where Thomas Frank’s team could be mathematically safe. To have 36 points, 12 more than Burnley, feels a still greater feat when Norwich and Watford, who finished above them in the Championship last season, look set for a swift return to the Championship.  Losers Arsenal, having a horrible week Mikel Arteta’s reign has veered between highs and lows, between terrific and terrible form, so it would be an exaggeration to say this has been the worst week of his time in charge. But it has been awful nonetheless, Arsenal’s own two defeats compounded by two huge Tottenham wins that brought a sizeable swing in goal difference towards their neighbours. The Gunners were awful against Crystal Palace on Monday and not much better against Brighton. As Albion had a solitary point (against Norwich, too) from their previous seven games, arguably losing to Graham Potter’s team was the worse result. The damage was not limited to the shift in the standings, as Arsenal went from favourites to outsiders for fourth place: the loss of the injured Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey on Monday means they now look short-staffed. They need two Granit Xhakas: when he started at left-back on Saturday, they missed him in midfield. And when Gabriel Martinelli spent the second half as an ersatz left-back, it underlined that a January spent slimming the squad and a policy of only having about 12 players they could trust were risky. Arsenal could do with Ainsley Maitland-Niles now.   Manchester United (as usual)Even Burnley had beaten Everton. As Everton had lost 17 of their previous 22 league games, virtually everyone defeated them; indeed, on many occasions, Everton beat themselves. But then along came United. If their bid – and that feels an overly generous way of describing it – for a Champions League spot ended at Goodison Park, it did so in entirely predictable manner: with a team that was less than the sum of its expensive parts, with a goal that involved Harry Maguire, albeit unfortunately, without any great semblance of a plan and with precious little of Ralf Rangnick’s beloved gegenpressing. It ended with Juan Mata on a Premier League pitch for the first time in 11 months: it underlines United’s capacity to waste money that they extended his contract and then did not use him until the 64th minute of their 31st league game. Most teams who lose do care and do try, but it was harder to make that argument about United. Meanwhile, David de Gea, in describing defeat at Goodison Park as a “disgrace”, is heading for the double as both the player and the pundit of their sorry season.   Sean DycheSometimes words can come back to bite you, especially when they seem to be delivered from a position of smugness. “I said to the lads that this lot don’t know how to win a game,” said Dyche on Wednesday and if the contents of his half-time team talk galvanised his side to beat Everton, he repeated them with relish in public. If they were an attempt to influence the rest of Everton’s season, it backfired: Frank Lampard’s side beat Manchester United and Burnley, who might have envisaged ending the weekend out of the relegation zone, instead lost to Norwich, the worst team in the league. Burnley only have four victories this season. In three games against Norwich and Watford, they have not even scored. Perhaps they don’t know how to win a game.  Watford, struggling at home The last time Watford avoided defeat at Vicarage Road, the opposing manager was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Since that 4-1 win, the Hornets have lost nine in a row at home. And if that partly reflects a fixture list that has included Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal, it is notable that 2022 defeats include Norwich, Brighton, Crystal Palace and now Leeds. In theory, Watford had winnable home games in the run-in – with Brentford, Burnley, Everton and Leicester set to visit Vicarage Road – but that kind of record prompts the question if they are capable of winning any of them.  Southampton, getting their annual thrashingAt least it wasn’t 9-0. Although, but for some fine saves from Fraser Forster, Timo Werner’s capacity to hit the woodwork or Chelsea easing off in the final half-hour, it might have been. Part of the curiosities of Ralph Hasenhuttl’s reign is that Southampton can both beat the top teams and get destroyed by them. When the wheels come off, they do in spectacular style. Maybe it reflects the high-risk nature of high pressing and high defensive lines: lacking the required intensity, far too open, Southampton were easy to play against on Saturday. Errors contributed, too: Mohammed Salisu was glaringly culpable for the fourth goal, just as James Ward-Prowse had been for the third. At least the 9-0s both had the mitigating factor of an early red card. This time, Southampton were hammered with a full complement of players.  Aston Villa, against the top teams Steven Gerrard has not been quiet about Aston Villa’s ambitions. To be one of the better teams in the division, it helps to beat them. Instead, Villa have a solitary win against top-eight opponents this season and that, 1-0 at Old Trafford, came under Dean Smith. They have four points against Manchester United but are pointless against the top six. That they had 19 shots, eight of them on target and many in the first half, against Tottenham, showed they could compete in some respects, but they lost 4-0. But for Hugo Lloris’ brilliance, Villa may well have led at the break. Under Steven Gerrard, they have competed against some of their superiors. But a return of no points out of 33 against the top six is terrible.  Wolves’ slow startersWolves were beaten by a second-half goal at St James’ Park but the seeds of their undoing were sowed before then. They had no touches in the Newcastle box in the first half and, as the statistic shows, no great intent in a poor, pointless opening period. Nor was it a one-off: they had been oddly positive from the start, scoring two before the break against Aston Villa and Leeds and three before Watford. Until then, however, they had a mere 10 first-half goals all season. They only have 67 in four seasons in the Premier League. Sometimes, under both Nuno Espirito Santo and Bruno Lage, they have seemed capable of starting slowly, easing their way into a game and then adding more attacking incision later. At others, especially last season, it seemed a self-defeating dullness that sets the tone for mediocrity. On Friday, that initial impotence allowed Newcastle to assume the initiative.  West Ham, losing to Brentford and losing defenders If a derby defeat felt definitive proof they will not get a top-four finish, the loss of the injured Kurt Zouma meant a defence already without the injured Angelo Ogbonna and the suspended Aaron Cresswell could be without a third key man for the Europa League quarter-final with Lyon.

For Sky Sports’ benefit as much as anyone, this is the title decider. City and Liverpool will win all of their remaining seven games against no-hopers. Goodbye logic, hello narrative: it’s winner takes all on Sunday. After a 2-2 draw at Anfield in October, with both teams on course for the Champions League semi-finals and set to face each other in the FA Cup semi-final a week later, the single-point lead Manchester City hold over Liverpool in the Premier League represents the only means of separating these two wonderful football teams. Liverpool haven’t won at the Etihad in the Premier League since January 2018, and given this isthe title decider, but also because they still have Manchester United and Tottenham to play, while City have just West Ham to face from the top half of the table, Liverpool need to go for it. But they both will. They always do; it’s unlikely to disappoint.  Manager to watch – Frank Lampard We’re essentially watching to see if Lampard has a crisis against Manchester United, which feels wrong. He’s lost seven of his nine Premier League games in charge of Everton, and even if you include the FA Cup wins over Brentford and Boreham Wood, he’s got the worst points per game ratio (1.00) of any Everton manager this century. Rafa Benitez must be chortling. He’s blamed his players. He’s blamed misfortune; as was the case when he was at Chelsea, he’s blamed most things other than himself. The general consensus until now has been that Everton are ‘too good to go down’, but that’s an opinion based on the quality of the players, not the manager. Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford are all Premier League players, but when you offset their ability with the inability of the man leading them, Everton Football Club is not too good to go down. Lampard and his players need the Goodison Park crowd behind them on Saturday and an early goal will get those United player turning on each other. It always does. That’s got to be the gameplan: attack early and get the other team crumbling before they do. Team to watch – Arsenal Mikel Arteta’s side were truly terrible against Crystal Palace–he admitted as much. The defeat in itself wasn’t too damaging, it was the manner of it that will have worried the Arsenal manager this week. They’re level on points with Tottenham, but that’s a Tottenham very much in form and likely confident in their ability to pip their rivals to the last Champions League qualification spot. With the north London derby to come and a tougher run-in than Spurs, Saturday looks like a must-win. A home fixture against Brighton is about as comfortable a game as it’s possible to get at this point. Graham Potter’s side are safe and have been playing like it for a while. The point from their 0-0 draw with Norwich last weekend was their first in seven games. A win and a return to free-flowing attacking football against the Seagulls, and then Southampton, will be just the tonic ahead of Chelsea and Manchester United.   Player to watch – Maxwel Cornet The £13.5m summer signing scored his seventh goal and claimed his first assist of the Premier League season in the massive win over Everton on Wednesday. He didn’t sign to play in the Championship, he signed to play attritional, unattractive football in the Premier League, and another goal or two against Norwich would put them in the driving seat to keep the dour dream alive. Assuming Ralf Rangnick uses the same ‘lads, it’s Everton’ type team talk as Sean Dyche said he did on Wednesday, Everton won’t get anything from their Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Manchester United. So come Sunday evening, Burnley can climb out of the bottom three for the first time since alphabetical order wasn’t the defining factor in league position.   EFL game to watch – AFC Wimbledon v Milton Keynes Dons A grudge match, for obvious reasons. Milton Keynes Dons are gunning for automatic promotion to the Championship, while AFC Wimbledon are four points from safety in the relegation zone. MK Dons currently hold the second automatic promotion spot, but Rotherham are just two points behind with two games in hand. There will be even more needle than usual in this one.  European game to watch – Napoli v Fiorentina Napoli are one point behind AC Milan in the race for the Serie A title, while Fiorentina are two points off a Europa Conference League place and four points off a Europa League place. Serie A is a great league in general this season. Inter Milan and Juventus both also still have a chance at the title, while former Chelsea managers battle at Roma and Lazio just below them.

241,https://www.football365.com/news/benfica-1-3-liverpool-reds-take-control-of-quarter-final,Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds take control of quarter-final…,"Luis Diaz scored a vital third goal for Liverpool late on as they beat Benfica 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Liverpool were in the ascendency at the break thanks to goals from Ibrahima Konate and Sadio Mane. Konate made a mistake at the start of the second half, though. He failed to clear and this allowed Darwin Nunez to score for Benfica. Diaz spared the defender’s blushes in the 87th minute as he restored Liverpool’s two-goal advantage. Liverpool show biggest PL improvement; Everton slump furthest It was a goal which significantly changed the game for a long period, as Benfica suddenly looked the better side with Liverpool completely out of sorts, but Diaz had the final word to make the return look slightly more comfortable than it had done. Victory saw Liverpool, who had lost on their last three visits here, equal a club record of five successive away victories in Europe. The omens had not been great for Benfica, third in Portugal’s Primeira Liga 15 points behind leaders Porto – whom Liverpool had hammered 5-1 and 2-0 in the group stages this season. Of the six changes Klopp made, the best one was bringing right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in after almost three weeks out with a hamstring injury. His pass for Diaz to head into Mane’s path for the second goal was a thing of wonder, while the one he delivered for a strangely off-colour Mohamed Salah to race onto but shoot straight at goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos was almost as good. It was the first time Klopp had started the midfield trio of Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita, with the latter impressing in attacking areas. In the opening 45 minutes the midfielder almost operated as a fourth forward, joining the attack to have four shots of his own before the break to underline the visitors’ dominance. That they only had a two-goal lead to their name was nothing short of criminal considering the opportunities which fell to Keita, Diaz, Salah – three times – and Alexander-Arnold. Konate eventually made the crucial 17th-minute breakthrough when Diaz won a corner which Andy Robertson swung to the far post, where the defender easily out-jumped Everton to beat the goalkeeper with a downward header. But better was still to come as Alexander-Arnold’s crossfield ball was laid on a plate for Diaz to nod into Mane’s path and the Senegal international could not miss from close range, going past Steven Gerrard’s total of 22 Champions League goals. Half-time brought another club record as Liverpool went 19 matches without conceding a first-half goal, although they had barely been troubled with Everton coming closest with a shot into the side-netting. Four minutes into the second half that all changed after Konate’s calamity trying to deal with Rafa Silva’s low cross. The goal altered the mood in the stadium and the momentum on the pitch and Klopp’s triple change of Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Jordan Henderson for Mane, Salah and Thiago attempted to restore control. Further Konate misjudgements caused more problems with Alisson Becker first having to parry Everton’s low shot and then, after the defender went chasing a ball he could never win, Nunez had a penalty claim rejected after tumbling under Virgil Van Dijk’s challenge. The pressure seemed to be getting to even the best, with Van Dijk’s air-kick in the centre-circle a brief moment of concern while Alisson also duffed a couple of clearances. But just when it looked like frustration would get the better of them, Keita’s perfect through-ball allowed Diaz to round the goalkeeper and slot home an angled shot. On the last two occasions the teams met in the quarter-finals of this competition, in 1978 and 1984, Liverpool went on to lift the trophy and Diaz’s goal put them well on their way to the last four this time.

242,https://www.football365.com/news/guardiola-relishing-marvellous-title-challenge-downplays-haaland,"Guardiola relishing ‘marvellous’ title challenge, downplays Haaland rumours","Pep Guardiola refused to be drawn on renewed speculation linking Man City with a summer move for Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. Haaland is expected to leave Dortmund in the summer and City are reportedly in pole position to sign the Norwegian international. The Mailbox reacts to the Champions League draw… “Since I’m here, every month we are going to sign 50 players,” Guardiola said (via Manchester Evening News). “Right now, it’s impossible I’m going to talk about some guys who aren’t here. Haaland is a Dortmund player.” “You can ask for this player or another one. The transfer window is going to start and many things will happen. “Maybe I speak about this club needs a striker for the next 5, 6, 7 years maybe once in 12 months. I’m not going to be the guy with the success because we didn’t have a striker. “It’s important that if you play good, seven or eight players arrive in the box. This is the best way.” Liverpool are now one point behind the Citizens in the Premier League, but the Spanish manager insists he is relishing the “marvellous” challenge Jurgen Klopp’s side pose to his team. He said (via Manchester Evening News): “It is what it is. In 14, 15 days, we will come back after the international break, then nine games. “Everyone knows what we do. It is a marvellous challenge. We try to do it.” On if Liverpool or City can win a treble this season, Guardiola responded: “If United did it, another team can do it. To break a record is because someone has done it. “When it happens, I think it will. It’s not easy, but you can do it. In September, October it’s more difficult. Two months left, yeah it can be done. But it happened once in a lifetime.”  City may be chasing glory in the Premier League and the Champions League but Guardiola has no concerns that intensity might drop for Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final at Southampton. He said: “How do you ask me when these six years we play every game like it’s the last game of our lives. “I know how difficult it will be away at Southampton. I’m sorry, I trust a lot my team, my players. I know it looks like everything is gone but I trust a lot my players to arrive in every competition who we are. “Like at Southampton, Crystal Palace. I want to do it with these players, I wouldn’t change one single player for the next two months.” With Liverpool getting back into the title race, Guardiola was asked if he has learned any lessons about his team over the last month. The former Barcelona boss responded: “Not much. I know my team quite well after six years. If we win or lose, I don’t learn. The good points we have, the weak points to improve. “From the emotion inside, second half at Palace we were anxious we wouldn’t win and play like we don’t play. At Goodison Park, how we celebrate the goals against United I know the desire in the team “I try to tell them, it’s not possible to control the emotion sometimes, they are human beings. Sometimes it’s difficult. Against United, I said be calm, they want to punish on the counter, so be calm. I got messages about the derby, no, be calm. Otherwise we are not good.” Guardiola added: “In the Premier League we are winning. Right now, the destiny is in our hands. “We are closer for games in the FA Cup, I don’t count the competitions. I know how difficult it will be at Southampton. Prepare to travel good, play well, and enjoy.” ",positive
243,https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-why-quarter-finalists-will-wont-win-it-liverpool-chelsea-man-city,Why the last eight will all win the CL (and why they won’t),"Will Simeone prompt Pep to overthink? Can Benzema fire Real to no.14? Anything – well, almost anything – is possible in the last eight. Here are some reasons why anyone can win the Champions League, and why everyone won’t… LiverpoolWhy they’ll win it: Because the Champions League comes as part of the Quadruple, which at this stage feels sodding inevitable to anyone not a Liverpool fan… Liverpool are currently second favourites to win their seventh European Cup, but the Reds know better than Manchester City how to win since the majority of this squad triumphed in Madrid three years ago. And they are now a better team than the one Jurgen Klopp inspired to glory in 2019. In addition to being bloody good, and Mo Salah doing Mo Salah stuff, Liverpool have perhaps the kindest draw they could have hoped for in the quarter-finals. Though Klopp will insist otherwise, Benfica will hold no fear for the Reds, even if a potential semi-final against Bayern Munich looks more daunting. That said, the Bavarians were brushed aside by Klopp’s men in the last 16 on their way to number six.  Why they won’t:The likes of Bayern and Real can only hope that Liverpool are distracted by their domestic duties, with a Premier League title fight occupying much of Klopp’s headspace and the squad’s energy. What a ‘disadvantage’ that truly is. Liverpool have swerved major injuries so far this season, but Trent Alexander-Arnold’s hamstring issue has been blamed on the Reds’ workload. Might it catch up with a few more players between now and the end of the season? That, to be honest, is perhaps their rivals’ best hope.

City are favourites and understandably so, though that was before a draw that pitted them against Atletico Madrid in the quarters and potentially either Chelsea or Real Madrid in the semis. It’s not the kindest, but City should fear no-one. Perhaps except themselves.  Why they won’t:Manchester United fell hook, line and sinker for Atletico’s sh*t and though City are infinitely more intelligent than their local rivals, the thought of facing Diego Simeone feels like the kind of prospect that could prompt Pep Guardiola to start overthinking. As may be the fact that the meetings with Atletico come either side of the Premier League meeting with Liverpool that may well determine the destiny of the Premier League title. Even if City navigate their way through Atletico’s traps, then come Chelsea and Thomas Tuchel, who made a habit of beating City in his first few months as Chelsea manager, including in last season’s final. Guardiola and his side have got the better of Chelsea twice this season but it would be very City to lose when it really mattered in the semi. CL draw: Chelsea, Man City face Madrid sides; Liverpool take on Benfica  ChelseaWhy they’ll win it: Because football is weird. Given all the chaos at Chelsea right now, the Champions League should be way down the list of the club’s priorities. But playing football matches seems to offer the players and coaching staff some blessed relief from the sh*tshow around them and it wouldn’t be a complete shock if the restrictions upon them have created a siege mentality in the dressing room. And, of course, they know better than anyone else left in the competition that they can win it since they did exactly that last season. On their day, Tuchel’s Chelsea can be a match for any of the sides left in the last eight. Tuchel himself seems to have a hold on Real Madrid, with the German coach never having lost to the Spanish giants in six meetings.  Why they won’t:Hoping for kind draws based more on the Inter Rail map than anything to do with form or pedigree is hardly ideal. With five ties left before the trophy is lifted, the prospect of none being played in front of their own supporters leaves a feeling that Chelsea’s current predicament will catch up with them at some point, especially if they have to face Real Madrid and Manchester City before they even contemplate a Megabus to Paris for the final. On the pitch, most people would agree with the bookies’ view that three teams look stronger; Real might take issue with them being pitted as fifth favourites behind the Blues – we’ll find out in the quarter-finals if the Spaniards have been harshly judged. To come from the middle of the field, amid their current handicaps, is a huge ask. 5 – Chelsea are unbeaten in their five encounters with Real Madrid in all competitions (W3 D2); indeed no side have ever faced the Spanish giants more often in European competitions without losing. Authority. pic.twitter.com/07EVYdmEbA — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 18, 2022   Bayern MunichWhy they’ll win it: Because they are a winning machine. And you could argue that their knockout draws have been kinder than that of the group stage. Still, Bayern won six out of six from a group consisting of Barcelona, Benfica and Dynamo Kyiv, and though Salzburg gave them a minor scare in Austria, the Bavarians blew them away 7-1 in the second leg. Such firepower could take Bayern all the way. Champions League top scorer Robert Lewandowski is still producing silly numbers while Thomas Muller continues to be a creative genius, especially domestically. In Europe, Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman are pulling their weight, too, with six and three assists respectively. Liverpool in the semi-final promises to be a mouth-watering tie, but not one either side will be fearful of.  Why they won’t: As hard to stop as their attack may be, Bayern are not rock solid at the back. In the Bundesliga, Bayern have conceded 28 goals at a rate of just over one per match. Across Europe’s top five leagues, 15 teams have a better defensive record. Of their their seven rivals in the Champions League last eight, only Atletico have conceded more domestic league goals. It is something for Salah and co to explore ahead of a possible semi-final, provided both reach the final four. But Bayern’s defensive frailties have yet to be exposed in Europe. No-one has conceded fewer goals in this season’s Champions League and Bayern have the lowest xGA. So there’s that.   Real MadridWhy they’ll win it: Because this is their competition. Real have won it almost twice as often as any other club – a 14th crown would put them level with every English team combined. Regardless of their pedigree, Real appear more unfancied than perhaps they ought to be. As fifth favourites in an eight-team field, no-one would have relished drawing Carlo Ancelotti’s men, who showed their character and quality to put PSG back in their box last week. With a seemingly unassailable advantage domestically, the La Liga champions-elect will be able to rotate players at home and focus all their energy into a trophy they know better than anyone else how to win. And Karim Benzema is on a mission to prove that Real don’t need two new strikers next summer, with only Lewandowski having scored more goals in Europe’s top five leagues this season, in addition to 11 assists.  Why they won’t: It’s fortunate for Real that Benzema is on fire because they don’t look watertight at the back. No-one has conceded fewer goals in this season’s Champions League, with Ancelotti’s defence breached five times, the same number as Chelsea and Bayern Munich. But their xGA of 9.3 suggests they have ridden their luck. Of the sides to make the last 16, eight have a lower xGA. It’s a similar story in La Liga. Against the kind of attacks they will face in the last eight and perhaps beyond, such defensive frailties will be more ruthlessly exploited. The flip side of being able to rotate is what momentum Real may sacrifice by resting players around their Champions League matches.  BenficaWhy they’ll win it: They won’t. Getting to the last eight is an achievement in itself for the third-best team in Portugal right now. They smashed-and-grabbed their way to victory over Ajax to get this far – “Benfica did nothing except for one free-kick… unbelievable,” said Dusan Tadic – but that is not sustainable through the quarters, semi and into the final.  Why they won’t:Feels like we sort of covered that, but OK. Despite reaching the last eight, even with £67million-rated Darwen Nunez, Benfica are joint 14th for goals scored in this season’s competition having conceded 11 – one more than they’ve netted themselves. They are 22nd for attempts on goal and 28th for average possession. 🗣️ Luisão: ""It's a difficult draw, but I remember that in 2006 we faced Liverpool and went through.""@slbenfica_en | #UCLdraw pic.twitter.com/E7qc5gWJdV — UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) March 18, 2022   VillarrealWhy they’ll win it: Unai Emery. The fella is a magician when it comes to the Europa League and the ex-Arsenal boss wants to “enjoy the Champions League,” which sounds ominous coming from a manager with his competition pedigree. Why they won’t: Emery said that Villarreal knocked out one of the “favourites”, which is an overly-positive take on Juventus at the moment. The Old Lady has had a miserable season and, creditable (and hilarious) though their win in Turin was, Villarreal progressed arguably through the weakest last-16 clash. Bayern Munich await in the next round, which is surely as far as they will go, and all credit to them for it.  Atletico MadridWhy they’ll win it:Because we’re telling Diego Simeone that he can’t. So he will. And he has plenty of time to devote to picking out what few weaknesses Manchester City may have to prey and prod at each one in the quarter-finals. Atletico have little else to play for this season, with Guardiola now Simeone’s main focus.  Why they won’t: To say they have little else to play for is not strictly true. Unless they do win the Champions League, they have to finish in the top four in La Liga to be back there next season. They are currently fourth with a two-point cushion between themselves and Real Betis below them. As much as they enjoyed reaching the last eight, putting one over on Manchester United is hardly the benchmark these days. Everyone seems to be at it. City won’t be patsies in anything like the same way and though Simeone is certain to cause Guardiola a sleepless night or two before their last-eight meeting, the Premier League leaders will likely be too good for Atletico. And if they aren’t, Chelsea or Real Madrid await in the semis. Sh*thouse your way through that, Diego. ",positive

Man Utd go into this game in terrible form. They have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions. Their only win in this stretch came against bottom-placed Norwich City. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as they won 3-2. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope Ralf Rangnick’s side drew against Chelsea last time out. After Arsenal and Tottenham won on Sunday, United are eight points adrift of the top four. Brentford meanwhile have fared well after being promoted to the Premier League. They sit on 40 points after 34 games and they are eight points clear of the bottom three. The Bees were beaten 3-1 by Man Utd when the sides met earlier this season. Merson thinks they will draw 2-2 at Old Trafford: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game. They’ll have a go at Manchester United and I think they’ll cause them a few problems this weekend.” Elsewhere, Man Utd are reportedly interested in Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez and are looking to include Anthony Martial in a swap deal for the striker. The Argentine has been terrific for the Nerazzurri since joining from Racing Club. He has scored 69 goals in 176 appearances. According to Italian journalist Marco Barzaghi, United are keen on bringing Martinez to Old Trafford. He claimed on his Youtube channel (via the Express) that the Premier League giants have offered Martial – who is currently on loan at Sevilla – and £42m to sign Martinez. Inter have reportedly rejected the offer with incoming United boss Erik ten Hag preparing for a busy summer transfer window. Martial joined the Red Devils for a reported £54m fee and has impressed in fits and starts but has struggled to justify the transfer fee that made him the most expensive teenager in football. His loan spell at Sevilla has failed to revitalise his career having drawn a blank in all eight of his La Liga appearances. ",positive

The German defender is a free agent and it has been confirmed that he will depart Stamford Bridge this summer with Real Madrid his most likely destination. Gossip: Barca turn to Chelsea flop, Arsenal offer Pepe to PL club, Newcastle make ‘huge’ offer Chelsea are currently unable to offer any new deals to player due to the government sanctions placed upon the club as a result of Roman Abramovich’s links to Russia. They had been hopeful they would be able to convince Rudiger to stay once a takeover of the club had been completed, however, he will now depart and former Arsenal man Paul Merson believes he is irreplaceable. Writing in his Daily Star column, Merson said: “Antonio Rudiger is the one player Chelsea couldn’t afford to lose, but he clearly didn’t love the club enough to stay. “He is risking the wrath of the fans now because he is turning down a lot of money and leaving them in the lurch, but let’s be honest: it’s been on the cards for a long, long time. “I called this one months ago. I don’t think Rudiger ever had any intention of signing; not after he was frozen out by Frank Lampard. “I know plenty has changed since then. Thomas Tuchel came in, brought him back into the team, and they won the Champions League. “But I think he had already made his mind up. His contract was already running down and other clubs would already have been expressing an interest. “You don’t wait all that time, refusing to sign, losing all that money you would have got by signing on improved terms, just to turn around and stay. “It’s serious money he has turned down. He would have been the most well-paid defender in the club’s history. But he doesn’t love the club, does he? Or he’d have stayed. “And he’s an unbelievable defender. Thiago Silva helps him, but I think he helps Thiago Silva as well. They are so good together in a three. It will be interesting to see how the fans are going to be now when he plays at Stamford Bridge. I don’t see them being too happy with him. “But he is irreplaceable really. Chelsea can’t replace him. No-one has bought the club yet. They are still under sanctions. They can’t even line someone up. “Rudiger is absolutely perfect for the way they play. He goes and squeezes players. He’s full of energy. A different class. And they say he’s a leader in the dressing room.” ",positive

The Reds are one point adrift of league leaders Manchester City with five games to go. Their trip to Newcastle on Saturday is arguably the toughest of their remaining games. The Magpies have won ten of their last 14 Premier League games. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward Howe’s men have also won their last six at St James’ Park. If Liverpool win, they will be top of the table ahead of Man City’s trip to play Leeds United at Elland Road. After Liverpool beat Villarreal, Merson does not think Klopp should rotate his team this weekend: “You’ve got a team that’s won four on the trot playing against a phenomenal Liverpool side this weekend. This game will tell Newcastle how far they’ve come and how far they’ve got to go,” Merson said (quotes via Liverpool Echo). “I’d be shocked if Jurgen Klopp rotated his team this weekend. Villarreal were well out of their depth on Wednesday night and aren’t going to score three goals next week. Liverpool can even afford to lose that game, but they cannot drop points here. “Liverpool must win this game because a draw is no good. City and Liverpool are miles ahead of every other Premier League team at the moment. Newcastle have done great – don’t get me wrong – but they’ll face a different kind of opponent in Liverpool.” Ex-Liverpool player Mark Lawrenson thinks Newcastle’s style of play will “suit Klopp’s side”: “After winning four games in a row, Newcastle will be full of confidence but, if that means they are even slightly more open than usual this weekend, that will suit Jurgen Klopp’s side. I’m sure Howe’s plan will still be to make sure they are difficult to beat, but I don’t think the home fans will settle for seeing them put 11 men behind the ball for 90 minutes and just play for a point. “The problem there is that Liverpool are at a different level to any of the sides Newcastle have just beaten – the Canaries, Crystal Palace, Leicester and Wolves. Also, the way the Reds are playing makes me think they will get the result they need, no matter who is in their team. They are just in that zone.” ",positive

The players in question are Ruben Neves and James Ward-Prowse. Wolves are expecting Neves to leave this summer amid interest from the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford The Portugal international is valued at £36m by transfermarkt, while Ward-Prowse has a value of £28.8m (£64.8m combined).Both players have been in great form this season in their own right. The Gunners have fared well this term as they currently sit fourth in the Premier League. They are two points clear of their arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Despite this, Merson has argued that Arsenal are in need of a deep-lying “genuine playmaker”: “Mikel Arteta needs a player in the same mould he was to transform Arsenal next season,” Merson wrote for The Daily Star. “I think they still need a midfield player who can sit in front of the back four and pick a pass. Arteta did that beautifully. But they don’t have anyone like that any more. Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey don’t have those kind of skills; someone who’s going to get on the ball and start spraying it around. “Xhaka and Partey do a great job in there but they’re not going to take you to the next level. I don’t think they’ve got a genuine passer in the team; a genuine playmaker from deeper positions like that. And if anyone can find that type of player it should be Arteta because he’s played that position himself. “Sometimes you have to be able to hit that diagonal ball over the top. With Arsenal, everything is short, short, short. Martin Odegaard does a great job of that, playing one-twos and trying to slip players in. But you need someone with a good passing range in behind him too. Someone who keeps it simple but can hit your forwards with a long ball or two as well. “Ruben Neves does it for Wolves. James Ward-Prowse does it for Southampton. I have no idea how he’s still at Saints. It must be the sea air! Both of them take free-kicks and give you an extra dimension from set-pieces in my opinion as well.” Merson went onto suggest that Arsenal could be “set back five years” if they miss out on the top four this season: “If you don’t get into the Champions League this season, it could set you back five years. Missing out could leave you a million miles off because they just won’t be able to bring that sort of player in. “And then you start fearing how long your own players hang around for. Arsenal were not in Europe this season. They had no distractions. That’s a massive advantage and they need to make sure they have made it count by the end of the season.” ",positive
249,https://www.football365.com/news/arsenal-youngster-goal-contributions-martinelli-smith-rowe-saka,Young Guns: Arsenal whippersnappers dominate this specific list,"With Conor Gallagher now an ancient, irrelevant 22-year-old whose eight Premier League goals and three assists for Crystal Palace this season are thus quite literally worthless, there are only five players still 21 or under who have seven or more goal contributions this season. Three of them play for Arsenal. Young Guns go for it etc. Here’s that top five. 7 – Michael Olise (Crystal Palace) – 2 goals, 5 assists Actually, you could make this 23 rather than 21 and suddenly things look distinctly more Chelsea-flavoured. As well as the on-loan Gallagher you’d have Reece James (5 goals, 6 assists) and old man Mason Mount (7 goals, 5 assists). But you still wouldn’t have Olise, a rare misfire for the Chelsea machine as they released him at 14 rather than keeping him on the books to loan out to Vitesse Arnhem. Their loss is Palace’s gain, although there are already – inevitably – rumours that Chelsea would quite like to buy him back now please.  7 – Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal) – 5 goals, 2 assists We’ve put him above Olise because goals are better than assists, surely. Has to the tie-breaker, doesn’t it? And, having started the season-opening defeats to Brentford and Chelsea, when Arsenal were very, very bad, he’s only really been back as a regular since December, when Arsenal have been very, very good. We still can’t decide which north London side’s banter in the first three games of the season was more misleading. A minor caveat to his fine form since his return, though, is that two of his goals came against Leeds and really do those count as goals? Every player in the league has got two goals against Leeds this season. But, officially, apparently they do count, and that means that only three players 21 or under have contributed to more goals in the Premier League this season. Two of them are his team-mates and one is a generational talent who plays for by far the best team in the country. So he’s doing pretty well.  10 – Phil Foden (Manchester City) – 7 goals, 3 assists Just absurdly good at football, isn’t he? And still absurdly young. At some point, we really should all start getting a bit more excited about a player Sergio Aguero continues to anoint as City’s best at every opportunity, which is startlingly high praise from a man who definitely knows of what he speaks.  11 – Emile Smith Rowe (Arsenal) – 9 goals, 2 assistsNone of those came in his first five games of the season either, so his current run is nine goals and two assists in his last 16 Premier League games to go with a goal and an assist on his first England start (albeit against San Marino and thus the Leeds Caveat must also apply here). Almost like Arsenal’s season as a whole is reflected in the individual records of their most gifted youngsters. 13 – Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) – 8 goals, 5 assists If Martinelli and Smith Rowe’s trend is one of improving returns as the season progresses, then that’s even more true of Saka, Arsenal’s glorious starboy. Six of his goals and three of his assists have come since the start of December in a 10-game run of eight wins, one draw and a harsh defeat to Manchester City. Essentially what we’re saying here is that a 20-year-old is the main driving force propelling a team towards a top-four finish and the second most significant factor is a 21-year-old. That is really quite something. Interesting to see Mikel Arteta assert this weekend that missing in the Euro final shootout was good for Saka’s career. We’ve given that some thought and even if the early part of this season didn’t cast doubt on that – which it does – we’ve decided that on balance it would still very much have been better for him to score that penalty to be honest.

250,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-man-utd-transfers-sales-ronaldo-rashford-pogba,Where might all Man Utd’s players go and for how much?,"Even if they’ve had enough at Old Trafford, many Man Utd players might be disappointed to see what options they’d possibly have elsewhere… It used to be said that the only way out of Manchester United is down. Is that still true? Perhaps. Most of their current players would ceratainly struggle to move up. Here’s an idea of the type of moves that might be available to the current squad members if they are allowed to pack their bags… David De Gea Age: 31 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Going nowhere since he’s one of the few players to emerge from this sh*t-show of season with a smidgen of credit. That, and he’s on silly money that no other club would even consider matching. If they were to shift him, though, maybe Atletico cash in on Jan Oblak and take De Gea home. Destination: Atletico Madrid Price: £25m  Dean Henderson Age: 24 Contracted until: 2025plus one-year option Desperately needs to move this summer before people forget he exists. With a very small body of work to show for two years during which he has lost the battle for the gloves, Henderson is relying on someone like Newcastle still being tempted or a club like Southampton having a really long memory. Destination: Southampton Price: £15m  Ian King: Man United are drifting towards a re-build with no plans  Defenders Luke Shaw Age: 26 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Reports suggest Shaw might be one of the few players Ralf Rangnick recommends for retention. If not, a lateral move would certainly be a reasonable expectation – Spurs if they sell Sergio Reguilon? Or maybe Brendan would give United their money back and Shaw the big cuddle he’s been craving. Destination: Leicester Price: £30m  Raphael Varane Age: 28 Contracted until: 2025plus one-year option It would be lovely to know what Varane thinks of all this. And whether he fancies sticking around. United really need him to. Destination: PSG Price: £40million  Victor Lindelof Age: 27 Contracted until: 2024plus one-year option It wouldn’t be a huge shock if a half-decent European side found room for Lindelof given his versatility. Destination: Sevilla Price: £20m  Harry Maguire Age: 29 Contracted until:2025plus one-year option Sheesh. In his current form, who would bother? We all know there is a top-class defender in Maguire but his reputation is in pieces and there’s only so long that can continue without his prospects disappearing around the U-bend. Would need a side who don’t mind relying on a deeper defence. Destination: West Ham Price: £35-40m  Aaron Wan-Bissaka Age: 24 Contracted until: 2024plus one-year option Dearie me. Signed for an initial £45million in 2019, and now they might be lucky to get a third of that back for a full-back so obviously petrified of crossing the halfway line. Can picture him going ‘home’. Destination: Crystal Palace Price: £15m  Diogo Dalot Age: 22 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Had a good run initially under Rangnick but the interim manager seems to have reached a similar conclusion as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Watch him go to Dortmund and fulfil the potential Jose Mourinho always thought he had. Destination: Borussia Dortmund Price: £15m  Alex Telles Age: 29 Contracted until: 2024plus one-year option Has shown enough glimpses to earn a return to Europe and United aren’t likely to keep both him and Shaw beyond the summer. Destination: Inter Milan Price: £15m  Eric Bailly Age: 27 Contracted until: 2024plus one-year option Said to be irked by Maguire’s continued presence in the XI but Suicide Eric is hardly whining from a position of strength. Can’t be relied upon for form or fitness. But someone will take a punt on him, if only for sh*ts and giggles… Destination: Barcelona Price: £10m  Phil Jones Age: 30 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Sean Dyche would make Philip Anthony Jones feel like a footballer again. Destination: Burnley Price:£5m  Midfielders Fred Age: 29 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Jose has done it once, he might do it again… Destination: Roma Price: £20m  Scott McTominay Age: 25 Contracted until:2025plus one-year option McTominay is one of the very few players you might put good money on being at United next season. If not, based on nothing at all, it feels like he’d do a decent job in Arsenal’s engine room and they’ll certainly need a midfielder. Destination: Arsenal Price: £30m  Nemanja Matic Age: 33 Contracted until: 2023 Will be 34 by the start of next season and he’s been slowing down for a year or two already. Apparently a good character to have around and Christ knows United are short of them, but a parting seems inevitable. Destination: MLS Price: £5m  Paul Pogba Age: 28 Contracted until: 2022 Pogba has been trying to get away from United for almost four years and this summer he’ll finally get his wish. Where he goes depends on who can meet his wage demands while putting up with his and Mino’s sh*t. Destination: Juventus Price: free  Bruno Fernandes Age: 27 Contracted until: 2025plus one-year option Fernandes is one of the few players still under contract who would attract interest from the top clubs. United would be mad to sell. But, United… Destination: Real Madrid Price: £75m  The top 10 worst transfer mistakes of the season  Forwards Cristiano Ronaldo Age: 37 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option Fancies a season or two with Lionel Messi if United don’t finish in the top four, apparently. PSG are daft and rich enough to do it. Destination: PSG Price: £15m  Edinson Cavani Age: 35 Contracted until: 2022 The Uruguayan has already checked out and isn’t letting silly things like away matches get in the way of planning his move to either Spain or South America. Destination: River Plate Price: free  Marcus Rashford Age: 24 Contracted until: 2023plus one-year option The fact that Rashford is open to a move highlights just how bad things must have become at Old Trafford. United would be terrified of selling the child-feeder which means they almost certainly won’t. But PSG would be interested again if Kylian Mbappe is on his way. Destination: PSGPrice: £60m  Jadon Sancho Age: 21 Contracted until: 2026 plus one-year option Sorry, Jadon, but you’re going nowhere. Literally and, unless a new manager has the desired impact, metaphorically too. Destination: Bayern Munich Price: £60m  Jesse Lingard Age: 29 Contracted until: 2022 United were greedy last summer and it will cost them this year when Lingard has his pick of clubs. Hasn’t played enough football to be missed. Destination: Newcastle Price: free  Juan Mata Age: 33 Contracted until: 2022 Too lovely for this sh*t. Farewell, handsome Juan. Destination: United Nations Price: free  Anthony Elanga Age: 19 Contracted until: 2026 Certainly not the most technical player to emerge through United’s academy but, as McTominay has proved, trustworthiness will carry you a long way in a dressing room dripping with self-interest. Destination: Leeds Price: £15m   High-profile loanees Donny van de Beek Age: 24 Contracted until: 2025 plus one-year option The next manager may well want to look at van de Beek, especially if that new man is Erik ten Hag. If not, Everton seem quite happy with him. Assuming they stay up… Destination: Everton Price: £35m  Anthony Martial Age: 26 Contracted until: 2024plus one-year option There is a very real danger that Martial and United will be stuck with each other next season since Sevilla have already decided they have no intention of keeping him. Not on those wages… Destination: Newcastle Price: £20m  ",positive
251,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-manchester-city-vs-manchester-united-de-bruyne-grealish-sancho,16 Conclusions: Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United,"Manchester City and Manchester United showed us all where they are in relation to each other, and that’s not good news for United fans. 1) Derby Day. A day when form can go out of the window, and something is at stake no matter where you happen to be in the league table. A day when there is something at stake. It’s popular to reduce all of this energy and tradition down to ‘bragging rights’, but it’s about much more than that. Manchester City and Manchester United have been playing since 1881, and they’ve been pushing and pulling at each other ever since. It taps into a lengthy history and affects the present at the same time. It matters, and this makes the paucity of Manchester United’s performance at The Etihad Stadium all the more perplexing.  2) Before the game, came a swirling fog of fact and rumour. The fact was that Cristiano Ronaldo wasn’t starting for Manchester United. The official line was that he was out with a hip flexor injury. The rumour – started, very much in the style of 2022, by his sister liking a post on Instagram – was that he wasn’t injured, and that he’d been dropped by Ralf Rangnick. There’s an obvious conversation to be had concerning what difference that might make to them on the pitch, but it’s also worth asking what good this perpetual media circus ever does the actual team. It may be great, it may be slight; it seems doubtful that it can make no difference whatsoever.  3) In some respects, Manchester City and Manchester United represent two different visions of what it means to be powerful. United are the global machine, capable of summoning up a crowd, wherever they go. They have considerable talent and have spent a lot of money on players, but all of these advantages have been squandered by a senior management that values profit over silverware and a constant swirl of speculation, gossip, politicking and, ultimately, unhappiness. City have spent even more money, but have avoided becoming a soap opera. The biggest club prize of all may be beyond them, but they just get on with the job of winning football matches.  4) This difference is also accentuated in the managers themselves. Pep Guardiola has been with Manchester City for six years, and the whole club has been built around what he needs in order to make his team the best in the game. Ralf Rangnick is an interim coach until the end of the season, and no-one still has any idea who will be replacing him. And it showed.  5) If what Manchester City aspire to be is encapsulated by one player, it’s probably Kevin De Bruyne on a day like this. There’s something almost attainable about Kevin De Bruyne. He looks like one of us, rather than a shop mannequin, and there is something understated about much of his football, which could almost lead you to think ‘I could do that’. But, of course we can’t. De Bruyne is a superb athlete, geometrically extraordinary, and often plays as though he has an extra sense that goes beyond mere spatial awareness. His first goal was about playing as though in camouflage, with two forwards dragging United’s central defence out of position for Bernardo to pull the ball back for him to slide in.  6) For his second goal, De Bruyne awaited his moment in the penalty area while Manchester United floundered around him. Phil Foden found himself able to cut a diagonal whole in the United defence from the left, and when his shot was parried by De Gea, the ball pinballed around, through Harry Maguire’s legs and back for De Bruyne, who had again been patiently waiting his turn. In this moment, we saw much of the difference between these two clubs for most of the last decade.  7) But to talk of these two goals alone would be misrepresentative of a first half in which Manchester United played a full part. When they did get forward, they frequently looked dangerous. Indeed, De Bruyne’s first goal might have come after just five minutes, but City’s lead might not even have lasted for very long. Within five minutes, Fred came achingly close to bringing United level when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes’ ball and was only stopped by a diving Ederson. But their defensive frailty really rendered much of this irrelevant.  8) United’s equalising goal, scored after 28 minutes by Jadon Sancho, showed the possibilities that come with spending the amount of money they have. A beautifully weighted through-ball from Paul Pogba switched the play from right to left. Sancho picked the ball up, cut inside on the edge of the penalty area, and curled a low shot around Ederson and in. This was what United paid all that money for these two players for. But doing something like this isn’t enough when you’re defending the way that Manchester United did against a team with the attacking strength of Manchester City.    9) It says something for Jack Grealish’s season so far with Manchester City that his inclusion in the team for this game was considered worthy of comment. You’d expect that a £100m signing would, by the March following his transfer, be one of the first names on the team-sheet but, while Grealish is slowly growing into his position at Manchester City, he still doesn’t quite seem to be a natural fit. But it should also be added that he did play a significant role in overloading the left side of Manchester United’s midfield and defence.  10) The goal that effectively ended the game as a contest was brilliant in its simplicity, its intelligence and its execution. A Manchester City corner on the left-hand side had everybody jostling for position on the six-yard line as ever, only for De Bruyne to sling to ball over to the far edge of the penalty area for Riyad Mahrez to half-volley the ball into the corner of the goal. Mahrez had started his run from so deep that no-one had given any consideration to marking him; it was the sort of move that would only even be attempted by a team brimming with confidence.  11) The third Manchester City goal was deflected off Harry Maguire’s knee, a deflection which seemed to just about sum up another poor afternoon for the United defender. Maguire is rapidly becoming something of a punching bag for criticism among the United support, and while the level of vituperation is obvious off-the-scale bonkers, you can see where it comes from. The ball passing through his legs as it pinballed its way around the six-yard box for the first goal was one thing, the deflection for the second another. And he might have found himself on the wrong end of a red card just after the hour, when he clattered into De Bruyne with a tackle from which there was no realistic likelihood of him ever reaching the ball. Few would have been surprised had it been a red card.  12) At 3-1 down, Manchester United just seemed to… give up. City toyed with them for much of the last 25 minutes, occasionally scampering up the pitch and summoning up a shot, but largely happy to sit on their lead. If anything, by the time of the full-time whistle, United had offered practically nothing throughout the entirety of the second half, which speaks volumes for the chasm between the two teams. But what should probably be troubling Manchester United supporters is that United almost seemed to settle for ‘only’ losing by a two-goal margin to Manchester City. It didn’t say much for the aspirations of the current generation of Manchester United players.  13) And in the end, they couldn’t even manage that. As the clock ticked over 90 minutes, David De Gea, who had spent the match offering at least some degree of resistance to City’s attackers, mis-cued a clearance which was threaded back through to Riyad Mahrez, who thumped the ball into the top corner via the side of De Gea’s head. It was one of those goals which looks offside at first, but then after a fairly lengthy delay the goal was given. This match had already been over for a good 25 minutes, but it did offer a truer representation of the balance of play.  14) In material terms, the weekend will end with the Premier League title race very much as it was, although the margin of victory has done City something of a favour, too. They have now reduced the goal difference to one goal from Liverpool’s. With their 1-0 win against West Ham, Liverpool remain six points behind them with a game in hand and the two teams still to meet once this season. However impressive City were in this match, there’s still all to play for at the top of the table.  15) Nothing unexpected happened to Manchester United in this match. It was, really, a culmination of all the painfully evident truths that have been staring everyone in the face for years. They have an unbalanced team with little apparent will for a fight, there is a now apparently perpetual feeling of unhappiness hanging over the club, and there is no apparent plan beyond ‘please keep us in the Champions League because that’s were the serious money is’, while sucking every last dollar possible out of the brand name while it’s still worth anything. With Manchester City and Liverpool, their two biggest rivals, so far ahead of them in the Premier League, looking in on the club increasingly feels like visiting somebody else’s idea of hell.  16) But for all the criticism to be aimed at Manchester United (and their performance deserves it), Manchester City should be credited for a superb, controlled and frequently imaginative performance. They are made of Premier League title-winning material, a team for the ages; as are Liverpool. Manchester United are not, and it’s difficult to see how they can possibly close this gap. ",positive
252,https://www.football365.com/news/pep-guardiola-concerns-manchester-city-goal-record-jack-grealish-stupid,Pep airs concerns over comment from Man City ‘stupid man’ Grealish,"Pep Guardiola believes Jack Grealish would be “a stupid man” if he allowed himself to become distracted by his Manchester City goal record. Grealish, 26, has netted just four times in all competitions for City since his £100m move from Aston Villa in the summer. One of those goals came in the FA Cup on Tuesday, as City secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 2-0 win over Championship side Peterborough.After that game, Grealish said of his goal tally:“I expect more, I want to get a lot more.” 16 Conclusions: Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United Guardiola, though, is not interested in Grealish’s individual statistics, and would instead prefer that he concentrate on his overall performance for the team. “I think he’s not frustrated but if he is frustrated, he is a stupid man,” the City boss said ahead of Sunday’s clash with Manchester United. “It’s not necessary to be frustrated after scoring a goal. “You have to play good, do your best, that’s all. If you score a goal, good, if not, next game. “Statistics, statistics, ‘I’m happy I’m good if I score 10 goals and after I am 20 points behind the leader.’ What’s important is to play good, help the team to win, and be part of something that we are in all together. “Of course I want to score 20 goals but it doesn’t matter. [If you] play good, did everything, did your best, honestly after the game you go to take a shower and it’s enough.” Grealish has operated as a false nine on occasion this season, with City yet to sign an elite striker. Guardiola feels it’s imperative that they plug that gap over the summer. “I think the club needs a striker, definitely,” he said. “I’m sorry, maybe I’m wrong. “I don’t agree with you. You say we play fantastically well without a striker because we are winning. When we are not winning, you say we need a striker, I’m naive. “How do these guys play without a striker? In the Premier League you have to play with a striker.We try, but sometimes it’s not possible.”  ",positive

City saw their treble hopes dashed as they were beaten 3-2 by quadruple-chasing Liverpool in a thrilling semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. 16 Conclusions: Liverpool beat Man City in FA Cup semi-final Yet midfielder Grealish did not want to dwell on the defeat, immediately turning attention to the two competitions City can still win this season. The England international said: “You just go in there and look at the talent and the experience that we have in that dressing room – I don’t think anyone else in the league has a dressing room like it. “Our performances, the competitions we are in and where we are in the league speak for themselves. “We just have to pick ourselves up, go again and hopefully by the end of the season we’ll have (won) the Premier League and the Champions League.” City paid the price for a slow start as Ibrahima Konate headed Liverpool into an early lead before a blunder by second-choice goalkeeper Zack Steffen gifted a second goal to Sadio Mane. Mane then volleyed the Reds’ third on the stroke of half-time to leave City staring at a heavy defeat. Grealish pulled one back after the break and Bernardo Silva set up a grandstand finish with another in a late rally but Liverpool held on. It appeared City’s intense recent schedule, including a draining Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid and last week’s exhilarating draw with Liverpool, had caught up with them. But Grealish said: “I’m not going sit here and say excuses. I just think we came out slow. That was it. “Liverpool have been the same as us, they’ve travelled the same amount as us in the last few weeks, played the same as us. “We didn’t have the first half that we wanted to but we came in at half-time and manager made a few changes. I think we were much better for it but I think in the end it was too little, too late.” City lead Liverpool by one point at the top of the Premier League and face Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals. They are back in action as they host Brighton midweek. “We still have still have the Champions League and the Premier League to play for,” said Grealish. “So we need to pick ourselves up and get back on track for Wednesday.” ",positive

Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Arteta, Son, Palace Grealish has struggled to live up to his price tag, however. He has scored four and assisted three in 32 games across all competitions this term. The 26-year-old is not phased by talk of him not scoring enough, insisting that he prefers the feeling of providing an assist. “Obviously as an attacking player, you do want goals and assists,” he told BBC. “I know for one thing I should definitely have more assists. “Goals – I think I need to get myself in goal scoring positions a little bit more but I know it’s not all about goals and assists. There are big games we’ve won and I feel like I’ve contributed.” 💇‍♂️😂 Jack Grealish on Instagram: pic.twitter.com/CoVUw7Z91O — City Xtra (@City_Xtra) April 14, 2022 Asked if he gets frustrated when people only focus on his goal contribution statistics, Grealish responded:“A little bit but I can see why people say it. But it’s been so much different. “I sat down with the manager and the analyst guys from City, they’ve showed me stats that you want to see as an attacking player that aren’t goals and assists – expected assists, passes in the final third, successful passes in the final third and stuff like this, where I’ve been quite successful in. “I just need a few to fall my way and then they’ll come.” When told thathe’s top three in the Premier League for touches inside the box, Grealish insisted that he needs to add more ‘selfishness’ to his game if he wants to turn those touches into goals. “I shoot way less than anyone,” he continued. “I’m not even sure why, the guys say it here. Like say if I score in training, the lads are like, ‘why don’t you shoot more?’ “I probably should become more selfish. But like I said I don’t really count myself as a selfish player. If someone’s in a better position I’m going to pass it to them. “I actually love the feeling of having an assist – players coming over and thanking you for their goal. It’s just nice. Scoring is the best feeling in football, but I just love assisting.” The former Aston Villa man also said that he is ‘not affected’ by his £100m price tag, but did admit to being “nervous” for his first Man City training session. “The most nervous I’ve ever been, apart from that day [FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 2015], was my first session at City,” he explained. “There was no one there, there weren’t like fans or anything, it was just the other players. Like going out to training, if I made a bad pass, they’d be thinking ‘a hundred million? He cant even control the ball!’ “I think even now, sometimes with the price tag and all, this doesn’t actually affect me at all I swear, it’s more or less trying to impress the manager because he’s such a big figure and trying to impress all these players I’m playing with, and wanting them to think I’m a good player. “This is the business end now and hopefully I can help the team and chip in with goals and assists, because that’s what I’ve come here for.” ",positive

Having won the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final 1-0 at home to Atletico, Manchester City went into the second match at the Wanda Metropolitano in little doubt as to what they would face. Atletico had a player sent off and are expected to face UEFA action after an on-pitch melee towards the end of the goalless draw continued into the tunnel after the final whistle. Manchester City were battered and bruised throughout but had anticipated such rough treatment in the build-up, with Jack Grealish the likely target. The 26-year-old was fouled five times in 22 substitute minutes by Atletico players at the Etihad but was not risked in the away leg because of ‘genuine fears for his safety’. The Daily Telegraph report that Manchester City felt Grealish ‘could be at risk of injury’ after being ‘aggressively targeted’ the previous week, which is likely why Pep Guardiola decided not to risk him. The £100m summer signing was still involved in the fracas, however, calling Stefan Savic a “c***” when the Atleti centre-half had attempted to headbutt Raheem Sterling. Some teammates have since nicknamed him ‘Peaky Jack’, while Sterling ‘also drew praise’ for not reacting to Savic’s provocation. CITY & ATHLETICO BEEF‼ Savic & Grealish have words entering the tunnel and Kyle Walker & Scott Carson weren't having any form of aggro from Athletico.  #mcfc #AthleticoMadrid #UCL pic.twitter.com/TMtNOrf4NF — Pundit Jay (@pundit_jay) April 14, 2022  The other Manchester City player to emerge with the most credit was Oleksandr Zinchenko, another unused substitute who inserted himself into the battle when Phil Foden was fouled by Felipe and dragged off the pitch. The Ukrainian ‘was privately hailed by team-mates as the unofficial man-of-the-match’ for defending Foden, who ‘bore the brunt of Atletico’s brutal approach’ instead of Grealish. ‘City’s players felt his actions were a reflection of what it means to be part of the squad this season as they chase down three trophies and that the whole situation could have a galvanising impact over the remainder of the campaign,’ it is added. Atletico were so confrontational that Neil Warnock was somewhat taken aback. “I must admit, when I watched it, the second half – I couldn’t stop watching, I was gripped. I kept jumping off my seat with the tackles and all the professionalism, crossing my fingers that Man City would go through. “It was only the last 15 minutes that it really became like that and I think Atletico were their own worst enemies. If they kept their cool, they’d have had a lot more chance of getting that goal – but they lost it. “We all do it, all the managers waste time, especially away from home, and referees don’t add that much on. For football, it’s a blessing they got knocked out. I’ve got a reputation, but I’ve never been as bad as Simeone last night. Deary me.” ",negative

Few other Premier League clubs, it would seem, can move from extreme comfort to extreme discomfort in such a short period of time as Arsenal. For much of their trip to Watford they were excellent, smooth and fluid in attack, pressing and dominant in midfield, but by the time they reached stoppage-time at Vicarage Road they were hanging on a little for three points that they should really have had sewn up a good twenty minutes earlier. Their previous performances had brought three straight wins, but these wins were ground out, rather audacious. Twice against Wolves and against Brentford they won by the odd goal, but the late winner against Wolves – a match which effectively ended any chance their opponents might have had of claiming that Champions League place themselves – felt like it should be transformative. Late, late goals have a tendency to give teams a psychological boost, and the short trip to Watford, a team that still hasn’t taken a single home point since tearing a desperate-looking Manchester United to pieces in November, handed them another three points. They took the chance, but it wasn’t without its scares. It took just sixteen seconds before Watford had the ball in the net, Emmanuel Dennis finishing from Joao Pedro’s through-ball, only to be called back for offside, but less than five minutes later Martin Odegaard combined nicely with Bukayo Saka before rolling the ball into the corner of the goal to give them the lead. Odegaard has come to look like a finished article this season, a player around whom Arteta can build a team. Saka, just about the only England player from last summer who hasn’t either been injured or out of form this season, is doing likewise. Who even needs an Aubameyang-esque ‘striker’ when you have players like this, whose movement and intelligence can cut a central defence open with such ease? But if a familiar pattern looked like it was starting to impose itself upon this match, Watford gave themselves a little hope just six minutes later, when Kiko Femenia found himself with a little space on the right-hand side and clipped the ball back for Cucho Hernandez to throw himself at a scissor kick that squeezed under Aaron Ramdsale to bring them level. It was a wonderful finish, certainly not what you’d expect from a team one place off the bottom of the Premier League, but the lift that it gave Vicarage Road wasn’t quite enough. Saka was a tormenting, impish presence on the Arsenal right throughout, and after half an hour he proved his inestimable worth to Arsenal again, this time combining with Alexandre Lacazette before steering the ball into the top corner. When Arsenal’s front three play like this, they look like the real deal. Five minutes into the second half, Odegaard and Lacazette combined to set up Gabriel Martinelli to curl the ball into the top corner to increase their lead to 3-1. But there does remain a slight fragility that Arteta needs to work on. With five minutes to play, a deep cross found Moussa Sissoko at the far post and he steered the ball past Ramsdale to pull Watford back into the game. It made for a more uncomfortable closing few minutes than most would have expected, and Arsenal were left holding on a little bit throughout stoppage-time. But they got there in the end. And that is what really counts, at this point of the season. There’s a race on for fourth place in the Premier League, and Arsenal look like the only team still in it who seem to want to be in it, at times. Manchester United still seem to be a deeply unhappy club. Spurs don’t even seem to know whether they’re actually any good or not. West Ham United may have tripped up once or twice too many times to be able to launch a challenge for fourth place now. Arsenal haven’t been winning matches by the margins that they might have hoped to have done, but they are winning, and that’s more than their rivals seem capable of, at the moment. But all of this does hint at promise. There’s more than the kernel of a really strong team in there, and they’ve put themselves in pole position to claim a return to the Champions League for the first time in six years with this result. If they can iron out this tendency to make wins slightly more difficult than they need to be, they may even now start to look at Chelsea in third place in the table and wonder whether there might even be a chance of overhauling them. But one step at a time. Arsenal are winning consistently, and they’ve picked the perfect time of year to start doing so. ",positive

Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Klopp’s side beat Newcastle United 1-0 on Saturday to remain one point behind Premier League leaders Man City. On Tuesday night, they face Villarreal in Spain in the return leg of their Champions League semi-final. Liverpool won 2-0 at Anfield last week in the first leg. Ahead of this midweek game, Alexander-Arnold has admitted that he is hoping he and his teammates “will be in the history books again”: “I did say one trophy a season minimum and that is in a season that isn’t our best, but we are in fine form and have been able to win in different ways,” Alexander-Arnold said (quotes via Irish Examiner). “When you are staring down the barrel and looking at more trophies, where if we win every game we are looking at more silverware, that is what we are looking at. These kinds of games are exciting for us. “This time last year we were trying to fight back into the top four and secure the Champions League. Now we are second in the league — a point off [Manchester] City — and in the FA Cup final. Who can complain? “This is a very special season for us all and hopefully we will see it through, and at the end we will be in the history books again.” Alexander-Arnold went onto suggest that Liverpool are “thriving off” treating each game as a cup final: “I feel like we thrive off it. This is always the best time of the season. Every game is a final, pushing on all three fronts. “These are the exciting games: You want to be playing in these, you want everything on the line, you want every game to feel like you have to win it. It is exciting, the buzz you get from scoring a goal and knowing how important it is.” ",positive

This is the view of former Aston Villa and England forward Gabriel Agbonlahor. Alexander-Arnold has been a standout player for Liverpool since he made his senior debut for his boyhood club in 2016. The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago The Englishman has proven himself to be a gifted attacking full-back, but he has at times been criticised for his defensive work. Liverpool beat their arch-rivals Everton 2-0 over the weekend. Toffees winger Anthony Gordon was able to cause Alexander-Arnold issues on the flanks. The Reds face Villarreal in the Champions League semi-finals. The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday evening. Agbonlahor thinks Villarreal would be wise to put their “quickest possible player” on Alexander-Arnold: “How good was [Anthony] Gordon on Trent [Alexander]-Arnold?” Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. “And I know Trent [Alexander]-Arnold is an amazing footballer, but he’s the weakness defensively. “So if I’m Villarreal tonight, I’m putting my quickest possible player on that left hand side on Trent [Alexander]-Arnold. “Gordon, every time he was up against him, got past him. “So that would be my tactics, even though you would probably get [Ibrahima] Konate come over and cover anyway. “But it would definitely be to target that right-back side.” Magic from Bobby against tomorrow's opposition in 2016 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/bHWvmJtRl9 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 26, 2022 Elsewhere, Phil Thompson believes Liverpool are capable of winning four trophies this season: “You have to try, as staff, to keep the players just looking at the next match and trying to block things out. “Everyone is talking ‘which one would you accept, lose a cup and which one would you go for?’ “Lo and behold, if you take it one at a time that will happen. You’ve got to discuss it and say ‘look, there’s this possibility’. “I think it will be extremely hard to win the four, it’s never been done before because of the simple reason it is so difficult. “If there’s one club who could do it, because of the power of Anfield, it can be Liverpool Football Club. “With the power of the fans, with the power of the players, squad they have at the moment, the way Klopp has the bond with the club.

The Toffees frustrated the Reds for a large chunk of the Merseyside derby before Jurgen Klopp brought on Luis Diaz and Divock Origi to change the game in their favour. Origi was involved in the build-up to Andy Robertson’s opener before he added a second with five minutes of time to play. ‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox… Alexander Arnold has been brilliant for Liverpool this season but former Reds midfielder Souness thought he was poor in the first half against Everton. Souness said on Sky Sports: “I thought Trent had a stinker in the first half and [Anthony] Gordon caused him some problems. When you break it down, it was a case of them not scoring early, but you have to concentrate in 90 minutes in football.” Sadio Mane was booked during a first-half scuffle with the Senegal international pushing Everton midfielder Allan in the face, before poking Mason Holgate’s nose. And Souness thinks Mane was lucky not to be sent off over the incidents, the Liverpool legend said on Sky Sports: “Mane’s lucky here. He’s pushed someone, maybe actually tried to poke someone.There’s more intent than just a push.” 🗣 “That’s a stonewall penalty.” Graeme Souness and @Carra23 both agree that Anthony Gordon should’ve been awarded a penalty pic.twitter.com/bHTh91UZ8P — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 24, 2022 Meanwhile, Klopp was pleased his “risk” to bring Origi and Diaz off the bench paid dividends as they did the double over Everton. “The situation in the table is clear for us, it’s not news, but if you want to win the game you have to change things,” said Klopp. “Was it brave? We tried to adapt the game as well in the protection, Anthony (Gordon) was on his bike a couple of times, we cannot leave Joel constantly there alone, it makes no sense. “We told Trent (Alexander-Arnold) to play from a little bit deeper and we wanted Fab (Fabinho) on that side as well, so we knew where the threat was coming from and still couldn’t always defend it in the first place. “In football if you don’t take risks you cannot win a football game.

Plus,Chelsea vs Real Madrid, away goals rule, best games and lots more. Send your thoughts totheeditor@football365.com… Reece James over TAA all dayWe see so many people on these pages proclaiming Trent Alexander Arnold as the best right back in the country. I have always argued against as these claims are always backed up with his individual attacking stats, not his individual defensive stats. Sure, he’s a brilliant player, brilliant passer and has a shot on him. However, he gets targeted a lot as the weak link defensively. Man City did it last weekend just as Leeds did 18 months ago. Reece James, for me is the better all round player. Until I looked further at the numbers for this season, Trent is actually a lot further behind than I realised. This season Trent has been involved in 14 goals through assists or by scoring. An impressive number for a ‘right back’. James has been involved in 11. However, Trent has played 2403 minutes, giving a goal contribution every 171 minutes. James has played 1246 minutes, contributing every 113 minutes. Let’s look at defending. James is successful in 86% of his tackles and his team concede a goal every 113 minutes he’s on the pitch. Trent’s tackling trails at a lowly 65% and his team concede every 126 minutes when he’s playing, so that one is a bit better but points to how his teammates are covering for his tackling failure. Gareth is right. Reece James is future for England.PeteB  Chelsea vs Real MadridKudos to Chelsea last night – so near and yet so far. I have to confess I wanted Real to win but sometimes you just get swept up on the ‘can they actually do this?’ bandwagon and I wouldn’t have begrudged Chelsea a place in the semi final. However, it did all remind me of that year Barca knocked them out of the Champions League in the latter stages. I was with a Spurs-supporting mate in a pub in and around Holloway when upon being knocked out, and in the midst of gloating gooners, one Chelsea fan stood up and shouted indignantly, ‘I thought this was England!’ and left the pub in a huff. I’m not sure I have ever seen an entire pub laugh at one individual more than they did that day.Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London  The season from a Liverpool POV 1. We ESCAPED with a point from the home of our direct rivals, City were terrifyingly good and should have finished the race off2. Havingsaid that, the past teams of a title challenging Liverpool would have probably lost the tie, only May would tell how significant was the draw from a Liverpool perspective 3. I can confidently say most Liverpool fans were picturing a semi-final tie against Bayern; watching Villareal kicking the German giants makes one think… (Already picturing us in the final unless Benfica pants us or Villareal awaken their Europa league form coupled with us shitting the bed) 4. FA cup- Will need a slice of luck plus a stellar performance (unlike the unrecognisable side in the league at the Etihad) to dump City out, they’re the better team 5. Ending this on the premier league, as it’s the prize that some of us rate above the CL and FA cup, watching City’s fixtures in Fantasy football was just depressing- All fixtures in green (Come on Pep, over think again but in the league) Cheers.Mihir Nair. Mumbai. LFC.(Uncomfortable is the feeling right now with respect to the place we’re in but atleast I’m excited unlike my ManU supporting brother, who watches Mumbai Indians and has given up on Manchester Red)  The difference between Chelsea and Arsenal I don’t support Arsenal or Chelsea but it seems the one obvious difference between Chelsea last night and Arsenal of old, is that apart from a few moments Chelsea actually looked quite good in both matches. As I recall Arsenal used to throw away the first leg by lying down and letting Bayern/Barca do whatever they wanted, and with no hope of a comeback they’d score a couple in the return fixture when their hosts were in cruise control. Chelsea could’ve had more at the bridge and absolutely could’ve added another couple last night. That said, once it went to extra time me and my housemate both immediately bet on Madrid to win it before pens because it’s just what they do. If Chelsea continue to do this over the next few years, and stop playing decent football, then we can probably compare them to Arsenal, but for now, as much as I hate to say it, the better team went out. Couldn’t agree more with Ken about that Modric assist though, that ball was worthy of a place in the next round.Manjo, LFC  Away goals ruleI think Johnny Nic’s latest fantastic article on the away goals rule misses possibly the purest beauty of the rule – that in no other way and at no other time can a single goal represent a swing from losing to winning in a single tie. At any other time, a goal might be a consolation or it might extend a lead; it could bring teams level, or it could be the goal that gives a team the lead from a previously deadlocked contest. There are, however, rare and glorious moments – so often in the dying moments of a match – where the swing from the absolute despair of beingbehindin a contest to the ecstasy of being suddenly catapulted into the driving seat comes with a single swing of the boot or flick of the head. I’m a Spurs fan. I was deeply miserable as I stood, motionless, in a boozer in South West London watching the seconds tick away at the Amsterdam Arena in THAT 2019 UCL semi final. There was no way that a slick, professional outfit like Ajax would let things slip. Spurs couldn’t possibly luck-out as they had done against City earlier in the competition. Then, for the third time that night, Lucas Moura happened and the whole pub went into absolute meltdown. Pints were thrown in the air. I was hugging and kissing strangers (thankfully Covid wasn’t a thing at that time). Would the reaction have been anywhere near as emotional if that goal had simply brought about the prospect of extra time and penalties?Manchester United were beneficiaries in similar fashion in Paris that same year. Maybe it would have been more emotional if the pub had been full of women… Isn’t that right, Kenny Shiels? Eh? Eh, Kenny? Isn’t that right, you absolute sexist neanderthal. I’ve just thought about this and realised that my logic only really applies to a knockout tie and that there are a number of moments (Agueroooooo) where a single goal changes the entire complexion of a league contest. But my point still stands so, fuck-it, bring back the away goals rule and that tedious and interminable debate about whether it’s “fair” to apply it before or after extra time!!Chris Bridgeman, Kingston upon Thames  It’s like an FA Cup tie Not sure how Sarah Winterburn did it but her article had a “FA giant killing”or “plucky underdog” feel to it about Chelsea’s performance last night. It was an enjoyable read but she probably couldn’t have been more wrong. This wasn’t some League 2 rocking up to a Premier League giant in the FA Cup 5th round looking to cause an upset, this was the current Champions League Winners, they won the flippin thing last year and then bought probably one of the best strikers in Europe at the time for nearly 100 million quid. They should have had a go at Real Madrid, they are not a world class team, they are winning quitea poor La Liga but have dropped more points at home this season than away, the worst Barca team in living memory hammered them 4-0 at home a couple of weeks ago. In the words of the immortal Roy Keane , it’s their job, they should play like that in a quarter final of a European Cup. For all their shots (which counts for squat unless you score to be honest) Chelsea lost because as Matthew correctly said in this morning’s mailbox, they were crap in the first leg and gave themselves too much to do. It had nothing to do with Alonso’s fingernail (they still scored a third) or Pulisic and Jorginho fluffing their lines (again near-misses don’tcount), it was down to the fact that Chelsea gave one the top scorers in Champions League history the freedom of Stamford Bridge a week ago and then for some reason while winning with 10 minutes to go away to Real Madrid in a Champions League quarter final stood off a man who ran the first leg and allowed him to play a fantastic pass. A recent story on Sky Sports had that Chelsea squad ranked as the 3rd most valuable in Europe. Unfortunately they only showed that in the second leg.Robbie DFC. *people are aware that Modirc isthe only person not named Ronaldo or Messi to have won the Ballon D’or since 2007 aren’tthey?  Liverpool Man City non rivalry Hi Regarding the lack of aggressionbetween Liverpool and City I was watching the match Sunday with a couple of mates, discussing the same thing. The general consensuswas that the players on both sides are so technically proficientthat you finish up with less of the hard man of yore on the top sides. Those players who were decent but made themselves vital to their teams cause by upping the aggressionlevel with a few reducers that obviously inflamed the other sides players and fans, led to the retaliatory reducer, argy bargy, handbags and food fights. The academy system is starting to dominate team sheets now and I can’t imagine City’s, Liverpool’s, Chelsea’s, etc academy coaches saying to their protegees ‘you are a bit limited my son so why not just get stuck in and you will make it’.Mel – Dublin, Berlin, Athlone Town  With all the conversation around whether or not Liverpool vs City is volatile enough to be considered a great rivalry and that the managers show too much respect too eachother unlike Ferguson, Mourinho, Wenger et. al it got me thinking. Is all of this talk just another sign of the toxic masculinity that is still rampant across the message boards and entering back into our stands (and now our pitches as Nottingham Forest found out recently among others) in larger and larger numbers across the continent. Is it seen as the last place for “men to be men” and all that nonsense that goes with it? It mixes well with the “whataboutery” that fills the message boards and social media. If player a assaults someone, instead of the fans just accepting he may be an idiot in that moment, it’s instantly “well what about player b”… It’s constant. It’s exhausting. And it’s absolutely fanned by the likes of this very website along with the British media and the ex players. The world’s best sprinters, rowers, rugby players etc can race/play against eachother and maintain an enormous amount of respect. What is it about football supporters that we need the violence, the vengeance, the face rubbing, tribalistic shit eating nonsense. What is it?

Barcelona 2-2 Chelsea | Champions League | April 24, 2012 – Since i imposed a strict “No Cup Finals” rule on myself i will simply go back a game from the Munich Final and choose that second leg against Barcelona, during an era in which Barcelona dominated European football, we were down to 10 men due to John Terry being so unfairly sent off (sarcasm everyone), Barcelona only needed a single goal to realistically put the tie to bed but Petr Cech was in inspired form, Lionel Messi missed a penalty and then Fernando Torres became an instant icon for the Blues repaying that entire £50m fee with his winning goal, one of the most exciting yet nail biting games i have watched as a fan. Manchester United 4-3 Real Madrid | Champions League | April 23, 2003 – Another April Champions League game, another second leg and just a day prior all be it 9 years previously from my Chelsea selection, i was about 10 at the time yet this game sticks in my memory as if it was yesterday, watching it on ITV it was a classic, Ronaldo had one of the games of his career scoring a hat trick and David Beckham came on as a substitute in which was his final European game for United and scored twice with one being a truly lovely free kick, it is rumoured thatthis was also the game that convinced Roman Abramovich a spectator in the crowd that night to invest his money into football.The Admin @ At The Bridge Pod  Female manager? Is the world ready for a female head coach/manager in the men’s game? I’m no rampant supporter of feminism, but watching the England women’s team last night it struck me how well Sarina Wiegman is doing with them, then today’s article sang her praises too. Would her skills transfer to the men’s game? Why not? Some pretty ordinary men keep getting another tilt at making a team equally ordinary, so is there a club out there willing to try? …That’s another question.Al McBoro  ",positive

Big Midweek: Werner, Atletico v Man City, Emery, Liverpool The left-sided Everton will be mainly up against Alexander-Arnold at Anfield in the second leg, in which they trail 3-1, but he has done his research on all of the right side of Liverpool’s defence, with Konate expected to again replace Joel Matip. “I’ve been trying to study the opponent after the first game, looking to better analyse the individual qualities of Alexander-Arnold and Konate,” he told a press conference. “I have tried to see where they have difficulties, the weak point, so that I can exploit and have a happy night, to give joy to the fans.” Benfica will be without right-winger Rafa Silva, who has been ruled out with injury having missed training on Tuesday. Caretaker coach Nelson Verissimo believes they have good enough options to take his place, however. “We all know the importance he has in our team: he has different characteristics and we have to make up for his absence, but we have solutions that will give a positive response,” he said. “We are sorry for his absence but we have a lot of confidence in the rest of the squad. “We go (to Anfield) with the natural ambition of someone who believes a lot in what he is doing. “We know that we are two goals down but we believe that things can change, especially if we score a goal first. “We’re going with that ambition, despite having lost the first leg. After the analysis we did, we realise that despite the difficulty we know we’re going to encounter, we have to believe.” Key to their chances will be 22-year-old Uruguay international Nunez, who is being tracked by some of Europe’s top clubs. Verissimo admits it will be difficult for the club to keep hold of the striker, saying: “It’s the law of the market. Obviously players like Darwin, and the best players, the idea would be to keep them all, but we are in a competitive market, in which clubs need capital for their daily management. “At the end of the season, if he has to go, we have to accept it. It’s the law of realising that there are stronger markets and because of that there are players that we cannot keep. Benfica is no exception to that.” ",positive
262,https://www.football365.com/news/everton-back-basics-bollocks-manchester-united-fabian-delph-allan,Early winners: Everton back to f***ing basics and b*llocks,"In a battle of two pretty terrible teams, Everton showed they gave a sh*t. Have you got the bollocks to play? That was the question asked by Everton manager Frank Lampard after a 4-0 demolition by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and the answer after Premier League defeats to West Ham and Burnley was ‘actually, no’ but also ‘have you got the tactics to play?’ and ‘f***ing hell, this really is horrible and Everton really could get relegated’. The answer right now – after a victory that pulls them four points clear of relegation – might well be ‘actually, yes’ but also ‘it helps when you are playing a rank Manchester United side‘. Make no mistake, this was a terrible, terrible football match blessed with very, very little attacking quality. That it was settled by a heavily deflected goal is absolutely apt. But the difference between these two rotten football teams was that Everton cared. They really, really cared. They worked ridiculously hard with limbs thrown in front of shots, heads put on lofted balls, feet launched into tackles and Jordan Pickford’s be-gloved hand flying over the heads of various hapless Manchester United players. If that’s how you show bollocks then Everton have gonads for days. The charge was led by Fabian Delph, playing his first football of 2022 but picked for his sheer bloody-minded Yorshire-ness. This is the man who stood up in a Manchester City dressing-room after one defeat to United and said: “It’s just the basics of football. It’s simple. It’s straightforward. We stopped f***ing running in the second half. I’m not blaming anybody. I’m saying, it’s the basics of football.Winning our individual battles. Sticking together as a unit. F***ing defenders defending. Midfielders, box-to-box. F***ing keepers… Just the basics of football.” Just the basics of football. That’s what Delph brought to Goodison Park on Saturday with a performance full of simplicity and energy. Winning individual battles? Absolutely. It helps when you are playing against mannequins but everything he did was exemplary. He won the ball, he passed the ball, he cleared the ball into the stands when that was needed. As he came off after 84 minutes, he was still pointing to his head in the universal language of football to say ‘keep yours’. They did. With every block, every tackle and every towering header, roared on by a Goodison Park crowd that could yet be their 12th, 13th and 14th men in the fight against relegation. Ben Godfrey made 13 clearances, Allan made four tackles, Richarlison covered every blade of grass and then Demarai Gray came off the bench and flung himself selflessly into the path of a goal-bound shot because when there is such an obvious and overwhelming collective stance of ‘thou shalt not pass’, it is contagious. United could have had the ball for another two hours and still not scored. Some of that can be attributed to the putrid state of this famous old club in red but much can also be attributed to the back-to-basics, b*llocks out attitude of these Everton players. Is it what Everton need going forward to establish themselves back among the middle tier of Premier League clubs? Absolutely not. But is it what they need to survive this season and remain in the top flight? God yes. READ MORE: What next for Lampard if he manages to get Everton relegated? ",positive

Liverpool hosted Watford in their first game after the international break on Saturday afternoon. The Reds were not at their scintillating best but they triumphed 2-0. F365 says: Watford stop Salah, but can’t stop Liverpool Joe Gomez put in a pinpoint cross for Diogo Jota who headed home in the first half. Fabinho later settled the game from the penalty spot. Ahead of Man City’s game versus Burnley, Liverpool are two points clear at the top of the Premier League. They have now won ten league games in a row. Klopp praised Gomez and Jota for their performances after the win over Watford: “I really think it was a performance there in the right moments. The first goal was really nice play,” Klopp told BBC Sport. “Credit to Watford and to Roy. He can really organise the team. Everybody knew what place he had to close to make it difficult. “We could have done better but after two weeks not together and the early kick-off it’s really tricky. But all teams have the same problems. “I don’t think after the international break I ever see the best game of the season. “We were very mature and very controlled.” On the penalty: “I didn’t see it back. I couldn’t see it on the pitch. There were players in between us and the ball. If it’s a foul that’s what VAR is there for. It shouldn’t be everything is allowed in the box just because the player didn’t get the ball.” On Joe Gomez: “Top. He set up the goal and had another brilliant cross in the second half which could have been a goal. How can you replace Trent Alexander Arnold? I didn’t ask him to play like Trent, I said play like Joe Gomez. He’s an outstanding player. He will have more games towards the end of the season. “Jota is top. He’s really decisive. Great cross, great header. “Big two months hopefully. This week can decide a lot about how May will be. The boys created a top-class basis and now we have to use it. It’s a tricky one. There’s a reason why it’s so difficult to win one trophy. Take it game by game. Take it 100% in each game. Hopefully keep all the boys fit and make changes between games. The Premier League is the most important competition.” ",positive

Clyne suffered the injury in Liverpool’s pre-season friendly with Borussia Dortmund in New York on Friday. The 28-year-old England international, who spent last season on loan at fellow Premier League side Bournemouth, was sidelined for most of the 2017-18 season with a back injury. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told the club’s official website: “What can I say other than how gutted we all are for Clyney? He was training and playing so well – he was in outstanding shape. “Clearly an injury of this nature isn’t a happy moment for any player, but the silver lining for him is that, according to the medical guys, it’s a straightforward ACL injury. “This means fixing it and coming back from it should follow a path that is free from pitfalls and complications. “At the moment there isn’t much more to say beyond we’ll all support Clyney in whatever way we can and we look forward to seeing him back on the pitch as soon as responsibly possible. “He is such a sound professional and is naturally very fit and strong, so all these things are in his favour.” ",positive
265,https://www.football365.com/news/wenger-nobody-else-wanted-midfielder-elneny,Wenger: ‘Nobody else wanted midfielder Elneny’,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted that no other club wanted £5m Egyptian midfielderMohamed Elneny. Elneny has been described as “between Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey” with his defensive-minded box-to-box style; he will start in midfield alongside Francis Coquelin on Saturday against Burnley in the FA Cup. Wenger appears quite cautious about Elneny, who was shocked by the physicality of the game against Stoke two weeks ago. “Let’s see how well he adapts to English football before we see if we have got him for a cheap price,” said Wenger. “Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only interested club in signing him. “Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar. “But we were looking at a specific position for a player with his kind of qualities and we identified Elneny as someone with the potential to do it. “I think we were right about him, but now he has to show that he can do it. “It’s a big step for him to come from Switzerland to go to the Premier League but I think it is the right time for him. “Physically, he is not a monster. Usually middle eastern people are big on stamina, mobility and agility but sometimes lack a bit of power. “He is not a powerhouse, but winning the ball is not only down to strength.It’s also about technique and switching on at the right moment. “You have players who are really muscular who lose fights against very slim players because small guys get their timing right. “It’s a real technique to switch your muscle on when the opponent is in a weak position. “I remember Jean Tigana only weighed 63 kilograms yet he was unbelievable as a defensive midfielder. “Elneny is a natural box-to-box player but he is more defensive-minded than most who play that role, so he can also play in a holding position. “He is a little bit between Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey. He can win the ball and effect quick transition and he is defensive-minded in his transitioning.” ",positive

Years and years ‘Drama is hardly the word for it. Goodison has not seen a night like this for years’ – David Maddock, Daily Mirror. ‘Bythe end, the stadium was shaking. They were banging on wooden panels, they were singing louder than they had done in years and the celebrations were a throwback to glorious days of old’ – Dominic King, Daily Mail. Everton beat Arsenal 2-1 in stoppage time 102 days ago and Goodison Park was pretty sodding loud at the time.  Doff of the cap ‘Begovic was one of four changes Lampard made to the team that capitulated against Wolves four days earlier…’ – Dominic King, Daily Mail. They were pretty rubbish in that game but not sure losing 1-0 to a goal in the 49th minute can ever be described as having ‘capitulated’.  Auba and out On Thursday evening, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his seventh goal in 10 games since joining Barcelona. They have all had one specific thing in common, at least if the Daily Mirror website is to be believed. After his hat-trick against Valencia on February 20: ‘Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sends Mikel Arteta awkward message from Barcelona’ The ‘awkward message’ was literally the hat-trick itself. Aubameyang hadn’t actually said anything. After his goals against Napoli on February 24 and Athletic Bilbao on February 27: ‘Arsenal sent another painful Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reminder amid Barcelona upturn’ The ‘painful reminder’ was literally the goals themselves. Aubameyang hadn’t actually said anything. After his goal against Osasuna on March 13, Aubameyang took a backseat: ‘Xavi aims thinly veiled swipe at Arsenal after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang heroics’ The ‘thinly veiled swipe’ was to say the striker “is a present that has fallen out of the sky” and he trains well. Arsenal are thought to be still treating the wound. And now, after his goal against Galatasaray on Thursday evening: ‘Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang throws shade at Arsenal when addressing Barcelona form’ Finally, some actual quotes from the man himself. He ‘hasfired a subtle dig’ at his former employers and at this stage, viewer discretion is absolutely advised: “When you are happy, you have excitement for everything, to score goals, to help the team and to kill.” Good lord. That is brutal. Mediawatch cannot wait to see what the next stage is after ‘awkward message’, ‘painful reminder’, ‘thinly veiled swipe’ and ‘shade’ when Aubameyang inevitably scores again. Although it probably should be pointed out that Arsenal have won 83.3% of their games since releasing Aubameyang, while Barcelona have won 70% of theirs since signing him. How’s that for ‘shade’?  Pierre pressure Honestly, though, imagine pretending that Aubameyang has had anything resembling a ‘swipe’ at Arsenal since leaving. Absolutely pathetic. It really is.  Boiled Rice The obsession with (and misuse of) the word ‘warning’ in football journalism continues apace with this from the Daily Mirror website: ‘Declan Rice sends Barcelona warning after West Ham’s Europa League heroics’ He did not mention Barcelona once until Joe Cole brought them up, and even then all Rice said was that “it would be special to go there”. The second Barcelona and Aubameyang stop messaging, reminding and swiping at Arsenal, they’d better watch out for Rice and his boys.  Don’t shoot the messenger On which note, the word ‘message’ can also still do one. ‘Dominic Calvert-Lewin sends message to Mikel Arteta as Arsenal hunt summer transfer’ – Daily Express website. No, dear reader, you didn’t miss an intriguing post-match interview from the Everton forward. Calvert-Lewin’s ‘message’ was instead a ‘first assist in the top flight since the 2019/20 season’. Alexandre Lacazette has set up four goals in 2022 alone. Are you listening, Mikel?  Blow your own trumpet The Liverpool Echo wrote about the ‘Champions League blow’ the club had suffered before drawing the weakest side left in the quarter-finals. A tie with Benfica should ordinarily be navigated comfortably enough by the Reds but this apparent problem could change all that. The ‘blow’, as it happens, is that Liverpool are in loads of competitions. THE QUADRUPLE is both a blessing and a curse, those poor sods. ‘From the five European sides left in the Champions League, none of them are left in domestic cup competition, while only Bayern Munich and Real Madrid currently looking capable of ending the season as national champions. Yet they both boast healthy leads at the top of the Bundesliga and La Liga, sparing them the repeated high-pressure Liverpool and Man City are about to face in the weeks ahead. ‘With the Champions League the only piece of silverware Atletico Madrid, Villarreal and Benfica can end the season with, they will be able to focus solely on the quarter-finals – a liberty the Reds and Pep Guardiola’s side will not be afforded.’ Simple. Just put the kids out in the FA Cup or forfeit their remaining Premier League games. That is the only way to deal with this ‘blow’ and regain the ‘liberty’ to focus on only one competition like all those other lucky clubs. ‘Naturally, all sides would prefer to be in Liverpool and Man City’s shoes as they look to finish the season with a quadruple or treble respectively. Yet it means they are both at a disadvantage compared to their continental counterparts when it comes to the stresses of competing in the Champions League quarter-finals.’ Being good enough to reach the quarter-finals of two different competitions while maintaining a title-contending pace in the Premier League is now a ‘disadvantage’ and it is at this stage that you really do have to wonder what the point of all this trophy-hunting is.  The beginning of the Hend The following two headlines feature on the Liverpool Echo website: ‘What Jordan Henderson did at 3am after ‘incredible’ Mikel Arteta admission’ ‘What Jordan Henderson did to Trent Alexander-Arnold as Arsenal fume against Liverpool explained’ And now Trent Alexander-Arnold is injured. The f**k was it that Jordan Henderson did to him at 3am?

Hickey joined the Serie A club from Hearts in 2020 after breaking into the side at the age of 16. He became the youngest player to start in a Scottish Cup final in 2018/19. The 19-year-old has made 21 appearances this term, scoring four times, and is now a mainstay in Bologna’s starting XI. Grading each Championship club’s January transfer window He has only appeared for Scotland at under-17 level after pulling out of numerous u21 squads due to injury. Aston Villa are reportedly long-term admirers of Hickey and the player was also tracked by Steven Gerrard during his time as Rangers manager. And speaking on the Claret & Blue podcast, Birmingham Live journalist Ashley Preece has tipped the Villans to make a move for the left-back in the summer. He said: “I think (Matt) Targett will go to Newcastle in the summer and I think Villa will bring in Aaron Hickey. “He’s been a long-term target, they know him well. Austin MacPhee worked with him at Hearts as well and likewise Gerrard’s backroom team know all about him from his time in Scotland.” Reports elsewhere state that Aston Villa had a bid in the region of £8.5m rejected for Hickey. Meanwhile,Aston Villa turned down three bids for Douglas Luiz during the January transfer window, according to reports. Luiz is into his third season at Villa Park after joining fromManchester Cityin 2019 and has impressed immensely. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is thought to be an admirer, while Manchester City have reportedly even made attempts to bring him back to the club since his departure. It was reported in November that he wanted to leave the club amid interest from Roma, while Arsenal and Newcastle have been linked with moves in the January transfer market. And nowThe Athleticreports thatAston Villa ‘have rejected three offers’ for the midfielder in January ‘with the most recent offer made on transfer deadline day’.

Former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and current Ajax manager Erik Ten Hag are believed to be the leading candidates to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick in the summer. However, a report emerged on Wednesday claiming that Man Utd were considering a move for Tuchel with the current uncertainty surrounding Chelsea and Roman Abramovich’s ownership of the club. Southgate right over Rashford; only morons wanted Maguire dropped But Neville predicts that Chelsea under new ownership would provide a “really exciting time” for Tuchel if he stayed at Stamford Bridge. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I think Thomas Tuchel will stay. “With Chelsea, we’ve seen the reports over the past 24 hours, they are going to swap one multi-billionaire for another, so they are not going to be weaker from a financial point of view. “If he is settled there, he’s got a good team, he’s achieved success, I don’t think he’d leave if the new ownership came in – and obviously all the restrictions were removed – and gave him the right support on building a project. “I think when new owners come into a football club that is a really exciting time for a manager because he will be able to exploit the fact that they are going to need to put money into the team and new owners have to put money into the team. “That’s the first thing fans look for them to do – are you going to support the football side of the business? I think that’s what they’ll have to do in the summer, so they might get £150m-£200m off the new ownership.” Tuchel worked wonders in his first season at Chelsea in 2021, taking over from Frank Lampard, finishing in the top four of the Premier League and winning the Champions League. When asked about the speculation linking him to Man Utd, Tuchel responded at a press conference ahead of their FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough: “Do you feel me less committed or involved with this club.

The Portugal international made the move to the Premier League in 2015 as he joined Southampton. After 138 appearances for the Saints, Soares joined Arsenal on loan during the winter transfer window in 2020. This transfer was made permanent that summer. Ranking every Premier League No. 1 by ball-playing ability The 30-year-old has been a bit-part player for the Gunners, playing 50 times. This included 18 starts across all competitions this term. TuttoMercatoWeb (via Sport Witness) are reporting that Soares “will leave” Arsenal this summer. His current contract expires in 2024. Newcastle have identified him as a summer target due to his ‘flexibility’. They face competition from Porto as they have presented Arsenal with a bid of around€5m. Elsewhere, Louis Saha has backed Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be named Premier League manager of the season. The Geordies have drastically improved under the 44-year-old’s stewardship and are set to become the first team to avoid top-flight relegation after failing to win any of their opening 14 encounters. They spent over £90m in the winter transfer window thanks to their new Saudi-led ownership, bringing in Dan Burn, Chris Wood, Kieran Trippier, Matt Targett and Bruno Guimaraes. Newcastle are now ninth in the Premier League and are one of the most in-form teams since the turn of the year. The club’s former striker Saha believes the Magpies’ turnaround should see Howe named Premier League manager of the season. “I think so, yeah,” Saha said when asked if Howe deserves the award (via The Shields Gazette). “When you have competition like Guardiola, Klopp and (Thomas) Tuchel, it’s hard, but it shows he’s done an amazing job. “When he arrived, they were favourites for relegation, and he’s built a dynamic team, played some very exciting football and defended well. “The players he brought in had an impact and credit to him, and to the club who had the guts to make that decision at the right moment. It’s very important to recognise the immense impact Eddie has had.” ",positive

Goals from Nuno Tavares, Bukayo Saka and a Granit Xhaka secured all three points for the Gunners, who had looked a bit shaky when Cristiano Ronaldo got one back for the visitors. The victory over United means Arsenal are now six points clear of Ralf Rangnick’s men – who have played one more game than the Gunners – while they are two points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham. Arsenal are the ‘most obnoxious team’ in the Premier League… Adams was glad to see Takehiro Tomiyasu come on as a late sub on his return from a three-month injury lay-off with the Arsenal legend “scared” of Cedric. Speaking about the race for fourth place, Adams said on Premier League Productions: “It could be a north London shootout now “Spurs have got Liverpool away and Arsenal coming up, those are going to be the two pivotal games I think in the top-four race. “It’s been a great comeback for Arsenal after those three defeats. We’ve had a few injuries too. “Tomi came back right at the end there which is great because I’m still scared about Cedric. He scares the life out of me so it’s good to see Tomi back in action. “If we can get him back and get solid defensively, I think we’ve got fourth.” 🏆 A MOTM performance 💥 A huge goal to secure the win 👏 Granit Xhaka pic.twitter.com/IqzvmLB5fC — Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 24, 2022 Xhaka scored a screamer to wrap up the points for Arsenal in the 70th minute and Mikel Arteta was delighted to see the Switzerland international score. “I was dreaming of that because he deserves it,” Arteta said after the match. “If any fan would individually spend five or 10 minutes with Granit, or even two minutes, because that’s all you need, they would understand the person that he is, the professional that he is and how much he cares about the club. “I think it was a phenomenal game for fans, for us it was a bit of a rollercoaster. We wanted to start the game really fast, dominate it, create issues, be really vertical and we managed to do that.”  ",positive

Mikel Arteta’s side fluffed a huge opportunity on Saturday against another team with nothing to play for. January inertia, as EVERYONE warned, has cost them dear. Arsenal couldn’t get anything going. A team that was scoring some beautiful goals a little over a month ago through quick movement and one touch football, now looks incredible short of ideas. That goes with a lack of confidence, but also, more simply, a lack of quality footballers. Cedric Soares has been praised to the hilt by Arteta in recent weeks, but wasted every dead-ball situation he had on Saturday and is very much in the old school category of full-backs – those with energy and grit, for whom a decent cross a game is a bonus not an expectation.Southampton – Cedric’s former employers – have two better right-backs, Kyle Walker-Peters and Tino Livramento, and that shouldn’t be the case given their relative budgets. Cedric is fine, but that’s the case for far too many members of this Arsenal squad. Granit Xhaka is fine. Eddie Nketiah is fine. Albert Sambi Lokonga is (currently) fine. Nuno Taveres is fine on a good day. And when the best players, like Bukayo Saka, like Martin Odegaard, are inexperienced, they can’t and shouldn’t be expected to carry their mediocre teammates through every game of the season. Those players aren’t devoid of blame, they were far from their best and both Saka and Emile Smith Rowe had very good opportunities thatweresaved expertly by Fraser Forster, but they shouldn’t have given the goalkeeper any chance. No brilliant player can be brilliant all the time, let alone relative youngsters. They need (and please excuse the simplicity of this statement) to be playing football with better footballers. When the sum total of your team’s attacking endeavour is give it to Cedric Soares to cross it, there’s something very wrong. — arseblog (@arseblog) April 16, 2022 This was a Southampton side that had been battered 6-0 by Chelsea last time out and they dealt with Arsenal, on the whole, pretty easily.In the absence of Kieran Tierney, Odegaard is seemingly the only source of creativity behind Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, and they couldn’t get the ball to him. Ralph Hasenhuttl deserves credit as the game plan was clearly to stuff up that No.10 area and allow Arsenal to have it out wide, where they knew there was no real danger, but that stifling strategy is made easy when there is only one avenue to block.  The impact of Tierney’s injury has been quite something. After a run of six wins in seven with Tierney, Arsenal have contrived to lose theirlast three against teams in no danger of going down and with no hope of European football without the left-back. He’s a fabulous footballer but there’s no way he should be that influential. Perhaps the big worry for Arsenal is that no-one played that badly against Southampton. None of them were at the top of their game but you couldn’t point to any individual and say they did much less than what’s expected of them. A lot of them aren’t good players playing poorly, but average players playing averagely. And they did have an opportunity in January, when there were widespread calls for reinforcements with Champions League qualification a real possibility, to buy a striker, or a midfielder, or at the very least sign players on loan to tide them over. Because they will make those additions in the summer, and the pool of potential recruits will be limited should they now lose out to Tottenham or Manchester United. This was a bad result for Arsenal, but not unexpected. With the shallow squad and the injuries they have, they are not a team good enough to qualify for the Champions League. But we knew that and presumably they did. And should they not make the top four they will look back to the January transfer window and think what could have been.  ",positive

Zaha was on top form against the Gunners, despite being an injury doubt for Monday night’s Premier League match. Vieira impact at Palace shames Arteta’s Arsenal reign… It was a poor evening for Mikel Arteta’s men who have now surrendered their place in the top four to arch-rivals Tottenham. Arsenal’s back four had a tough night against an in-form Palace side, who raced into a two-goal lead after 24 minutes. Lee Dixon criticised Nuno Tavares, Ben White and Gabriel for their part in the first two goals of the match. “Look at Ben White’s position,”said Dixon.“He’s following Mateta, then all of a sudden he goes towards the ball and leaves him. He then has a free header inside the six-yard box. It can’t happen. Stay with your man! Things like that tell me they’re not switched on. “It’s one of the balls in where you say ‘Oh, Gabriel has made a mistake’. You got to win the ball. The defending is absolutely shocking. “The back four are in a decent position. As soon as Ayew starts to make his run inside, then Tavares has to step into him, don’t step back. He steps back, Tavares. He doesn’t do that and drops too deep. “That just enables Ayew to run into the gap. Then Gabriel has to win it. If you are the last line of defence, you have to be 100% sure you are going to win the ball, he doesn’t and is out of position.” And former Tottenham striker Bent has singled out the other member of Arteta’s back four, Cedric, saying that he was bettered by Palace talisman Zaha. “(Zaha) is one of those players that I call bullies,” Bent told talkSPORT (via HITC). “Because, once he knows he’s got the full-back, he knows he can do what we wants with him. He just toys with him. “Cedric tried a couple of times to get tight to him, to make it difficult. But, in the end, he just knew; ‘I can’t get anywhere near him’.” ",positive

The Brazilian’s progress at the Emirates Stadium was hampered in 2020 when he suffered a serious knee injury after joining the Gunners in 2019 from Ituano. Martinelli has scored 17 ties in 74 appearances for Arsenal and has made his most Premier League appearances (19) in a single season in this campaign. Arsenal, Arteta should tell Neville to go fourth and multiply The Brazil international has been impressing this term and now Soares has been comparing the 20-year-old to Manchester United striker Ronaldo, who has scored 692 career club goals in 929 appearances. “Gabi has this aim for goal. He likes to attack the space, like Cristiano,” Cedric told the Evening Standard. “He likes to score goals, like everyone does. But Gabi has this willingness to fight. Even when he doesn’t play, he keeps working the same way. “He is an easy young kid to talk with. You talk and you can see he listens to you. He’s talented, but the way he works is fantastic.” Cedric has covered impressively in the absence of Takehiro Tomiyasu and has vowed to fight for his spot with the Japan international returning to full fitness. He added: “You need to believe in yourself. I came to Arsenal because of what I did in my career and by doing every week what I aim for. I was fighting for it and then achieved this. “And now, I need to fight for my spot. This is completely natural and normal. You need to keep working and believing in your skills, knowledge, performance and mentality. “In a natural way the truth always comes out. As we say in Portugal, it’s like water in olive oil, the truth comes to the top. “I used to have one of my biggest friends growing up, maybe even now he is still one of my closest friends, when he didn’t play he was completely gone, upset and wouldn’t talk to the coach. “You can be upset — you are human — but what you cannot do is stop trying and stop fighting. Maybe it’s from my family or the way I grow up, but I just try to focus on my job and treat my training like a game. When I am not playing, the training is a game.” ",positive

The Portugal international signed for the Gunners in 2020. He initially joined them on loan from Southampton before his move was made permanent ahead of the 2020/21 campaign. Soares spent five years at the Saints and he previously had a spell at Sporting Lisbon. He has also been capped 34 times by Portugal. Cup defeat points the way forward for Arsenal, and other mails… The defender was a bit-part player for Arsenal last season but he was able to start 19 games across all competitions. Only eight of these starts came in the Premier League. Soares has featured regularly in cup competitions this term but he has not started in the league since August. He was part of the side that lost 1-0 to Nottm Forest in the FA Cup on Sunday. Spanish outlet AS (as cited by Sport Witness) are reporting that Soares has been “offered” to Atletico Madrid. They are thought to be in the market for a new right-back given that Kieran Trippier has joined Newcastle. A deal for Soares would be a loan that includes an option to buy. The report adds that the defender is not a “priority” for Madrid currently. Elsewhere, Ian Wright and Roy Keane have criticised Arsenal defender Nuno Tavares. Arsenal legend Wright thought Tavares showed “disrespect” to Arteta after putting in a terrible display: “He has started very poorly. He is coming off and he’s thrown his gloves down, I think this is the wrong manager to do that with,” Wright said on ITV. “Showing that kind of attitude. I think the disrespect he is showing at the minute is something Mikel Arteta won’t like, especially given the performance he has put in.” Former Manchester United midfielder Keane questioned why Tavares was even upset in the first place. “Why is he upset? He must know [he’s at risk of being taken off],” Keane said. “He’s right in front of the dugout and the manager, he’s been sloppy in everything he’s done. “Ok, a player can make a mistake but that sloppyness is down to his attitude and the way he started the game and you can’t start a game like that. You’ll get dragged off.” ",negative
279,https://www.football365.com/news/transfer-gossip-manchester-united-west-ham-double-swoop-haller-diop,Manchester United target players from West Ham past and present in £47.7m double swoop,"Manchester United have found a couple of budget options for their summer rebuild, with current and former West Ham players set to be targeted. SEBASTIEN GO There has been a notable increase in entry-level arithmetic when it comes to the reporting of Manchester United’s transfer plans. Those in the know have finally scrolled far enough down the Ajax squad to realise Erik ten Hag might like to bring Sebastien Haller back to the Premier League with him. Jurrien Timber,Noussair Mazraoui and Antony have all already been linked with moves to Old Trafford, and not for the first time this season Haller has made it four. The Sun say ‘it looks as though’ the 27-year-old forward‘could be following in the same direction’ as his current manager. He is framed as an affordable alternative to nine-figure targets such as Harry Kane and Darwin Nunez. The two years remaining on his Ajax contract give Haller a supposed valuation of £35m, which would be phenomenal for a forward with 33 goals and nine assists in 39 games this season, albeit with the sizeable caveat of that West Ham stuff. Not sure why Ajax would sell him back to a Premier League side for less than the Hammers originally paid, mind. Haller shows Premier League failure is not a career dead end  ISSA TRAP Not content with signing a player who struggled at the London Stadium, Manchester United will also keep an eye on one who has proved useful for David Moyes this season. Issa Diop is no Craig Dawson but has been important for a club that appears to have some sort of centre-half curse currently. Diop has been linked with a move to Old Trafford before – he was once thrust into the middle of a feud between Paul Scholes and Jose Mourinho – and it seems that interest never really faded. But there could be a fight for the Frenchman. It is claimed by Foot Mercato that Monaco took advantage of West Ham’s arrival into the country for their Europa League game against Lyon, arranging a meeting with Diop’s representatives. But Manchester United have ‘already approached’ the player and Ralf Rangnick ‘followed him closely’ while at Leipzig. The 25-year-old has just over a year remaining on his West Ham contract and a £12.7m fee is deemed fair. Shame about the whole season-ending injury thing, though. Huge credit to Issa Diop. Came into the side at a crucial moment in the season and had a very good game tonight. Hopefully this gives him the platform to kick on now. Delighted for him. — Dan Woffenden (@danwoff98) April 14, 2022    PIERRE PRESSURE Newcastle might have all the money but, the excellent Bruno Guimaraes aside, their scouts are hardly branching out into those exotic corners of the world that such a budget naturally unlocks. Kieran, Chris, Dan and Matt are the first names of a forgettable Irish boyband that hopes to crack America but soon fades into obscurity, rather than the first signings of a football revolution. Without looking beyond the Premier League, the Magpies have landed upon another shiny trinket that Tottenham could deem worth offloading if the reported figures involved are accurate. The Daily Express suggest Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has attracted the attention of Eddie Howeand a £30m move could be pursued. Only Kane and Ben Davies have made more appearances for Tottenham under Antonio Conte but any squad reinforcement in north London will require sacrifices to be made first. Doubling their money on the Danish midfielder must be tempting. ",positive

It was revealed earlier this month that Premier League clubs are ‘tracking’ Hickey. The 19-year-old made his debut in senior football with Hearts. He signed for Italian side Bologna in 2020 for around £1.5m. England aren’t unique in abuse problem; football culture is toxic The left-back has played 38 times for Bologna in Serie A over the past two years. During the latest international break, Hickey made his senior debut for Scotland as Steve Clarke’s side drew 1-1 against Poland. After signing five new players in January, Newcastle are again expected to be busy in the transfer window this summer. Fabrizio Romano has revealed via Twitter that the Magpies are ‘interested’ in the young defender. Hickey is considered to be a ‘top talent’ and ‘other clubs are monitoring him closely. It is expected that he will cost Newcastle between £15-20m. Elsewhere, Newcastle are at the front of the queue for Sven Botman ahead of a potential summer move from Lille, according to reports. Botman was the Magpies number one defensive target in the winter transfer window but were unable to bring in the Netherlands under-21 international. It was a busy transfer window for the Geordies, nonetheless. They signed five players in total, spending £85m, eventually getting a central defender through the door in Brighton’s Dan Burn. But it now seems that Newcastle will attempt to sign Botman again ahead of the summer transfer window with Football Insider claiming the Geordies are still likely to beat AC Milan to his signing. The website insists that the Magpies are ‘in pole position to sign’ Botman this summer ‘for around £30million this summer even though he has agreed personal terms with AC Milan’. Botman is ‘still keen on signing for them and is eager to play in the Premier League’ and the Dutchman ‘remains a priority for Eddie Howe and the recruitment team as they look to recruit a top-class centre-back’. The report insists that offering ‘a satisfactory contract will not be a problem for Newcastle’ with the wealth at their disposal this summer and they are ‘confident that Botman will accept their contract offer after verbally agreeing personal terms earlier this year’. Newcastle believe they ‘can still win the race’ with Milan for the 22-year-old despite the Serie A side jumping the queue to agree personal terms. ",positive

282,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-england-not-unique-abuse-maguire-football-bulture-toxic,England aren’t unique in abuse problem; football culture is toxic,"England defender Harry Maguire was on the receiving end of abuse against Ivory Coast, but this is a poison that spreads beyond one culture. The booing started before kick-off at Wembley, and it’s plainly obvious that it had little or nothing to do with England. Ivory Coast didn’t put up a great deal of opposition in this friendly match, but Harry Maguire’s performance was reasonably accomplished; he had a hand in a goal and England kept a clean sheet without to much difficulty. Realistically speaking, Gareth Southgate wouldn’t have asked for anything more. But this is a distraction, really. It doesn’t matter how Maguire played for England in this match, and we know this definitively because the booing started before a ball had even been kicked, and most likely for reasons of club-related toxicity. And the temptation to examine his performance in view of this attempted pro-action, to try to criticise the abusers because a player didn’t play badly on this occasion, is to miss the point. Seeking to ‘disprove’ the booers by picking apart a player’s performance is giving their behaviour a level of validation that it doesn’t deserve. There is certainly a subset of football supporter for whom nothing will ever be good enough. We can speculate over the reasons why they might behave this way – the impact of video games which make the physically extremely difficult something that any idiot can do by pressing a handful of buttons at the same time? The malign influence of a society that amplifies the loudest and most extreme positions on any given subject, no matter how stupid they might be and which increasingly values infantilism over mental maturity? The possibility that high ticket prices engender a sense of entitlement that can never be satiated? Is it, as John Nicholson suggests, ‘just people who think they’ve paid their money and that gives them the right to abuse a player’? – but even understanding this is unlikely to change the behaviour of people for whom the sense of entitlement is already so high. Why, exactly, should any of us care about the motives of anybody who boos a player during – or, even more absurdly, before – a match for any reason other than to try and breed its worst excesses out of the game? Because the point at which people who might self-identify as ‘supporters’ are booing players before a match has even started is probably the point at which we need to turn our attention away from those who are being jeered and towards those who are doing the jeering. The ‘amount of money they earn’ doesn’t wash here. The culture of abuse goes on right the way down football’s food chain, from seasoned England internationals down to the level at which players aren’t earning any more than those who are watching them, while the extent to which referees are quitting the grassroots game because of the bullshit they have to put up with on a Sunday morning is causing a genuine existential crisis for youth and amateur football. Of course, it doesn’t help when people with reach in the media speak out against this sort of behaviour being unacceptable. Step forward Roy Keane, who said after the match that Maguire should “be big enough and man enough just to get on with the game”. Grrrr, yeah, just man up. Ignore the constant slew of vituperative abuse that follows you everywhere and just MAN UP. It’s a strange line of reasoning, to reach immediately for the idea that this is somehow the fault of the person on the receiving end of the abuse rather than the person witlessly throwing it around in the first place. It doesn’t sound like victim-blaming. It is victim-blaming.  But generally, the closer you get to the absolute heart of the game, the less abuse of players there is. The players all know better than to sling this sort of thing around, and the response to criticisms of abuse is always the same, an assumption that ‘ex-pros’ are just circling the wagons, when it seems altogether more likely that professional players know exactly how difficult playing the game at that level can be, and how such abuse can hurt. Indeed, it’s likely that quite a few of these abusers have little to no idea how difficult it all is, or just how good professional players actually are. Anybody who has spent more than 30 seconds on a pitch with any number of them will already be aware of this, but even those that are routinely denigrated as being ‘donkeys’ are capable of doing things with a football that those in the stands could only ever dream of replicating. It would be instructive (and likely cathartic, for those amongst us who are sick of this culture of disrespect and abuse) to put 11 abusers – a ‘troll’ is something subtly different; let’s stick to calling them what they actually are – up against 11 professional players and see what sort of state they’re in by the end of 90 minutes, or to turn up at their job and stand behind them offering imbecilic ‘advice’ and abuse all day. To be clear, this isn’t about England, or any specific player, even though the culture surrounding the England team can look especially toxic. Look at the replies to any tweet sent by a club or player and you’ll see a rainbow coalition of flags from all around the world. It isn’t about any one specific club, because it’s pretty much universal in that respect. And it isn’t specific to any particular age, either. There are plenty of examples of fully grown adults whose emotional incontinence after a football match has cost them their jobs after abusive messages they sent online blew up and found their way to their employers. And none of this is about mollycoddling players or deflecting criticism, either. We’re definitely not talking about constructive criticism here, and no-one would suggest that anybody should be immune from fair criticism. But the idea that that the amount of abuse that players routinely receive is (or even is meant to be) constructive in any way whatsoever is obviously ridiculous, and furthermore there is absolutely no-one on earth who clutches their pearls tighter than football supporters themselves when they’re on the receiving end of a perceived slight. In all honesty, football is little more than a reflection of the world in which it is situated, and it’s a world in which casual cruelty has become almost expected. We’ve probably all guilty of being insufferable on social media at some point or other, and we can all do better. But football’s culture does feel uniquely prone to bringing out the worst in people, with its combination of ever-increasing tribalism and the game being watched by a vast audience who are frequently kidded into believing that they understand it better than those who’ve spent years and years living and breathing it. And all of this can – should – provoke uncomfortable questions. Are men’s players fair game while women’s players aren’t? Is it reasonable to say that all verbal abuse is fair game while any form of physical assault is verboten? Isn’t racist verbal abuse acceptable if ‘all’ verbal abuse is acceptable? If this is about how much they earn (spoiler: no-one seriously believes it is), then where’s the line? Because abuse is ultimately a form of bullying, and the point at which people are seeking to defend those who act in this way is surely the point at which it’s all gone way too far. Unfortunately, it feels as though this pandora’s box opened a long time ago, and it will be near-impossible to close it again. ",positive

The right-back needed surgery on the injury he sustained in February, which came in just his fifth appearance since a £12million move from Atletico Madrid. “My recovery is going really well,” he told NUTV. “I am moving a lot better now, my ankle is not as tight anymore, so it has been really good progress since we have been here and I am looking forward to stepping up my recovery. “I am in a good place, I have been since I got injured. I am happy to be here and doing my rehab with the team and looking forward to coming back quickly. “I feel like that, I know my body, I know how my body is reacting and up to now everything I have been doing in the rehab room I have had no reaction so that is positive news. “I would like to be on the pitch as soon as possible but it was a break, so we have to take that into account. When I am feeling right and 100 per cent ready to play the manager will be the first to know. “I have got to take my time a bit because it was a serious injury and I have to be mindful of that but at the minute I am feeling positive.”  ",positive
284,https://www.football365.com/news/grading-each-championship-clubs-january-transfer-window-bournemouth,Grading each Championship club’s January transfer window,"Bournemouth caught the eye witha FIFA Career Mode madness while Stoke and QPR did good business. Barnsley – DRock bottom of the Championship and needing reinforcements across the board, the Tykes didn’t even make a signing until the final hours of the window with Moroccan midfielder Amine Bassi joining the sinking ship. The summer window – likely in League One – needs to be a huge one. Each of the three winter departures left with nary a tear shed from the Oakwell faithful.  Birmingham City – B A surprisingly fun transfer window from Birmingham, whose season has been rather tedious since a strong August. Juninho Bacuna is the only permanent arrival, but at 24, could prove to be a masterstroke of a midfield acquisition, while Onel Hernandez has started his temporary switch in great form and Lyle Taylor got off to the perfect start too. Losing loanees Dion Sanderson and Riley McGree will hurt, but they have been covered well.  Blackburn Rovers – B They didn’t lose Ben Brereton Diaz, so top marks for that. Joe Rothwell stayed too, albeit he may have burnt one too many bridges in wanting a move away from Ewood Park, but the hallmarks of the promotion-challenging side are there for the rest of the season. That can only be a good thing. Versatile attacker Ryan Hedges and the now injured Dilan Markanday are potentially very good incomings too.  Bournemouth – A I am sceptical as to whether doing a FIFA Career Mode madness can actually work in real life, but Bournemouth’s deadline day deals are fun and in these scientific gradings, that counts for a lot. Freddie Woodman has been one of the Championship’s outstanding goalkeepers in the last couple of years while Kieffer Moore offers competition and back-up for top scorer Dominic Solanke. Nat Philips should be playing Premier League football; after this window, that could come with the Cherries next season. Three more words: Todd flipping Cantwell.  Blackpool – B A relatively quiet month will be welcomed beside the seaside, with Josh Bowler staying at the club despite interest from Bournemouth, Fulham and Nottingham Forest. Incoming business was decent too. Jake Beesley gives the Tangerines another option up front and Owen Dale has plenty of potential on the wing. No huge outgoings made January a pleasurable ride for everyone of a Blackpool hue.  Bristol City – C+Timm Klose in. Tyreeq Bakinson out. It’s not bad, but it’s not great. A new defender was the priority and former Norwich centre-back Klose is certainly one of those.  Cardiff City – B+ Cardiff came into this transfer window looking dangerously over their shoulder at the relegation zone, so signing good players on loan as short-term plasters is as good a plan as any. Jordan Hugill scored on his debut and looked generally quite impressive, and Uche Ikpeazu could prove to be a good replacement for Kieffer Moore, but the Wales striker will be a big miss for the Bluebirds regardless. Alfie Doughty, Cody Drameh and Tommy Doyle could all be crucial in keeping Steve Morison’s side out of the bottom three too.  Coventry City – B-A very quiet month, but there will be few complaints with that. All the star players have stayed with the Sky Blues and defender Jake Bidwell improves their options at the back considerably. That will do nicely.  Derby County – D Almost impossible to grade given Derby have an impossible task to improve their squad, but it is almost certainly weaker at the end of the month than it was on New Year’s Day, with Phil Jagielka and Graeme Shinnie departing for deals at Stoke and Wigan respectively. There are bigger concerns at Pride Park, of course. Teenage starlet Luke Plange signed for Crystal Palace on the deadline but will remain with the Rams for the rest of the season – perhaps the best case scenario.  Fulham – B+One of the quietest windows in the country with no incomings and full-backs Steven Sessegnon and Cyrus Christie departing on loans with Plymouth and Swansea respectively. It was all about keeping the big hitters and they did that, Fabio Carvalho included.   Huddersfield Town – B A quiet month was put to rights by a busy deadline day in which the Terriers boosted their young and exciting squad with the acquisitions of goalkeeper Jamal Blackman joining the fourth Yorkshire team of his career, and then another Chelsea loanee in the highly rated Tino Anjorin. Midfielder Carel Eiting was the last man through the door, and to much fanfare given his performances on loan at the club in 2020/21.  Hull City – B+How the mood has changed on Humberside from the start of the window to its conclusion. Deadline day brought the arrivals of forwards Marcus Forss and Allahyar Sayyadmanesh, while the permanent signing of Brighton’s Ryan Longman put yet another spring in the step of Tigers everywhere. They waved goodbye to Josh Magennis and loanee Matt Smith, but Regan Slater takes the latter’s spot in the squad. These are exciting times for Hull.  Luton Town – B They kept hold of all their key players; for a team like Luton in a position of strength in midtable, that will do nicely. Simon Sluga was replaced between the sticks on deadline day by the more dependable Jed Steer, and that is pretty much that at Kenilworth Road. Sweet.  Middlesbrough – B- Riley McGree could prove to be a solid addition to Middlesbrough’s midfield options as the season progresses, while two of the most notable EFL transfers of the month were the dual loan signings of Premier League strikers Aaron Connolly and Folarin Balogun respectively, neither of whom have set the world alight in the early stages of their Boro careers. No big outgoings is the best news for Chris Wilder’s side.  Millwall – C+ Five more months of Jed Wallace is cause for celebration. Not much else to say, really.  Nottingham Forest – A- It has felt a little bit scattergun at times, and they missed out on primary target Josh Bowler, but Forest have improved their squad in both quality and quantity. Sam Surridge and Keinan Davis are both improvements on Lyle Taylor in Steve Cooper’s set-up, while Steve Cook is a good signing in defence as long as he never plays in a back two again. Jonathan Panzo is much more adept in that formation and like Surridge, has previous in working with Cooper.  Peterborough United – C- They have been the busiest of the Championship sides. In truth, they needed to be. Peterborough are no strangers to frantic transfer windows and this was no different. Genuine quality arrives in the form of versatile Bali Mumba on loan from Norwich and Jeando Fuchs in midfield. Too many signings here feel like good ones for League One though, which is exactly where the Posh will be next season if they’re not careful.  Preston North End – C Preston know they are safe in the league and have next to no chance of going up so it makes sense to have had a quiet month and focus on the second half of the season and the better value in the summer window when Ryan Lowe can make the squad his own. Aston Villa youngster Cameron Archer could catch the eye. Josh Harrop and Connor Wickham are the big leavers, but neither will be missed.  Queens Park Rangers – B Jordy de Wijs could be one of the biggest outgoings from the second tier in January, but the loan arrival of Wolves defender Dion Sanderson makes up for that tenfold. David Marshall has impressed having been brought in to cover for Seny Dieng at AFCON, and will provide great cover when the Senegalese stopper returns. Like the other front runners, the happiness comes from keeping the star performers at the club.  Reading – C Would have been worse on account of signing only a back-up goalkeeper but offloading flop George Puscas for £5million and getting his astronomical wages off the books is to be commended. As good as any signing the Royals could have hoped to make this window. Losing Andy Carroll to West Brom is a stinker though.  Sheffield United – B- A frustrating window as it appears Sheffield United have failed to come good on utilising the funds that the fans were assured could be spent. Charlie Goode on loan from Brentford is one of the best deals of the month, never mind deadline day, and he should slot in perfectly on the right side of that back three. ‘Keeper Adam Davies is a dam fine upgrade on departed duo Michael Verrips and Robin Olsen between the sticks too.  Stoke City – A- They needed a goalscorer, and they got it in Josh Maja. They needed a dynamic midfielder, and got it in Lewis Baker. Phil Jagielka provided expertise and experience at the back, while Aston Villa loanee Jaden Philogene-Bidace will offer plenty of magic. It’s hard to be disgruntled when you tick most of the boxes you need in a typically difficult month to do so.  Swansea City – D+ Unlike Stoke, Swansea had boxes to tick and outside of Hannes Wolf and potentially Cyrus Christie, it feels like they haven’t checked them as well as they might have done. They might do well to wait until the summer with neither relegation a worry nor promotion a realistic hope, but it was an underwhelming month, save for ‘keeper Andrew Fisher joining former boss Russell Martin from MK Dons.  West Bromwich Albion – D Well that was almost – almost – as depressing as their season to date. Daryl Dike was supposed to be their season’s and Valerien Ismael’s saviour, but an eight week spell on the sidelines now beckons. Andy Carroll is the slightly less exciting replacement to score goals, but there are far more problems in this Baggies squad which haven’t been addressed. Promotion is looking even less likely now than it was at the start of the window. ",positive
285,https://www.football365.com/news/aston-villa-reject-three-bids-douglas-luiz-arsenal-admirers,Aston Villa reject three bids for star with Arsenal known ‘admirers’,"Aston Villa have turned down three bids for Douglas Luiz during the January transfer window, according to reports. Luiz is into his third season at Villa Park after joining fromManchester Cityin 2019 and has impressed immensely. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is thought to be an admirer, while Manchester City have reportedly even made attempts to bring him back to the club since his departure. January 2022 Premier League transfer window: the winners It was reported in November that he wanted to leave the club amid interest from Roma, while Arsenal and Newcastle have been linked with moves in the January transfer market. And now The Athletic reports that Aston Villa ‘have rejected three offers’ for the midfielder in January ‘with the most recent offer made on transfer deadline day’. It is understood that ‘the Premier League club want to keep the midfielder and tie him down to a new long-term contract’ despite ‘admirers at both Arsenal and Newcastle United’. And former Premier League striker Kevin Phillips predicted that Luiz would stay put on deadline day despite the interest in him. Phillips told Football Insider earlier today: “I don’t think he’ll leave today. “Luiz is a big player for Aston Villa. I cannot see a situation where Steven Gerrard would let him go, to be honest. “He probably suits the style of play at Arsenal. Arteta likes them to play out of the back and Luiz likes to get on the ball. “But at this moment in time I don’t think he’ll leave Villa, even if they bring another midfielder in. “I think it is something they may reassess in the summer if the player wants to leave but right now, it’s a non-starter for me. I cannot see him leaving.” And Phillips thinks Aston Villa are the big winners of the January transfer window in the Premier League, he added: “They are the big winners this window, in my opinion. The business Steven Gerrard and Aston Villa have done so far is just amazing. Hats off to the board for backing Steven. “Steven has clearly had an impact in terms of the players the club can attract. Villa is a massive club, of course, but this calibre of signing hasn’t been seen at the club in a long time. The club is moving in the right direction. “To bring the players in they have had, with the possibility of a couple more coming in… 1000 per cent Villa have had the best window. “It has put them in a position where they could challenge for European football.” ",positive
286,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-worthing-finally-get-the-promotion-they-deserve-at-the-third-time-of-asking-george-dowell,The extraordinary tale of Worthing and a promotion at last,"Few clubs were hit harder by the pandemic than Worthing – of the Isthmian League – but this promotion is just one chapter of a bigger story. Having already wrapped up the Isthmian League Premier Division championship, they’ve had to make the last two home matches of the season for Worthing FC all-ticket. The capacity of The Crucial Environmental Stadium is frequently listed at 4,000, but is likely to be capped at around 2,600 for these two matches, and Worthing have already had two crowds of more than 2,000 this season for league derbies against Bognor Regis Town and Horsham. It’s a celebration that’s been a long time coming. On March 26 2020, Worthing were seven points clear at the top of the same division, when it was decided to abandon the league season with no promotion or relegation. When the 2020/21 season was also abandoned, they’d only played eight games of the season, but Worthing were still top of the table, having played three games fewer than second-placed Cheshunt. But this story stretches back 12 years. George Dowell was 17 years old at the time, and had just broken into the Worthing first-team squad, when he was in the passenger seat of a car that flipped off the bend in the road between Worthing and nearby Arundel. George broke his neck, two vertebrae in his back, and severed his spinal cord, leaving him paralysed from the chest down, while his friends walked away with only minor injuries. When the compensation money for his life-altering injuries came through in 2015, Dowell decided to buy into his local football club, after hearing that it was more than £200,000 in debt and possibly heading towards bankruptcy. But his investment into the club didn’t end with paying down that debt. It’s known that he’s spent more than £600,000 since, and it might be as much as a million pounds. But this money hasn’t merely been frittered away. The ground has had a 3g artificial pitch installed, which allows for seven-day use, while considerable refurbishments have been carried out, especially to the main stand, where the bar has also been completely refurbished. The town has reacted. Ten years ago, crowds at Woodside Road weren’t often much higher than a couple of hundred, but this season the average has been 1,270, a figure that will likely grow further with two celebratory matches left to play. And it is noticeable from home matches that this is a relatively young and mixed crowd, a lot of fathers with young children (I should know, occasionally being one of them), but also a large number of teenagers and young adults. Worthing’s somewhat staid reputation as a town is seldom on display come three o’clock on a Saturday afternoon. This level of community engagement is important. The Premier Division of the Isthmian League is the regional third tier of the non-league game; as its winners, Worthing will start next season in the National League South. At this level of the game, there is no television money unless you chance upon a run in the FA Cup, so match-day revenues are all-important in a way that hasn’t quite been the case in the EFL or remotely the case in the Premier League for some considerable time. Gate receipts are important, but the same goes for food and drink sales too.  Worthing run a very successful youth and academy set-up, and have a women’s team play their home matches at Woodside Road on Sunday afternoons. All of this is playing the role that a football club should be fulfilling within its local community, and this in turn creates vital revenue for the club. That Worthing’s average home attendance is the highest in the division by more than 50% puts the club in a decent position to be able to compete, financially, while functioning as a true hub for the local community. It has started to become something of a virtuous circle, and since the lockdown restrictions ended it has felt across the whole of the non-league game as though there is a desire on the part of a lot of people, after more than a year’s enforced separation from others, to come together as a community. This season started slowly, with two defeats from their first four matches and a very early elimination from the FA Cup at the hands of Corinthian-Casuals, but when Worthing started to get into gear, they looked unstoppable. Three wins from their last three matches would see them bring up 100 points from 42 league games, and since they’ve won nine of their last ten in the league, this seems far from impossible. Amongst their number this season has been Dean Cox, who made almost 150 appearances for Brighton & Hove Albion and more than 200 for Leyton Orient, and whose experience will be invaluable behind the scenes, even if his playing time has been limited. The headline-grabber this season has been Ollie Pearce, who’s the league’s top scorer with 34 goals. The team is managed by Adam Hinshelwood, who’s now in his second spell as the club’s manager, a period which already spans seven years, even though Hinshelwood doesn’t even turn 40 until 2024. Hinshelwood’s determination is admirable. It would have been easy to become disheartened by the two seasons that ended up cancelled when they were at the top of the table, but Hinshelwood has stuck by the club and the club has stuck by him. It’s been extremely beneficial for all concerned. What happened to George Dowell was a tragedy, of that there is no question, but Dowell can at least take considerable satisfaction from what he’s been able to give back to his hometown football club in the years since then. Brighton is 15 miles from Worthing, and although the local railway station still throngs with people in blue-and-white scarves on a Saturday lunchtime when the Albion are at home, the town itself is far enough from its bigger neighbour to have its own distinct personality. Having a successful local football club can be a highly beneficial part of that, and Worthing is a better place for everything that Dowell has done for it. Few other clubs will have deserved a promotion at the end of this season than this one. ",positive

The Blues’ owner put the club up for sale, setting a £3bn asking price while also writing off the £1.5bn debt the club owe him. Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI… However, the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Abramovich’s sanctions mean that all of his assets have been frozen with Chelsea able to operate under a special license. According to The Times, Chelsea have told the government, and rival bidders for the club’s ownership, that they want to restructure the way the Premier League club is being sold. This would include paying off debt from Chelsea’s parent company Fordsham Ltd to a Jersey-based companyCamberley International Investments, which appears to have links to Abramovich. There are, unsurprisingly, concerns over whether this will be allowed to happen due to Abramovich’s UK sanctions. If Roman Abramovich now wants his £1.6bn loan paid back as @TimesSport is reporting, then Chelsea have a huge existential problem UK Govt have always insisted this can’t/won’t happen Clock is ticking on May 31st deadline but it’s more serious than a complex delay…. — Rob Draper (@draper_rob) May 3, 2022 Ministers have been under the impression that all proceeds from the sale would go to the government who would provide it to many causes, including helping those affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as grassroots football in the UK. When Abramovich announced that he would put the club up for sale, he said in a statement:“I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid.” However, the oligarch is reportedly claiming that the sanctions are stopping him from writing off the debt, with the government expected to challenge him on this. Chelsea’s special licence runs out on May 31, with a sale needing to be agreed before then. It is widely expected that the government will not extend the deadline. The Raine Group and Chelsea have both expected the sale to remain on course to meet that deadline. Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly’s consortium bid is understood to have been selected as preferred bidder by the Raine Group, the New York merchant bank overseeing Chelsea’s sale. Boehly has edged ahead of bids from Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca to receive the preferred bidder status that inches the US tycoon ever closer to a takeover.

But crucially, Ratcliffe never categorically ruled himself out of a bid for the Blues. Chelsea chiefs are understood to have anticipated a bid from Ratcliffe, the 69-year-old petrochemicals boss who bought Ligue 1 club Nice in 2019. Stamford Bridge bosses had not expected Ratcliffe to make such a late, dramatic entrance into the race however, with the British tycoon understood to have met with Blues chairman Bruce Buck on Thursday. The Raine Group has overseen the sale process for Chelsea, with the New York merchant bank yet to comment on Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Boehly’s expected status as preferred bidder. Eldridge Industries chairman and chief executive Boehly now stands in pole position to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. But it is understood there would be nothing to stop Abramovich and Chelsea striking a deal with Ratcliffe, other than the race against time. Chelsea need the sale complete by the end of May, after Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10. The Russian-Israeli billionaire put the Blues officially up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street then claimed to have proven Abramovich’s links to Russian president Vladimir Putin when sanctioning the 55-year-old. Chelsea have been forced to operate under strict Government licensing terms since Abramovich’s sanctions, and the Treasury will have to ratify the club’s sale as the final step in the eventual takeover deal. Boehly has paired up with fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital in his consortium offer for the Blues.

Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale at the start of March before being hit by sanctions by the UK government. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star He had his assets frozen as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, due to his alleged ties with president Vladimir Putin.

After being linked with buyingTurkish Super Lig outfit Goztepe, Abramovich has now made an offer to buy La Liga side Valencia, as per Plaza Deportivo (via Sport Witness). Rival bidder Miguel Zorio claims that current Valencia owner Peter Lim has leaked the Russian oligarch’s bid to the media. “Peter Lim has tried to sell the club in London for 250 million euros and has not succeeded,”Zorio is reported as saying. “Lately, he has leaked to international media that he has two purchase offers, mine and that of the Russian oligarch of Chelsea. “And from here, I tell him that either he puts 50 million every year to compensate for the losses he generates or he sells to us.

The 25-year-old has been in and out the team at the King Power Stadium this season but has managed 21 Premier League starts, scoring an impressive eight goals and contributing four assists for his team-mates. Arsenal have been the main club interested in Maddison over the last year or two with many reports linking the former Norwich City star to the Emirates Stadium. A report last Sunday said that Leicester were ‘considering’ the sale of Maddison this summer in order to raise funds to strengthen their squad. The Foxes have failed to build on back-to-back fifth place finishes in the Premier League with Brendan Rodgers’ side currently sitting in tenth position. And a sale of Maddison would help them bring in reinforcements. The Sun now claim that Tottenham ‘are ready to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for Maddison in the summer transfer window with Leicester looking for a fee in the region of £60m. Spurs have ‘genuine interest’ after allowing Dele Alli to leave for Everton in January, while Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele also left on temporary deals. It is understood Antonio Conte ‘is a fan of Maddison and keen to increase his attacking options’ but a move could be dependent on Spurs being able to sell Lo Celso or Ndombele.  MBAPPE BLOW SEES REAL SWITCH TARGET Real Madrid are ready to renew their efforts to sign Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland, according to reports. Haaland is extremely likely to be on the move this summer when his£68m release clause becomes active in the summer transfer window. There have been many months of speculation surrounding where the Dortmund striker will end up with Man City recently emerging as the favourites to land him. His record of 80 goals in 84 appearances since moving to the Bundesliga side means most clubs in world football would be happy to have him and now the Daily Mirror claims that Real Madrid ‘have launched a new charm offensive’ to beat Man City to the signing of Haaland.

The Chelsea owner and at least two senior Ukrainian peace negotiators were said to have experienced symptoms of suspected poisoning, including red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands. Spare Ukraine the ignominy of a World Cup we all should boycott… Abramovich suffered the symptoms after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, sources close to the situation said. Russian-Israeli billionaire Abramovich and the others who fell ill have since recovered, with the 55-year-old Chelsea chief continuing his efforts for peace in Ukraine. Abramovich is understood to have been working to help set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of Ukrainians, amid the Russian invasion. The Chelsea owner has also been attempting to help bring representatives from other countries to the table for peace talks. Abramovich, who put the Blues up for sale on March 2, was sanctioned by the Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. The Stamford Bridge club must operate under strict Government licence, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. Downing Street must approve another new licence to authorise Chelsea’s eventual sale, with the money either frozen or distributed to charitable funds to aid victims of the war in Ukraine. Abramovich has pledged to write off Chelsea’s £1.5billion debt, and the bidding frenzy for the club could see the eventual deal hit £3billion. Chelsea’s sale has reached the point where four bidding consortiums have made a shortlist, drawn up by the Raine Group, the New York merchant bank overseeing the process. ",negative

Bale joined the Spanish giants for £90m in 2013 after a terrific spell with Tottenham Hotspur. Man City and Liverpool await face-off after friendly fire He has won four Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles, scoring 106 goals in 258 appearances across all competitions for Los Blancos. Despite his success at the Santiago Bernabeu, Bale has never managed to endear himself to the Real Madrid fanbase. Last month, Spanish newspaper Marca were very critical of the Welshman, describing him as a ‘parasite’over their perception that he is robbing the club by running down his contract. Bale has struggled with injuries in recent seasons and has missed numerous games this term. He has made seven appearances for Madrid in 2021/22. Gareth Bale laughed off the jeers from the home fans yesterday What does he have to do to prove himself🤔 pic.twitter.com/mrmdqQuHBe — FootballJOE (@FootballJOE) April 10, 2022 Match-going Real fans have always had a difficult relationship with Bale, doubting the winger’s commitment to the club. The 32-year-old made his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, coming off the bench in the 74th minute of Madrid’s 2-0 win over Getafe on Saturday. He was met with boos and whistles by some of the home crowd, with Ancelotti laughing off his reception, insisting that he – like Bale – was not concerned. “It didn’t bother me that he was whistled at,” Ancelotti said (via 90min) after Bale’s first home appearance in 654 days. “He’s training well and he wants to work hard and help the team. That’s the most important thing. We need everyone and it’s very important for the fans and the players to be united.” Bale is out of contract at the end of the season and is widely expected to leave on a free transfer. Meanwhile,Alphonso Davies hinted that Cristiano Ronaldo should be Man Utd captain after mocking the club’s decision to appoint Harry Maguire as skipper. “Can you guys imagine [that] you’re Ronaldo, right?”Davies said on hisTwitchchannel.“One of the greatest players ever, in the 21st century. “Harry Maguire is your captain. You refer to him as captain – I don’t know what he says to him.” The Bayern Munich left-back added: “I’m not dissing Harry Maguire, but Ronaldo should get the armband, man.” ",positive
294,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-man-utd-three-physical-players,Mailbox: Man Utd only have three physical players,"Thank you for your mails on Manchester United and more. Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com Man Utd can’t tackle or won’t tackle I have to say week in week out I find myself agreeing with what Rangnick says, let’s be honest most non-blinkered fans can see it too but I respect him for saying it and not the usual boring defence of a team failing. United are weak physically and mentally. Since refs allowed tackling back into the game United have TANKED and it’s easy to see why – Ronaldo the greatest header of a ball ever hasn’t won a header outside the box all season, doesn’t even try and forget tackling, Bruno doesn’t tackle, Pogba can’t sprint or tackle, Sancho not the hardest grafter, Rashford, Martial, Fred, Dalot. In fact the only payers with any physicality are McTominay, Shaw and I guess slabhead (who can’t run). I can see what Ralf says about signing players who see United as a step up the way Liverpool bought Mane, Salah, Robertson, Virgil etc. But we have done that – Wan Bissaka, Schneidelin, Dalot, Maguire, Telles etc. Hasn’t worked out too great. I think look closer to home, use the youth set up that’s doing great things by all accounts. We’ve arguably had more success with those coming up through the ranks – McTominay, Elanga, Henderson (potentially), Garner, Lingard and Rashford have had their moments. Give Mejbri, Shoretire, Hugill – least they’ll put the effort in which has to be the starting point for United right now sadly. Dave Teacake  Musings on Spurs v Newcastle …no doubt the right players will get the right praise/condemnation but there are a few players I feel need a quick shout after a fantastic win for the Spurs! * It’ll probably get said elsewhere, but if any PFM thinks the game has got less physical, just watch Romero, jeez, I could watch him crunch into tackles all day long. * Lucas and Stevie B may not get much game time but they are such an important part of the squad, Paratici needs to pull out a charm offensive to make sure they don’t seek a move away; we’re constantly told football is a squad game, two players for every position etc etc, Fabio, keep that in mind! * Although if he can sign us a free-kick merchant that’d be great. Sure, Kane scored one in 2014, and Dier in 2016, but if that’s all the success you need to get the job then I’m fairly certain even my old man could get the gig. Sonny takes the corners, why not try him on free-kicks too? * Don’t you dare make me dream Antonio, don’t you dare! Jerome, Bristol Spur  Man City wins don’t hurt Man United In answer to MAW’s question in the morning mailbox, it’s quite simple; everyone else is a rival, Liverpool are the enemy. I’d rather City win 10 in a row than Liverpool win 1, I’d hope they felt the same about us! The thing is, City’s successes can be brushed off. Firstly, the funding of the club. If Abu Dhabi ever stepped back, then they’re back to being mid table at best. Secondly, they don’t have the fan base, which means they don’t get much column inches. A Liverpool title win would get ten times the coverage a City treble would. Then think about the gulf in the amount of tweets and posts it would get on the socials. What’s especially galling about Liverpool’s current success is that it’s come about through good management from top to bottom. Over £40m for Brewster and Solanke when Phil Jones has another year on his contract? God I miss the days of them trying to convince themselves that Andriy Voronin or Jermaine Pennant would be the missing piece in the jigsaw… Lewis, Busby Way  Alisson is brilliant but… Whilst I completely agree Alisson is one of the best in the world – a lot of people seem to be overlooking the clear offside for that Watford ‘chance’ on Saturday before Jota scores. When the through ball comes the player is half a yard off, thanks, mainly to Van Dijk and Matip’s excellent line. The real winner there is, unbelievably, the rule of not putting the flag up immediately – as the save from Alisson then allows the quick counter. But as for the ‘could be behind, now one nil up’ it’s nonsense. The reality is, could have a freekick, now one up. Sky ignored it on Saturday. It’s a nice story though, eh? Marc   On Neville and Arteta Good article from Matthew Stead regarding Gary Neville’s nonsense about Arsenal. I would take issue with the headline though. The last thing we want is more Gary Nevilles. Aidan Boyce, Wexford Let’s all laugh at Everton I’m not saying its been a long time since Everton last scored at Stamford Bridge but…. Christian Eriksen has scored there, moved to Italy, scored a hatrick, won Serie A, died, come back to life, returned to the PL and scored there again in between then and now. Happy Monday Toffees! Andy West CTID  Blame the monarchy I’ve been saying this for years but we live in a Capitalist Dictatorship. Democracy is simply an illusion to give us proles the feeling that we matter. Football is the perfect example of this. Talking about British history like Tim is, I mean, there is just so much imperialist/oppressive/racist people like that who defend the empire and the monarchy to the death, but why? (and why pretend they’re speaking for everyone?) The government reports to the queen: A queen that is never interviewed or held to account A queen that gives us options of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn A queen whose Crown Estate dominates the financial markets in order to keep her in wealth and power Until we remove the capitalist dictator in power, you will all continue to be ruled by corporations, at the behest of the queen. There is no democracy, only corporate values and corporate control. All the bills go up, I mean why are people so surprised? Get off your imperial, racist, oppressive high horses and become a republican (not the American one) and start a new movement where we have no oppressive monarchy. We can create a sovereign wealth fund that benefits the country and not just the queen and her cronies. Fat Man (Monday rant over)  Fanmail for Tim I appreciate this is a football website, but can someone explain to Tim that the 800 years of British rule of Ireland, including the genocide of the Irish during the great famine is not the same as some apparent slave raiding of the coast of Britain. For the record, those of us born after the troubles in the North (millennials or generation z) generally don’t feel negative or condone anti British sentiment. We like to see you lose in international football & rugby, mainly due to the narrative that is created around these events. (Footballs coming home) and all that nonsense. Think Roy Keane during the Euros. But lets not pretend there is no history between our countries, or create a false narrative that little old England was pillaged by Ireland some time in the past. Mark, Dublin  …May I suggest that Tim takes his own advice and read a few history books – and possibly a dictionary – before writing on such false equivalences. Neill, Ireland  …Quick right to reply please on Qatar and my mail: * I’m not saying Qatar shouldn’t be criticised. It’s just hilarious coming from the English and those representing them. So long as you are happy for Qatar and the rest of the world to protest the next tournament England host then I’m cool with that. Same rules for everyone. Maybe we can have a retrospective protest for the made-up Iraq war. Remember that one, I don’t recall anyone asking for England to be removed from any sporting competitions. Sound bloke Tony Blair, the bloke whose party you happily voted for? Cool Britannia? Hundreds of thousands of dead. You’ve forgotten than one haven’t you… you’re still benefitting from it… Tony Blair is back trying to influence the country… nothing to see here… just a war criminal happily shaping the direction the country goes… * Yes you are guilty of your government’s policy. As my mail said. YOU VOTE FOR THESE PEOPLE. You however choose to give more importance to education, taxes, infrastructure and don’t care about your foreign destruction. Perhaps next time an MP calls to your door, ask them if they support British foreign wars and the manufacturing of weapons of huge destruction. Maybe that should be a priority of the British voter? Or just ask them about the potholes on your roads… whatever suits… * Tim mentions Britain being one of the most tolerant societies in the world. It sure is. That’s why I made the point that this outrage should not be confined to within one’s own borders. The reason you have such a great society is due to the pillaging of nations all around the world. Your entire foundations are built on oppression. Hence why you have statues of Winston Churchill a man hailed only as a hero in England, yet responsible for numerous atrocities around the world. But let’s just focus on WW2, don’t talk about the rest… Sssssshhhhh. * If the poppy does indeed “commemorate the fallen”, perhaps stop wheeling out the old British WW2 legends (and they ARE legends) as the embodiment of the poppy and give a bit more airtime to those killed by British soldiers. Maybe next time James McLean gets booed for not wearing a poppy, one of the commentators could explain the absolute rock-solid logic for him not wearing it. Perhaps hold those booing him accountable. Or is anti-Irish racism still cool? I guess it’s just the banality of evil. We are all guilty of it, from eating violently farmed meat, to wearing fast fashion, to owning mobile phones that cost the same as a months wages in the 3rd world. We are all guilty of it. It’s good to take a look in the mirror from time to time. Suck it up, your past/present ain’t pretty. Don’t waste time defending it. Change it. Vote for a party/person that brings in refugees from the lands you pillaged. Vote for a politician that stops the continuation of the war machine. Dare iIsay it… vote for someone not educated in Eton and is actually a normal human. Or don’t, Your choice. You live in a fabulous democracy. Peace Out Shz ",positive

298,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-rudiger-and-son-play-as-though-they-love-football-and-that-matters,Rudiger and Son play as though they love football; that matters,"Players like Antonio Rudiger and Son Heung Min play with a style and freedom that says something about their love for the game. The moment came during the first half of the Premier League match between West Ham United and Chelsea in December, when the ball fell to Antonio Rudiger who, despite being a distance from the West Ham goal that made what followed optimistic, attempted a shot on goal that ballooned hopelessly over the crossbar, before running impishly back to his correct position, chuckling to himself like a naughty schoolboy. Football, we can all agree, takes itself too seriously these days, but a slow creep over a couple of decades has normalised what we really should consider beyond parody. The Champions League has an anthem, as if UEFA is a nation state. Before the start of Premier League matches, when the teams take to the pitch, the referee takes the match ball from a ceremonial plinth, like an offering to the Gods of Football, only in reverse. The Soccer Saturday music is severe enough that you half expect Jeff Stelling to announce that war has been declared on China rather than tell us about Carlisle United’s third goal at Harrogate Town. The Championship play-off final is The £200m Match while the FA Cup languishes because success can increasingly only be interpreted as an amount of money, while history, tradition and continuity’s lack of intrinsic value renders it redundant. We’re even hitting a tipping point at which competition doesn’t matter as much as size, when it comes to deciding who gets to play elite-level European club football. A little something has to be tossed to the richest clubs. They might pick up and their ball and go home otherwise. So in amongst all this gloom – it’s fair to say that we live in a society that is increasingly fine-tuning its ability to make us angry and to take everything in bad faith – a player who can let that mask slide for a moment, someone who looks as though there is nothing on this goddam earth that he would rather be doing right now than play football, feels like a palate cleanser. Antonio Rudiger’s delighted face was a welcome change of view from the self-regarding, preening and gurning faces that hog the back pages of our newspapers and our television screens.  The same goes for Son Heung Min. The speed of acceleration with the ball at his feet, the finishing, and the unerring ability to pick out his strike partner as if by radar are all well and good, but it’s the extent to which he plays as though he loves football that really makes him stand out. It brings a sense of freedom and exhilaration to the way he plays. When he’s running through a defence to get on the end of a pass, the space opens up in front of him, and even the incredible athleticism has to take second place to the style with which it’s all put together. There have always been players who just so happened to be extremely good at football but had mixed feelings about the game. David Batty is the example that always springs immediately to mind, quite likely because his ascent to the top of the professional game came at a time when football was becoming fashionable again for the first time in decades, meaning that the background noise often felt like an arm’s race to declare one’s fandom. But even this can be charming to see. Gareth Bale may be annoying Real Madrid at the moment (and everybody knows that irritating the superclubs is good for a little low humour – sorry guys, but that’s just the little price you have to pay for all that winning), but there’s no doubt that he is living his best life. It’s not that he doesn’t like football; it’s just that when he’s not playing, he’d rather be playing golf. And given that, at 32 years old and with a history of injuries, he’s well and truly into the autumn of his playing career and is probably fairly comfortable with shrugging his shoulders at the outbursts from the Spanish press. Football clubs commoditise players; it’s their entire business model. There’s nothing wrong with that dynamic being turned on its head every now and again.  But the footballer who plays the game like they love playing the game is a joy forever. They’re one of the most important connections between the team and the supporters, and the supporters know by instinct who they are. They’re secure enough in their ability to be able to allow themselves to smile. There has long been this idea in football that there has to be some sort of cruelty or some sort of physical pain in order to succeed, as though that is the sacrifice that a player has to make in order to get to the top of the game, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Furrowing their brows and puffing their cheeks out like a bull waiting to take on a matador works for some, and it’s hardly as though these players aren’t beloved too. Supporters love that level of commitment. But the players who love the game are instantly recognisable because we see ourselves in them. It’s a different kind of commitment but it’s valuable all the same. ",positive
299,https://www.football365.com/news/ricketts-family-bid-for-chelsea-entirely-funded-by-cash,Ricketts family bid for Chelsea entirely funded by cash,"The Ricketts family’s, one of the four remaining bidder to buy Chelsea, are entirely funding their bid by cash. The Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts are among the final four bidders looking to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. How best to protest greed and human-rights abuses in Qatar… The Ricketts, for whom siblings Tom and Laura are fronting the family’s candidacy, have been adding advisory partners in fine-tuning their bid ahead of the April 11 deadline for improved offers, but were understood to have no need of extra investment. US hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin has added his significant personal financial clout behind the Ricketts’ bid. And it is understood the Ricketts’ offer involves no equity whatsoever, which underpins the family’s drive to keep Chelsea at the world game’s pinnacle. The Ricketts’ proposal for a cash purchase would allow the Cubs owners to take the Blues forward unencumbered, should their bid prove successful. Chelsea fans have launched a sustained social media protest against the Ricketts’ candidacy, and are planning in-person protests at Stamford Bridge ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash with Brentford. But the Ricketts family are understood to be determined to allay the main fears among those protesting Blues supporters. Tom Ricketts has already held meetings and had conversations with prominent Chelsea supporters and groups, and will continue those efforts. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Russia President Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special Government licence to continue operating, though under strict terms. Abramovich cannot profit from Chelsea’s sale, but had already vowed to write off the club’s £1.5billion debt. As well as the Ricketts family, the remaining contenders looking to buy the club are LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and British business titan Jonathan Goldstein, Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. All four bidders are busy sharpening their submissions, and could yet raise the value of their offers for the Blues. Tom Ricketts last week met with Paul Canoville, Chelsea’s first black player, to apologise for father Joe Ricketts’ historic Islamophobic comments and set out his stall for the Stamford Bridge club’s future. Tom and Laura Ricketts have worked hard to build links with Chicago’s Muslim community after Joe’s comments from 2019. Brother Pete Ricketts has been linked to anti-LGBTQ sentiment, but is not involved in either the Chelsea bid or the Cubs. Laura Ricketts in contrast is the first openly gay owner of a major American sports franchise in her co-chair role at the Cubs. A major campaigner for LGBTQ rights, Laura Ricketts is a member of the Barack Obama Foundation’s Inclusion Council and has received long-standing backing from the former US President. The rival bidders for Chelsea will have the chance to meet with Stamford Bridge club executives next week, and potentially even manager Thomas Tuchel. When asked on Friday if he would meet the bidders, Tuchel replied: “I’m not sure if they want to and I’m not sure if I should! “I don’t know if it’s a good idea or a bad idea. Maybe it’s best to be involved, if I am involved, as late as possible. “I’m not sure if I could tell you the names of the consortiums and new bidders. “It is my information that it is down to four and in the next weeks there should be further talks and negotiations.” ",positive
300,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-gone-backwards-manchester-united-grealish,Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season,"Manchester United could account for the entirety of this list of players who have regressed the most this season in comparison to last. 10) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa) The permanent distraction of just how much Arsenal mistreated him has finally disturbed the previously solid foundations upon which Emiliano Martinez built his second phase as a goalkeeper. After perennial loan spells underpinned his formative years, the 29-year-old crammed an entire Gunners career into three summer 2020 months: he broke into the team due to injury during lockdown, impressed massively, won two cup finals at Wembley and parlayed that into a £17m transfer to become guaranteed first choice elsewhere. Aston Villa benefited from that decision last season but this campaign has been a climbdown. Martinez has not been poor, just more middling in comparison to his previously high standards. His save percentage of 76.8% in 2020/21 was second only to Nick Pope’s 77%; it has crashed to 67.3% and the Argentina international ranks higher than just three other Premier League regulars in that respect. Tim Krul, Jordan Pickford and Illan Meslier can all point to extenuating circumstances but Villa are on course for a top-half finish despite Martinez’s stock falling below that of Jose Sa and Arsenal successor Aaron Ramsdale.  9) Jack Grealish (Manchester City) “I’ve found it a lot more difficult than I thought I would, adapting to a different manager and teammates. At first I thought I’d have more of the ball, get more assists and goals but it doesn’t work like that at all. I’ve had nowhere near as much of the ball as I used to get at Villa.” Since that charmingly frank interview in December, Jack Grealish has added just two more goals to his collection. His last assist remains a well-executed run and pass on the counter against Brighton last October. The numbers pale in comparison to those that were posted at Villa to tempt Manchester City into signing the first nine-figure British player. As he has belatedly recognised, there is added nuance to taking a big fish out of a small pond and placing them in an ocean; they cannot be expected to perform to the same standard or produce to a similar degree. But Grealish must be hoping his second season echoes those of Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez, Joao Cancelo and others who needed a bedding-in period under Pep Guardiola, because the sense of him having taken a step back in terms of performance will linger.  8) Harry Kane (Tottenham) Eight goals and three assists in nine games for club and country doth not remove the vague early-season stench of injury, managerial upheaval, tactical misguidance and existential crisis. Harry Kane has avoided the usual hamstring and ankle problems but the Nuno Espirito Santo experiment made for a patently and potently awful combination with that bungled Manchester City move and the striker’s form was understandably impacted. Kane has been ushered back to the straight and narrow by Antonio Conte, revitalising his partnership with Heung-min Son and enjoying his football again. But the leading Premier League goalscorer and assist provider of last season is currently a distant joint-third for the former and 14th, level with Kiko Femenia, for the latter. Imagine only scoring at an average of a goal every other game and not every match and a half. Absolutely pathetic.  7) Tomas Soucek (West Ham) The sight of Tomas Soucek lurking in the penalty area, inexplicably losing whichever defender was assigned to mark the 6ft 4ins Czech international and redirecting Michail Antonio’s cross into the Wolves net last month was simultaneously rare and familiar. It was something to which we had all grown accustomed not long ago, yet a sight far less common than it used to be. David Moyes purposefully neutered his thoroughbred to provide a platform for their partner. “We can’t allow them both to make runs into the box,” he said in September of midfield pair Soucek and Declan Rice, “so we need to have a bit of understanding that one stays deeper than the other”. The Englishman has tried wholeheartedly to assume that mantle and Soucek’s sacrifice has not gone to waste in a Champions League qualification charge and run into the deeper stages of the Europa League knockouts. Moyes has also swapped their roles back at times. But the Czech’s attacking numbers have suffered, his expected and actual numbers both crashing season upon season.  6) Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester) Brendan Rodgers took his time to discover the answer but wasted little in largely ignoring it. An attacking succession plan was devised last season whereby Leicester need not rely solely on Jamie Vardy any longer. Kelechi Iheanacho was carefully placed next to the club’s talisman as a slightly deeper second striker, capable of playing both through and between the lines instead of focusing purely on runs on the shoulder of the last defender. It expanded their forward play, evolved it. Iheanacho ended the campaign with 12 Premier League goals, 11 of which came from March onwards, and Rodgers complemented that development with the signing of Patson Daka. Yet Iheanacho has been a peripheral figure at best since. His 15 starts have been unevenly distributed and 13 Leicester players have featured more regularly. Considering Vardy, James Maddison and Harvey Barnes have all been absent through injury at various points, often concurrently, the seeming lack of trust in Iheanacho has been peculiar.  5) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) The line of argument that Cristiano Ronaldo is not the Manchester United problem but certainly one of many issues can be diluted into one simple point: Bruno Fernandes has been utterly nullified. His overall record last season was 28 goals and 17 assists in 48 appearances. With a maximum of nine fixtures to come, that has become nine goals and 14 assists in 37 games. Save for a seminal final month or so, it has been a stark downturn. A basic reduction in his role as chief Manchester United protagonist has removed the spotlight under which Fernandes thrived. Ronaldo is the story and his compatriot a mere sub-plot at best, diminishing his natural inclination for brilliance. There have been glimpses – the Leeds hat-trick, an Atletico assist and the performance away at Villa Park – but not enough to dispel the burgeoning idea that he could provide future coaches with a tactical problem rather than solutions. They sold us a dream 👀 30': Paul Pogba assists52': Paul Pogba assists54': Paul Pogba assists 30': Bruno Fernandes scores54': Bruno Fernandes scores60': Bruno Fernandes scores A hat-trick of goals and assists 🤯 pic.twitter.com/O6wASj0atA — Red devils 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (@AayushBaniya3) March 20, 2022   4) Michael Keane (Everton) Everton as a whole have regressed markedly but many of those individuals might justifiably shirk their portion of personal blame. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Yerry Mina and Abdoulaye Doucoure have all slipped somewhat yet the injuries that have beset Goodison Park must be taken into account. No such excuse exists for Michael Keane, however, with evidence of his largely solid if uninspiring 2020/21 campaign lost to the raging dumpster fire that might still beckon his second Premier League relegation. It is no badge of honour to have made the most appearances and played at least 467 more minutes than the closest outfield teammate as the most regular component of one of the Premier League’s worst defences. Keane has that dubious distinction and while both Rafael Benitez and Frank Lampard have trusted him as much as the many coaches that came before them, neither have proved capable of coaxing consistent reliability from the 29-year-old.  3) Miguel Almiron (Newcastle) More than a year has passed since Miguel Almiron’s last Premier League goal; it is 56 appearances and counting from his last top-flight assist. Newcastle waited 13-and-a-half largely unlucky years to break their transfer record but the subject of that £20m move has already been rendered surplus to requirements – and the expected consequences of multi-million-pound investment into the squad is only partially to blame. Almiron does not lack effort or commitment and could prove useful as an option but Newcastle have already outgrown him. A forward cannot hope to get by on a seasonal goal output that supporters can still claim to match as April approaches. The 28-year-old will be thanked for his service in the summer and moved to a more suitable home.  2) Jannik Vestergaard (Leicester) It seemed like an excellent signing: an experienced player in a problem position for a relatively low fee without any protracted saga. Jannik Vestergaard was not going to move the needle at Leicester but the Southampton centre-half was effective consolidation of their spot as chief Champions League challengers. The Foxes have been unsettled by defensive fitness problems throughout the season but that does not account for the sum total of Vestergaard’s futility. In his six Premier League starts, Leicester have kept no clean sheets and conceded 16 goals. Southampton, conversely, have been far more secure in the Dane’s absence, not even once losing 9-0.  1) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United) In one version of the chaos timeline, Manchester United hero Marcus Rashford takes one less stride to the left, shortens the stutter in his run-up and, afforded more than a minute or so of the prior game to remove the nervous energy from his legs, tucks his penalty off the right side of the post and in. England lead Italy 3-2 in the Wembley shootout and Jordan Pickford’s glorious save from Jorginho is actually as crucial as we all mistakenly believed for a split-second. It would be crass to suggest that miss has damaged Rashford; playing through shoulder, back and foot injuries for two years at an elite level was far more debilitating and the effects are still being felt. But something has changed in the 24-year-old, who once carried the weight of not only Manchester United but the entire nation’s expectation with gleaming pride, only for it now to come close to crushing him. The bare numbers show a player with 21 goals and 15 assists in 57 games at club level last season reduced to five goals and two assists in 26 appearances so far. Yet these issues run far deeper and something seems perhaps irretrievably broken.  ",positive
301,https://www.football365.com/news/chelsea-four-given-strict-april-11-deadline-for-final-bids,Chelsea Four given strict April 11 deadline for final bids,"Chelsea’s four prospective new owners have an April 11 deadline to submit their final bids to buy the Blues. New York merchant bank the Raine Group has set that deadline for final bids to keep Chelsea on course to have new owners in May, the PA news agency understands. Chelsea’s remaining suitors will have the chance to table improved offers to buy the Stamford Bridge club, with commitments required for at least £1billion of future spending. Chelsea have instructed Raine to seek those future spending commitments in a bid to safeguard the west London club’s future at football’s elite level. Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca was the final addition to the four-strong shortlist to buy Chelsea on Friday. The 67-year-old billionaire co-chairman of Bain Capital boasts a strong offering to buy the Blues. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly are the other bidders still in the race. The Raine Group spent Thursday informing a host of unsuccessful bidders they were out of the auction before starting the process of confirming the shortlist in the race to buy the Blues. Celtics supremo Pagliuca and Cubs owners the Ricketts were understood to have been informed by Raine early on Friday afternoon in New York time. US magnate Boehly and his Eldridge Industries firm has backing from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and respected British business leader Jonathan Goldstein. Former British Airways chairman Broughton has drafted in sports business and politics heavyweight Lord Sebastian Coe, adding genuine clout to his consortium. Wall Street investment banker Michael Klein has added a major financial edge. The Cubs-owning Ricketts family boast the financial muscle of US hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin, believing their experience of renovating storied stadium Wrigley Field offers an edge in their candidacy given Stamford Bridge’s required rebuild. The Ricketts family are yet to allay supporters concerns however, but are working hard to prove their suitability to take the Stamford Bridge helm. Roman Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on 2 March, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The Russian-Israeli billionaire was then sanctioned by the Government on 10 March. The Blues must operate under strict Government licence, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. Downing Street must approve another new licence to authorise Chelsea’s eventual sale, with the money either frozen or distributed to charitable funds to aid victims of the war in Ukraine. Abramovich has pledged to write off Chelsea’s £1.5bn debt and the bidding frenzy for the club could see the eventual deal hit £3bn. ",negative

The German international joined the Blues from AS Roma for a reported £31.5m fee in 2017. Man Utd duo join Everton’s Gordon in Prem weekend’s worst XI… He has particularly impressed at Stamford Bridge since Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard during the 2020/21 campaign. Rudiger helped Chelsea lift the Champions League last term under the German head coach. The 29-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and – despite efforts from the Blues – will leave on a free transfer this summer. Speaking after Chelsea’s 1-0 win against West Ham on Sunday, Tuchel revealed that the sanctions placed on owner Roman Abramovich thwarted the club’s efforts to renew their defender’s contract. He said:“Toni, the situation is that he wants to leave the club. He informed me of this in a private talk. “We gave everything – me and the club – but we could not fight anymore because of the actions. Without the sanctions we would at least be able to carry on fighting, but our hands are tied. We don’t take it personally. It is his decision.” Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United have all been linked with Rudiger, however, a move to the Spanish capital is looking very likely. Multiple reports say the German centre-half has agreed to join Real Madrid, with Fabrizio Romano claiming a deal is all but done. Real Madrid have reached verbal agreement with Antonio Rüdiger. Contract not signed yet – but Real Madrid are now closing on Rüdiger deal on a free: here we go soon! ⚪️🤝 #RealMadrid It’s gonna be a long-term deal.

No official announcement before the end of the season, even if Toni will sign in May.” Meanwhile, the Daily Mail have reported that Real Madrid’s contract ‘surpassed’ Chelsea’s£230,000-per-week offer. They say that Rudiger ‘turned down bigger offers elsewhere in Europe’ in favour of a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. Madrid have been courting the defender all season with a deal appearing dead in the water, however, the sanctions placed on Abramovich appeared to revive their interest. ",positive
303,https://www.football365.com/news/ranking-every-premier-league-no-1-goalkeeper-by-ball-playing-ability,Ranking every Premier League No. 1 by ball-playing ability,"A goalkeeper being good at football is quite important these days. Stopping the ball going into the back of the net is well and good, but if you can’t play out from the back you are not likely to excel at a top club. Look at four-time Golden Glove winner Joe Hart. Pep Guardiola had one look at his ball-playing ability and said ‘No, thank you’. We rank every Premier League’s starting goalkeeper by their ability to kick the ball well. 20) Fraser Forster (Southampton) Sorry, Fraser. It had to be someone.  19)Tim Krul (Norwich) Krul is extremely one-footed and has never been a great distributor. Great hair, mind.  18) Martin Dubravka (Newcastle) I have watched a fair bit of Newcastle over the years and it is fair to say that Dubravka has failed to impress me with his ball-playing ability. It is a surprise to some that the Geordies are looking to sign a new goalkeeper in the summer, but his distribution, passing and vision is not good enough for a team as rich and ambitious as Eddie Howe’s tricky Mags.  One per Premier League club: Reasons why they should sign Pogba  17) Nick Pope (Burnley) Pope actually leads the league in attempted long balls by a goalkeeper in 2021/22 but that is not too much of a surprise given how Burnley operate on a football pitch. The England international is less than convincing with the ball – not helped by the Clarets’ style or his height – which could potentially hold him back from making the step-up to a bigger club.  16) Ben Foster (Watford) Foster might be the best vlogging, cycling goalkeeper in the Premier League, but in terms of his actual goalkeeping and footballing skillset, the former England international is near the bottom. In fairness to the 39-year-old, he is one of three GKs with a league assist this season.  15) David De Gea (Manchester United) In a season full of weak points for United, one notable one has been De Gea’s lack of ability with the ball at his feet. Often exposed for his inability to play out from the back, it is no wonder that rumours are already circulating about his future with Erik ten Hag coming in at the end of 21/22. De Gea saw Maguire and said ""No dog, ain't risking it"" 😂😂 pic.twitter.com/XAgF6e1X3F — *wilding* (@wildin_2) April 18, 2022   14) Vicente Guaita (Crystal Palace) His late pre-assist for Joel Veltman’s actual assist for Neal Maupay’s cheeky lob over Guaita earlier this season did not cover the Spaniard in glory, but he’s not the worst the Premier League has to offer in this department.  13) Edouard Mendy (Chelsea) Perhaps his goalkeeping ability overshadows his ability with the ball at his feet because he is a bloody good goalkeeper. Like Guaita, Mendy had a bit of a brain fart that cost his team dearly when playing out from the back. They would’ve got away with it if it wasn’t for those pesky French strikers… Hat-trick for Benzema! ✔️ The worst possible start to the second half for Chelsea… 😔 A terrible defensive mix up between Édouard Mendy and Antonio Rüdiger allows a tap in for Real Madrid's star man ⚽️#UCL pic.twitter.com/GJDtp3IM6u — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 6, 2022   12)Ilian Meslier (Leeds) From French strikers to French goalkeepers; Leeds’ shot-stopper Meslier is a promising young ‘keeper with a lot of learning left to do, especially when it comes to passing. In the Premier League, the 22-year-old is fourth for passes attempted and fourth for accurate short passes, but not fourth in our list.  11) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham) The ex-Arsenal goalkeeper has made 431 of his 738 passes in the league this season and has fought off competition from Alphonse Areola, who is on loan for the entirety of 21/22.  10) Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester) Brendan Rodgers loves to see his team play out of the back and Schmeichel’s place in the team has never been scrutinised, so he must be doing something right.  9) Hugo Lloris (Tottenham) Lloris is similar to De Gea in the respect that he doesn’t play too well under pressure. However, he is definitely not bad with the ball. It does help to you have Harry Kane to aim for.  8) Jose Sa (Wolves) Sa is one of the signings of the season and has steadied the ship at the back for Wolves. The Portuguese leads the league in dribbles completed in comparison to his fellow goalkeepers. He has been in amongst the top of the saves list as well, but that’s nowhere near as important.   7)Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa) Shot-stopping, passing, distributing, s**thousing, trash talking. Martinez has got it all and is a brilliant modern-day goalkeeper. It took him a while to become a Premier League No. 1 after numerous loans during his time at Arsenal. After shining under Mikel Arteta with Bernd Leno out injured, the Argentine was able to display his terrific distribution before joining Villa for around £15m.  6) Jordan Pickford (Everton) Pickford is arguably better with his left foot than with his hands, but I don’t think that means Frank Lampard is contemplating putting him in left-back. As per WhoScored, the England No. 1 has only misplaced one short pass all season and has the third-most accurate long balls in the division. Similar to Pope, this is probably more of a reflection of his team’s style of play…  5) Robert Sanchez (Brighton) The Spanish goalkeeper has attempted 1223 passes in 21/22. That is nearly 200 more than second place in the Premier League. Sanchez sort of emerged out of nowhere, replacing the reliable Mat Ryan in between the sticks. Brighton play a certain style of football and Sanchez suits it perfectly. He helps Graham Potter’s side beat presses and play out of the back very well.  4) Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal)Arguably Arsenal’s signing of the season, Ramsdale has helped the Gunners reach a new level in terms of playing out. His signing raised eyebrows within the Arsenal fanbase, but the 23-year-old has shut up many of his critics this term with his shot-stopping and ball-playing ability.  3) David Raya (Brentford) Raya’s distribution is outstanding and Brentford sorely missed him when he was out injured for 14 league games. A transfer could easily materialise for the Spaniard thanks to his passing alone. He has previously been linked with Arsenal and a move to a club of that magnitude is not out of reach for Raya. ⛳️ Perfect yardage, bit of backspin Never play footgolf with @daviidraya1 #BrentfordFC pic.twitter.com/abHZNvgwtZ — Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) April 25, 2022   2) Alisson (Liverpool) The Liverpool No. 1 is arguably the best goalkeeper in the Premier League and is arguably the best with the ball at his feet, but he falls short of the man who everyone fully expects to be in first place here. Alisson leads the league in short passes completed by over 100 and only has six inaccurate short passes; that’s nine less than Sanchez, seven less than Raya and three less than Ramsdale. His passing range is outstanding, even providing an assist for Mohamed Salah during a 2-0 win against Manchester United in 2020.  1) Ederson (Manchester City) This was never in doubt. Ederson is calmness personified. Ederson: ""I was going to make a pass to the left-back, but I saw Trent Alexander-Arnold covering Joao Cancelo, so I delayed the pass, and the ball went on the goalline. Aymeric Laporte offered me a line of pass, so I sorted it out very calmly."" [via @ManCity] pic.twitter.com/HEFTkInQch — City Report (@cityreport_) April 22, 2022   ",positive

The new owners can’t arrive too soon. These remain uncertain times for Chelsea. The race to take over the club seems to be permanently a couple of days away without having yet arrived, and while it remains highly likely that they will return to the Champions League come the end of the season, work will have to be carried out on the playing squad during the summer and nobody yet knows what the appetite for spending will be on the part of those new owners. The transfer saga that has been looming over the club for the whole of this season is approaching its endgame, and it doesn’t look like a successful result for the club. Antonio Rudiger was left out in the cold by Frank Lampard but has grown exponentially as a player under the guidance of Tuchel; Chelsea have been prevented from discussing a new contract with him since the sanctions against Roman Abramovich were put in place, but an earlier, substantially improved offer was rejected and Real Madrid have swooped. The Bernabeu now seems almost certain to be his home from this summer. It is completely understandable that the loss of a player with such leadership qualities should have sent a cold chill through Stamford Bridge. When a player of this stature leaves a club, they leave a space behind them that is far greater than anything visible from the 90 minutes that the rest of us see once or twice a week. It’s about the atmosphere around the training ground, the dressing room and the gym. It’s about having a structure in which there are players who stand out as an example to players of all ages, an example that others can follow. Everybody at Stamford Bridge already knows that the loss of Antonio Rudiger will be a big loss to Chelsea. Rudiger won’t be the only defender to leave Stamford Bridge for Chelsea this summer, either. Andreas Christensen’s contract expires at the end of this season, and it already seems almost certain that he will be leaving for Barcelona, although this hasn’t been officially confirmed yet. Further threat to their defensive stability was averted after Cesar Azpilicueta signed a year’s extension on his contract which could only be agreed under current sanctions because it was an extension.  In the slipstream of these ongoing rumours has now come the rumour that Thomas Tuchel could be considering his future with the club due to, according to reports, ‘the paralysing restrictions the club is operating under’. But how likely is this? The timing would certainly be odd. Tuchel has been working under these restrictions for the last couple of months and the point at which confirmation of a new owner should be imminent seems like a very strange time to be bailing on the club. Normality should soon return to Stamford Bridge. It won’t be the same normality that existed under Abramovich’s ownership – it seems unlikely that the new owners will be either willing or able to support the sort of losses that he underwrote – but the existential threat that has been hanging over the club will be lifted, commercial activities can begin again, and the all-important work that needs to be carried out on the playing squad will be able to start. It would be extremely surprising if, having rode out this extremely difficult period in the club’s history, he left the club just as that period was coming to an end. Tuchel has history, of course. His two previous jobs have both seen a deterioration in his relationship with his employers, and while this is understandable in the case of PSG (a club that looks close to unmanageable the best of times), when combined with the same thing at Borussia Dortmund, it starts to look like a pattern. But for all of that, it should be added that Tuchel has been an outstanding spokesman for Chelsea during their recent difficulties, and that as yet the rumours remain anonymous and unsubstantiated. But while the arrival of new owners at Chelsea will finally close the door on a difficult period for the club, this doesn’t mean that other issues will all magically vanish with them. The squad is due some attention beyond the replacement of Rudiger and Christensen. N’Golo Kante, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho and Thiago Silva and the aforementioned Cesar Azpilicueta are all out of contract in the summer of 2023. The unsuccessful signing of Romelu Lukaku and what happens next with him, amid rumours that he wants to return to Inter, will have to be addressed. Stamford Bridge is no nearer to getting its much-needed renovation, although all three bidders for the club have committed to it. After the last couple of months, Chelsea could probably do with some stability and a clear vision for the future. No-one knows who the new owners will even be, still less what sort of money they will spend during the summer transfer window. It may well be that, whoever they are, they’ll be looking to make ‘signals of intent’, and the summer transfer window is a perfect time to do that. But spending that money is one thing; spending it wisely is something else altogether, and it can hardly be said that Chelsea did that last summer. The circumstances of the last couple of months have largely been out of the club’s control, but those days are soon to end. Confirmation of the identity of the club’s new owners will not only be the ending of one chapter; they will also mark the beginning of another.  ",positive

Rudiger made the move to Chelsea in 2016 for a fee in the region of £29m from Roma. The Germany international was in and out of the team to begin with but he has been heavily relied upon by Thomas Tuchel. One per Premier League club: Reasons why they should sign Pogba The 29-year-old has been a star performer for Chelsea this term as he has played 47 times across all competitions. Rudiger is out of contract in June and it is being reported that he has agreed to join Real Madrid on a free transfer. Jorginho has now stated that “everyone at the club will miss” Rudiger as he has helped Chelsea a lot: “He’s been here a long time so if he leaves we are going to miss him. He’s a big personality and he’s helped us a lot,” Jorginho told Sky Sports. “We’ve had amazing times here, he’s a good friend of mine so if he leaves, not just me but everyone at the club will miss him.” When asked what he will miss about the defender, Jorginho added: “The craziness! He makes me laugh a lot and all his jokes and laughs. That’s the nice part.” Meanwhile,Graeme Souness has criticised Jorginho after his limp penalty was saved in Chelsea’s 1-0 victory over West Ham on Sunday. Luckily, Christian Pulisic was on hand to spare Jorginho’s blushes as he struck in the last minute to give Tuchel’s men all three points. “Pathetic. It bounces before it gets to the goalkeeper,” Souness said on Sky Sports. “That’s exactly how not to take a penalty. Poor penalty.” Fellow pundit Kevin Campbell added on the decison to award a penalty: “I thought it was a bit harsh. “I think the contact’s outside the box but Lukaku’s so strong, his power takes him into the box. It’s that last contact that spins him around. Lukaku’s so strong he gets his arm and it’s that last bit of contact that spins him around.” ",positive
306,https://www.football365.com/news/hoping-everton-relegation-frank-lampard-elitism-john-nicholson,Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism,"This isn’t anti-Everton sentiment, but I bloody love seeing Frank Lampard’s Everton getting beaten and I’d love for them to go down with him as manager. There, I’ve said it. I’d want the same for any club managed by Mr Lampard right now. It’s not anti-Frank as a person either; I’m sure he’s a perfectly nice fella. It’s what he represents. My Lampard antipathy is rooted in the fact that this was a job that he ought never to have been given and was not qualified in any way to do and was only given because he’s Frank Lampard, ex-top footballer. Same goes for the Chelsea job. While that sort of over-promotion of someone because they’re a famous name is less common in football now than it once was, the fact it still happens needs calling out. Anyone who had Frank’s short nearly four-year managerial CV who wasn’t Frank Lampard would never have been anywhere near that job. Firstly, because managing Derby County and Chelsea is not a grounding to pull Everton out of a spiral of decline; fighting relegation is a skill and you need some experience to draw and great man-management to motivate the players to do it. Relegation run-in: Remaining fixtures and survival hopes for Burnley, Everton, Leeds and Aston Villa The fact he fell out with some Chelsea players in relatively short order and had to use Petr Cech as an intermediary should have been a warning sign to Everton that those essential man-management skills are probably not his strong point. That within weeks he was publicly questioning whether Everton players had the bollocks for the fight, only underlined this. How would you feel if someone who had only been at the club for a few weeks started slagging you off? No-one could say that Lampard wasn’t a great player, though his endless inaccurate shooting for England still haunts me. But this obviously doesn’t automatically translate into being a manager who can take a failing side and make it a successful side. In fact, for a player who has pretty much only ever been praised and lauded, who operated at the top of the tree for so long, it was a pure ‘cross your fingers and hope for the best’ appointment. No-one knew what he’d do in adversity because he’d never experienced any football adversity before. There was not one single thing that Everton’s executives could have pin-pointed to discern that he was the right man for the job. Not one. Only his name. More annoyingly still, his appointment fits into broader societal trends where the over-privileged constantly fail upwards, fecking up one job after another only to be given another high-ranking, highly paid job, only to do it all over again ad infinitum, meanwhile opportunity is denied to other more talented people, blocked by this underperforming elite. What has Lampard actually done for the club? Taken them from 16th to 18th, that’s what. Even at Chelsea, when he guided them to fourth during a transfer embargo, and was hailed as great success by those media mates who are just keeping him sweet to get stories and content, the club was already absolutely stuffed with expensive acquisitions and a development squad full of talent, the envy of most. They made par. Almost anyone could have. At heart, Lampard represents elitism. That’s what is so infuriating. It is the assumption that the famous name will somehow by osmosis be better than someone who has already proven themselves to be good but isn’t a famous name. You’d think Everton would know this. After all, they took David Moyes, a relative unknown from Preston. It’s been one bad thing after another attached to Lampard. When it comes to signings, Dele Alli and Donny van de Beek have been an absolutely disastrous waste of wages. In less than three months he’s tried playing 3-4-3, 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3. All of which suggests that he doesn’t know what to do for the best. Flitting from one formation to another instead of coaching a method and sticking to it looks amateurish and just communicates ‘you don’t know what you’re doing’ to the players. Plenty of decent managers would have loved the chance to manage Everton and could barely have done a worse job than not-so-super Frankie Lampard. That they were overlooked in favour of him is frankly dumb. The players have much more to give than he’s getting out of them. They sparked into some sort of life in the Merseyside derby, which only served to illustrate how unmotivated they had been by the manager previously. Big-name players often still have undeserved managerial kudos ahead of actually doing anything worthy of it. This is as much a fan problem as an ownership problem. There are fans who are against some prospective managers because ‘I’ve not heard of him’. On this index Lampard scores big as a recognisable name, but it is a worthless index which should be ignored. We have arrived at a time when, although there are exceptions, many top managers have either not played the game professionally, or not had a great career, or learned their trade at lower-league clubs. So we should always be suspicious of the big-name player taking a big job without a CV to back it up or at least one which looks like a good fit. Football should be a meritocracy, not just another illustration of how there’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest of us. Lampard relegating Everton would perhaps make idiot owners think twice before employing someone on name and playing reputation alone. ",positive

The 21-year-old was booked for simulation in the 2-0 defeat against Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. Man Utd duo join Everton’s Gordon in Prem weekend’s worst XI… This was the sixth time an Everton player has been booked for diving this season. The Toffees account for half of the yellow cards issued for diving in the division. Gordon was denied a penalty in the second half of the game at Anfield after going down under Joel Matip’s challenge. Many believe referee Stuart Attwell got the decision against Matip wrong, with ex-Toffees striker Kevin Campbell saying he ‘bottled’ giving his former side a spot-kick. Campbell said onSky Sports: “This is a pen for me. It’s a push in the back. He’s in the box, it’s a push in the back. He’s nowhere near the ball, he pushes him. “You see that. If that was at the other end, I’m sure this stadium would have gone crazy. That’s the one break that Everton needed. “I thought the referee bottled it a little bit, if I’m honest with you.” And former Liverpool midfielder Murphy believes Gordon is building himself a reputation for being a diver. “People get reputations and he’s diving too much,” Murphy said ontalkSPORT. “He’s a great player by the way. I really like him, Anthony Gordon. He’s a super talent, but I’ve watched Everton so much this season and he does dive a lot – and this is within the same game. “Because he’s got that lovely way about him, he’s got great balance, he can go both ways and he’s got a low centre of gravity, he does get fouled a lot. 🗣 ""I've gone one v one with him and I've got the better of him and he's stood on me foot."" Anthony Gordon explains why he feels he should've had a penalty and that he didn't deserve a yellow card for his ""dive"" pic.twitter.com/lhCkgxiwqB — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 24, 2022  “We’ve talked about this with Jack Grealish and they do go over too easily, but the argument is why shouldn’t they? Because if they don’t, you don’t get the penalties or the free-kicks. You can’t win. “But, would he have got that penalty if he hadn’t have gone down in the first half? Maybe yes. “The fact is, it was a pen. Again we talk about referees being able to take each incident in isolation, but that’s just not the way the world works.” ",positive

Ruthless France hitman Benzema produced a carbon-copy of the two headed goals he scored in last week’s quarter-final first-leg at Stamford Bridge, where his hat-trick had Real expecting to stroll into the last four. Leeds United, Marsch, Bielsa and football’s eternal battle Champions League holders Chelsea turned up in Madrid with other ideas however, big ideas in fact, of a memorable and odds-defying comeback in this pulsating second-leg. The Blues shook off their 3-1 deficit from the first leg and took Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid apart. Mason Mount, Toni Rudiger and Timo Werner put the Blues 3-0 up and on the very cusp of completing that miracle of Madrid, and that with a Marcos Alonso effort chalked off for handball. Luka Modric rescued Real though, delivering a sublime raking pass that allowed Rodrygo to race on and volley into the net past a stunned Edouard Mendy. Chelsea’s fourth stint of extra-time this season duly ensued and after all their efforts and three smart goals, one flick of the head from Benzema brought the Madrid house down. The 34-year-old turned home Vinicius Junior’s cross with another potent aerial finish to wrestle the Champions League-holders status from Chelsea’s grip. Benzema now has 38 goals in as many games for Real Madrid in all competitions this season. Such marksmanship invariably yields trophies and Madrid will feel themselves well capable of claiming Champions League title number 14 this year. Chelsea warmed to their task without delay, with Reece James’ yellow card for a tug on Vinicius the only early concern. The Blues boasted far more poise and control than in the home leg and duly took the lead when Mount capitalised on a ball falling nicely for him in the area. Chelsea built steadily in the move for the goal and Mount steered home in style to hand the visitors the perfect start. An outstanding effort to be proud of tonight in Madrid, but we exit the #UCL. pic.twitter.com/UNA7NAZTkE — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 12, 2022 Vinicius again threatened on the left but could never cut loose as at Stamford Bridge in a first-half full of frustration for the hosts. By the time Benzema was booked for an aerial challenge on Thiago Silva, the home supporters’ jeers appeared to have rattled the Madrid men. Ancelotti’s side seemed jittery and certainly lacking any rhythm or fluency. Chelsea negotiated pretty much the ideal half from their perspective, taking that 1-0 lead on the night into the interval. Thomas Tuchel’s side sustained the pressure straight from the restart, with Madrid continuing with their curious ploy of sitting off and allowing Chelsea to dominate the ball. The hosts’ passivity continued unabated, even after the chance to recalibrate at half-time. When Rudiger powered home a headed finish from Mount’s corner, the Blues were ahead 2-0 on the night and level in the tie. Alonso thought he had sent them into dreamland and a 3-0 lead, only for his crisp strike to be chalked off after a VAR review. The Spanish defender was judged to have handled the ball after a ricochet in the area, handing Madrid a major reprieve. The home side almost took immediate advantage but Benzema struck the bar when he should have scored. Chelsea kept their cool and set about yet more well-structured attacks and Mateo Kovacic’s fine threaded ball sent Werner through on goal. The Germany star twisted, then turned, then delivered a side-footed shot that found its way to goal via a deflection. Madrid looked on the brink but then Modric conjured the pass of the night. The Croatia playmaker raked out a stunning ball to Rodrygo, who strode forwards and lashed home on the volley. From listing and listless to fizzing and fluent, Madrid were transformed in that instant. Chelsea were hardly finished, however, and replacement Christian Pulisic fired over from a fine position on the inside-left in the Madrid box. The United States forward then scooped over from an even better position in the six-yard box, latching onto Kai Havertz’s knock-down. Madrid found more spark in extra-time and Benzema finally turned up with that trademark header. Chelsea lost possession cheaply out wide and Vinicius broke free to tee up the Frenchman to deliver another pulsating headed goal. Losing 3-2 on the night, Madrid were still primed to progress on aggregate and this time Chelsea could find no further riposte. Hakim Ziyech saw a stinging drive well parried by Thibaut Courtois, before Havertz headed wide when unmarked in the box and Jorginho scuffed a shot wide too. ",positive
309,https://www.football365.com/news/chelsea-played-champions-mission-made-possible,Chelsea played like champions on a mission made possible,"Chelsea are out of the Champions League but they exited with pride and no little magnificence. You think you have no horse in this race. You think you feel roughly the same about every European super-club run by rich, ruthless billionaires. You think you have no latent patriotism that makes you support any and every English club in the Champions League. You think all that and then you find yourself up on your feet shouting “get the f*** in” when Timo Werner leaves three Real Madrid defenders on their arses and finishes emphatically at the second attempt to put Chelsea ahead for the first time in this tie after 165 ludicrous minutes that have showcased the very best and the very worst of both these clubs. That’s what this Chelsea performance did to this neutral. It was a performance full of such intent, such verve, such invention and such heart that you could not help but be swept along with their hunger. This was a European champion refusing to go quietly into the night despite their task being described as “almost impossible” by the manager whose brilliance made it absolutely, completely possible. Every decision Tuchel made was justified as early as the 15th minute, when the intelligence of Ruben Loftus-Cheek – tasked with playing a hybrid position that helped Reece James almost as much as it befuddled the Real players – created the overload which meant that the urgency of Mateo Kovacic was rewarded by the emphatic finish of Mason Mount. Loftus-Cheek, Kovacic and Timo Werner were all brought in by Tuchel after that disastrous first leg and all three combined in the build-up to that opening goal. The German had said that “it’s worth trying and it’s still a stage where you can also over-perform” and over-perform they absolutely did, pressing with precision to make Real look passive in front of their increasingly frustrated fans. It took an hour and another Chelsea goal – this one from the indefatigable Antonio Rudiger – to awaken Real, who almost created a tap-in for Karim Benzema before Marcos Alonso had a goal disallowed for using a fingernail in the build-up. There was no such let-off for Real when Werner made it 3-0 to Chelsea on the night and it would have been 4-0 were it not for Thibaut Courtois saving in spectacular fashion from Kai Havertz. This was Chelsea at their irresistible, magnificent best, though a Real Madrid side boasting Luka Modric and Benzema always has a chance. It was a ludicrous pass from Modric that created the Rodrygo goal that took the game into extra-time and it was the Frenchman who headed home to finally hand the advantage back to the men in white. Football fundamentally boring? Not here. If Chelsea lost heart, it didn’t show. If Chelsea lost their legs, it didn’t show. They kept running. They kept fighting. This was a team desperate to stay in the Champions League, praying for the sliver of luck that eluded them as goalmouth scrambles ended in nought, Havertz headed a glorious chance wide of the post and substitutes Christian Pulisic and Jorginho both fluffed their lines. It’s not often that a team has 27 shots and scores three goals in the Bernabeu and it’s simply not enough. Tuchel was right; it was definitely worth trying. With every sinew and every ounce of tactical intelligence. Champions League exit will hurt but there was so, so much to admire in the way that Chelsea faced a near-impossible task and damn near pulled it off. It was a performance worthy of champions and worthy of the odd expletive from a neutral. ",positive

The Blues were passive as they fell to a 1-0 defeat against Everton in the Premier League. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight They only won one of their five league matches in April and have kicked off May in terrible fashion. The result, however, handed Everton a crucial three points in their battle for survival. Tuchel says he is ‘disappointed’ after Sunday’s defeat, insisting that his players must stop making “individual mistakes”. The German told BBC Sport:“It is disappointing because over the last four matches we don’t have enough points for what we want and it is concerning. We have one clean sheet over the last four matches and it is far too easy to score against us. “We can’t stop doing individual mistakes. We struggle to have repetitive top performances. Today was an OK performance but OK is not enough. “We conceded in the first minute of the second half and it becomes more difficult. The way we gave this goal away was absolutely unnecessarily. If we keep on giving goals away it ends up in the results we have had recently. “We were not on the highest level. We trusted the team. Maybe we could have changed more.

When you have that much possession, we did not play our best match but we were in control, and then we gave a goal away and it kills the game for us because it is everything the opponent wants. It is a huge pattern in our season. “We have now four matches in the last two weeks and one clean sheet, that needs to change – if we try to get away with OK performances that is not good for us, we are a team that needs to be on the very top limit on every match basis.

Tuchel’s Chelsea predecessor Lampard sent the German coach a good luck message when the former Paris St Germain boss took the Stamford Bridge helm in January 2021. MAILBOX: Four reasons why Everton fans are firmly behind under-fire Frank Lampard Lampard is now battling to keep Everton in the Premier League, with the struggling Toffees managing just one win in six matches in all competitions. Tuchel admitted he’s excited to meet Lampard after Chelsea’s record-goalscorer sent him a good luck message when he took over the club. “He sent me a very kind, respectful message after I took over at Chelsea that meant a lot,” said Tuchel, of Lampard. “I was a huge fan of him as a player and he is and will remain a legend at our club and this is a given. “I was very happy when he wrote me that message and it was very gentlemanly. “We didn’t have the chance to go out and have lunch and he took the chance to go and take charge of Everton. “He took an assistant from us, Joe Edwards, we were not so happy! Just joking. We will meet some friendly faces with Joe and Ashley Cole and Frank, who I have never met in person. “It is a very exciting week for me, I would love to meet him. We need the points, they need the points urgently as well.” Lampard handed the likes of Reece James and Mason Mount their Chelsea breakthroughs in his west London managerial tenure. Tuchel has been at regular pains to express his admiration for Chelsea’s academy system, with the club now having produced a glut of current homegrown senior stars. Asked if he had Lampard to thank for the nucleus of quality academy stars at his disposal, Tuchel insisted the former Blues midfielder would not have promoted anyone who did not warrant their chance. “I don’t know if it is gratitude. I don’t think Frank did it to do them a favour,” said Tuchel. “I think every coach does it because it is all about helping the team. It is not about age in any direction. “If Thiago (Silva) helps us we don’t care about how old he is. And we don’t care how young somebody is. When you are ready you are ready. I strongly believe you find your way if you have what it takes. “I am very grateful for the quality the academy produces and grateful for the culture at Chelsea to push these boys through and this is top, top quality. “It is our job to let them play and to prepare and push them on this kind of level. This is what Chelsea is about.” ",positive

Blues coach Tuchel will go head to head with mentor Rangnick at Old Trafford in Thursday’s Premier League clash, adamant that Chelsea do not need the emergency operation being talked about by the Red Devils. READ MORE: Chelsea need stability and clarity as Thomas Tuchel exit rumours begin to swirl again Where Rangnick believes new United boss Erik Ten Hag will have to breathe new life into the Old Trafford ranks, Tuchel still remains confident Chelsea’s needs only run skin deep. Chelsea have lost ground on their rivals in recruitment and retention for next term due to the club’s constraints given owner Roman Abramovich’s UK Government sanctions. Talisman defender Antonio Rudiger will leave for Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer, with fellow centre-back Andreas Christensen also bound for Barcelona. Asked what Chelsea need this summer in light of Rangnick’s heart operation comments, Tuchel replied: “Cosmetic surgery. I would be less concerned if we had still the same ownership, if we could rely on our structure. “As this is also in question we are, not concerned, but aware of the danger that the situation is maybe a bit more complex. “And it can be complex enough if you lose a player like Toni, and maybe lose another player like Andreas with the kind of quality, and both of them free. “It is demanding enough nowadays in football to lose these kinds of quality, in a back three lose two key players for free. “It can be demanding enough even if everything else stays in place. So with this in question it can be a very, very demanding summer. “I don’t know if surgery is the right term for it but I just want to be positive about it and stick to the things we can influence.” Chelsea remain on course to have new owners in place by the end of May, with Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca the remaining consortium bidders for the Blues. The Raine Group could select its preferred bidder for Chelsea by the end of this week, which would then leave the Government to grant a new licence for the sale to be complete. ",positive
313,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-city-liverpool-guardiola-klopp-friendly-fire,Man City and Liverpool await face-off after friendly fire,"The rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool – Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp – has a thread of friendly fire running through it. It seems aeons ago since Manchester City and Liverpool last initiated hostilities on the pitch. Their relationship has always been a rather distant one, compiling wins on a never-ending loop until – after trampling over everybody else – they face off to slap each other. Six months ago they produced pulsating drama at Anfield, sharing four goals in a game that had a manic, knockout tie quality to it. The fixture list now demands both come out and put on a Goliath versus Goliath Super Sunday and then do it all again with a Saturday matinee performance. There’s arms-length friendly fire respect between Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, which isn’t the most enticing trailer for movie time. Very little energy is wasted on the build-up apart from the standard appreciation society. Neither manager expects the other to drop any points. Tick. Klopp always puts the favourites tag around the blues so that his rednecks can feel like the hunters. Tick. Pep tells us for the umpteenth time that Jurgen is the toughest opponent he has ever faced in his career. Tick. It’s all rather respectful if a little forced. The only time they broke into a spontaneous spat was when the German claimed his rivals had enjoyed a two-week break because of Covid. As Guardiola retorted at the time: “I thought Jurgen was not that kind of manager.” Gentle put-downs are as aggressive as it gets. The rest of the Premier League are craning their necks to see if they can get a glimpse of what might be happening up there in this rarefied air. The nerd stat being bandied about is that these two have taken a monumental 337 and 338 points from their last 144 matches. They are streets and interplanetary systems ahead of the rest. This is a proper premium rivalry. It just doesn’t have the historical edge that elicits cosy nostalgia. When Sir Alex Ferguson scoffed at Mark Hughes for suggesting the Manchester derby was the biggest school fight in town, he would have stopped clocks to prevent United not even being in the playground a few years later. Only once has the duopoly disappointed: when the two played out a shadow boxing goalless draw at Anfield in October 2018. That game was full of newly-formed mutual respect, driven by the experience of the helter-skelter style and intensity of Liverpool’s two most famous thrill-seeking wins. Pep, with furrowed brow and all, couldn’t stop worrying about that front three in those 4-3 and 3-0 losses. Something had to be tweaked to neuter the flying fortress of firepower. Klopp graduated from that base style where his team had to fight like “animals” just to get the ball. The last time the Reds went to the lion’s den in vital title race territory back in January 2019 they carried a seven-point lead which may have influenced a more conservative line-up. Sticking a half-fit James Milner into midfield alongside the workaholics Gini Wijnaldum (is he still not missed?) and Jordan Henderson didn’t quite work out. This autumn, Liverpool’s limited midfield was torn asunder again at times with Milner operating as a ragdoll full-back ripped to shreds by Phil Foden. Curtis Jones and Henderson struggled to shut doors as Foden, Rodri and Bernardo Silva flooded the not-so-watertight compartments. In the second half, Liverpool came roaring back with their “killers” as Gary Neville likes to describe them. Guardiola waxed lyrical: “What a game. That is the reason the last years Man City and Liverpool were always there because we try to play in this way.” It’s been 17 months since Liverpool saw the Etihad. Klopp went full metal jacket, throwing all four strikers onto the pitch from the off in a 1-1 draw. It worked for about 20 minutes before City managed to sort themselves out and then gain the ascendancy.  The overriding feeling of the last few years is that this match, especially at home, rests on Pep’s racket. Guardiola constantly talks about playing with personality. Results, although not secondary for one minute, will always be less important to his mantra: being themselves. City excel in finding the comfort of constant mesmeric rhythms which the opposition just can’t disrupt. He joked he was going to be clever against Atletico and play 12 men. Only overthinking and a courageous opponent can disturb the beats and lead to defeat. This Liverpool have now developed enough to change it up without relying on emergency Divock Origi mode. Their sophistication in-game will be curious to witness if things start to unravel on Sunday. They were the team with literally no substitutes in Kyiv four years ago. Now they have some aces to play to seize the day. As Klopp might say, this is “boom” or bust. ",positive
314,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-gareth-bale-discovers-that-hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-madridista-scorned-real-madrid,Gareth Bale discovers that hell hath no fury like a Madridista scorned,"Gareth Bale has hit back at the Spanish newspaper Marca over their comments about him, and their response hasn’t exactly been dignified. Perhaps it was always inevitable that it would end like this. In a world in which footballers are treated as little more than commodities by both clubs and the media, perhaps there was inevitability about the petulance of what has been happening between the Real Madrid-obsessed Spanish newspaper Marca and Gareth Bale. Bale’s spectacular brace for Wales against Austria in the World Cup play-off semi-finals has prompted a most peculiar outburst in Marca and El Chiringuito, the football show that achieved viral fame with its troublingly obsessive-looking coverage of Lionel Messi’s transfer from Barcelona to PSG and Kylian Mbappe’s failure to sign a contract with Real Madrid. It was pretty clear that Gareth Bale had a message to send to somebody during the Wales vs Austria game, as he shouted ‘SUCK THAT!’ into a microphone while celebrating his first goal, and it wasn’t difficult to guess who he meant. The newspaper Marca had already run a story in which they described Bale as a ‘parasite’ over their perception that he’s running down the clock until the end of his contract with the club, and after the match, El Chiringuito’s absurd histrionics stepped up another gear when one of their pundits claimed that he should be ‘fired’ for ‘disrespecting’ Real. The latter of these two comments was just plain stupid, rather than particularly offensive. It’s vanishingly unlikely that Real Madrid would legally be able to fire him for upsetting their media fee-fees, and even if this were the case, with his contract expiring at the end of June regardless, it’s highly doubtful that it would be the greatest disaster for a multi-millionaire footballer to have to deal with. But this doesn’t alter the fact that he is absolutely entitled to see out the remainder of his contract. And then there’s the small question of whether this simultaneously childish and chiding tone actually even benefits Real Madrid at all. Real are one of the most famous football clubs on the planet, and are in the market for the very best players, players who can choose from any club to play for whatsoever. Does El Chiringuito really believe that acting this way helps or hinders their pursuit of the very best players? It’s possible that, say, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe don’t care about this spat in the slightest, but it’s not difficult to imagine how a player who can go and play anywhere for vast amounts of money might take a look at the media culture surrounding this club and not take too kindly to the way that former(ish) players are treated.  The comments on El Chiringuito were delivered in their normal pantomime style and were pretty easy to dismiss, but the comments of Marca seem to have crossed a line for Bale, who issued a statement himself about the treatment that he’s been receiving in the Spanish media in which he described the comments made by Marca about him as “slanderous, derogatory and speculative”, and adding that, “I want to use my platform to encourage change in the way we publicly talk about, and criticise people, simply for the most part, not meeting the often unrealistic expectations there are projected onto them.” Marca have decided to defend themselves over this, but they didn’t make a particularly good job of it. Journalist Juan Castro – who, it should be pointed out, didn’t write the article that caused the furore, told the BBC: “We made really big positive headlines in the first years of Gareth here in Madrid, but sadly he stopped playing here in Madrid, he does not want to play here, he is always injured and has played only four games in La Liga this season, scoring only one goal.”So let’s take a quick look at what the journalist concerned, Manuel Julia, actually said: ‘The Bale parasite comes from the cold and rains of Britain. It settled in Spain, at Real Madrid, where, disguising its intentions, it first showed diligence and love for the grass, but soon its nature brought it to suck blood without giving anything in return. ‘More than blood, it sucked, and sucked, the club’s euros. ‘Unlike others of its species, like the flea, the louse, or the bedbug, the Bale parasite does not produce pain or sickness in its grass, but after sucking, between smiles and messing around, shows a tongue-in-cheek disrespect for that off which it lives. ‘He laughs, claps, throws itself to the ground, sings, in a kind of humiliating ceremony, which, at least, finally comes to an end, like all misfortunes.’ You stay classy there, Manuel. The moral high ground is always held by the person who describes someone who has angered them in subhuman terms, isn’t it? Bale has not played much this season, that much is true, but this is because he has not been selected to play in the first team, and it seems a bit odd to criticise a player for this, when team selection can hardly be said to be their decision. That choice rests with the head coach. And Bale has always been injury-prone. Again, presuming that he didn’t want to be injured, it’s not saying much for Marca’s sense of perspective that they should be criticising him for this. And regardless, there’s something to be said for knowing when to shut up, to be the ‘bigger man’, when it comes to this sort of subject. It would have cost Marca, a well-known newspaper, nothing to listen to Bale’s criticism and perhaps reflect upon the histrionic nature of their coverage, and it does little for their reputation to go after a player in the apparent support of a behemoth such as Real Madrid, in this way. How can they be trusted to speak truth to power in a country in which an absurdly disproportionate power over the game is held by two clubs? Perhaps this is a mis-reading of their role within Spanish society, but if the reality is that Marca is little more than a fanzine for this huge club, their output should be treated as such and taken as seriously. The good news for all concerned is that this unhappy marriage only has three more months to run, and that football will only be played during them. It will obviously be the best for all concerned for Gareth Bale to be rid of Real Madrid and for Real to have the money they’ve been paying to an injured player this season available to spend on someone else. It is also, when considering their outrage levels, worth pausing to recall that Bale has helped Real Madrid to 14 trophies during his time there, including four Champions Leagues and three Liga titles. His goal in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool is a strong contender for the greatest ever in the final of that competition. The strangest thing is that all these cheerleaders for the powerful football club on the planet should seem so insecure. Perhaps it’s what attracted them to Real in the first place. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale can continue with his Wales and his golf. After all, if this is how they’re going to talk about him, why should he lift a finger for the last two months of his contract? If anything, the comments of the last few days have only proved why he was right to not care about them in the first place. ",positive

Ronaldo re-joined the Red Devils last summer in a move that led many to believe the Premier League giants would compete on all fronts this season. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… The Portugal captain hit the ground running at Old Trafford, scoring a brace on his second debut against Newcastle before netting some crucial goals in the Champions League. Despite his 18 goals in all competitions this season, Ronaldo has been heavily criticised for his performances with Man Utd enduring a poor season. They are expected to miss out on the top four and were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16, Carabao Cup in the third round and FA Cup in the fourth round. Maguire has also had his fair share of critics this campaign. Many fans, pundits and former players have urged Man Utd interim boss Ralf Rangnick to drop the England defender. The German has remained faithful in Maguire, however. He has made 33 appearances this term across all competitions. Bayern Munich left-back Davies says he can’t believe Maguire is Man Utd captain, insisting that he has no idea why a player of Ronaldo’s calibre is being led by the 29-year-old. Alphonso Davies on Harry Maguire captaining Cristiano Ronaldo 😳 (via thatboydavies19/Twitch) pic.twitter.com/ixZlIOKsue — ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) April 9, 2022 “Can you guys imagine [that] you’re Ronaldo, right?” Davies said on hisTwitchchannel (via Goal). “One of the greatest players ever, in the 21st century. “Harry Maguire is your captain. You refer to him as captain – I don’t know what he says to him.” The left-back added: “I’m not dissing Harry Maguire, but Ronaldo should get the armband, man.” Meanwhile,Merseyside Police have launched an investigation following an incident in which Ronaldo appeared to knock a mobile phone out of a supporter’s hand at Everton. The force is appealing for witnesses after footage on social media emerged which appeared to show the Portuguese smashing a phone out of a Toffees fan’s hand and onto the ground as he limped off towards the tunnel followinghis side’s 1-0 loss at Goodison Park. Man Utd striker Ronaldo later issued an apology for his “outburst” via social media and invited the supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford “as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship”. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: “We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison. “As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch.” ",positive

It’s got Paul Pogba in, if that helps… POG OFF Whisper it but the front pages are arguably more interesting than the back ones today, but hidden among the coverage of Chelsea’s heroic failure in Madrid there are still some odds and sods of the hot, hot transfer chat you lot just can’t get enough of. Look, there’s even some Paul Pogba stuff in the Mirror. You always like that. If it wasn’t so damned early in the morning we could probably even conjure up a clever bit of bait-and-switch business about the often-ineffective, opinion-dividing star with his famous hair and tie it in to those front pages. We’re not doing that, but just imagine we did. That would have been some good stuff right there, eh? Anyway, according to the Mirror’s “senior United source” there is going to be a mutiny in the squad if he doesn’t find another club to muck about this summer and instead signs the half-a-mill-a-week contract on the table to become United’s highest-paid player. There will be “fury” apparently, because “he plays so infrequently and has no qualms about criticising the club”. According to the source who is definitely a real person who said these exact words unprompted: “Some of the players think it’s out of order he could be getting twice as much as they are when he hardly starts a game and talks about leaving all the time.” That new deal includes a basic wage of £400k, with add-ons tipping it over the half-million mark and above your Ronaldos (£450k) and De Geas (£375k). Good luck, Erik Ten Hag anyway.  NO BALE OUT Wales boss Robert Page has confirmed Gareth Bale will sign on… somewhere if Wales qualify for the World Cup. His Real Madrid deal runs out in the summer and it’s fair to say he won’t be getting a new one, but with Wales tantalisingly close to qualification for the winter World Cup, Bale will still be playing club football for someone if only to keep himself in nick for November and December. That’s The Sun’s angle anyway, and they might be losing their touch here, to be honest, because a) the more interesting reading of Page’s quotes is arguably that Bale really could quit football at 32 if Wales don’t qualify for Qatar and b) they can’t even be bothered with a bit of wild speculation about where he might end up in the summer. You’d imagine the Madrid “parasite” still wouldn’t be short of offers and as long as he can find somewhere with a training ground close to a golf course you’d like to think something could be worked out. Banter flags aside, it’d be a shame to lose him entirely to the world’s worst sport, really.  BUZZ AROUND BEES STAR Christian Eriksen’s return to elite football with Brentford was already one of the most uncomplicatedly good-news stories in sport before he proved he still has what it takes to play at this level and now attention turns inevitably if grubbily to what happens next. He only signed a six-month deal at Brentford, who have won all four of the games he’s started in the Premier League and only six of the other 28 and, while Thomas Frank says an extension is “realistic” there is inevitably plenty of other interest given the way Eriksen’s comeback has gone. 90min have done the job of going through all the current interested parties and state that Eriksen’s wage demands are nothing like the six-figure contracts he was on at Spurs and Inter. The Dane apparently is well up for staying in England and Spurs are, inevitably, touted as an option although the “manner of his departure” could be a barrier to that reunion. Our opinion is, it wouldn’t be, but we’ll see. If not Brentford or Spurs then it could be – deep breath – Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Everton, Newcastle, West Ham or Fulham once their promotion is confirmed. So almost half the league, then.

317,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-kante-last-champions-league-hurrah-chelsea,Kante set for last Champions League hurrah for Chelsea,"Chelsea should look to sell N’Golo Kante this summer after five further Champions League fixes… N’Golo Kante was player of the match in both Champions League semi-final legs against Real Madrid and in the final against Manchester City last season. He went full Kante in all three of those games: stealing possession; breaking up play; driving forward; creating chances. But that Kante – the one who takes hold of a game of football and refuses to give it back – has been an infrequent presence for Chelsea this season. The many miles run appear to be catching up with him and this Champions League campaign could, and perhaps should, be his last hurrah for Chelsea. READ MORE: Big Midweek: Chelsea v Real, Grealish, Liverpool, West Ham Kante has started just 15 Premier League games under Thomas Tuchel this season and has had four separate injury lay-offs. When he has been in the team, he’s rarely played with the verve and intensity that could be proffered as his middle name, suggesting every aspect of his midfield machinery isn’t quite running smoothly. Similar was said at the same stage last season, with his performances in the latter stages of the Champions League making those who questioned him look very daft indeed. But that was the start of a trend that’s seen Kante move towards becoming an outstanding footballer who can put in outstanding performances, rather than an outstanding footballer who is always outstanding. If Chelsea can eke out five further optimum Kante displays they have an excellent chance of retaining their Champions League crown. And given his propensity for injury this season they should be wrapping him in cotton wool for those games.Chelsea don’t need Kante to finish third or fourth in the Premier League, but they need him to win the Champions League. After that, Chelsea would be wise to sell him. He’s 31 and his contract expires in the summer of 2023, at which point he could leave for nothing. As the club are about to find out, allowing players’ contracts to run down is costly. They could lose all three of Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen this summer. With money likely an object going forward, those players could easily have earned them £100m combined. Replacing Kante will be impossible – there’s no-one like him and therefore by definition no-one as good. But Conor Gallagher could play and thrive in that role for Chelsea. He’s been brilliant on loan at Crystal Palace this season and offers the goals and creativity from midfield that Chelsea lack. If Tuchel had to choose between peak Kante and peak Gallagher it would be an easy choice, but Gallagher’s stock is rising while Kante’s falls. Tuchel would want to keep Kante in an ideal world, but Chelsea no longer live in one. Whoever takes over will not have the bottomless pockets of Roman Abramovich, and with the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge a necessary priority, money will be tight. They will be in no position to turn down £40m for Kante. A deep foray into the Champions League this season will improve Kante’s chances of one last big move in his career, with one particular suitor – who have long been interested in the midfielder – likely to be looking for any cheat code to win the competition that continues to allude them. PSG wanted Kante when he moved to Stamford Bridge and have been linked with him periodically ever since. Having signed pale imitations of Kante, they are likely still interested in the real thing, with Idrissa Gueye and Danilo Pereira mere methadone to the Kante crack cocaine. It will be rough for Chelsea without the Frenchman. Although his reduced role this season means they won’t be going cold turkey, they will no longer be able to fall back on the fix when they need it most. But five more fixes should do the trick for Chelsea, starting with Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Rack up the Kante. ",positive

Manchester City are in search of their first-ever Champions League trophy, while Real Madrid are hunting down their 14th title. PepGuardiola’s side were on top for the majority of the first leg, but Rivaldo thinks Real Madrid’s experience in Europe could come into play in the second leg. “I played them many times and know what I’m talking about, and they are also a 13-times Champions League winners facing a team that has never won it, so, it’s normal that the Spanish club have that bigger experience that allows them to survive in tough circumstances. “Now, I expect Real Madrid to be confident about qualifying to the final at the Bernabeu in front of their fans, so I imagine that Man City will have difficulties despite being favourites to go through.” Manchester City are still in the driving seat for the Premier League title and they travel to Elland Road on Saturday in search of three points. Meanwhile, Carlo Ancelotti’s side needs just one point against Espanyol this weekend to wrap up the La Liga title. ",positive

The German is out-of-contract in the summer and the Blues are currently unable to offer him new terms due to the sanctions placed on the club as a result of owner Roman Abramovich’s links to Russia. Chelsea may end up grateful for the chasing pack’s flakiness Abramovich is currently in the process of selling the club with three consortiums remaining as potential new owners. It remains to be seen when a takeover will be completed and whether they will be able to have one final chance of convincing Rudiger to stay at Stamford Bridge. Transfer expert Gianluca di Marzio, as reported by the Express, has revealed that a deal to sign with Real is close. The reports suggest that Real ‘intensified’ their interest in the defender following his impressive display against them in the Champions League quarter-finals. Real are now edging ‘closer and closer’ to meeting the high demands of the Rudiger and there is now an expectation that a deal could be completed soon. A number of clubs have been linked with a move for the 29-year-old including the likes of Manchester United, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. However, it would now appear that the Blues defender will be plying his trade in La Liga next season. Meanwhile, former Chelsea forward Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has slammed current Blues forward Romelu Lukaku for his lack of effort. Hasselbaink said on Sky Sports: “If you want to be the man, you need to at least run around. “You have to try and show that you are bothered and that you want to suffer, and he simply does not run around, he does not go into gaps and he doesn’t go into space and without doing that, you are not going to score. Chelsea were very static and if you are going to have players that play like that, you have no chance.” But it was a poor performance all round by Chelsea, with Malang Sarr and Andreas Christensen failing to step up in the absence of Antonio Rudiger and Thiago Silva. “I think for Chelsea today it was a bad performance, a really, really bad performance,” Hasselbaink said. “Certain players are getting an opportunity like Lukaku, Sarr, Christensen and when we go back to Lukaku, he does not do enough.” ",negative

The Englishman is out of contract this summer and he has barely featured for the Red Devils this season. Newcastle United attempted to sign him in January but Man Utd’s hierarchy prevented this deal from happening. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? It was reported on Monday afternoon that AC Milan and Juventus are ‘leading the chase’ to sign Lingard on a free transfer. The 29-year-old was an unused substitute as United beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane got the goals. After the game, Lingard’s brother – Louie Scott – took to Instagram to criticise United for their treatment of the midfielder: “20 years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,” Scott said (quotes via The Mirror). “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league OK. “Class of ’92, Busby Babes, you’re run by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, god bless!

On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong.

The 26-year-old signed for Arsenal in 2011 when he was 16-years-old. He was unable to establish himself as a regular for the Gunners. Gnabry only played for them 18 times and he had an unsuccessful loan spell at West Brom during the 2015/16 season. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min The attacker left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen on a permanent basis.Following an impressive debut season, Bayern Munich activated his release clause to sign him. The Germany international has been a key player for Bayern Munich in recent seasons. He has grabbed 63 goals and 40 assists from his 169 outings across all competitions. So far this term, he has been involved in 26 goals from his 43 appearances. His future at Bayern is in doubt as his contract expires in 2023. It was reported last week that Gnabry has rejected Bayern’s latest contract offer. If he signed the deal, his salary would have doubled. Robinson thinks Tottenham should be “in the hunt” to sign Gnabry this summer: “Gnabry is a world-class player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “If he is to leave Bayern Munich you would like to think that Spurs are in the hunt for him. “It is going to be a big summer for Spurs. A lot will depend on whether Harry Kane stays at the club, which I hope he does. “I’d question whether Gnabry would get into the Tottenham team ahead of Son, Kane and Kulusevski right now. He’d be competition for Kulusevski but I don’t think that position is a priority at the moment. “That level of player is what you want Spurs to be signing though.” Elsewhere, ex-France international Jerome Rothen has warned PSG against pursuing Antonio Conte because he’s “more passionate about his chequebook” than Spurs. Reports emerged last week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team. That’s already problematic.” ",positive

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive

Son grabbed his second of the game and 19th of the season in style as he curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to put the seal on Spurs’ victory. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player. But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive

Son took the headlines after a superb hat-trick, along with Dejan Kulusevski’s fine strike, to send Spurs three points clear of Arsenal, making them favourites for Champions League qualification. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star But they were indebted to Lloris’ heroics in the first half as after Son’s early opener Villa laid siege on Spurs’ goal. The Frenchman made seven saves in the opening 45 minutes, including a wonder stop from Jacob Ramsey, which was the most by a Spurs keeper since data collection began. That allowed their lethal front three, with Harry Kane again notching two assists, to run riot in the second half. “What can I say? He saved us. We are scoring goals but if Hugo wasn’t there we were probably 3-1 or 4-1 down,” Son said of his captain. “Because Hugo saved us in a tough time when we needed him, he was turning like a superman, like a cat. It is insane, when he made the first save (from Ramsey) it was really close to him and the shot came really he just had them. He was like a cat. Hugo saved us. “It is a really special day for the team. It is a really hard place, we showed great personality, great character, especially after the first half. “Some teams are going to lose this situation because they can’t deal with it. We turned up in the second half really, really well and scored the second goal, third goal and fourth goal. I am really proud for the team. “The Premier League there is never one easy game. You go away from home and the supporters are different. “These are difficult places to go, 4-0 sounds easy but it is never easy. We did really well in the second half, we turned up and changed the game.” The only negative of a brilliant day for Spurs was an injury to Matt Doherty, who hobbled off in the first half after a heavy challenge from Matty Cash. He tried to play on but had to give up and was seen leaving the ground with a brace on his right knee. Boss Antonio Conte said of the injury: “I hope nothing serious, I hope. The doctors are going to check on him tomorrow (Sunday). “I hope nothing serious because he wanted to try to continue to play but then at the end he preferred to come off. “I hope so because Matthew is an important player for us and I hope this injury is not serious.” ",positive

The moment came during the first half of the Premier League match between West Ham United and Chelsea in December, when the ball fell to Antonio Rudiger who, despite being a distance from the West Ham goal that made what followed optimistic, attempted a shot on goal that ballooned hopelessly over the crossbar, before running impishly back to his correct position, chuckling to himself like a naughty schoolboy. Football, we can all agree, takes itself too seriously these days, but a slow creep over a couple of decades has normalised what we really should consider beyond parody. The Champions League has an anthem, as if UEFA is a nation state. Before the start of Premier League matches, when the teams take to the pitch, the referee takes the match ball from a ceremonial plinth, like an offering to the Gods of Football, only in reverse. The Soccer Saturday music is severe enough that you half expect Jeff Stelling to announce that war has been declared on China rather than tell us about Carlisle United’s third goal at Harrogate Town. The Championship play-off final is The £200m Match while the FA Cup languishes because success can increasingly only be interpreted as an amount of money, while history, tradition and continuity’s lack of intrinsic value renders it redundant. We’re even hitting a tipping point at which competition doesn’t matter as much as size, when it comes to deciding who gets to play elite-level European club football. A little something has to be tossed to the richest clubs. They might pick up and their ball and go home otherwise. So in amongst all this gloom – it’s fair to say that we live in a society that is increasingly fine-tuning its ability to make us angry and to take everything in bad faith – a player who can let that mask slide for a moment, someone who looks as though there is nothing on this goddam earth that he would rather be doing right now than play football, feels like a palate cleanser. Antonio Rudiger’s delighted face was a welcome change of view from the self-regarding, preening and gurning faces that hog the back pages of our newspapers and our television screens.  The same goes for Son Heung Min. The speed of acceleration with the ball at his feet, the finishing, and the unerring ability to pick out his strike partner as if by radar are all well and good, but it’s the extent to which he plays as though he loves football that really makes him stand out. It brings a sense of freedom and exhilaration to the way he plays. When he’s running through a defence to get on the end of a pass, the space opens up in front of him, and even the incredible athleticism has to take second place to the style with which it’s all put together. There have always been players who just so happened to be extremely good at football but had mixed feelings about the game. David Batty is the example that always springs immediately to mind, quite likely because his ascent to the top of the professional game came at a time when football was becoming fashionable again for the first time in decades, meaning that the background noise often felt like an arm’s race to declare one’s fandom. But even this can be charming to see. Gareth Bale may be annoying Real Madrid at the moment (and everybody knows that irritating the superclubs is good for a little low humour – sorry guys, but that’s just the little price you have to pay for all that winning), but there’s no doubt that he is living his best life. It’s not that he doesn’t like football; it’s just that when he’s not playing, he’d rather be playing golf. And given that, at 32 years old and with a history of injuries, he’s well and truly into the autumn of his playing career and is probably fairly comfortable with shrugging his shoulders at the outbursts from the Spanish press. Football clubs commoditise players; it’s their entire business model. There’s nothing wrong with that dynamic being turned on its head every now and again.  But the footballer who plays the game like they love playing the game is a joy forever. They’re one of the most important connections between the team and the supporters, and the supporters know by instinct who they are. They’re secure enough in their ability to be able to allow themselves to smile. There has long been this idea in football that there has to be some sort of cruelty or some sort of physical pain in order to succeed, as though that is the sacrifice that a player has to make in order to get to the top of the game, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Furrowing their brows and puffing their cheeks out like a bull waiting to take on a matador works for some, and it’s hardly as though these players aren’t beloved too. Supporters love that level of commitment. But the players who love the game are instantly recognisable because we see ourselves in them. It’s a different kind of commitment but it’s valuable all the same. ",positive

Son and Kane went into the history books after combining for a 37th goal in the 4-0 victory over Leeds, moving past Chelsea’s Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. The pair have been the leading light for Spurs for the last few years, with Kane particularly excelling. Premier League winners and losers features profligate Man Utd His assist for Son at Elland Road was a sublime ball over the top and the South Korea international is lost for words at how good the England captain is. “What can I say more about Harry? I think any compliment, I’m gone,” he said. “I can’t say any more words about him. You can say ‘superb’. You can say ‘phenomenal’. It’s not enough for me. “I’ve played together with him for a long time and I’m still looking at him and thinking, ‘Wow, this is unbelievable’, you know? “So I think the words are not enough for me. He’s just an unreal player. I’m really happy to work with him every day and playing together is a big honour.” Their partnership has evolved over the last 18 months as Kane has began to take deeper positions, often being the creator and finding Son with a fine passing range. But Kane’s prowess in front of goal has remained, making him the best number nine and number 10 in the Premier League. “When you think a striker is always scoring goals and a number 10 is also making assists, he can do both for two or three seasons,” Son said. “He wants to improve for himself. This is his ability, he’s so good to watch. He can play number 10, number nine. Whatever we need. “To have a striker like this is massive. What can I say? What can I say about Harry? He’s doing so well, we’re glad to have him and we can still help him as well to get many goals. “He’s a striker and he’s still hungry for goals and big things as a team.

The pair combined for the 37th time when Kane superbly assisted Son’s late strike, moving clear of Chelsea pair Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. READ MORE: Bielsa’s Leeds future in doubt as leading replacement named It was a fitting end to a comprehensive win for Antonio Conte’s side, who laid the foundation for the win with three goals in the opening 27 minutes as Matt Doherty, Dejan Kulusevski and Kane got on the scoresheet. Spurs’ produced an impressive response to Conte’s midweek rant, where the Italian cast doubt over his future after a 1-0 loss at Burnley by suggesting he was not “good enough” to fix Spurs’ problems, but the focus is now on Marcelo Bielsa’s position. Leeds have lost their last four games, conceding 17 goals in the process, and they will be looking nervously over their shoulder with teams below them picking up points. The win for Spurs probably comes too late to resurrect their top four hopes, but they are still in the race for European football. A reaction was always on the cards after Conte’s comments and they delivered by taking a 2-0 lead inside the opening 15 minutes against a team who were devoid of defensive capability. They opened the floodgates in just the ninth minute as Harry Winks set Ryan Sessegnon free down the left and his cross was perfect for Doherty arriving at the far post. The Irishman produced an emphatic finish to score his first goal for the club. Spurs doubled their advantage six minutes later thanks to some generous defending from Diego Llorente. As Kulusevski darted into the box he looked to have overrun the ball, but Llorente inexplicably left it, allowing the Sweden international to fire home at the near post. Leeds needed an instant response and they almost got it as a loose ball fell to Robin Koch but his effort hit the post and went to safety. And Spurs tightened their grip on the game in the 27th minute with a sublime goal from Kane. Pierre-Emile Hojberg flighted in a superb ball over the top to pick out Kane, who clinically finished at the far post in a way that few strikers in the Premier League would be able to. To their credit, Leeds offered some sort of reaction and had Spurs pinned back, but were unable to find a way through, with Luke Ayling heading a good chance wide. But they were booed off at half-time, having conceded 19 goals in four and a half matches. They could not regain the upper hand after the restart and Spurs had chances to extend their lead, but Illan Meslier came to Leeds’ rescue. He denied Doherty and Son in quick succession and then twice kept out Kulusevski efforts. Stuart Dallas was guilty of a shocking miss after he raced in on goal with Hugo Lloris stranded before Kane and Son went into the record books in the 85th minute. It was a brilliant pass by Kane to send Son clear and the South Korean made no mistake, lashing home in style to create history. Rodrigo’s free-kick rattled off the post at the death, but there was no avoiding another heavy defeat, taking Leeds’ total goals against to 20 in five games. ",positive

Harry Kane scored twice having been reunited with Heung-min Son; their marquee summer signing joined Son in returning from injury; Conte was able to blood his two new January arrivals; and the void left by one of the targets he missed was filled encouragingly by a player in receipt of a much-needed stroke of good fortune. Everything came up Conte for Tottenham against Brighton who represented a potential banana skin for a Spurs team who are looking more and more a side built in their manager’s image. What hazards laid in wait in north London caught out the Seagulls, who were deservedly dumped out of the cup but each goal they conceded was entirely preventable. And at the other end, when the chances came, most notably in the second period to reduce Spurs’ advantage to a single goal, Brighton and Neal Maupay in particular showed themselves to be as impotent as ever. Kane has no such worries about firing blanks at the moment. Each of his goals came as a result of some kamikaze defending but the first showcased the quality of finishing that was missing before Conte pitched up, and the second highlighted the poacher’s instinct so woefully absent in the opening months of the season. Kane has now netted seven goals in his last 10 games, a run all the more likely to be extended by Son’s return. The South Korean star made his first appearance in a month and had a hand in each of Kane’s goals. First, it was his pressure that forced Adam Webster into a turnover that led to Kane curling an unstoppable effort around Robert Sanchez. And his contribution for his strike partner’s second was even more eye-catching – a driving run from inside his own half that left Webster so dazed, the Seagulls defender bundled the loose ball into Kane’s path. Harry Kane has now scored 15 goals across all competitions this season, Mohamed Salah (23) is the only Premier League player with more. Eight have been for Antonio Conte. 💪 pic.twitter.com/bpRnFlzH82 — Squawka Football (@Squawka) February 5, 2022 As pleasingly for Conte as Son’s return was the manager’s first opportunity in three months to select Cristian Romero at the heart of his back three. The £42million signing was a steady presence for 77 minutes, shackling Maupay, Jakub Moder and briefly Danny Welbeck before cramp kicked in. Being able to play Romero alongside Eric Dier, absent tonight with a ‘little problem’, will be a huge boost for Conte, as will Emerson Royal if he can maintain the form and adventure that saw him create Spurs’ second goal when his cross was deflected in off Solly March.  Conte wanted Adama Traore to play in Royal’s place but Spurs floundered in the January window until they completed a successful raid on Juventus. At 3-1 up and seemingly comfortably, Conte felt able to give Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur their debuts, only 48 and 24 hours respectively after their first training sessions at Spurs. Kulusevski was bright on the right, regularly cutting inside onto his left foot in the final quarter and the Swede should already have his first assist but Steven Bergwijn blazed a gilt-edged chance high over the bar. Receiving his first booking in English football was Bentancur’s most notable act, but the Uruguay midfielder could profit from a stodgy performance from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Harry Winks in the centre of the midfield – perhaps Conte’s’ only concern on an overwhelmingly positive night in a competition the manager has never not reached the final.

Spurs have acted quickly to appoint Conte. He replaces Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Italian has penned an 18-month contract. He previously led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2016/17. Antonio Conte by the numbers: Games, trophies, signings… He had previously been in advanced talks with Spurs in June about becoming Jose Mourinho’s successor, but they broke down after the two parties were at odds over key issues. However, managing director Fabio Paratici is now in position at the Premier League club and has a strong relationship with the 52-year-old, having worked with him at Juventus. And those differences have now been overcome, with chairman Daniel Levy looking to the serial winner to turn Spurs back into a force in English football. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,” Conte told the club website. “Tottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.” Nuno was relieved of his duties after Levy and Paratici met on Sunday to discuss his future, with the news delivered early on Monday morning. The Portuguese was a condemned man following Saturday’s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United, when fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and roundly booed him at full-time. Spurs have lost five of the last seven Premier League games and have gone two hours and 16 minutes without having a shot on goal. Conte inherits a team in ninth position in the table, five points off the top four after 10 games. The Italian, who is expected to be given some funds in January to strengthen the squad, is due to take training on Tuesday and be in charge of Thursday’s Europa Conference League clash with Vitesse Arnhem. He becomes the fourth manager to cross the divide between Stamford Bridge and north London, following Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Mourinho in managing both clubs. Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. “I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.” Spurs said an update on Conte’s coaching staff will follow in due course.

Reports emerged in France and Italy earlier this week suggesting Conte was interested in replacing Mauricio Pochettino at the Ligue 1 club. READ MORE: Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Conte, who has 12 months left on his contract, has continually refused to commit his long-term future to Spurs, but insists the latest round of speculation is not true. He said: “Obviously I think that it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invest news – only to speak, only to create problems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we’re really focused on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies. “In this situation, who works in football – players or managers – know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out.” The Italian does not want this issue to be a distraction for the club’s push for Champions League qualification. Spurs are two points behind Arsenal with five games to go and Conte has called on a joint effort to get over the line. “In this moment our fans, me, the players, the club, the fans we need to be focused, we need to be concentrated on an important target for us,” he said. “We have a big opportunity to try to get a place in the Champions League. “It’s a big opportunity for us because no one can imagine to stay and fight for this target in this league now in this moment. In the past it was different, but now you know very well what I said in the past that it would be a miracle to get this achievement. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and its the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “Now it would be very important to be focused and not listen to fake news and the people that for sure want to create problems for the environment. “We have to play these five games and then you know, because I answer a lot of times, that at the end of the season in a private way I will speak with my club and I will see the best solution. “We’re working very hard and my players know very well we’re very focused. We’re speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Spurs will be without Sergio Reguilon for Sunday’s game against Leicester as he has a groin problem.

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive

Winners Paul Ince Who would have thought it? Certainly not us. Almost certainly not you. In truth, even Paul Ince himself must have had his doubts. But Reading’s 2-1 victory over Stoke has afforded the Royals one foot and an extra couple of toes in the Championship next season. A difficult campaign has flirted with the farcical at times in Berkshire, rarely more so than finally getting rid of Veljko Paunovic and replacing him with Ince. But that decision has been vindicated. Ince was brought in to keep Reading in the second tier and barring an insane turnaround, has done that with relative ease. He has made some odd comments and there are obvious doubts as to whether he is the right man for the long term, but he at least deserves the opportunity to be included in that discussion when May comes and Reading are almost certainly still a Championship outfit. If Reading are no longer likely to finish 21st, it is because they are looking good to overthrow Hull rather than dropping into the bottom three – since losing 4-0 to Nottingham Forest, they have taken eight points from four games and hold an eight-point buffer to Barnsley with six games remaining. Given the downward trajectory the club was on when Ince got the gig part time, those results and that league standing are impressive, even more so considering almost nobody thought it was a good idea.  Nottingham Forest As the cliche goes, it is far better to have points on the board than games in hand, but Nottingham Forest’s situation was so advantageous before Wednesday’s clash with Coventry that anything other than a play-off spot would have been considered a disappointment. After the 4-1 thrashing of Blackpool in the first game after the international break, two Midlands derbies against winnable opposition presented themselves in the form of Coventry and Birmingham. The first of those potential banana skins was passed with consummate ease, Brennan Johnson scoring once again and James Garner providing a peach of a finish. The hard part looked to be getting in the top six. If Forest get there – and it is entirely in their hands – they have to be the favourites to go up. Start getting excited, Forest fans. Eight Championship loanees ready for the Premier League  Joel Piroe A 16th Championship game in which Dutch striker Piroe has scored in his debut season for Swansea was also his 16th league goal of the campaign. Piroe absolutely refuses to deal in braces, but he has belted up Swansea’s season more than well enough to give fans something to cheer even when the going has not been so good. Now Russell Martin’s side are riding the crest of a wave with 10 points from their last four games, the thrashing of bitter rivals Cardiff on the road and a follow-up victory at Millwall in which they started the game as second favourites. It is too late to get anything more tangible this season, but if the Swans keep Piroe around at the Liberty, they are in for a treat in 2022/23. At £1million last summer, Piroe has to go down as one of the best value signings at this level for years.  Sheffield United’s old heroes 2018/19 called. They want their Sheffield United promotion heroes back. John Fleck setting up Oliver Norwood for the only goal of the game from a well-worked set-piece that puts the Blades in play-off contention sounds like something straight from the Chris Wilder playbook, but this was indicative of current manager Paul Heckingbottom’s qualities. A squad that had become stale in their second season back in the Premier League and under Slavisa Jokanovic this campaign has been reinvigorated under Heckingbottom. Lightning could still strike twice in this corner of South Yorkshire.  West Brom An excellent first half was followed by a stuttering second 45 minutes, but that didn’t detract from one of very few genuinely enjoyable matches of the season for suffering West Brom supporters. It feels too late to mean anything this term, but perhaps we have seen the start of something to build upon with Steve Bruce at the helm. Alex Mowatt started in fine fettle under his old Barnsley boss Valerien Ismael but has waned in recent months, while Andy Carroll’s first Baggies goal had eluded him since his winter switch to the Hawthorns. Both could have big futures – long and short-term respectively – in the Midlands, and Wednesday night went some way to proving that. Your support tonight was superb, Baggies. As always, it's greatly appreciated. 👊 pic.twitter.com/yEQ63MQUFm — West Bromwich Albion (@WBA) April 6, 2022   Preston setting up next season Like Swansea at the weekend, Preston proved there is never an irrelevant time to beat your local rivals. The clash with Lancashire opponents Blackpool was a mid-table game to neutrals, but meant the world to supporters of both. With play-off hopes just about in tact for either at kick off, Preston’s deserved victory affords them great optimism for next season under Ryan Lowe.  Cameron Archer It is a shame that a genuinely impressive loan spell – six goals in 12 starts earning eight points – has been for a team fighting at neither end of the table. A season-long loan spell back at Deepdale next season will be hugely beneficial for all parties.  Fulham Only so low because we are running out of superlatives, and we expect nothing less than greatness from this amazing side. Fulham were far from their best but that mattered not. A rigid defensive display was capped by a moment of typical accuracy from Aleksandar Mitrovic to deliver all three points. Two more results like that and promotion is theirs. In truth, it has been a matter of when, not if, for months now.  Aleksandar Mitrovic Thirty-eight goals, Jeremy. Thirty-eight. That’s insane.  Losers QPR’s attackers Recent results have been poor, but QPR’s performances will be of even greater concern for Mark Warburton and his side. Against Sheffield United, a game that would have seen the victors make headway at the expense of their opponents, QPR never looked like being that team. The Londoners are still only three points off the play-off places, but they are being punished for lifeless display after lifeless display which has seen them go from promotion dark horses to absolute outsiders for a top six berth. Lyndon Dykes and Andre Gray started the game and played a combined 158 of 180 minutes without ever looking like troubling the Sheffield United backline, never mind the scoreline. Dykes had started the season on fire, but the Scotland international is without a goal since January, much like veteran former hero Charlie Austin; he didn’t even get off the bench on Tuesday night. Gray has been capable of better but put in the sort of insipid performance which has been all too common this campaign.  Mark Warburton And of course the man who will pay the price for that collective failure sooner or later is the manager. Warburton’s time in the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium dug-out is done now, regardless of whether he receives his marching orders this morning or in the summer. It is nigh on impossible to envisage QPR turning around their disastrous form. A win away from the play-offs they may be, but they have been miles off the pace for the majority of the calendar year now. It is a shame that it will end with such acrimony. Warburton has done a terrific job transforming a club once known for overpaying mercenaries and turning them into a club their fans can be proud of. He has provided many memories this season, but his stubbornness in not changing a formula which stopped providing correct answers some time ago will be his undoing.  Millwall when it mattered In another corner of London, Millwall have experienced a quite different calendar year to their near-neighbours. 2022 has brought about a run of form which has seen the Lions go from absolute mid-tablers to threatening a space in the top six, culminating in a seven-game unbeaten run. With hopes of the play-offs in their sights, a Swansea side on a high from the weekend were the next obstacle to overcome. But overcome the Swans they could not. When it mattered, when a play-off spot actually looked like a reality rather than a pipe dream, Millwall could not make it count. The chances go back to being slim once more.  Michael O’Neill Stoke fans are rightfully divided on Michael O’Neill. The Potters had looked like genuine promotion challengers for much of the season, but have been facing mid-table malaise since the turn of the year. Defeat to Reading was the latest in a long line of defeats which have derailed faith in the former Northern Ireland manager. It is possible to accept that O’Neill has done an amazing job in having kept Stoke in the Championship two seasons ago, helping to shift the deadwood and giving the Potters a team with at least a semblance of identity, while also accepting that he likely isn’t the best man to take them to the next stage. One step forward on Saturday has been followed by another two back. It is probably time to change.  Middlesbrough Chris Wilder’s home form since taking charge of Middlesbrough late last year had been imperious. Against league leaders and promotion certainties Fulham, Boro put in a decent performance, but this was a third straight game at the Riverside without scoring. If we are to believe that the play-off spots are now four from six, Middlesbrough might just have found themselves as one of the outside two for the end-of-season lottery.   Coventry City Losers in name only. This has been a wonderful season for Coventry. Back in their own city, multiple moments of late magic and defying expectations on a near-weekly basis have all accompanied a fine 2021/22 campaign. This is a team and a club that can go from strength to strength from here. But Wednesday’s defeat to Nottingham Forest all but ended their chances of glory this time around. The Sky Blues are eight points off sixth-placed Sheffield United with six games to play.  Taylor Harwood-Bellis Harwood-Bellis is one of England Under-21s’ brightest stars and has a great future ahead of him. At Stoke, he hasn’t quite had the desired effect on loan from Manchester City. But just as he had begun to find some form, the young centre-back scored a comical own goal, heading into his own net under little to no pressure. It’s all very different to the promise that littered the bet365 Stadium at the season’s start. ",positive

Saint-Maximin moved to the Premier League from Nice for around £16m in August 2019 and has made 85 appearances for the Magpies. Big Midweek: Chelsea v Real, Grealish, Liverpool, West Ham He has been one of the Geordies’ best performers in recent seasons, becoming a favourite of the St James’ Park faithful. The 25-year-old’s style of play has seen him widely praised, with Joleon Lescott calling him “unplayable” after a terrific performance against Everton in February. “Saint-Maximin was outstanding, unplayable at times,”Lescott said.“He was causing so many problems going forward. “He is so unpredictable, I certainly would not want to play against him! “If he continues to produce that every game, he won’t be playing at Newcastle, he plays for one of the best teams in the world because he has got that much talent, he is a remarkable player.” According to 90min, Saint-Maximin might get his chance to play elsewhere, as they claim the Magpies are ‘open to selling’ the Frenchman. He has been ‘pushing’ for a new contract this season – despite having over four years left on his current deal – with the Newcastle board reluctant to offer him higher wages with so much time left on his contract. The report claims that Wolves are interested in signing the winger, with Adama Traore expected to leave Molineux at the end of the season. Everton are also interested but will likely need to avoid relegation from the Premier League in order to sign Saint-Maximin. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has admitted his side are still in a massive fight to stay in the division after their 5-1 defeat at Tottenham. Howe said: “We contributed to that [score]. We were 1-0 up and executing a good plan. We were controlling them as best we could. “I don’t think [it will damage] morale. In hindsight we might look back on this as a good thing. It might realign our thoughts and get us back to the basics. “We’re still in a huge fight to stay in the division. That’s six away games in seven.

The Magpies were heavily linked with the Frenchman during the winter transfer window. Newcastle did not end up agreeing a deal with Reims. But they were able to sign Bruno Guimaraes, Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Dan Burn and Matt Targett in January. Gossip: Newcastle eye Prem No.1; Arsenal learn striker price Ekitike has been a regular for Reims in Ligue 1 this season. He has missed several games due to injury but he has still played 24 times across all competitions. The 19-year-old has grabbed ten goals and three assists for Reims across all competitions. Football Insider are now reporting that Newcastle remain interested in Ekitike as he is their ‘number one forward target’. They state that the Magpies are in ‘pole position’ to sign the young attacker. It is stated that Ekitike would cost around £25m this summer. Elsewhere,Newcastle have been dealt a huge blow in their pursuit of Lille centre-half Sven Botman as he is reportedly “really close” to joining AC Milan. The Magpies were heavily linked with the Netherlands Under-21 international throughout the January transfer window. AC Milan were also linked and it is widely believed that the two teams are going toe-to-toe in pursuit of the 22-year-old defender. After failing to sign number one defensive target Botman in the winter transfer window, Newcastle turned their attention to Sevilla’s Diego Carlos, but talks also broke down over signing the Brazilian. They eventually signed a central defender on deadline day, bringing in Dan Burn from Brighton for £13.5m. A report last month claimed that the Geordies are in ‘pole position’ to sign Botman, despite the young centre-half agreeing personal terms with Milan. And now renowned transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano has reported that the Serie A leaders are “really close” to completing the signing of Botman. He wrote on Twitter: “AC Milan are really close to complete Sven Botman deal as first signing for the next season, work in progress. Talks are advanced as planned for months. “AC Milan are working to reach full agreement with Lille soon – Botman is ready to accept their proposal.” ",negative

Saint-Maximin has surprisingly been linked with a move away from St James’ Park. Championship winners and losers as Forest fly Magpies boss Eddie Howe dismissed speculation that the Frenchman will leave the club, however. He said: “He’s an incredible talent and yes, of course he has a long-term future at the club.” With rumours of the fan favourite being sold, Newcastle have been linked with numerous wingers. The Daily Mail claim they are looking to replace Saint-Maximin with Trossard, Moussa Diaby or Brennan Johnson. Johnson has been excellent for Nottingham Forest this season and is attracting lots of interest from the Premier League. As is Diaby, who has scored 16 goals and provided 11 assists in 37 appearances across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen this term. The report claims that Trossard is looking to leave Brighton at the end of the season. He has 16 months left on his contract at the Amex. Newcastle are expected to be very busy in the summer transfer window and have also been linked with West Ham attacker Jarrod Bowen. 90min report that the Magpies ‘are ready to compete with any side in the running for his signature’ this summer. It is also suggested that Howe was a ‘huge fan’ of Bowen when he was the manager of Bournemouth. Elsewhere,Mateo Kovacic has backed “amazing” Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric to still be plying his trade at the top level into his 40s. The Croatia team-mates will line up on opposite sides when Chelsea travel to the Bernabeu for the second leg of their quarter-final clash on Tuesday night. “He was always as good as he is now, for me as far as I know in the last five, six or seven years he’s on the same way level, which is amazing,” said Kovacic. “Why is that good? It is because he loves football so much. He lives it every day. He’s a professional and if he keeps going like this, I see him still playing three, four more years on such a high level.” ",positive

The former Bournemouth both also says he cannot afford to be caught up in the emotion of the Magpies’ fight for Premier League survival. 10 current goalkeepers who are a little bit barking Newcastle looked to have dragged themselves to the brink of safety with an eight-game unbeaten run which included six wins following the turn of the year. But they sit just seven points clear of the drop zone as a result of three successive defeats and Burnley’s 3-2 victory over Everton on Wednesday. A difficult run-in gets underway on Friday evening when they entertain Wolves at St James’ Park. But Howe, who was keeping both feet firmly on the ground as the most optimistic of fans contemplated an unlikely push for Europe just a few weeks ago, remains similarly measured as the pessimists start to fret. He said: “Look, I embrace the wins and I love that positive feeling, and I want to see other people happy, I want to see our supporters enjoying success. That’s my motivation to do the job. “But I don’t think it’s healthy for me to get caught up in it and become a person of extreme emotion, I don’t think that’s going to help my players at all, so staying calm, using my brain to think logically and intelligently, I think, are the things that I need. “When we went on our unbeaten run, I was the same, probably sat here and you’re thinking, ‘Come on, give us a bit more’. But then on the other side of it, I’m exactly the same. “It doesn’t mean that I don’t feel the emotion because I do. Losing for me is very painful, but it’s important I don’t get caught up in it because then I’ve got another game to prepare for, so it’s making sure I do my job effectively to help the players perform in the next match.” If defeats at Chelsea and Everton arrived in unfortunate circumstances, the second-half capitulation which contributed to a 5-1 demolition at Tottenham has prompted soul-searching on Tyneside and an acceptance that the performance was simply not good enough. Asked if the players had seen a different head coach this week, Howe, whose side faces Wolves, Leicester and Crystal Palace in back-to-back home games after four on the trot on the road, admitted as much. He said: “Certainly this week, without going into too much detail, I’ve maybe changed the way I’ve dealt with the players or certain situations because I didn’t like what I saw in the second half and I think no-one connected with the club liked what they saw in the second half.” Howe, who may have to wait until November for Dan Ashworth to be installed as Newcastle’s director of football with Brighton understood to be demanding £5million to release him from his notice period, dismissed speculation that the club could be willing to sell Frenchman Saint-Maximin this summer.

The 25-year-old Frenchman has started none of the last six games after being laid low by a combination of injury and illness, and some fans have even started to question his place in the team after a series of muted performances from the bench. Gossip: Arsenal move for Juve star, Man Utd eye Champ defender However, while highlighting the need to find the balance between his maverick attacking qualities and his more mundane responsibilities, Howe knows the player he has on his hands as he prepares his team for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Tottenham after a warm weather training trip to Dubai. The Newcastle boss said: “Maxi is certainly a unique footballer. I’ve never coached anyone quite like him, and that’s a positive thing. Some of the things he can do and some of the things he’s done in the last two weeks training-wise have been very, very good to see. “But it’s about harnessing that and trying to make that function for the team. Maxi is very keen to make a difference, he’s very keen to do well for the team, he cares passionately about the club, so I’m excited to see what he can deliver. “For a player of his type, consistency will always be an issue because it’s very difficult to do what he does. “But as long as we get the buy-in from him to the team and he is really committed to the things he finds more difficult – which would be recovery runs, working off the ball – as long as we see that, the other things will take care of themselves.” Indeed, Howe is conscious of the need not to “over-coach” a player who at his best can be an irresistible force. He said: “It’s something from getting to know Maxi that I’ve had to learn quite quickly because I think over-coaching him is a negative. Part of the strength of Allan is that you can almost let him do his stuff – but he needs to be free to do that. “You don’t want him overthinking the game because his natural talent is so impulsive.” Howe hopes to have keeper Martin Dubravka and defender Fabian Schar, who pulled out of international duty through injury and illness respectively, as well as midfielder Jonjo Shelvey available, although Covid-19 has hit his squad and staff once again. Full-back Kieran Trippier was due to undergo a scan on his fractured metatarsal on Friday, but striker Callum Wilson is fighting to play again this season as he attempts to work his way back from Achilles and calf complaints. Howe said: “We need to stress the Achilles and the calf in the right way because if we do it too quickly, then he’ll reinjure himself; if we do it too slowly, obviously we’re going to run out of time for the season.” ",positive

With 84 minutes on the clock and the game threatening to end in a 0-0 draw that would have done little to aid either team’s chances of Premier League survival, Eriksen lifted an inch-perfect cross into Ivan Toney, who headed past Nick Pope to break the deadlock. Eriksen was again influential in added time as he played through Toney, who was brought down to win a penalty that he stuck away. Chelsea sanctions being eased may not be enough to sustain them Having suffered a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, the Denmark international has been eased into the team following his January move but both he and Brentford are starting to build momentum and Frank is “convinced” he’s only going to get better. “It was a quality cross from Eriksen and a great header from Ivan,” the Bees boss said. “We’ve seen things like that against us a few times this season, but this time it was a bit of quality from us. “There is still more to come from him. Maybe not 10 top crosses a game, but more sharpness in the big moments. He’s at a good level now but the last bit will take some time. “For me [signing Eriksen] was not a gamble. I was convinced he could help us and that he could be the best signing ever for Brentford. “It was not an injury, it was a heart condition. So he wouldn’t have lost any speed or anything. There’s a mental issue but when he decided he wanted to play that was it.”  Speaking to Premier League Productions, goalscoring hero Toney said of the win: “It’s a massive step. Everyone was putting our name in the hat for relegation but we don’t listen to that. “Results haven’t been going our way but we haven’t lost desire. The team we have in the dressing room is more than capable of staying in the Premier League. “I feel like with a player like Christian Eriksen you have to stay focused at all times. I don’t think I had a shot before I scored today. I can’t thank him enough for being in the squad and helping us. “I set a target. I’m not there yet but hopefully I can hit it before the end of the season.”   ",positive

The 19-year-old came through the ranks at Chelsea. He did not make his senior debut for the Blues before he left last summer. Southampton paid around £5m to sign the right-back from their Premier League rivals. Warnings from history: Where previous QUAD BIDS went horribly wrong The Saints are enjoying a strong season as they currently sit ninth in the table. Livramento has been one of their standout players. It has been reported that Chelsea included a £38m buy-back clause in the sale of Livramento. This option becomes active at the end of the 2022/23 season. Manchester Evening News revealed earlier this week that Man Utd are interested in Livramento. The Red Devils have used Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Diogo Dalot at right-back this season.Hutton thinks Livramento would “really improve” Man Utd’s squad: “It’s going to cost Man United a lot of money,” Hutton told Football Insider. “They’ve had real problems at right-back this season. Ralf Rangnick has chopped and changed from game to game and it’s not really been settled. “They’ll be looking to sort that out for the new manager. I’m not sure Chelsea will be willing to fork out £38million with Reece James the obvious first choice, but you’re still talking a lot of money. “It’ll be an interesting one to keep an eye on this summer. Livramento is a brilliant talent who would really improve that squad – especially if they’re looking to play with wing-backs. “But it’s going to cost them mega-money, that’s for sure.” Back in November, Theo Walcott likened Livramento to ex-Southampton and Tottenham star Gareth Bale: “You know what, he actually reminds me a little bit of Gareth (Bale) coming through as a full-back. “I just feel like his presence, the way he drives, his pace and power – there’s no surprises, you know what he’s going to do but he is so strong with the ball and very clever, technically he’s fantastic. “He’s got great people around him to work with him and the great thing about Southampton is he’s got so many youth players around him. “I think it’s important to have similar age players close to you, I remember when I came through it was a lot of experienced players which was very different, but I feel like he will be able to fit right in with this generation of team coming through now. “I feel like he’s going to have a very good career.” ",positive

The Gunners have already been busy in the transfer market this summer. They first signed Benfica left-back Nuno Tavares for around £7m. They followed this up with the purchase of Anderlecht midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga for a fee in the region of £15m. Mikel Arteta’s side are also close to signing Brighton’s Ben White for £50m. Danny Murphy believes that White can push Arsenal into the top four. White plus two more makes Arsenal title contenders… Arsenal are also interested in signing Sheffield United goalkeeper Ramsdale. He is believed to be rated at around £30m this summer. The 23-year-old joined the Blades last year for around £18.5m from AFC Bournemouth. Ex-Spurs midfielder O’Hara has been speaking with talkSPORT about Ramsdale’s links to Arsenal. He claims that this move shows that they are a “mess”: “This literally sums Arsenal up doesn’t it. It sums them up business wise. “They got rid of Martinez, who’s a brilliant keeper for what, £20million or something? Let him go, a snip, was one of the best keepers last season. “And now they’re gonna go and sign someone from a relegated team for £30million, what are they doing? “Who is doing their business there? Seriously. What are they doing? They are a mess.” Elsewhere, Jack Wilshere is “surprised” that Gabriel Martinelli has not played more for Arsenal: “I was surprised at times when Arsenal needed a goal, they needed something and he wasn’t thrown on. “He is that type of player who can do that. He arrives in the box. He always seems to be in the right place, at the right time. You cannot teach them things. “I feel he will only get better with experience of playing in the big games.

The Gunners beat United 3-1 at the Emirates to strengthen their hold on fourth place in the Premier League.

After the Portuguese playmaker struck the post, Ramsdale ran up and celebrated wildly in front of him. Murphy wasn’t impressed, telling talkSPORT: “I always think when you’re getting too emotionally involved you’re detracting from your own performance. “When you start getting to the Martin Keown in [Ruud] Van Nistelrooy’s face or Ramsdale jumping out [against United], I think you’re losing the plot a little bit. It’s all a bit for fans. “I understand it. If I was his manager I’d be saying, ‘Don’t do that again’. “The best example of reining that emotional aspect of his football is [Jordan] Pickford, that’s why he’s still England No 1. “If Ramsdale’s got sights on taking over from Pickford at some point… there’s nothing wrong with passion and if you save the penalty I’d understand it. But he didn’t save it.” When it seems like it just can’t get worse for Man Utd, Bruno Fernandes misses from the spot… Was Aaron Ramsdale’s celebration reminiscent of a certain @martinkeown5 👀 pic.twitter.com/66j2orz0jb — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 23, 2022 Meanwhile, Mohamed Elnenyhas revealed that he wants to renew his Arsenal contract even if he is not guaranteed consistent game time.

I don’t decide who plays but I keep going in training to show how good I am and to make him play me. “If I don’t play I keep going until I get my chance. “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving.

But surely Aaron Ramsdale, being sent the wrong way on a penalty and celebrating in Fernandes’ face, had to go down as one of the more pathetic things I’ve seen. Through his excellent efforts this season, a complete non entity of an Arsenal team are running away with the annual Terry-Henry Trophy for most obnoxious team in the top flightJohn, Shropshire  Granit XhakaLove to hate him!!!! Golazoooooo!!!!Kenneth, 4th in Dallas  Not defending Man Utd but… I am not trying to gloss over the fact that United do not appear to have any discerning tactics or plan each week and no player in the current squad doesn’t have at least one flaw, but… Pundits and fans do seem to ignore the rotten luck they have suffered this season. Yea they were outplayed by Liverpool, but after 7 minutes 7 of their strongest 11 weren’t on the pitch. Against Arsenal, I know it’s off target but hitting the woodwork three times shows that millimeters were in it. I’ve lost track of the amount of deflected goals they have conceded. Also that Arsenal goal at Old Trafford where Fred kicked De Gea! (Was that this season?) Like I said, I’m not trying to defend their current effort, but it doesn’t seem to be talked about. I know football’s all tribal and everyone else is “sh*t”, but if something doesn’t fit what the current general view is, it’s just ignored.M  No Pogba, no Maguire, no Ole… still the same shit! The problem must be something else?Manyooligan (Ah, just remembered it’s Ronaldo) SoC  TEN HAG OUT! Oh, wait. Isn’t it Autumn yet?Mark (Tee hee) MCFC  Tell you what, I know man utd have been poor lately, and you can’t really say they deserved to win, but they at least deserved something from that game. Say what you will, the third goal should not have stood, I am not as sure about the offside decision but, yes, there is a solid argument for that as well. That said, it is quite impressive how Utd always manage to match Arsenal in strength even when they play absolute rubbish against everyone else. It is a shame, I was going to say the refereeing lately has been good and we get this match. It can’t be helped, not even a mad man will argue Utd deserve top 4 but it certainly was not out of their reach. As Rangnick said, they should have at least 8 more points than they do.Sa’ad  Worst signingWho is the worst signing in Premier League history? There’s a lot of contenders, from Torres to Chelsea and Andy Carroll to Liverpool to George weahs cousin Ali Dia hoodwinking Graeme sounness. But after some thought I’ve discovered the worst ever signing. Nope it’s not Maguire you silly United fans. It’s a city player. Benjamin Mendy is the worst ever premier League signing. A player who after signing for a world record fee played 50 games and then was never seen on a football pitch again since 2017. A player who seems to think he has a rape bonus in his contract. This is a sentence that should never be written about a football player but Mendy has 5 more (alleged) rapes than he does goals since he came to Manchester. One of those girls was 17 when the alleged incident happened. Such a danger is he to the women around him that he was only given bail on the condition that he is under house arrest and must surrender his passport and agree that he nor anyone representing him contact complainants. World record fee. Never plays. Alleged serial rapist. He’s actually done more to sully city reputation in his time their than cities ethically questionable owners. And he got paid to do it. Can anyone think of a worse signing?Lee  HateHatred is an ugly word isn’t it? An ugly word for an ugly emotion. It typically belies great ignorance, seeing another as different, separate from us and ultimately contemptible. It has lead to the worst human atrocities that we witness today and throughout history. It distorts our perspective of other people and causes us to categorise them into groups to which we assign certain characteristics. Derogatory negative characteristics that allow us to attack and destroy those we hate. We can attack physically, verbally or emotionally. Football is a microcosm of the world we live in, with every spectrum of human supporting every club. No club is without its scumbags. I like to believe that these are a small minority. I like to believe that the majority of football fans are sound and decent people. I have faith in humanity to prevail over hatred, violence and destruction. I’m a Liverpool fan. It would appear a lot of people hate us. We’re told they do anyway. That’s ok, we’re the victims right. This insidious invective is being thrown time and time again in our direction but minorities or fans but sadly increasing minorities. In the last week small numbers of Utd and City fans chose occasions of anniversaries of the deaths of footballs fans at Hillborough as an opportunity to express their hatred of Liverpool. When we are blinded by hatred we don’t see the other as a human being just like us, no different from us. There are a number of Liverpool fans who are blinded by hatred just as much as any fans of any other club. Our fans are not all sacred pure and chaste. No group of humans are. But there is a time to speak up against hatred. When we see innocent families who have suffered the most unimaginable tragedy being taunted at football matches then we have a moral responsibility to call it out and deal with those responsible. Bad things happen when good people do nothing. I call on Football365 and all decent football fans to unite against this form of footballing hatred which includes Munich air crash chants and homophobic and racist chants as much asHillsborough chants and to stand united against those who bring this to our terraces. Anyone singing these chants (how hard would it be to make a list of unacceptable ones and display at games) could easily be identified by cctv and banned for life. Ignoring hatred in the hope it goes away it a fallacy, hatred grows like a cancer amongst people unless it is identified and cut away. The silent, decent majority needs to stand together on this one.Dave LFC  Worst supporters…ever! With the news that PSG have won their record equalling 10th title you would have imagined there would have been some wild celebrations. But no! Apparently the fans booed at half time and left 15 minutes before the end, rather than celebrate with the team. All because they didnt win the champions league…having lost to minnows Real Madrid no less. Is there a more entitled and frankly disgusting set of ‘fans’ in the history of football?Zak  ",negative

Graham Potter’s side were deserved winners as Arsenal suffered their third defeat in four, with the Gunners struggling to cope in the absence of the injured Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney. The result leaves Arsenal in fifth, three points adrift of fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur, who boosted their Champions League hopes with a resounding 4-0 victory at Aston Villa. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star Speaking to the club website, Ramsdale lamented the “uphill battle” that Arsenal gave themselves by going 2-0 down, seemingly not having learnt from their sluggish start in Monday’s 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. “It’s not good enough,” he said. “Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you’re losing at half-time. “We were not in the rhythm of the game, that’s unlike us, especially at home where we’ve normally started really well all season. “It was a really poor performance and as I said we went to the end but that’s a given at any club, especially this club. When you give a team a step up in the Premier League it’s always hard to get back in the game.  “One-nil down is tough enough, two-nil down in the Premier League is even harder. So if we’d have got the first goal back even earlier we might have pushed and pushed but there was too much to do in the end. “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t. We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? “It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season.”   ",negative

They get to dress differently. They can use their hands. Attention seekers. Even straight man Hugo Lloris is toying with eccentricity, what with his length-of-the-pitch celebrations and wandering around the box as if he’s lost his wallet. Here are some of the current crop that are ever so slightly bonkers… Ben Foster When Covid stopped football way back in March 2020, chirpy Ben Foster decided to set up a YouTube channel called ‘The Cycling GK’ which merged his football passion with his bike pursuits. Foster’s enthusiasm is child-like, like a boy-man who has seen a bouncy castle for the first time. ‘Infectious’ might be pushing it as some of his colleagues look as if they may want to just hush him up; Claudio Ranieri called Foster a ‘great actor’. That’s one way of describing his broadcasting style.  Jordan Pickford We are not advocating any kind of aggression after Will Smith’s disorderly Oscar performance, but there’s a case for Pickford to be forcibly restrained from his full repertoire. The Everton and England keeper is like one of those Dreamworks cartoon characters whose every mannerism looks exaggerated. The gurning, the shouting, the mouthing and the Kung Fu fighting are just the start. Then there are the dives to balls that are going way wide or over. Gareth Southgate gets the relatively sedated version whereas Goodison brings out his Gotham City side.  Aaron Ramsdale Ramsdale must have starred in some Hovis advert in a previous life because his gestures, every roll to the ground, points to some mastery of method acting. It’s a ‘look at me’ vibe with bells and whistles and a brass band. He tends to go a bit quiet during Liverpool defeats (see Jota, Diogo). However, nothing will stop the effervescence bubbling back up to the surface. It was recently revealed that Ramsdale takes on the role of DJ after victories to play the Emirates fan favourite to the tune of Status Quo’s Rockin’ All Over the World. Fun fact, eh. In the words of @1kevincampbell “Aaron Ramsdale can be captain, but goalkeepers are crazy. They’re all mad. And he’s another one. He’s crazy! He’s a great goalkeeper but he’s mad. He loves when the opposition fans are giving him stick” We love you @AaronRamsdale98 💕 pic.twitter.com/lPlzh69hC8 — Lottie 🎗🐝 (@Lottiie_B) December 22, 2021   Pepe ReinaThe former Liverpool man went on loan to Aston Villa to ‘help’ them escape relegation by the skin of their teeth in 2020. What transpired was a keeper well past his prime who occasionally lost his goalkeeping sat-nav. Even the man with no pulse, Sven-Goran Eriksson, called Reina’s mad dash to intercept Harvey Barnes “an incredible mistake”. He’s got rhythm but might have lost the dressing room by this time…  Kepa Kepa has always had a little bit of the devil in him. Think back to the EFL Cup final against Manchester City after he staged a one-man protest and then shot himself in the foot by not saving Sergio Aguero’s peashooter. The Spaniard’s latest attempt to be the sledger- in-chief came at Wembley again a month ago when Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk et al ignored his attempts to play the big man. Jamie Redknapp blasted: “Ridiculous. I didn’t like his behaviour when the penalties were about to be taken and then he takes one of the worst penalties you’ll ever see. I don’t understand it.” Radio Ga Ga, Jamie. They all are, them keepers.   Emiliano Martinez In the win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September, the Argentinian waltzed up to Cristiano Ronaldo as if to query why the Portuguese wasn’t taking the injury-time spot-kick that could have salvaged a point for the home side. The shenanigans had the desired effect as Bruno Fernandes blazed his penalty over. Martinez then did a little jig in front of the United fans behind his goal. They loved that. When the teams met again at Villa Park, the keeper made a howler to let in a Fernandes shot but went AWOL into the arms of fans as Villa came back from two down….he’s on heat.  Kasper Schmeichel Maybe it’s the stress of knowing Leicester cannot get their head on anything that comes into their penalty area, but Kasper is steaming mad in his dotage. He made a formal complaint about Alexander Lacazette’s stuttered run-up for the penalty in Arsenal’s 2-0 win over the Foxes. In December, he even moaned that the new Premier League match ball was rubbish: “It’s a moody ball because it doesn’t do what you want it to do. Particularly when you try to hit hard, it won’t really work.” After the FA Cup win over Chelsea last year, former Leicester stalwart Andy King said: “If he concedes one goal in training he will go absolutely mental.” Indeed.  Joe Hart The Celtic keeper has been a lost soul ever since Pep decided he didn’t fancy him at City in 2016. To be fair to the Spaniard, this de-selection coincided with another international tournament where our Joe made zero big saves. Hart does not stop talking. It’s like a stream of consciousness activated by a monster energy drink. The man has resilience in spades though, especially after Nuno Espirito Santo stuck the boot in by claiming: “The ball’s too quick for you, you’re too old, you’re not moving, you’ve got no strength in your body.” When he was a bit younger, Hart used to contort his face in the tunnel, chew gum more furiously than Sir Alex Ferguson and shout obscenities to get himself ‘up for it’.  Adrian Now that Liverpool have found a proper number two, Reds fans can come out from behind the sofa and remember that, on occasion, Adrian wasn’t half bad when he wasn’t shouting at fresh air, falling over against Atletico or shovelling the ball into the net against Chelsea. Even madder – and no less amusing -was that performance in the 7-2 roasting at Villa Park when he literally went off for a jog while the ball was smacking the bar. Quite the weirdest thing. 📉 After conceding seven times, committing an error for Aston Villa’s opener, Adrian garnered a WS rating of just 3.81 this evening – the lowest in a PL game this season 👀 Alisson is also set to miss the Merseyside derby after the international break pic.twitter.com/WifCkVYp5Y — WhoScored.com (@WhoScored) October 4, 2020   Jose Sa Jose Sa has certainly made an impression between the sticks for Wolves this season as only Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City have conceded fewer goals than the Portuguese. It helps that Sa already looks like a mad sailor who lives on Captain Morgan. Conor Coady says he’s a bit barking, so it must be true. “He’s a character, a proper character,” the defender laughed. “As you probably know most keepers are, they’re all a bit mad aren’t they, they’re all a bit weird keepers, to be honest with you. He’s proper different believe me, he’s a huge character.” Okay. Conor. We get the picture. He’s a card.  ",positive

The German lost his status as first choice at the Emirates Stadium following the signing of Aaron Ramsdale last summer. Injury to his colleague has now offered the 30-year-old a route back into the side and Arteta says it is down to him to make the most of it. Arsenal, Arteta should tell Neville to go fourth and multiply Leno kept a clean sheet as Arsenal beat Aston Villa last time out and, with Ramsdale still troubled by a hip problem, he looks set to continue against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday. Arteta said: “This is football and it’s not an individual sport. I have a lot of sympathy with every player that doesn’t play and doesn’t get the chances they probably deserve but unfortunately that’s the game. “When he’s been playing for 10 years that meant someone has been there waiting for that opportunity.

In the goalkeeping position it’s no different. “That is why we bought Aaron, to get the standards higher, to bring different qualities, different ways of understanding and acting during matches, and different experiences. “With Bernd we have the capacity to play him (on Monday) and we know what we’re going to get. “He’s done a very similar thing to Cedric (Soares) and Nico (Pepe) – not accepting the situation, but trying to improve it. “And then he’s been consistent in the way he trained, the way he behaved, in those months, waiting for the opportunity and, when he had it, to take it.” Arteta recognises it can be difficult for a player to accept a reduced status having seen it many times during his own playing career.  The Spaniard, who spent 11 years in the Premier League with Everton and Arsenal, admits he only appreciates the bigger picture now because he is a coach. He said: “I can give you hundreds of examples. When you start to get to 30, 31 and 32 it’s going to happen, I guarantee it’s going to happen at some stage in your career. “But if it is that late I think it’s a good sign, that means you’ve been pretty consistent because it can happen much earlier. “It’s never easy to accept for a player but we want the best, so if we make a decision to play somebody else it’s because we believe in that moment it’s better for the team to play somebody else. That’s it. “There is not a personal thing in that decision at all and it cannot be taken personally. “I didn’t play when I was younger, you never understand the reason. They can explain to you but you will never understand, you’ll never agree to it. “That’s normal but when you’re on the other side of the table the picture changes completely.” Arsenal have recovered from a poor start to the season to put themselves in a strong position to claim a Champions League place. Correspondingly, expectations may have changed but Arteta feels no need to change anything now. He said: “This is a conversation we have had now for over six to eight weeks, so they have already been through that and have responded really, really well. There is nothing new that they have to do.”  ",positive
353,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-fa-regulators-done-enough-damage-premier-league,FA as regulators? They have done enough damage already,"The FA response to the fan-led review looks very much as if it’s about their level of control rather than the actual good of the game. Considering the existential questions that football in England is currently asking itself, it’s hardly surprising that the international break should have seen a flurry of comment on the subject. It’s been almost six months since the publication of the fan-led review into the governance of the game, and still nothing substantive has come from the government on the subject, despite many fine words from politicians of all hues. Small wonder that some are starting to ponder whether, in the face of intense lobbying from those with an extremely vested interest in maintaining the status quo, there’s any interest in seeing this through on the part of the law-makers beyond reaping whatever positive headlines they can from promising to see it through while sitting on their hands. The Premier League’s reticence to embrace substantive change surprised nobody, but what of the FA? After all, they remain – in theory, at least – the ultimate governors of the game in this country, and they have a responsibility to the whole of football rather than just the narrow interests of 20 member clubs. As such, we might have expected a slightly more nuanced view from the FA, but there’s a problem with this; the FA ceded a considerable amount of control over the governance of the game to the leagues themselves a long time ago, and it’s hardly as though they didn’t play a role themselves in the mess in which we find ourselves. It’s been more than 30 years since the plot to break the top division of English football away from the rest and keep the proceeds for themselves was first hatched, but for all the historical revisionism of claiming that this was in some way ‘inevitable’, this was far from the truth. In 1988, the Football League had produced a manifesto called One Game, One Team, One Voice, which proposed a holistic approach to the development of all levels of football which placed itself at the centre. Coming at the same time as a new television contract which increased the value of TV rights from £6.3m to £44m, hostility between the two bodies grew to such an extent that, after the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 led to Lord Justice Taylor calling for ‘the fullest reassessment of policy for the game’, the FA commissioned its own report. Published in April 1991, the Blueprint of the Future of Football legitimised the formation of the Premier League. The FA’s ‘prime objective’ was ‘establishing the England team at the apex of the pyramid of playing excellence’, and to that end they promoted the FA Premier League, which would be ‘governed by a committee of the FA’ and which would consist of 18 clubs, created to prevent the formation of a ‘break-away league [which] would be driven by commercial considerations’ rather than ‘a desire to elevate the England team’. This, as has been abundantly clear for the last three decades, simply did not happen. All the Premier League needed for legitimisation was the say-so of the FA. They didn’t really need them for anything else, and by the time the new league became a reality, everything that might benefit the game in a broad sense had been stripped away, with only the true reasons for its formation – to concentrate wealth and power within the new league – remaining. In short, the FA was completely out-flanked by the businessmen running the clubs. The Premier League never was reduced to 18 clubs, and the FA was never allowed anywhere near its actual decision-making. In truth, the formation of the Premier League enfeebled both the FA and the Football League.  Considering all of this, it should come as no surprise that in 2022 the FA’s response to the fan-led review has been fierce opposition and an attempt to cement its own power again. The Times reports that they are redoubling their efforts this week with a letter in which they claim, somewhat conveniently, that they should be given the control that Tracey Crouch believes should be handed to an independent regulator. They intend to put the matter to a vote of the FA Council this week; for reference, here’s a list of the members of that organisation. Crouch’s review has already suggested that the FA could take on the regulatory role, but only if it first went through a process of reform and modernisation, including the composition of its current board. The FA’s letter to council members suggests there is resistance to that sort of reform being forced on the FA by Crouch, and that reform of the board is conditional on the government ditching any plan to appoint an external regulator. But why, exactly, should they get a piece of this particular pie when it was their own politicking that went so far towards bringing the Premier League into existence in a form that benefited 20 clubs above all others in the first place? The FA voluntarily ceded regulatory control to leagues themselves years ago. Meaningful reform should not be about the same old revolving cast of actors spinning before alighting at the same old, white, male faces yet again. Once again, we’re reminded of where the true fault-line within English football truly rests, between those who have profited handsomely from the last 30 years and those who haven’t. The urgent need for an independent regulator exists because those who are have been in a position to reform the game over that period of time have actively resisted doing so. Yet there they still sit, Premier League clubs owners muttering ominously about ‘killing golden geese’, while the FA can come up with nothing more imaginative than giving control back to them. The results of the Mail on Sunday’s State of the Game poll, surveying the supporters of Premier League clubs, are pretty clear. They want significant reform. And it seems inconceivable that supporters of EFL clubs wouldn’t want to go considerably further. But the reactions of the Premier League and the FA have been instructive. The fan-led review is to be watered down to the greatest extent possible. The explicit requests of fans must be ignored, in order that those who have had their snouts in the trough and control in their hands may continue to do so. The FA already knows that ‘To have any chance whatsoever of being considered as a credible body within which to house an independent regulator, we must demonstrate to government that not only are we willing to change, but that we have already effected change.’ The entire reason we are in this position in the first place is that no-one in a position to effect change within the game has bothered to do so. All concerned had their chance, but they had their eyes on feathering their own beds and their own political squabbles instead. They’ve all had their chance, over the last 30 years, and yet here we all are. The FA are welcome to make their case for why they should be entrusted with such control, but that doesn’t mean that anyone has to pay the slightest bit of attention. ",positive

The 21-year-old progressed through the ranks at Man Utd. He made his senior debut for them during the 2018/19 campaign. Garner went onto play six times for United during the 2019/20 season. He has spent the last couple of seasons in the Championship. Ranking the England chances of 88 uncapped PL starters Last season he had spells at Watford and Nottm Forest as he played 40 times in the league. The Englishman returned to Forest ahead of the start of this season. He has played 36 times across all competitions this term as he is one of the players spearheading their promotion push. Nottm Forest currently sit ninth in the Championship but they will move into the play-offs if they make the most of their games in hand. Leeds United meanwhile are 16th in the Premier League. They are currently seven points clear of the bottom three. Phil Hay of The Athletic has revealed that Garner has been ‘mentioned recently’ as a ‘target’ for Leeds. The West Yorkshire outfit will likely have to stay up if they are to have any chance of signing the midfielder on loan. Elsewhere, Leeds striker Patrick Bamford is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of six weeks because of an injury to the sole of his foot. The 28-year-old was withdrawn midway through the first half in the 3-2 win at Wolves before the international break, having only recently returned from a foot complaint. While he will not require an operation, Leeds announced Bamford faces missing another sizeable chunk of the season after rupturing his plantar fascia. Bamford was Leeds’ top-scorer on their Premier League return last season with 17 goals in 38 games, but he has featured in just nine of the club’s 30 matches this term due to hamstring and ankle problems. Leeds’ head of medicine and performance Rob Price said on the club website: “(Bamford) has played with a plantar fascia injury for the last 12 months. “Despite treatment and a prolonged period of rehabilitation, the injury has progressed from a partial tear to a full rupture. “Injuries to the plantar fascia are notoriously difficult to manage, but all concerned are confident that he will make a full recovery from this injury in good time. “What (Bamford) needs is a period of rest and rehabilitation to allow his body to fully recover.” ",negative

But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

356,https://www.football365.com/news/tottenham-3-1-west-ham-son-brace-keeps-spurs-in-touch-with-top-four,Tottenham 3-1 West Ham: Son brace keeps Spurs in touch with top four,"Heung-Min Son scored a brace as Tottenham beat West Ham 3-1 in the Premier League to keep in the hunt for the Champions League places. The South Korean scored twice, having also been involved in Kurt Zouma’s own goal, as Spurs made it four Premier League victories from five to close the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal. Arteta the fraud, muddy Liverpool waters and more mails They are now three points behind the Gunners, who have a game in hand but still have to visit their north London rivals in a clash that is yet to be rescheduled. Antonio Conte’s men, who also climbed above the Hammers, will believe they have the momentum in the battle for the top four as they signed off for the international break in style. This was a damaging defeat for West Ham, who got on the scoresheet through Said Benrahma, in their own pursuit of the top four as they are six points behind the Gunners having played two games more and winning the Europa League may now be their most realistic route of getting Champions League football next season. The Hammers’ exertions against Sevilla on Thursday night must have played a part as Tottenham made an impressive start and went ahead in the ninth minute, becoming the beneficiaries of another own goal. Matt Doherty won the ball high up the field with some good pressing, Harry Kane squared to Son and the last touch came from Kurt Zouma – the sixth time an opposition player has put through his own net against Spurs this season. West Ham should have levelled almost instantly as Eric Dier was muscled off the ball by Michail Antonio, but he drilled inches wide. A matter of inches also denied Tottenham a second shortly afterwards as a forging run by Dejan Kulusevski, followed by a one-two with Kane, saw him break into the box and his pullback was turned onto a post by Son. The South Korean finally got his goal as Spurs doubled their lead in the 24th minute as he again paired up with Kane. Kane’s defence-splitting pass sent him clear and he lashed the ball past Lukasz Fabianski with the aid of a deflection. Spurs were in total control, but they allowed West Ham back into the game 10 minutes before the break as they were punished for some poor defending. Doherty conceded a needless corner which was allowed to make its way to the far post where Benrahma was waiting to convert, having lost his marker. The second half was on a knife edge as both sides had chances in the first 15 minutes. Kane wasted a massive chance to make it 3-1 as a heavy first touch from Son’s through ball allowed Fabianski to come out and make a save, while Antonio blazed well over at the far post from Aaron Creswell’s cross. Spurs began to find space on the counter-attack and had Sergio Reguilon any sort of confidence in the penalty area he might have been able to extend the lead, but after two Kane passes put him in the clear, he first elected to go down looking for a penalty and then shot straight at Fabianski. The England captain was then guilty of missing a golden chance to wrap the game up with 10 minutes remaining. A clever pass by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg played him in on goal, but Kane skied his effort when trying to clip the ball over Fabianski. Spurs finally ensured it would not be a nervy finish as Son killed the game in the 88th minute, latching onto Kane’s header and converting with ease for the pair’s 39th goal combination in the Premier League.

357,https://www.football365.com/news/top-10-moments-puskas-winning-erik-lamela-tottenham,Top 10 moments from Puskas-winning sh*thouse Erik Lamela,"Your modern football fans all like to see bias in absolutely everything ever written about association football, and, like a stopped clock, they will sometimes be right. We are very, very, very biased in favour of Erik Lamela, the greatest sh*thouse the Premier League ever saw and someone who we miss terribly now he’s wasting away in Spain or some such footballing backwater rather than delighting us with his antics on the regular in proper football, English football. Whenever we’re feeling down – and while Blue Monday might be a load of old marketing tosh there’s no denying that a grey January day when Premier League matches keep getting postponed is pretty grim – we like to remember Erik the Magnificent and all the great and so often underappreciated things he did for the game in this country. Clearly, the lads at FIFA feel the same because they’ve only gone and given him the Puskas Award for that extraordinary goal that delighted us all and bored Alan Smith senseless. 🚨🏆 The FIFA #Puskás Award goes to @ErikLamela for his sensational goal for @SpursOfficial v Arsenal! A strike worthy of being called #TheBest 🤩 — FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) January 17, 2022 More than enough justification I think you’ll agree (and I don’t care if you don’t, because bias) to wheel out a top 10 of our favourite Lamela moments.  10) Having a navy blue Santa at his kid’s Christmas party At number 10 purely to instantly highlight the sort of person we’re dealing with here. There’s something joyous about a player – especially a foreign one – joining a club and becoming as absurdly obsessed with the club as the most hopelessly addicted fan. Lamela is one such player, instantly becoming fully COYS to the extent that he wouldn’t allow a traditional red Santa at a kids’ party. There’s a petty brilliance that tells you so, so much about his on-field nonsense. Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Erik Lamela makes sure Santa is dressed in blue instead of red because he is so Spurs! 🥰💙#THFC #COYS pic.twitter.com/2MTRYGjkzj — Last Word On Spurs 🇮🇹 (@LastWordOnSpurs) December 25, 2019   9) Burnley water bottle mischief Classic Lamela, this, coming off the bench to help Spurs defend a shaky 1-0 lead at a time under Jose Mourinho’s reign of terror when they were conspicuously bad at doing so. Quickly and correctly identifying Burnley’s likeliest route back into the game, Lamela produces a Proper Tackle on Dwight McNeil to Let Him Know He’s There. Enough for most players, for mere mortals, but just the starter for the Machiavellian Lamela. When the Burnley physio arrives on the scene, Lamela nonchalantly steals his water bottle. Absolutely freaks my nut that there are people out there who honestly think winning a Carabao or whatever is somehow better and more important than this.  8) Calling Jack Wilshere a pussy North London Derbies were the ideal canvas for an artist such as Lamela. The heat and fire of the occasion ideal fodder for his brand of infuriating nonsense. While his true masterpiece was still a couple of years away, sending Wilshere into a blind rage by hacking him down and then saying “F*** you, pussy” was the sort of thing that makes you wonder what goes on in the heads of those Spurs fans – and they did still exist right to the end – who never rated their greatest ever player. Look at his face, just look at his face. Erik Lamela to Jack Wilshere: “F*ck off you p*ssy”. God how can you not love this little Argentinian bastard. Knew exactly what he was doing, just look at the smirk on his face. 😂👏🏻#THFC #COYS pic.twitter.com/f6Imz3y4Xk — Ricky Sacks 🎙 (@RickySacks) February 10, 2018   7) The Anthony Martial red card It’s barely 15 months since Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham happened, but it already seems like ancient and dubious history. Did it really happen? Can’t have, surely. Too silly. Lamela didn’t bother himself with such frippery as joining in with the goal fun on this occasion, funnelling all his energies into sh*thousing. We’ll never know just how decisive his actions were to the final outcome, but it’s reasonable to assume ‘pretty bloody decisive’ would be somewhere close. An odd game had already seen Spurs overturn an early deficit to lead 2-1 before Lamela’s 28th-minute masterpiece in which he would wind up Martial so much that the Frenchman had simply no option but to respond in the most minor way imaginable. That was all Lamela needed. Down he went, off Martial went. As United struggled to cope with the stupidity of it all and heads in red were gone everywhere you looked, Spurs helped themselves to another couple of goals in the eight minutes that followed.  6) Bellowing at the Ajax fans Okay, even we are prepared to admit that Lamela has to take second place to Lucas Moura in the story of Spurs’ most astonishing victory of recent times. But that doesn’t mean our hero didn’t play his part, shrewdly deciding that Lucas’ 96th-minute winner was the perfect time to start screaming at the heartbroken, crestfallen Ajax fans. That only one of them is moved to propel a bottle at him is frankly astonishing. Lucas Moura v Ajax“Ohhhh they’ve done it” pic.twitter.com/ju2jQpbhTI — george (@StokeyyG2) January 16, 2022   5) Last-minute ball-roll v Ajax But even that wasn’t his final or even best contribution to that memorable night. It’s funny how memory can deceive; we, understandably, see that final, decisive goal all the time. The commentary even calls it “the last kick of the game”. But it wasn’t. Despite the goal coming in the sixth minute of added time there was what, at the time, seemed an interminable further period of play before the final whistle. Countless moments in which Spurs had the time and opportunity to do something more Spurs than any Spurs they had ever Spursed before. So what did Lamela do? Just casually completed some of his trademark ball-rolls on the edge of his own area while every Spurs fan on earth tried to process what had just happened and what still could. In those crazy moments, Lamela stayed in his process and stuck to what he knew. These are the things that separate the good from the great.  4) Technically not scoring a hat-trick against Leicester Strip everything else away, and Lamela brings two things to a football match. First, he treats every game as if it’s a World Cup final, and second, he brings pure chaotic energy. In a way, that makes him perhaps the perfect footballer for the final day of the league season, a day when logic and sense traditionally goes out of the window and the actual significance of a match is often inversely proportional to how entertaining it turns out to be. He’d already had previous in final-day daftness, scoring the one in Spurs’ 5-1 thrashing at already-relegated Newcastle to cede second place to Arsenal in 2016.  Spurs were already assured of a top-four finish by the time the final game of 2017/18 came round against Leicester but were still a bit miffed to find themselves 3-1 down early in the second half at Wembley. Fifteen minutes later, Lamela had scored three to put Spurs 4-3 up. Sure, Leicester would go on to equalise for 4-4 and force Harry Kane into scoring the actual winner, and the joyless know-nothings at the Dubious Goals Panel would officially award the second of Lamela’s three goals to Chrstian Fuchs, but real heads know what went down that day.  3) Getting kicked up the arse by Virgil van Dijk Hard as it may be to comprehend now, back in the dim and distant past of early 2018 Liverpool and Spurs were direct rivals. Both were locked in a scrap for Champions League qualification and Spurs arrived at Anfield in February sat in fifth place, two points behind their hosts in third. For a full appreciation of how much has changed in the four years since, Burnley were seventh. This was a great game even before Lamela got involved in the dying moments. Mo Salah gave Liverpool a third-minute lead which they held for 77 minutes. Then it all went silly. Victor Wanyama thrikered home a daft equaliser, before Harry Kane uncharacteristically missed a penalty. Salah then appeared to have won the game for Liverpool with a very characteristic slaloming run and ingenious finish over Hugo Lloris in added time. Enter Lamela, who detected contact from Van Dijk in an early pre-colossus Liverpool display and hit the ground in his usual quiet, undemonstrative manner. Another penalty, and this time Kane made no mistake. Both would end up in the top four, going on to contest the Champions League final the following season.  2) The non-Puskas-winning Rabona v Asteras Tripolis It takes Lamela-level genius to steal the show in a Europa classic in which Harry Kane scores a hat-trick and then goes in nets after Hugo Lloris gets sent off and promptly chucks a consolation goal for the Greeks into his own net. But Lamela did precisely that with a goal so extraordinary that at first watch on TV it looks like a glitch. Any goal you have to instantly rewind just to figure out what happened is worth cherishing. That his later exploits would make it possible to have a debate about which Rabona was his best is testament to the great man. This one, while undoubtedly in a lower-profile game, came from greater distance and has an inherently pleasing trajectory that would have been deeply satisfying had it been produced by the sort of dreary run-of-the-mill footballer who thinks using their right foot is a legitimate option.  1) The Puskas-winning Rabona v Arsenal The first ever Puskas Award-winning goal to have “just trundled in”. Incredible that it’s not for sure the best Rabona goal Lamela has scored for Spurs. Judging by this, it might not even be in the top two for his career. But this was pretty special. The nutmeg on its way is pure chef’s kiss. That it came in what would eventually be a pretty limp 2-1 NLD defeat makes it undeniably apt as the final great moment in Lamela’s Spurs career, not least because he also managed to get himself sent off for, staggeringly, the one and only time during his eight years in England. It’s worth noting that the criteria for the Puskas, an inevitably futile attempt to codify something as subjective as goal greatness, contains the phrase “aesthetically significant”. It is a perfect description of Lamela, a player who is nowhere near the best and certainly not the most successful but has brought so very much to the sport. And it proves once and for all that the decision to swap him for a member of Spain’s fifth best Beatles tribute band – and to send millions of pounds Sevilla’s way on top – is an act of extreme cultural vandalism at which even the current government would baulk.

Tottenham travelled to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Spurs were arguably the better side over the course of the 90 minutes but they were beaten 3-2. Big Midweek: Man Utd v Atletico, Everton, Ramsdale, West Ham Maguire’s own-goal made it 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. When this went in, Romero taunted the out-of-form Man Utd star. This backfired in the end though as Cristiano Ronaldo completed his hat-trick to settle the game in the 81st minute. Speaking post-match, Roy Keane criticised Romero for his celebration: “Not good. No, no, no. You get no luck for that. When you’re a player you take note, don’t worry. You take note of that.” Parlour has now suggested that if he was Maguire, he would have “taken out” Romero for his actions: “I think that’s bang out of order. I don’t think I’d do that. It’s a big game for both sides but come on,” Parlour said (via the Standard). “I don’t know the situation but you don’t need to do that. Just take the goal and run away and celebrate with your team-mates. “I’m with Roy Keane. I’ll be waiting for him in the next game, do him – boff! “You can take him out though! Go for a tackle and get a yellow card for it. “Don’t do it 100 per cent, just take him out. I got brought up in an era where you do that – Martin Keown, Tony Adams – they know exactly who’s taking the mickey out of people and they do him.” Tottenham manager Antonio Conte admitted his side were beaten by the brilliance of Ronaldo rather than Manchester United. “We’re talking about a player who not only tonight showed he is a top, top player. “Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the two best players in the world in this era. When you play against this type of player, they’re decisive. “Without Cristiano Ronaldo, for United it wouldn’t have been a good night.” ",positive
359,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-manchester-united-3-2-tottenham-hotspur-cristiano-ronaldo-harry-maguire?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,16 Conclusions: Man Utd 3-2 Tottenham Hotspur,"Manchester United beat Spurs in their shoot-out to stay in the race for a Champions League place, with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. 1) Manchester United and Spurs both went into this match aware of the fact that, for all the stop-start nature of their football over the course of this season, we’re reaching the point at which dropped points can no longer be tolerated if their ambitions are to be realised. Arsenal are the clear favourites to grab the fourth Champions League place; unless there are further unexpected chapters in the story of Chelsea’s season, only one of these three clubs has any realistic chance of playing in the Champions League next season. This match was not far short of a shoot-out to stay in that race.  2) Both Manchester United and Spurs remain in a state of limbo, their futures not entirely certain. Manchester United are no closer to finding a permanent manager for next season than they have been. Erik ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino continue to lead the way in the betting markets, but Pochettino finds himself simultaneously more likely to be available come the end of the season and less likely to appeal to a team harbouring ambitions of winning the Champions League following PSG’s capitulation against Real Madrid a few days earlier. And then, of course, there’s growing speculation that they may even be monitoring the Thomas Tuchel situation at Chelsea.  3) Spurs, meanwhile, may have racked up five goals in their last match, but that came against 11 scarecrows dressed as Everton players and there was a sense that they hadn’t even played particularly well to get that win. But the gloom that had descended with defeats to Southampton, Wolves and Burnley – not to mention against Middlesbrough in the the FA Cup – had been lifted a little by 180 minutes of shooting practice against Leeds and Everton, during which they racked up nine goals and a little much-needed self-confidence. Early winner: Man Utd’s greatest problem, Cristiano Ronaldo  4) For everything that’s been said about his future at Manchester United, the old dog can still pull a trick or two out upon request. Cristiano Ronaldo’s 12th-minute goal, a swerving 25-yarder from a Fred flick which left Hugo Lloris grasping at thin air, was yet another demonstration of the Ronaldo paradox. United had not been firing on all cylinders of late, and suggestions had been growing that his return may be ending ahead of the end of his contract, but it only took him to be in the right position once to be able to settle those early Old Trafford nerves. It hasn’t been enough to sustain United to the extent that might have happened with a team with a fully-functioning defence throughout the season, but it’s in moments like this you see the reasons why they would want to keep hold of him.  5) One viewer’s exciting end-to-end battle is another viewer’s match rendered open by two leaky and slightly panicky defences. Spurs reacted positively to United’s opening goal, and were probably the better team over the remainder of the first half. They dominated possession, and early commentary talk of how United were getting their ‘arrogance’ back soon quietened as they continued to press forward and the home defence started to buckle in front of them.  6) The one player who has impressed more than any other in the Spurs team over the last six weeks or so has been new signing Dejan Kulusevski. Kulusevski was a menacing presence on the Tottenham right throughout the game, unafraid to run at defenders despite not seeming to have an enormous amount of pace himself, eager to tackle back, and imaginative in his passing. And it was his hard work that brought Spurs level, beating two defenders on the right-hand side with something akin to sheer force of will and then driving the ball against Alex Telles’ arm for a penalty kick, which Harry Kane drilled past David De Gea. It was no less than Spurs’ previous 20 minutes deserved.  7) That Spurs’ parity only lasted for three minutes speaks volumes about the frustrations of their season. When Nemanja Matic released Jadon Sancho on the right-hand side, Sergio Reguilon stepped out half a yard too late and the trap had been sprung. With Tottenham arms still in the air, Sancho hared away and delivered a low cross for Ronaldo to score from close range. It was a second goal that United’s previous first-half performance scarcely deserved, but such lackadaisical defending warranted it.    8) Spurs dominated the first 15 minutes of the second half too, but their ball delivery and decision-making in the final third of the pitch was visibly poor. On three or four occasions, they pinned United back effectively, only for the final pass to fall straight at a United defender’s feet or for the ball to sail safely over the goal and away to safety. The only clear chances of this period fell to Son Heung Min, who shot wide from 12 yards, but even this most likely came about because the ball into his feet came a few inches behind him, meaning that he couldn’t quite get the angle on his shot that he would have wanted, and to Ronaldo, who managed to wiggle himself into a little space on the right, only to see Lloris beat his shot away. But the quality dipped overall throughout this period from both teams, everything getting a bit scrappy from both teams. Whatever this period of the game may have looked like, it didn’t look much like ‘Champions League’ football.  9) Marcus Rashford continues to underwhelm. He was an anonymous presence in attack for much of his time on the pitch, and his withdrawal to make way for Anthony Elanga midway through the second half was no great surprise. It is worth remembering that the England squad players from last summer’s European Championships didn’t get much of a break last summer and that club form across that entire squad this season has been patchy, but if he is, as has been reported, getting frustrated by his lack of game time and is considering taking his chances elsewhere, then he’s going to have to up his game if he wants to continue playing at this sort of level.  10) We do need to talk about Harry Maguire. It’s not so much that he’s a bad footballer – bear with me, here – it’s more that he has this habit of throwing himself into these unnecessary high-profile disasters. On this occasion, Son released Reguilon on the left-hand side; Cristian Romero had appeared in a dramatically offside position, and had Maguire let Reguilon’s low cross be tapped over the line by Romero it would almost certainly have been called back for offside. It was a quintessential Maguire moment, a momentary ungainliness in which he appeared to forget not only how to defend a low cross, but also the basic rules of how to be a biped. Romero, for his part, took a moment to gurn in Maguire’s face, all of which made what followed seem somewhat inevitable.  11) When Ronaldo’s header cracked into the top corner of the Spurs goal to restore United’s lead for a third and decisive time, the commentary team were very keen to tell us all how he’d ‘proved his doubters wrong’. Well… not quite. No-one ever denied that Ronaldo would score goals for United this season. Those who were sceptical of his transfer wondered whether he would bring a little imbalance into United’s squad, and whether he would be either willing or able to join in the high tempo, pressing game that is commonplace in the Premier League nowadays. No-one has ever doubted Ronaldo’s ability to improve his personal statistics, but for Manchester United the more important issue this season has been how to improve the club’s statistics, by getting closer to the top of the Premier League to start with, and that simply hasn’t happened. Who knows, perhaps Manchester United will win the Champions League in the style of that extraordinary advert he made a couple of years ago, just like his fever dreams. But it is worth remembering that prior to this match, he’d scored just one Premier League goal in 2022, and it doesn’t seem healthy that United were so dependent on this one player to dig them out of a hole.  12) But the record-breaking and the sense of occasion are genuinely remarkable. He’s now scored 807 career goals, lifting him to fifth in FIFA’s all-time rankings, and it says something for his force of personality that he is able to do this, even occasionally, at 37 years old. The third goal was really a consummation of this self-determination, an almost brutal shoving of Matt Doherty out of the way of the ball, as though by force of will. Romero, the tormentor of Maguire after his own goal, was nowhere to be seen. And it would be both churlish and fundamentally untrue to say that these occasions when Ronaldo lives out his Roy of the Rovers fantasies in public have no value to Manchester United. Without his presence, United almost certainly would have lost this match; there remains no other player in the Premier League who can spin a match on its head quite like him.  13) United did seem to miss the channelled aggression of Bruno Fernandes in attacking midfield positions. He was laid low by illness. More interesting was the performance of Fred, who was almost unrecognisable as a terrier-like presence in a defensive midfield slot. Fred has become something of a meme over the course of his time at Old Trafford, but it should be recognised when he puts in a truly accomplished performance. Were it not for his hat-trick-grabbing, headline-hogging team-mate, Fred’s would have been a Man of the Match performance. If anyone, he resembled N’Golo Kante in this match, and praise doesn’t come much higher than that.  14) Spurs are probably right to feel aggrieved at having come away from this match empty-handed. They dominated for long periods, and although United were more successful in holding them at arm’s length in the second half, there were only brief spells when it felt as though United were pinning Spurs back in the same way. If Conte is feeling in a philosophical mood, he may wish to ponder that it is sheer bad luck to be up against Ronaldo when he is having an evening like this. Somehow, it seems unlikely that Conte will see it this way, but his team did put in a creditable performance, even if they left with nothing to show for it. 15) Manchester United remain a curate’s egg, flashes of brilliance mixed with mundanity and occasional moments when individual players seem to forget how to play the game altogether. This result lifts them back into fourth place in the Premier League table, the minimum requirement for the Glazers, as everybody knows, but match postponements earlier in the season give the table a somewhat unreal look. United are in that final Champions League place now, but it still seems unlikely that they will be by the end of this season.  16) It’s entirely possible that Ronaldo’s hat-trick will finally galvanise United, and that rising back to fourth place in the Premier League table will give them a critical psychological push, as the season enters its closing straights. But although United are back in fourth, they only lead Arsenal by two points and Arsenal, who’ve lost just one their last ten Premier League matches, have four games in hand in which they can clamber back above them. It might be that they’ve left it just a little too late for this season, and with big changes coming at Old Trafford during the summer, quite what the future holds for United remains as much of a mystery as it has for much of the time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. But perhaps today wasn’t really about the long game. Ronaldo may be off at the end of this season, or he may stay for the second year of his contract, but days like this are likely to get increasingly rare, so perhaps United supporters are best advised to stop looking nervously at the league table and just wallow in the glow that comes from a 3-2 win with a Ronaldo hat-trick. Moments like this are, after all, ultimately what the game is all about. ",positive

Aston Villa duo Emiliano Martinez and Emiliano Buendia, along with Tottenham’s Giovani Lo Celso and Cristian Romero – on loan at Villarreal and from Atalanta respectively – were sanctioned by FIFA’s disciplinary committeeover a failure to comply with the world governing body’s Covid-19 protocols. The match on September 5 was called off after Brazilian officials walked onto the pitch to confront the four players over their alleged breach of Covid-19 rules. Frank Lampard’s Everton lead Premier League winners and losers The FIFA disciplinary committee has ordered the qualifier to be replayed at a location and date to be set by FIFA, and has fined the Brazilian and Argentinian federations 500,000 and 200,000 Swiss francs respectively over order and security breaches – around £400,000 and £160,000 each. Each federation was also hit with a further 50,000 Swiss francs (just under £40,000) fine over the abandonment. Argentina’s players walked off the pitch after the Brazilian health authority officials came on to it. The four Argentina players were alleged to have declared false information on official forms to the country’s authorities and in doing so broke Covid-19 quarantine rules. Romero and Lo Celso started the match, along with Villa goalkeeper Martinez, but Buendia was not in the matchday 23. Romero and Lo Celso were understood to have travelled to South America for international duty against Spurs’ wishes. Premier League clubs had made a collective decision not to release players during last September’s international window if it meant them travelling to red-list countries as they would face 10 days of quarantine on their return.

READ MORE: Spurs should be just as worried as Saints about Hasenhuttl January signings Bentancur and Kulusevski once again featured from the bench after their cameos against Brighton on Saturday. Bentancur entered the fray 10 minutes beforeSon Heung-min put Spurs in front, while Kulusevski came on six minutes later, but former Spurs boss Sherwood blamed the pair for the defeat. He told Premier League Productions: “In the end, the best team beat the best players. Southampton were quality. They knew, in possession and out-of-possession. “They had a game plan. I thought their game plan was a lot better than Tottenham’s. You look at the attempts. 23 attempts to Tottenham’s eight? I thought they deserved the game. “It’s not about holding on. Antonio needs to get better control of the football match. Then you don’t have to hold on. You can’t just rely on holding on and gamesmanship just to preserve your three points. “I think he has done a brilliant job since he has been in there. He is still learning about the players. He brings on Kulusevski and Bentancur. And they change the game, as soon as they come on, Tottenham lost.” Conte admitted after the defeat that his side need to “manage the game” better in the future. “It was a pity because in the first half we struggled against them. But in the second half we played well and scored a goal. Then at that moment, you have to try to keep the result until the end,” Conte said. “We had other chances to score as well but last time against Leicester we were losing 2-1 and won 3-2, but this time we were leading 2-1 and lost 3-2. “There is a long way in front of us and we have to be better to manage the game in different situations. There are many parts of the game and we can improve in this aspect. “The message at half-time was, in the first half we made many mistakes and many times the pass was not good and we risked complicating our life. “This is a part of the process and you have to try to improve, to understand when there is a bit of pressure you have to be more accurate in the pass and decision making. The players gave everything tonight and that is why it was a pity to lose the game. When you give everything and lose, that is no good. “I repeat, in the first half every time we moved the ball we found the situation for chances to score. In the first half maybe we made some mistakes on the ball and it gave us a bit of instability. “We have to try to improve in this aspect. I know very well that this team is young, many players have to play to get the experience, especially in this league. I knew there was a lot of jobs to go.” ",positive
362,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-ready-pounce-arsenal-saka-one-condition-champions-league,Liverpool ready to pounce for Arsenal star on one condition,"Premier League sides Liverpool and Manchester City are lining up moves for Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka this summer, according to reports. The England international has contributed six goals and four assists in the Premier League this seasonand has become one of the Gunners’ most important players at the age of 20. There have been rumours for a while that Liverpool are looking to bring some youth into their attack with Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane all around 30. F365 Says: Newcastle should target Liverpool’s Muller Lite They strengthened in January with the signing of Luis Diaz from Porto, while they just failed to get a deal over the line for Fulham attacker Fabio Carvalho despite agreeing a fee for the England under-18 international. There has already been speculation that Liverpool want to pursue a deal for Saka, who is out of contract next year, with Duncan Castles declaring on The Transfer Window Podcast that the Reds had included him on a “shortlist of potential additions”. And now ESPN claim that Liverpool and Man City ‘are both watching the progress’ of Saka ‘and could make a move if the Gunners fail to qualify for the Champions League’. The report sounds a warning to Gunners fans too by saying that ‘Arsenal face a crucial summer in their bid to keep the England youngster’. Football.London recently insisted that Arsenal were‘expected’ to offer Saka and his manager Arteta new deals in the summer. Meanwhile, Steve McManaman said a couple of weeks ago that there “would be riots if Arsenal let him join Liverpool” in the summer transfer window. “Bukayo Saka would be an amazing signing for Liverpool but I can’t possibly see Arsenal selling a key player to a domestic rival,” McManaman told the Sport Review. “I can’t envision that move happening. He’s one of Arsenal’s star men. I’ve seen a lot of Arsenal this season and Buyako excites me more than any other player in their side. “Would I love Liverpool to get him? Definitely. He brings you something different. He attacks down the right, takes people on and gets to the byline. A bit different to Mo Salah, who likes to cut inside, Saka is more of a winger but a winger that likes to chip in with goals and Liverpool do need a winger like him. “However, there’s no way on earth that Arsenal will let him go unless it’s a case of his contract running out. He’s such a young lad but still a leading figure in that Arsenal side and he’s improving every single year, so there would be riots if Arsenal let him join Liverpool.” ",positive
363,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-quirky-german-man-utd-ninth-mediawatch,Liverpool have ‘quirky German’ and Man Utd in ninth?,"All those trophies won by Jurgen Klopp and he is still just a ‘quirky German’. Meanwhile, Manchester United perspective is lost… Warn of the worlds Mediawatch is pissing in the wind while shouting at the clouds but on Wednesday night, Liverpool beat Arsenal 2-0 to move within a point of Manchester City with their ninth straight Premier League win. That’s the story. It’s simple. It’s football. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was asked after the match if he thought momentum was on Liverpool’s side and here is what he said: “Momentum is the most fragile flower on the planet. “If someone walks on it, then you have to work to get the momentum back and just get through it.” And that, according to The Sun’s back page, was Klopp ‘firing a flowery title warning to his Liverpool side’. Sorry, but was it f***. Klopp also said these words: “I’m very excited about the team and the situation we are in. We just need to keep going. I don’t think a lot about City, that’s the truth.” And that, according to the Daily Mail‘s back page, was Klopp ‘warning the champions his team will not let up’. Sorry, but was it f***. He literally said “I don’t think a lot about City” and you decide that was a ‘warning’? This is going to confuse a whole lot of people but not every word muttered by somebody in the public eye is a warning, a message or an admission. Sometimes they just say shit. And more often than not, the football is more interesting.  Want to say you quirk itJurgen Klopp has won the Premier League, Champions League and various other trinkets as Liverpool manager after winning two Bundesliga titles with Borussia Dortmund. So how does miserable Mark Irwin refer to him in the second paragraph of his match report from the Emirates? ‘The quirky German.’ Verdammt noch mal.  Lost in EuropeOh my. Oh my, oh my. Neil Custis really has not taken Manchester United’s defeat to Atletico Madrid very well at all. He is a man who loves an international airport and defeat to the Spanish side has curtailed those adventures for another season at least. You will be shocked to learn that there has been a monumental loss of perspective from the Sun man. After some nonsense about a ‘lame-duck manager’ and ‘lame-duck players’ purely so he can make a ‘quackers’ quip, he quickly finds himself here: ‘The team’s head is barely above water with the season now in danger of sinking and the real prospect of the club finishing outside the top eight, never mind the top four.’ This, ladies and gentlemen, is the Premier League table: Premier League table as it stands. Arsenal remain fourth, a point clear of Manchester United who have played two games more. 3 clear of Spurs who have played one more game also. pic.twitter.com/pHIKZ2jQOE — Connor Humm (@TikiTakaConnor) March 16, 2022  The eagle-eyed among you will spot that Manchester United are in fifth place on 50 points and the team in ninth are Aston Villa on 36 points. So Custis now fears – after a slim defeat to Atletico Madrid (who are not in the Premier League) – that United will throw away a 14-point lead over Villa. And this lead will be thrown away despite – and this does seem rather important – the fact that United have actually lost only one of their last 10 Premier League games, and that was to leaders Manchester City. Indeed, since their ‘lame-duck manager’ has been in charge, only City and Liverpool have picked up more Premier League points. And you think this team could slump to ninth?  Custis calls this ‘the sad reality’, which is odd because it is neither sad nor reality. ‘In the top flight United could easily finish in their worst position since 1989-90 when they came 13th. ‘Seventh was their worst since then under David Moyes in 2013-14. ‘They have Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea in their final nine matches, but no game will be easy for a team in the state they are now in.’ It’s five days since they beat Tottenham. And before they face any of Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, they have matches against Leicester, Everton and Norwich, who are literally the three worst Premier League teams of 2022 so far. We suspect at least one of those games will be easy for a team that have lost just once in 10 top-flight games. ‘United’s season effectively finished on Tuesday night and it will be very difficult to lift the players for a battle to finish in the top four, one which in reality they will not win.’ Did he seriously think they would win the Champions League? Was he pinning all his hopes on that improbable dream? Curious how we keep being told that Liverpool can win the Quadruple (25/1) and yet Manchester United cannot finish in the top four (4/1)…  Nobody else but you…Over in the Daily Mirror, Jeremy Cross is so all-in on Thomas Tuchel at Manchester United that he is blithely dismissing all other candidates. ‘Mauricio Pochettino and Erik Ten Hag have shown in recent weeks the challenge of managing United will be too big for them.’ Ten Hag has indeed lost two of his last 16 matches in charge of Ajax so he is definitely not a candidate. Losing narrowly to Benfica in the last 16 of the Champions League is clearly unforgivable. ‘Tuchel took charge of a Chelsea team floundering under Frank Lampard and turned them into European champions within six months. He won six trophies with Paris Saint-Germain and led them to the Champions League final, something Pochettino has not come close to matching with the same club.’ Pesky fact: Pochettino took PSG to the Champions League semi-finals, which is really quite close to matching the final. Mediawatch agrees that Tuchel would be a fine candidate but appointing a manager based on the last two weeks’ Champions League results seems a tad short-sighted if you are using the same piece to argue that United need to stop thinking about the short term.

The Premier League sides have a ‘presence’ in the chase for the Brazilian centre-back, along with Inter Milan, Juventus, AC Milan and Bayern Munich. Gossip: Haaland deal clearer, PSG in talks with Prem boss That’s according to TuttoMercatoWeb (via Sport Witness), who claim the Torino are ‘awaiting the auction’ in the summer for the 24-year-old. And Tuttosport have added to the speculation on Thursday, claiming many clubs have ‘lined up’ for the ‘complete player’. The report states that an offer of€25m would be sufficient to persuade the Torino to part with Bremer, but the Serie A side must decide whether to ‘monetise as much as possible’ or accept a player as part of the defender’s sale. It’s said that chairman Urbano Cairo would prefer to sell the star to England for ‘cash’. Fortunately, it’s claimed Spurs, Liverpool and Man City are ‘ready to open talks’ for Bremer’s transfer and ‘these three clubs must be held in high regard because compared to the Italians they have larger budgets’. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher claims the Premier League title race is now ’50-50′. “I think everyone connected with Liverpool Football Club will believe they will go on and win the title,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “It is 50-50 if you like because of the situation with the game at the Etihad. “But I feel this is the first time Liverpool can win the league at any time this season. I said City before a ball was kicked. I thought it was well gone after Liverpool drew 2-2 at Chelsea.There’s still a point in it. But I think the momentum Liverpool have, the game they have coming up next, they could go top of the league. “You can see the reaction from the supporters and the players now. Man City are still in great form, they’re just dropping points a little bit. “You can imagine what Anfield is going to be like. As I said, I think everyone in that away end believes Liverpool are going to win the league.” ",positive

The Egyptian star is out-of-contract at the ned of next season and, so far, is yet to agree new terms with the club. Reports suggest that Liverpool are not willing to break their wage structure to keep Salah. Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man Utd, Merseyside derby, Eriksen Salah is widely recognised as one of the best players in world football at present and has been in fine form this season, despite a recent drop-off. The winger leads the Premier League goalscoring charts, notching 22 time so far this season, five more than next best Heung-Min Son who has 17. He also co-leads the assists leaderboard, alongside teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold and his performances have been key to helping Liverpool challenge on all fronts. Having wrapped up the Carabao Cup in February, Jurgen Klopp’s side are still in with a chance for a unprecedent quadruple as they fight for the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

Speaking to FourFourTwo, Liverpool’s talisman said: “I don’t know, I have one year left. I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. “So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly. I have one year left and the fans know what I want. “I’m not worried, I don’t let myself worry about something. The season didn’t finish yet, so let’s finish it in the best possible way – that’s the most important thing. Then in the last year, we’re going to see what’s going to happen.” Salah did admit the club, which has helped win the Premier League and Champions League in the past me, means a great deal to him. “Yeah. This club means a lot to me – I’ve enjoyed my football here more than anywhere, I gave the club everything and everybody saw that. I’ve had a lot of unbelievable moments here, winning trophies, individual goals, individual trophies. It’s like a family here.” The forward spoke further on his connection to the club, revealing that when he does leave the club, whenever that may be, it will be a really sad occasion for him. “Of course. To play in that atmosphere and to see the fans always behind me… I have banners in the stadium, two or three, and they’re always singing my song. It’s going to be a really sad moment.”  ",positive

Weariness surely must be a factor given the epic contribution he’s made for club and country over the last year. He’s entitled to be mentally as well as physically knacked, given everything he’s been through, but where does his workload sit compared to other Premier League stars? Pretty high, it turns out. This is a top 10 of the busiest Premier League boys this season by minutes played. Some caveats. These are totals for all competitions and include international games as well. It’s outfield players only – Edouard Mendy, Alisson, Kasper Schmeichel and Ederson have all racked up 4000+ minutes as well – and because we’ve taken all the stats from the heronerds at Transfermarkt the season’s tally includes July and thus bits and pieces of Copa America and Euros. By definition the bits of those competitions played in July were a pretty big deal, and so we’ve decided that’s fair enough and also that we can’t be bothered to do the sums ourselves to get rid of those games. 10)Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – 3909 minutes We are vastly annoyed that nine rather than 10 Premier League-based players have got past 4000 minutes. Especially as ninth place is almost two full matches past that mark. Maybe we could have got away with including Ederson because the last two weekends have shown a) his outfield skills and b) that other keepers don’t have them. Anyway, Bernardo Silva. Having a good season. Good for him. Like all but two members of the list, he’s got 50 matches under his belt since July.  9) Harry Kane (Tottenham) – 4153 minutes Missed Spurs’ first league game and was a late sub in their second but has barely missed a minute since having also racked up minutes in the Carabao, Europa Conference and FA Cup while also playing lots of games and scoring approximately 843 goals for England. After a stunning run was absolutely rotten against Brighton at the weekend, raising questions about the wisdom of Antonio Conte telling him Spurs had “seven cup finals” to finish the season.  8) Sadio Mane (Liverpool) – 4257 minutes The star of Liverpool’s win over Manchester City at the weekend on his 55th appearance of the season, although his 85 minutes against City were his only FA Cup minutes of the season apart from six against Norwich in round five. He also didn’t feature in the Carabao until the final, but can only hardly be accused of shirking. His hefty workload includes twin penalty shoot-out successes with Senegal at Egypt and Mo Salah’s expense in first AFCON and then World Cup qualification.  7) Joao Cancelo (Man City) – 4314 minutes Yeah, it’s a lot of minutes but lazy Joao hasn’t even bothered to play 50 games yet. He’s played a mere 49, but 44 of those in City colours. He’s missed only two Premier League games this season and played 90 minutes in all but one of the other 29. He managed only 78 minutes in the 2-0 home defeat against Crystal Palace.  6) Declan Rice (West Ham) – 4407 minutes Absolutely crucial player for club and country these days and could yet end this exhausting but hugely rewarding year with a Europa League winner’s medal and Champions League spot without having to make a £100m move to somewhere or other. Might still do that anyway, of course.  5) Luis Diaz (Porto/Liverpool) – 4454 minutes Even Liverpool’s January signing has racked up an epic amount of minutes thanks to our cut-off including a bit of Copa America and a whacking great number of World Cup qualifiers for Colombia along with 28 games for Porto – including two against Liverpool – and 16 games in all competitions for his new club. Nobody in European football can touch his total appearances, with an absurd 59 games of football for club(s) and country since July.  4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea) – 4500 minutes It’s no longer news to point it out, but it remains one of the more astonishing redemptions in modern football. Rudiger went from such a peripheral and insignificant figure at Chelsea that they were even prepared to countenance doing business with Spurs to get rid of him to becoming the all-action leader and heartbeat of their defence. Can’t imagine Chelsea without him now, which is awkward because we’re all going to have to when his contract expires at the end of the season. Real Madrid had decided against signing him, but might now reconsider after his display against them in the epic Champions League quarter-final second leg at the Bernabeu. 3) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – 4530 minutes There is a school of thought that he isn’t quite as good since his injury problems. This may well be true, which really says a lot less about the player he is now than it does about how absurdly good he was when he first rocked up at Anfield. Has played 90 minutes of all but two Premier League games this season, sitting out against Newcastle and Spurs with the ‘rona. Liverpool’s cruise to the Champions League semi-finals has meant that’s the competition where he’s been able to have a small amount of rest, sitting out the final two group games and the second leg of the quarter-final against Benfica.  2) Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) – 4575 minutes It’s now over a month since Salah’s last goal for Liverpool, during which time he’s also suffered laser-affected World Cup qualification penalty heartbreak to pile on his AFCON penalty heartbreak. He wouldn’t be human if he isn’t a bit knackered and affected by it all, and the evidence of the slight drop in level from the absurd standard he’s set for most of the season is undeniable. The Mailbox is currently fighting over when and whether he should be dropped/rested as Liverpool continue their exhausting yet sensational pursuit of history.  1) Tomas Soucek (West Ham) – 4636 minutes But not even Salah can compete with Soucek for workload this season. The Czech midfielder has missed just four West Ham games all season, which would be striking in a normal West Ham season and never mind one that’s included a run to the semi-finals of the Europa League. Hasn’t missed a minute of Premier League action since mid-January, and you do wonder whether that might have to change as the Hammers’ priority shifts ever more towards European glory.  ",positive

The Egyptian star started the season in red-hot form but has dipped off in recent weeks, failing to find the net in his last five appearances. Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Arteta, Son, Palace He does still lead the Premier League in terms of goals and provided a brilliant assist for Sadio Mane in the 2-2 draw with City last weekend. And for that reason, former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has told Klopp he must start the winger at Wembley on Sunday. Murphy told the BBC: “I agree that he hasn’t been playing as well as he can do, but let’s not forget that since the 29-year-old Egyptian joined Liverpool in 2017, he has set standards with his goalscoring numbers above anything we thought could be possible. “We are judging him against his own ridiculous record and the fact his statistics over the past two months are more ordinary does not change the fact he is capable of scoring remarkable goals that no-one else on the pitch can, whoever the opposition are. “That in itself is enough of a reason to pick him, but on top of that you have to remember the effect his mere presence will have on City. “Regardless of whether Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake or Oleksandr Zinchenko play at left-back for City this weekend, they would fear Salah at all times. “They all love to get forward themselves but they know that, when they do, they are leaving the Premier League’s best goalscorer behind them. That is a very different dynamic to anyone else they could go up against in Liverpool’s team. “While Salah didn’t score at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, he still had a huge impact on the game, not least with his perfect pass for Sadio Mane to make it 2-2 at the start of the second half. “I am expecting more of the same this time, and it would not surprise me at all if Salah actually scores the winner, because he has done it so many times before.” Liverpool have a number of options in attack and Klopp could choose a number of different ways to set his side up for the clash, but Murphy believes Roberto Firmino should be given the nod. “It is not just Salah whose place is in doubt. Jurgen Klopp has got some big decisions to make about who gets into his front three, because of the competition for places that first Diogo Jota and now Luis Diaz have brought to their attack. “Jota got the nod over Roberto Firmino to start against City last weekend. But I think what happened in that game means we might see more of Firmino this time. “Like Diaz, Jota has been a wonderful buy but neither of them can do the job that Firmino does for the team in keeping hold of the ball and getting it up the pitch.” ",positive
368,https://www.football365.com/news/ranking-each-championship-clubs-chances-of-fa-cup-progress,Ranking each Championship club’s chances of FA Cup progress,"It’s FA Cup third round time and as if it wasn’t difficult enough figuring out all the moving parts, this January we have isolations and postponements to factor in too. We’ve looked at all the Championship teams’ ties, opponents and likeliness of the managers to play a complete reserve team, and ranked each club’s chances of progress from best to worst… 1) Luton Harrogate at home, Luton boss Nathan Jones has a new contract and his team will be raring to finally get on the pitch – the Hatters are my most likely to progress.  2) Peterborough Posh face Bristol Rovers at home in need of something to bump their poor league form. They’re better at home than away and Rovers have won only one of their last four in League Two.  3) Bournemouth The Cherries top the Championship and are likely to field as many fringe players as possible; that said, opponents Yeovil are in the National League.  4) Stoke Michael O’Neill needs some good news, or more pertinently doesn’t need any more bad news. Leyton Orient at home even resting a few players should provide it.  5) Barnsley Barrow dumped Ipswich out on TV in the previous round, but if any Championship manager has an incentive to play his strongest side it’s Barnsley’s Poya Asbaghi, who hasn’t won in six as the Oakwell boss.  6) Middlesbrough Boro face Mansfield with both sides in form. Much depends on how seriously Chris Wilder takes the competition. Perhaps the sense of good feeling around the club keeps things moving in this tie.  Examining latest Championship done deals and transfer rumours  7) Reading The lowest-ranking team facing any of our Championship sides is Kidderminster of the National League North, but they are riding high in fifth place. Reading will likely rest players, along with AFCON absentees and injuries, but will they have enough to win.  8) Nottingham Forest Forest have been in fine form and face Premier League giants Arsenal; this is something of a ‘joker’ from me based on the 4-2 home win in the same fixture a few seasons ago and a probable Gunners reserve side.  9) Blackpool It’s Hartlepool away for Blackpool, who haven’t been in good form in the Championship with their only recent victories coming at home to their adversaries from last season’s League One. Could be a potential banana skin for the Seasiders in the battle of the Pools.  10) Fulham In Championship terms Fulham’s squad is light years ahead of opponents Bristol City, Marco Silva will likely play some hungry fringe players and still be favourite to win this one.  11) Coventry The Sky Blues need to rekindle that brilliant home form that had them up in fourth for much of the early going in the Championship. Mark Robins might use this as an opportunity to throw in goal-shy Vitkor Gyokeres in what could be fairly close to full line-up at home to Derby.  12) QPR League One leaders Rotherham will be hoping to show the Championship what they’re missing and possibly about to receive. QPR may be more focused on mitigating the loss of their AFCON trio and protecting their current fifth-placed spot.  13) Birmingham This one smells a bit of an upset. Birmingham are in need of a sort out and Lee Bowyer could use the game experimentally, while Plymouth are having a great season and despite losing manager Ryan Lowe to Preston, still reside in the League One top six.  14) Cardiff It’s an all-Championship clash between the Bluebirds and Preston, Cardiff got a creditable draw at West Brom last time out and perhaps some of their decent youngsters will see them through this one.  15) Blackburn If Tony Mowbray sees Rovers being in the top two of the Championship with 21 to play as the golden opportunity that most of us do, then he may be tempted to let local rivals and top three League One side Wigan have the temporary north-west bragging rights.  16) Derby The Rams are in fine form ahead of an all-Championship clash with Coventry. We may get two strong sides but I suspect if you promised Derby fans four points in their next two league games in exchange for defeat here they’d all take it. Perhaps Wayne Rooney will feel the same.  17) Preston Ryan Lowe has a perfect two out of two league record as Preston boss but an away trip to fellow Championship side Cardiff may not be the most inspiring in terms of grabbing a third.  18) Bristol City If Bristol City go full first XI in this one and Fulham go full-on reserves then they’ll be ok, but I suspect if it’s a couple of weakened sides, then Fulham’s strength in depth will make things tough for the Robins.  19) West Brom On the evidence of the Baggies’ Carabao Cup showing, a reserve team losing 0-6 to Arsenal, I suspect Big Val might not be too worried about Brighton coming to the Hawthorns either.  20) Millwall I think we might get two first XIs in a spicy derby match between Millwall and Palace, if that’s the case then those Premier League resources will make things very tough for the Lions.  21) Swansea Southampton have Premier League calibre and a point to prove after one win in their last eight games. Swansea have lost three on the bounce and I’m not smelling an upset.  Newcastle and Everton among five Premier League clubs who look ripe for an FA Cup giantkilling  22) Huddersfield I think we may get fringe line-ups from both Huddersfield and Burnley up at Turf Moor. The Terriers are looking good and wouldn’t want to disrupt their unlikely play-off surge by risking too many key players.  23) Sheffield United I think Wolves might fancy the FA Cup for a bit of a run this season. Bruno Lage’s stock is high after their Old Trafford win and the fact they own and can exempt the Blades’ best player this season (Morgan Gibbs-White) from playing against them is also a help.  24) Hull Hull’s home game to Everton feels like the perfect chance for a bit of Rafa Benitez reputation management. The Spaniard is struggling as Toffees boss and I suspect will probably take this game fairly seriously to Hull’s cost. ",positive

370,https://www.football365.com/news/ferdinand-tells-arsenal-go-and-buy-e60m-rated-man-city-star,Ferdinand tells Arsenal to ‘go and buy’ €60m-rated Man City star,"Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has encouraged Arsenal to “go and buy” Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus. The Gunners are set to be in the market for a new striker this summer. This comes after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left the club to join Barcelona last month. Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are still options for Mikel Arteta but both forwards are out of contract this summer. Warnings from history: Where previous QUAD BIDS went horribly wrong Jesus made the move to Man City in 2017 for around £27m from Palmeiras. He has scored 88 goals from his 222 appearances for the English side. The Brazillian has only started 17 games across all competitions this season. He has provided two goals and eight assists in the league. Ferdinand and respected journalist Fabrizio Romano have been talking about Jesus’ future. Romano has hinted that Jesus would cost a fee in the region of €60m: “At the moment I’m told there are no talks for Gabriel Jesus because [Inter Milan] can’t bid for €60 or €50 million so we’re just talking about ideas and rumours,”Romano told Ferdinand’s Vibe with Five YouTube channel. “But I’m sure that Gabriel Jesus’s situation, alongside of Raheem Sterling’s situation, is something that needs to be clarified in the coming months for Manchester City. They’re both out of contract in 2023. “For Gabriel Jesus, they need to discuss internally and see what they want to do. Because, with a new striker joining Manchester City in the summer, I’m not sure that the position of Gabriel Jesus will be so clear.” Ferdinand then suggested:“If I was Arsenal, I would go and buy Gabriel Jesus.” The BT Sport pundit believes Aubameyang has benefitted from his Arsenal exit: “I just feel he looks happy again. I saw him at Arsenal for a number of months where he just didn’t look happy. “People undervalue and underestimate how important your happiness is when you’re a footballer or any job that you’ve got to have that element of happiness and fulfilment and he just wasn’t having that at Arsenal. “Both have benefited from him leaving. Arteta has got even more of a stranglehold on the squad, more respect, they know where they stand now, there’s a line that they don’t go beyond, we don’t know the details of that.” ",positive
371,https://www.football365.com/news/haaland-gives-green-light-to-man-city-move,Haaland gives ‘green light’ to Man City move,"Erling Haaland has reportedly given the green light to make the move to Manchester City this summer. It was reported on Monday thatCity had made a ‘significant step’ in their pursuit of Haaland after agreeing terms with his representatives, with a five-year deal expected to be sealed ‘in the next week or so’. READ MORE: Haaland to City could be sporting and sportswashing triumph And The Athletic have now confirmed that Haaland has agreed to move to the Etihad this summer. The report claims the details – the payment to Borussia Dortmund, commission to his representatives and the details of his contract – still need to be ironed out. City are said to regard the developments as pure speculation and have declined to comment, while Pep Guardiola also refused to be drawn on the rumour. The 21-year-old has scored 25 goals in 26 games across all competitions this season, and at just£63m – the release clause in his contract – the striker would be a steal in the current market. City pursued a striker last summer after the departure of Sergio Aguero, with the current Premier League champions eyeing the signature of Harry Kane, but they were unable to persuade Tottenham to part with the England captain. Meanwhile, Barcelona legend Dani Alves insisted that he would choose PSG’s Kylian Mbappe over Haaland. “I wouldn’t go all out for Haaland. Honestly, I wouldn’t spend a lot of money on him,” Alves said. “On Mbappe yes, but not on Haaland. I’m playing sporting director, eh, but I’d go for Mbappe first, I think he’s more complete in every aspect. “If you’re going to make a huge investment, you have to make it in the best. If it was up to me, I’d go for. He’s the best there is, and for Barcelona’s style, at the moment, in football, there is no-one better than him.” ",positive

The Norway international was at the centre of a tussle between Dortmund and Man Utd when he became available for a fee in the region of€20m. BVB won the race for the 21-year-old in 2020 with Haaland joining the Bundesliga side after scoring 29 goals in 27 matches for RB Salzburg. One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues His amazing scoring record has continued at Borussia Dortmund with Haaland bagging 82 goals in his last 86 matches in all competitions. During negotiations to sign Haaland, Dortmund agreed that they would include a buy-out clause of€75m, which is now very likely to be triggered this summer. And now Watzke has revealed that Man Utd would’ve pipped them to the signing of Haaland in 2020 if they had agreed to a release clause in the deal. Speaking to 19:09 Talk (via the Daily Mail), Watzke said: “We gave Erling Haaland a release clause… otherwise he would have gone to Manchester United.” Widespread reports indicate that Man City are now favourites to land Haaland this summer with the Citizens looking to bring in a new striker. Meanwhile, former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann thinks Man City-bound Haaland has been “disrespectful” to Dortmund this season. Speaking to Bild, Hamann claims that the sale of Haaland will help Dortmund, he said: “I think that not only the fans, but also the team and the club are fed up with the whole circus. “At BVB, players will score goals even without Haaland. That has always been the case. I actually think it will help Dortmund in the short or medium-term if Haaland is no longer there.” Hamann added: “He drew a lot of attention to himself. Then he did his lap of honour in front of the Sudtribune alone in the winter. His gestures, his waving off and his body language have been disrespectful at times. “He missed a lot of games and you also have to remember that BVB also suffered defeats with him. That’s why I think Haaland is better off elsewhere. And I also believe that Dortmund will benefit from the money they will get for him. “WithoutHaalandthere is also a huge opportunity. Maybe a (Donyell) Malen will blossom, for whom it has not been easy to score goals next to Haaland. I believe that BVB, with the players they’ve already brought in, will be better without Haaland next season than with him.” ",positive

But they are often either promoted above their station or ultimately reach the top and come down the other side. Here’s an XI of players currently at a Big Six side in need of a step down. GK: Dean Henderson (Manchester United) Henderson has played three games of football this season. Thought to be vying with David de Gea to be No.1 on his return to Manchester United nearly two years ago, he’s now understandaby pretty peeved at the situation. Erik ten Hag is reportedly ‘concerned’ about De Gea, but if true, those doubts – thought to be around the Spaniard’s ability with the ball at his feet – are unlikely to be curbed by Henderson.  RB: Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Manchester United) Manchester United bought an excellent defensive right-back and Wan-Bissaka has – in the main – been an excellent defensive right-back for Manchester United. It’s hard not to feel sorry for the guy. United either bought him with an acceptance of his attacking limitations, which is moronic given the importance of forward-thinking full-backs in every other successful football team in European football. Or they believed they could coach him into becoming a real attacking force having seen no evidence that would become a reality, which is an incredibly naive way to spend £50m.  CB: Victor Lindelof (Manchester United) Lindelof has always seemed like a half-decent defender playing the part of a very good one. His tranquility often belies the chaos around him and not in a good way. While Harry Maguire is front and centre in the blame stakes, Lindelof shrinks into the background. He’s the sort of player that a person less au fait with United might struggle to name as part of their team or squad – he’s just there, not doing very much.  CB: Nathan Ake (Manchester City) “He’s so reliable, especially when you behave in your life like him, he always will do good. In the bad phases, always helping, exceptional person.” Pep Guardiola is very, very good at protesting too much, making squad players feel more integral than they clearly are. Ake is important to Guardiola – he wants four quality centre-backs – but the Dutch international is obviously fourth choice and could easily be the main man at an inferior club.  LB: Alex Telles (Manchester United) Bought as a replacement, or at least competition, for Luke Shaw in the summer of 2020, Telles has found himself on the bench for the majority of his Manchester United stay after his arrival appeared to give Shaw the kick in the backside he needed. Shaw’s injury in recent weeks has given Telles the chance to impress, but his time in the team has only really served to strengthen the view that he will forever be a back-up.  CM: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool) Georginio Wijnaldum’s departure gave the Ox an opportunity he has failed to grasp. And there is a sense that it was a last chance for a 28-year-old who has struggled with injury in his time at Anfield, but in truth has never met the mark required to play consistently for a title-chasing team. A move to a lesser Premier League side could easily result in a Jesse Lingard-like reminder of his quality.  CM: Harry Winks (Tottenham) In mid-February Harry Winks admitted – after five starts in six Premier League games under Antonio Conte – that he feared his Tottenham career was “dead and buried” before the Italian boss arrived at the club. Now, after just one more start from the last 11,with Rodrigo Bentancur in no small part to blame, his Tottenham career looks, once again, dead and buried.  AM: Lucas Moura (Tottenham) Lucas managed to beat off competition from Steven Bergwijn to be the A.N.Other alongside Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, but Dejan Kulusevski has made that spot his own and doesn’t look as though he will relinquish it. At just 29 the Brazilian has at least one move left in him and would offer Spurs the chance to raise £20m or so for a summer transfer kitty.  AM: Callum Hudson-Odoi (Chelsea) Frequently injured at the point at which he appears to be hitting top form, Chelsea should have taken the £50m Bayern Munich offered two years ago. A player with everything who shows his quality in increasingly frustrating glimpses. Still only 21 and yet it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  AM: Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)Ten Hag is set to hold Zoom meetings with all members of the Manchester United squad ahead of his arrival in the summer to give him a chance to assess them, while offering an opportunity for players like Rashford – who might be thinking of an exit – to assess him. Rashford isn’t alone in being a very fine United footballer whose form has nosedived this season. And amid apathy from the fans and worry over his place in the England set-up, parting company with his boyhood club may be the best recourse. He may need to take the opportunity for a sideways move, rather than a step down, while such offers are still a possibility.  ST: Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City) A goal or an assist every 99 minutes for Manchester City is an excellent record and yet, because he plays for Manchester City, it’s quite hard to truly tell how good he is. There’s little doubt he would be an improvement on Mikel Arteta’s options at Arsenal and that’s a move that seems about right. ",positive

But the player (Haaland) is smart enough to understand that United will be back at the top, that’s for sure, and he will fit the bill. “That’s what United are looking for – someone who can guarantee goals, will definitely play for many, many years and who knows, could even break records.” Man Utd interim manager Ralf Rangnick is also of the belief the club can attract top players, citing Bruno Fernandes’ recent contract extension. The German said on Wednesday: “Of course, it would be better if we played Champions League next season but this also affects other clubs, it’s not only a problem Manchester United has. “The renewal of the contract of Bruno shows this is an attractive club, with a new manager, new approach, this is still a massively interesting club and I look forward to helping Erik and everyone at the club to get the best and change the whole approach next season so Manchester United can be a top club.”  ",positive

One per Premier League club: Reasons why they should sign Pogba Speaking on The Athletic Football Podcast, Ornstein added more meat to the bones: “Well the situation all revolves around Manchester City’s pursuit of Erling Haaland because the likelihood is there’s going to be an opportunity for Gabriel Jesus to leave this summer if City get Haaland, which we expect them to do, or another striker if they don’t. “Then with Jesus coming towards the end of his contract, he’s approaching his final 12 months, he’s had limited game time at City of course and there haven’t been any suggestions that he’ll be signing a new deal. “Then that gives the opportunity for clubs to take him.

But there has been no contact, to my knowledge, so far between the clubs. “So that’s obviously a significant step that would need to be taken but the early indications are that this is a move that Gabriel Jesus would be open to. And he is the profile of striker that Mikel Arteta is looking to bring in. I think they want to bring in two forwards and the way he can drop deep from the striker position and also pull wide is something that appeals to them.

377,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-everton-lampard-liverpool-klopp-contract-salah-man-utd-chelsea-ronaldo,Four reasons why Everton fans are firmly behind under-fire Frank Lampard,"The Mailbox features a staunch defence of Frank Lampard from an Evertonian, while Jurgen Klopp is proclaimed as Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started…. Football’s greatest mystery How can a team spend a billion to become this bad? Opposition players must be p*ssing themselves laughing how easy it is to play against United!Manyooligan (Do Telles and Rashford even realize the problem is on their flank???) SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season. I can count atleast 10-12 separate occasions where he has won us some points and carried us in a game. On the other hand you got 100m Lukaku, 71m Havertz & 50m Werner who all combined still do not possess half the skill Ronaldo does, or else it would have been 5-1.Aman (Great ball by Matic though, twice in two weeks now)   ",positive

Pep Guardiola‘s side are currently one point clear of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. Both clubs have four games to go. Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI… Man City are also in the semi-finals of the Champions League. They beat Real Madrid 4-3 in a thrilling first leg at the Etihad. The return leg takes place on Wednesday night. If City go through, they are likely to face Liverpool in the final. They are 2-0 ahead of Villarreal on aggregate. Richards thinks a defeat against Real Madrid is the only thing that could “hamper” City in the fight for the Premier League: “The only thing is, if Man City were to go out in the Champions League, that could knock the confidence,” Richards told Sky Sports. “When you go into big games and you think you’re well prepared and you lose, it knocks the stuffing out of you. That’s the only thing I see hampering the rest of City’s [season].” Richards went onto praise Man City and Liverpool for the high standards they have set: “The standards that both City and Liverpool are setting now. In my opinion, two of the best teams the Premier League have ever seen – they’ve got to keep doing that. “You never know, the Premier League is so unpredictable. But I believe that both teams will win all their remaining fixtures, that’s how good they’ve been. There might be one slip-up or one nervy moment. After this week’s fixtures – Liverpool winning comfortably and City winning comfortably, I think they’ll win all of them.” Elsewhere, Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio is of the belief that Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus “will stay” this summer: “Seeing [Gabriel Jesus] playing against Real Madrid, I don’t think Guardiola will allow him to leave, even if they sign Haaland. Which they will, because they are very, very close,” Di Marzio told wettfreunde. “They still need another striker. A different type of striker. Haaland is a different type. [Gabriel Jesus] will stay because it’s difficult to find a player like him. Manchester City doesn’t need to sell a player in order to get funds to buy another player. They have the possibility to buy all the players they want. “It depends on Gabriel Jesus in the end and if he is okay with playing less with Haaland coming. It depends on his attitude, knowing another incredible striker like Haaland will arrive.” ",positive
379,https://www.football365.com/news/benzema-tears-chelsea-apart-real-madrid-perfect-hat-trick,Benzema tears Chelsea apart with a *real* perfect hat-trick,"Karim Benzema was the spearhead of a majestic Real Madrid display against a suddenly out-of-sorts Chelsea. The 13-time champions stormed Stamford Bridge to place one foot firmly in the semi-finals. People often talk of “perfect hat-tricks”, by which they – quite wrongly – mean one comprising a goal scored with each of the head, left foot and right foot. Then there are “German hat-tricks”, which (to my mind needlessly) place extra restrictions on what counts as a proper hat-trick by insisting they must be three consecutive goals scored within the same half. The logical extension of those twin daftnesses is the Perfect German hat-trick. Left-footed, right-footed and headed goals scored without any other goals or a half-time whistle interrupting. At this point you’re raising the difficulty tariff to something approaching cricket’s version of the achievement. But it’s all tish and fipsy. Because the perfect hat-trick was scored tonight at Stamford Bridge by Karim Benzema. Two brilliant goals and a comical one is definitely the best kind of hat-trick. It was also his second consecutive hat-trick in the competition having turned the PSG tie on its head in the last 16. Having emerged from Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadows to become indisputably Real Madrid’s main man he is on Ballon d’Or-winning form right now. More importantly, it’s potentially Champions League-winning form. His first two goals were magnificent, both absurdly difficult and very different headers sent arcing beyond a despairing Edouard Mendy. Key to both, beyond Benzema’s exemplary movement and finishing, was the quality of delivery. The first was created by the equally excellent Vinicius Junior, whose pacy delivery from the left allowed Benzema to get enough on the ball to find the top corner from a good 14 yards out.  Then Luka Modric – the second former Spurs schemer to have a lovely old time at Stamford Bridge this week – curled in a beauty from the right which Benzema almost just let hit him on the head and rebound back inside the post. It was reminiscent of a couple of goals at the old White Hart Lane, actually. One scored against Spurs by Edin Dzeko, one by Harry Kane against Arsenal a few years later. But it was better than both, marked out by the freakish apparent effortlessness of it all. It was surely the greatest header anyone at Stamford Bridge had seen for, ooh, a good three minutes. Chelsea at this point were also, it should be noted, a shambles. Madrid’s midfield three had seized full control of the pitch and both Vinicius and Benzema had more than served notice of their threat before the goals came. Chelsea, four days after an embarrassing defeat to Brentford, were being overrun again. Real Madrid are very much like Brentford in many ways. Yet they still got to half-time with a foothold. Kai Havertz – once again proving himself Chelsea’s man for the big occasion – pulled one back with a fine headed goal of his own. Definitely the best headed goal to be only the third best headed goal of the half. FACT. Thomas Tuchel looked to grab the lifeline with significant half-time changes. Off went Andreas Christensen to spare him any more torment from Vinicius. More contentiously but also perfectly understandably based on the evidence of the 45 minutes that had just gone, so too did N’Golo Kante. On came Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech. This was bold stuff, and it was to Tuchel’s credit that he saw Havertz’s goal before the break as an opportunity but not vindication. Maybe those changes could have turned the tie back in Chelsea’s favour. We’ll never know, because then came the calamity Chelsea’s play had threatened. Mendy left a routine short pass to Antonio Rudiger short. Rudiger, already on a booking, didn’t commit to tackling the onrushing Real Madrid player which was, of course, Benzema and the rest was a formality. Two great goals, one stupid one, and Benzema became only the fourth player to score consecutive Champions League hat-tricks, joining Luiz Adriano and the two you’ve already guessed. That was already more than enough narrative and action for one night, but there was still time for more. Romelu Lukaku came on and touched the ball four times. Two of those touches were headers from which he really should have scored to at least reduce Chelsea’s deficit and offer a slim chance of pulling something out of the fire in Madrid. The contrast from Benzema’s first-half masterclass could not have been more stark. The elite striker at the peak of his powers, and the one struggling desperately to relocate his spark. ",positive

Also: Everton are the new Spurs; Villarreal’s secret; and a World Cup to get excited about. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… The new SpursSean Dyche’s half time team talk pretty much read “lads, lads, it’s Everton”Rich  Lampard or Jewell? A selection of quotes for everyone to enjoy: “We have to get better” “The players aren’t lacking in effort but we’re lacking in quality” “We’re not good enough – it’s as simple as that. Some of the things that go on on the pitch among this group of players just beggars belief at times.” “We’ve got to be bigger and stronger, and the players who are here need to be better” “I keep on saying the same things over and over again and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to work out that’s why we are where we are” “It is a harsh lesson but it is a harsh league and we are not good enough” “I’m embarrassed at the way we played … Some players are not worthy of being here and the sooner we can get them out the better” “As soon as we concede we collapse like a house of cards … As soon as we face a bit of adversity we have not got enough leaders or men to get through it” “The whole mentality here must change. When adversity hits you, you have to be able to fight. I want to see some real men in the trenches here next year” “We have to be mentally and physically stronger” Perhaps the most damning thing about Everton’s situation is that those quotes sound like things Frank Lampard might have said this season, but are actually direct quotes (from BBC match reports via Wikipedia) from Paul Jewell in 2007-08, while his Derby County side were limping to the worst ever Premier League season.

Four obvious reasons stand out. First, a quadruple is a bigger achievement than a treble what with it literally being one more trophy. Therefore any discussion of a Man City treble has to be framed (for another ten days at the maximum) within the context that Liverpool could go one better. The quadruple has never been done before so of course it’s big that it’s still on, as it was when City have been in with a chance at this stage in recent seasons. Secondly, given that Liverpool were regarded as relative outsiders for the title this year: 3rd favourites according to the bookies at the start of the season at 11/2, compared with 4/6 to Man City; picked by none of the F365 crew and none of the 20 MOTD pundits (only three of whom had Liverpool in the top two). It is thus a much bigger story for Liverpool to win the league plus the others than for a City stroll. Thirdly, and linked, is that the title looked like a done deal in January and we now very much have a race. Finally, and as Mediawatch well knows, Liverpool have many more fans than City and thus guarantee those precious clicks! Really looking forward to the game on Sunday (as well as dreading it). Going to stick my neck out and say that Liverpool will win. Have never been confident about going to the Etihad before but this time I look at our squad and, as terrific as theirs is and has been, I’d only take KDB and Foden (both of whom I’m worried about on Sunday!). Everywhere else I think that our players are as good or better than theirs and that is a heck of a good feeling. I am sure that City fans feel similarly positive about their own squad but I feel for the first time there is proper parity in quality in depth. What a time to see two such great sides going at each other! Clearly not enough to warm Johnny Nic’s cockles (I’d recommend docking him pay for plagiarising himself over and over again) but for this Liverpool fan, these are the days!Andrew LFC, Cambridge  Carabao Cup and FA Cup would be ‘sensational’ for Liverpool Liverpool have already had an extremely successful season this year, whatever mocking trolls may think and post. In light of theBenfica result last night, things would have to go pretty squirrelly not to go through in the second leg. What this will mean is that, at minimum, Liverpool will be 2nd in the League, semi-finals in the FA Cup, semi-finals in the Champions League and winners of the Carabao Cup. Seriously? That’s pretty damn extraordinary. And after last season’s c*****rf**k of a season, I’d have ripped quite a lot of arms off to have done so well this year on so many fronts. In short, we’ve already had a really, really good season. To turn it into a great season, we need to win another trophy. I’m sure we’d be mocked by plenty for *only* winning two, considering where we are now. But, for example, winners of the Carabao and FA Cup, 2nd in the league and semis in the Champions League? That’s an sensational season for any club that isn’t Manchester City. And one that every other club in the Premier League would love to have. Obviously winning three trophies is a legendary season and the elusive quadruple would simply be the greatest season of all time. Unfortunately we won’t do it, because we’ve got possibly the greatest team in domestic history in our way. Pep is in serious contention for his own treble – he absolutely won’t fail on all three fronts. But basically, we just can’t lose from here. We’ve won one trophy, we’re in a great position to win another, we’ve played fantastic football and all without spending a ridiculous fortune. The squad is the best it’s been and Jurgen is managing better than ever. So whatever happens from here, I’ll take this season and be extremely happy indeed.James, Liverpool  Top two way ahead The funny thing is that neither City or Liverpool are actually playing tremendously well right now. I haven’t watched City as much as Liverpool, granted, but it looks to me as though they are huffing and puffing and nowhere near their best, often just scraping over the line despite them being dominant in just about any measurable metric. And having blown a 14 point lead (notwithstanding the games in hand that Liverpool had), it does look as though they are somewhat below their imperious best. And despite a better run of results, you could say the same about Liverpool. Salah is way off the pace right now (I know Klopp has discussed resting him soon, but he may actually have to consider dropping him, which might make those contract negotiations a bit trickier), and the team has been stumbling along a bit, and are probably fortunate to have had such a run of results. This tells us a few things – that Liverpool and City are massively ahead of the chasing pack in the Premier League, not just on points but on the sheer quality of what they are doing, even though they have a few more gears to shift up. The same can be said for most European teams, too, and until one of them gets to play either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, we won’t really know if even they are at the same level. And finally, anyone can win on Sunday. Obvious, I know, but it seems unlikely that either team is going to dominate on the day. A cagey affair settled by a single goal beckons, I reckons.Mat (Salah will score a hat-trick now I’ve said that)  On the slide When are managers going to tell players to stop sliding on their knees (‘…like children at a wedding’ Trademark Peter Kay) after scoring? After Kanate opened the scoring for Liverpool last night both he and Fabinho celebrated by sliding on their knees towards the corner flag. Fabinho got it wrong and his right knee dug in, causing him to topple over. Thankfully, as a Liverpool supporter, he was OK. But sooner or later someone will do the slide, have their knee dig in and the resulting ‘jarring’ will see them subbed off and some lengthy time in the treatment room. And for what?! What happened to the good old ‘running away with your arm raised’ or the classic ‘sshhhh’? Kids today, eh?!Steve, Cirencester, LFC  Great January deals As I read Mediawatch, the item about Luis Diaz maybe not being the ultimate January transfer caught my attention and piqued my curiosity. The examples on offer were all perfectly justified, but my NUFC perspective offers a number of other candidates, including Kieran Trippier (who has maintained a leadership role despite his injury), Dan Burn and Matt Targett from this year alone – if you take them as a package. (I’ll stan for the latter two despite the Spurs debacle.) But I think I’d put Joe Willock’s loan from Arsenal last year above even them. We were nearly as deep in the mire, and he tied Alan Shearer’s club record seven-match goal streak while arguably keeping us up. And the there’s Papiss Cisse, who scored 13 PL goals in 14 appearances after his January 2012 arrival. In some ways, 2011 was even better, seeing Andy Carroll sold for silly money and Hatem Ben Arfa arriving for around 5 million pounds. And that’s just Newcastle. Eric frigging Cantona was a mid-season transfer. I think Virgil Van Dijk was, too.Chris C (Toon Army DC)  Villarreal’s secret Villarreal have looked such a threatening side every time I’ve watched them this season. Being a team that contains several players who for the most part underwhelmed at their English clubs, how can they be on the “cusp” of a champions league semi final? They should have scored 7-8 against Bayern. There seems to be discipline, buy in, belief, harmony. Not to say they are bad players, but how can this group of players be raised to this level towards the business end of the champions league? What is the explanation? Less media coverage? Lower expectations? Different league? Weather? It just boggles the mind how so many premier league teams are so quick to discard of players who can do a job at the top European level. Does England require instant gratification from signings more so than in other countries? Thoughts please.Pete, Cape Cod USA (aware Villarreal are struggling a bit domestically) Isn’t football supposed to be fun? I am a season ticket holder at Northern Irish side Linfield. We are one of the world’s most successful sides including winning 55 titles and under current manager Sir David Healy we have won four of the last five titles and are currently top of the table with 5 games left in a very tight title race. There is a man who sits near me every game who no matter how well we are doing spends the whole game saying the players are rubbish, Healy hasn’t a clue etc. This and reading mails from the likes of Stewie Griffin and Ashwin made me wonder why some people actually watch football when it seems they don’t actually get any enjoymentout of it? They seem to want their team to do badly so that they can say their opinions were correct. It really baffles me. Football is supposed to be fun and while I can understand fans of Derby or Bury in recent years not having a great time, I really don’t get the attitude of some fans of successful sides. I’d love to know what they get out of it.Sam, Newtownabbey The best league in the world I have to assume that Johnny is by miles the most narcissistic person in all of England, because imagine thinking of something being the best, and then still making the entire article about yourself and what you think is best. Let me define what best stands for: Capable of beating the others, being the top in their field. So if by all the metrics, EPL is the best. Then it is the best. Just because you have a sadist personality who likes to see bad football, please dontspew such nonsense just because you have a website you can write on. God forbid F365 get a decent editor with some balls to tell JN off when he comes up with such crap. For eg: “Does the side that was in fourth playing so poorly mean it’s the best league in the world?” No, the fact that the side in 13th (before the match) can beat the side in 4th easily, makes it an interesting and desirable league that is clear of the rest of the 4 leagues combined. Stop trying to push your anti EPL agenda because it’s getting tiresome now. In a world where facts are now considered opinions, Johnny comes up with the gem: “there is no absolute objective best. There is no absolute objective worst. We all have different tastes, enjoy different things, dislike different things” Again, being the BEST is not about what the people think. We may all think England are the best, but losing to Italy in the finals is an absolute objective of Italy being the best. That’s the whole point of the damn tournament. Same goes for the WC, CL winners, Teams that enter the top 4 CL places etc. The whole point is that no matter what the people think, the reality remains that due to the metrics set by the rule makers, they are the literal BEST in that category. You dont have to agree or disagree to anything, and can have your opinion, but to argue about the word best is a new low for any sane writer, much less a left wing writer who suddenly has a case of Trumpmania in trying to fight and argue with random words off the dictionary & to changing the meaning of best because the current best doesn’t suit your agenda. For Eg: I hate City & Liverpool, but that won’t change the fact that they are the current BEST. My opinionmatters for nothing. Get it?? I don’thave to like it for it to be true. Cheers,Aman  …I haven’t had time to read the site lately but was reading John’s article today and was thinking the Premier League usually gets labelled as the ‘best’ because it’s deemed to be the most competitive, so I wanted to dive a little further into the numbers across leagues. For fairness I originally looked at points tallies within the top 5 leagues without the top or bottom sides and used the points gap between the remaining teams. La Liga: 57-22= 35 Ligue Un: 56-23= 33 Bundesliga: 57-26= 31 Serie A: 66-22= 44 Premier League: 72-21= 51 Then I obviously had to go back and check the points gap with the top and bottom teams. La Liga: 69-22= 47 Ligue Un: 68-23= 45 Bundesliga: 66-16= 50 Serie A: 67-16= 51 Premier League: 73-18= 55 Now I should preface this first by saying the Bundesliga only has 18 teams and have only played a maximum of 28 games whereas other leagues or teams have played up to 31 games, however the general consensus is there to see. On the whole, Ligue Un, La Liga or the Bundesliga are the fairest, with Ligue Un ranking 2nd and 1st and La Liga ranking 3rd and 2nd and then the Bundesliga ranking 1st and 3rd. In terms of overall competitiveness within leagues (as in how close the teams are to each other) the Premier League is the worst on both metrics. I do agree with John that other metrics are very subjective, as in there might be more goals scored in one league than another but that doesn’t mean the attackers are better, it could just mean that defenders, coaches or tactics are worse. I’m sure this has also already been said but Man United have become the most boring team to watch. At least under Ole before this season, they were a shambles but an entertaining shambles and were likely to at least score. Ragnick has made them boring and arguably no better than Ole this season. For my two cents United are a little like Real Madrid but obviously worse now: they’re ethos is based on having big name players doing big things, whereas football is now more pattern and tactic based than that; buying the big names is no longer the best strategy but they don’t want to effect the brand or irritate the fans by not buying them either, putting the squad and club into a mess. I do however conform to the view that footballers are at such a level that it doesn’t take much to turn it around. Conte with Spurs is a good example, Tuchel to Chelsea another. It wasn’t that Chelsea’s team were bad before Tuchel, they just needed a coach that good. United have a lot of good players (some not so good), they just need a coach that good.James, Galway  Buzzing for the World Cup So while my students are/were doing a project here, I finally had time to look at The World Cup schedule etc …..

F365 Years I have been feeling nostalgic over the last few days, and it made me realise that I have been following the Football365 website for close to 20 years. Other than this website, only my family is a constant, and that’s not by choice! I started off as a young kid from Zimbabwe in college in the US, trying to keep up with football. There was no way of watching football at the time, and Football365 was as good as it got. And F365 was the first website I looked at every day. I remember the first days I came across the website. It was pretty light-hearted and didn’t take itself too seriously (when it had the look-alike section, which was either thought-provoking or ludicrous). I remember playing a bootleg version of Championship Manager and imagining articles about me appearing on the website. To see Football Manager adapting and including F365 as a source that was part of the game. Another era was the dark days of the Sky Sports partnership – which was the equivalent of joining Darth Sidious. I loved the articles from Johnny Nic, where he managed to relate partying with a bare-breasted lass in Vegas to Middlesborough’s failure to push on and challenge for the title (followed by Johnny trying to flog his shirts). I remember the podcast era, which I enjoyed and seemed too brief. Then there was the lockdown period where staff were doing vlogs. I miss the awkward ones where authors looked like high school kids, forced to do their homework and doing the bare minimum. (Though a highlight was marvelling at how poor quality Matt Stead’s camera would be and how far we could look up his nose). The current era is defined by this damn registration wall (i am sad I have to register just to read articles more than a week old) and the videos at the end of each piece. It has been quite a journey with F365, and it would be great if F365 (Sarah Winterburn, this mission is for you) would share an article ranking the best and worst eras of F365.

Lukaku returned to the Blues last summer. They paid around £97.5m to get him from Inter Milan. The 28-year-old grabbed 24 goals and eleven assists last season for Milan in Serie A. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football It was hoped that Lukaku could help Chelsea challenge for the Premier League title this season. He has struggled for the Blues though. The Belgium international has only scored five goals in 23 league games. He has fallen down the pecking order in recent weeks as he has only started 25 games across all competitions this season. The Evening Standard are reporting that Lukaku ‘will reject any interest’ from AC Milan and Newcastle United this summer. The Magpies are one of few clubs able to afford Lukaku’s fee and £300,000 a week wages, but he ‘would not entertain’ a move to Newcastle. His status at Chelsea is unclear as there are ‘major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him.’ Elsewhere, Frank Leboeuf has tipped Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic to leave the club this summer if he thinks his treatment has been “unfair”. In a tweet which has since been deleted, Mark Pulisic wrote on Twitter: “The sad thing is he [Pulisic] loves this club, teammates, and London.… puts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boy… big 6 months ahead…” And now Leboeuf thinks there is a possibility that Pulisic could leave in the summer transfer window unless he steps up his game. When asked if Pulisic could leave in the next transfer window, Lebouef told ESPN: “Yeah, it’s possible. In don’t know if it’s sad or not. “He never seems to be essential to any of the coaches, whether at Borussia Dortmund or Chelsea. “I think he has the pressure of a country behind him ahead of a World Cup because he’s the [USA] captain. But in Europe we don’t seem him as a real leader or the guy who’s going to save Chelsea. “It is what it is. He still has the time to be stronger but if he thinks it’s unfair then yeah, he should leave Chelsea. Or fight for your spot because the frontline has been a mess for more than a year.” ",negative

The Toffees had been on a terrible run of one Premier League win in their last seven matches before their 1-0 victory over Manchester United in early April. Including their victory over the Red Devils, they have now picked up seven points from their last four matches as they attempt to claw their way out of relegation trouble. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving And, after analysing clips since Lampard took over at Goodison Park,Carragher has been impressed by the changes the former England midfielder has made over the past four matches “I actually admire what Frank’s done in the last four games,” Carragher said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football show. “We’ve all seen Frank, he’s been at Derby, Chelsea and now at Everton. He wants to play football. We put coaches in categories, does he want to play like Pep? Or like Jose? “Jose Mourinho’s been a huge influence on his coaching career, but we’ve seen his early stages, he wants to play out the back, he wants to be almost a Pep Guardiola type of manager. “What’s happened is, they’ve gone like Jose Mourinho in the past two games. The game that scared Everton that they possibly could go down was the Burnley loss.” Carragher also used clips in Lampard’s first Premier League match against Newcastle United and their February fixture against Manchester City to demonstrate how the former Chelsea boss wanted them to play when he first came in. “When Frank first came in, he’s trying to get on the ball, making passes even round the back going through midfield that’s changed. What’s really interesting as you go further down here is that the actual attacking numbers have been pretty similar, even though they are so much down on possession. “And I think a tell-tale sign for any sort of team, how you want to how they play, is what they do when the goalkeeper gets the ball. I want to go back to Frank Lampard’s first game as a Premier League manager for Everton, it was away at Newcastle. This is three minutes in and the ball goes to Jordan Pickford. Now let’s not forget it was a pressure game, Newcastle were down there, Eddie Howe’s team like to press from the front, Frank will be well aware of that. 🗣 “[Frank Lampard] wants to be a Pep Guardiola type of manager… what’s happened is that they’ve gone more Jose Mourinho!” Part one of @Carra23‘s in-depth Everton analysis ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/uPIwzj4hFq — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “And Newcastle are not dropping off and letting Everton play. There’s the front three from Newcastle. They’re ready to go and press, they want Everton to play from the back. You see Jordan Pickford. We’re playing out from the back. Michael Keane saying: ‘Play. Don’t worry if there’s players there.’ “This is what Frank would have tried to put into them. It was a little bit different under Rafa but that’s what Frank Lampard wanted to do. This is against Man City. And the reason I wanted to show this was because similar to show the Chelsea and Liverpool, two of the top teams, one of the best pressing teams as well. “So you see Jordan Pickford play short. He doesn’t go long now tries to make a pass out wide. And again, this is one of the best teams in the world at winning the ball back, but that was the idea of Frank Lampard. “And I go back to admiring what Frank’s done in the last four games because I don’t particularly like it when managers say: ‘You never change, you always keep the same message and in the ideal world Frank will wanna play from the back and press from the front, but you can’t always do that.”  ",positive
383,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-liverpool-benfica-konate-mane-diaz-rivals-hope-fear,Liverpool will give rivals hope and fear in equal measure,"After taking a commanding lead at Benfica, Liverpool made one mistake and wobbled. Yet Jurgen Klopp’s players are the most resilient around. Having sworn a pre-match oath that Benfica were “going to try to surprise” Liverpool in the first Champions League quarter-final of his eclectic career, there was a comforting predictability in 32-year-old Adel Taarabt’s decision-making and execution under duress just after the half-hour mark. The visitors had already taken a lead they did not seem likely to relinquish by the time the Moroccan received a pressure-relieving pass on the perimeter of the centre circle. Benfica had strung nothing of note together in the previous 33 minutes but Taarabt concluded that there was no better moment to break into some intricate one-touch play, cushioning a first-time ball directly in between his two closest teammates and into the path of Ibrahima Konate, then holding his begloved hands outstretched, as if to ask why no-one was able to teleport 10 yards in time to retain possession. Six touches and eight seconds later, Liverpool had doubled their advantage. It came to the shock of approximately nobody. Liverpool punished that mistake ruthlessly and ludicrously. Konate, scorer of the opening goal with a routine header, allowed Trent Alexander-Arnold to do the honours. The right-back homed in on an incisive Luis Diaz run with an astonishing 40-yard delivery that even accommodated the Colombian’s gilded stride and allowed him to nod back across goal for Sadio Mane. The bout was over. Perhaps that sense subconsciously pervaded Liverpool’s. Jurgen Klopp often commends the supreme mentality of his squad but there is no guaranteed immunity against complacency at any level, nor can collective crises of confidence be permanently prevented. Watford discovered chinks in this imperious armour and Benfica followed suit to undo the knot on this Champions League tie. Yet as an increasing number of teams are having to realise in progressively more painful ways, it is one thing landing a couple of sucker punches on Liverpool and another entirely to land that knockout blow while simultaneously dodging the retaliatory flurry. They have developed a particularly devastating penchant for scoring soon after allowing a gilt-edged opportunity, as Arsenal and Nottingham Forest can certainly attest. Benfica’s chance was more a general dominance after Konate’s mistake allowed Darwin Nunez to half the deficit. Four of the hosts’ nine shots came in the 10 minutes after a strike that roused the Estadio da Luz; Alisson shattered the dreams of every tabloid journalist by saving from Everton. The Brazilian then engaged in some awkward, heart-stopping footwork on the edge of his own area on two separate occasions as that mild but tangible feeling of jeopardy lingered. Klopp was disturbed enough to make a triple substitution on the hour in the hope of settling Liverpool down, introducing lieutenant Jordan Henderson and the energetic pair of Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota. It served to both calm their nerves and stunt Benfica’s rhythm. In a game that produced 26 shots, it was notable and no accident that there were none between the 61st and 81st minutes. Liverpool needed that period of tranquility. Henderson has been absolutely professional in his performance. Created two chances missed by Diaz and Jota but I'll see his slander for being a regular scapegoat. — Kartik (@Pooltard) April 5, 2022  Then came their final push. Alexander-Arnold, Firmino and Jota all had attempts frantically blocked and Diaz squandered one opening. He would do no such thing with the next, roundingOdysseas Vlachodimos to crown Naby Keita’s run and through ball with a clinching third goal. It was a victory given wings by Red Bull. Konate and Mane, two of the goalscorers, were aided in their development by Leipzig and Salzburg respectively, while the solid Keita came through both systems. Konate was at fault for Benfica’s goal and much of the ensuing peril but he defended impeccably in the first half and took the opener well. That Liverpool have made only two first-team signings this season and both he and Diaz have slotted in so seamlessly is remarkable. So, too, is the durability of this team. That really is what sets them apart from most of their peers. Others are capable of playing at a relatively similar standard to Liverpool – although no team can punish an innocuous mistake in an instant like with Mane’s goal, nor be quite so consistently threatening. The difference is that Klopp’s side can withstand a storm, emerge unscathed and still have time to have the last word. They manage to continue when the rest might crumble. It is a fine party trick, particularly when hopes of making history hinge on simply clearing these last obstacles, no matter how convincingly.  ",positive

The 25-year-old made the move to Liverpool in January from Porto for a fee that could rise to £50m. Tottenham Hotspur were pursuing him but he opted to sign for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Diaz has hit the ground running for the Premier League outfit. He has grabbed four goals and three assists from his 20 outings. The forward was involved in two of Liverpool’s goals as they beat Man Utd 4-0 at Anfield last month. Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season.” ",positive
385,https://www.football365.com/news/qatar-world-cup-embarrass-problem-simeone-mailbox,"How to embarrass Qatar, English moralising and…","The Premier League is back, folks. Get your thoughts on the weekend’s action in to theeditor@football365.com. How to embarrass Qatar… It’s been great to see Qatar and Russia in the mailbox recently and the Saudi owners before that but I’m going to start with Kurt Zouma’s feline proclivities. In all the West Ham matches since that video came out of Kurt punting Bonbon across the floor he’s come in for a lot of stick from fans in the stadium, home and away. I’m sure we’ve all seen some of the witty and downright crass (but brilliant) placards in the stadium and the giant cat face at Anfield. Top stuff all around. I’d love to see that approach taken with more serious topics. Instead of a giant Cat face at Anfield I’d love to see a giant picture of Jamal Khashoggi when Newcastle come to town. I’d love the crowd to chant songs about MBS having him killed at every game. Imagine at the Qatar World Cup the Brits that make it there sing loudly about migrant slave deaths. “How many died, how many diiiiied, etc… (I am not Simon or Garfunkel) I know this sounds like I’m trivialising extremely sensitive and appalling topics but it’s those 90 minutes, one or twice a week, that these people have paid for, when we all tune in to be sportwashed. That’s when their investment is most vulnerable. It’s the only time when those that are free to speak can do so. We can flip the agenda so that their investment has the opposite effect, attracting negative attention. Imagine the embarrassment, every time you sit to watch your team/investment a fan holds up a giant picture of someone you murdered… We can’t expect the teams or players to do it, the legal and financial penalties are too big. They still have to exist in the FIFA/Uefa ecosystem. Nor can pundits or commentators, really, because they are employed by the networks. But the fans… free radicals in this equation that can completely reverse the outcome. I look forwards to a new Premier league song book in the coming weeks denouncing cat kickers and people killers alike.TM READ MORE: Ranking Premier League teams by their top three goalscorers The problem with Simeone You know, there was a time when Mourinho once staked a claim for the title of the best coach in the world. He built his sides on the principle that possession was not important and that more possession meant more ball losses which creates chances for incisive and brilliant counters, you just needed to defend well enough and wait for your moment. He was successful. His Real Madrid side still hold the record for the most goals scored in a single la liga season, he battled the best and came out with a badge of honour. It may not have been beautiful, but it was effective and it earned him titles. But it eventually stopped working, why? Guardiola was not going to be defeated, that more possession meant you will lose the ball more was only a mere assumption, it could be proved wrong with better positional play and even if you did lose the ball, who was to guarantee that the opposition could generate counters? You just have to win it back quickly through organised pressing. That is not to say that you will not win every once in a while, Tottenham beat City under Mourinho and Man Utd came back to win 3-2 in a quite interesting encounter. But that is the exception, not the rule. Mourinho no longer came out with badges of honour, his teams could not resist the opposition anymore and only won because their opponents did not take their chances, his teams played against sides in the lower half of the table and you really could not tell which was the big team. Remember his final match with Man Utd? The match he lost against Liverpool when Tottenham where top of the table? All this reminds me of Simeone. How does this apply to Simeone? Well, Simeone is not that different. He seems to have a good record in the champions league, but he also has a record of dropping out from the group stages. His teams have better structure in possession, but it is not anything in comparison with really top teams. He went almost 9 years having never won at the camp nou. He may smash and grab a win against Man Utd, but that is only because of Utds lack of ability to retain the ball well in dangerous areas, build up, or even press well, as such Atletico were always going to be comfortable. See how they cope against Man City, if they can survive the relentless pressure. His teams are emotional, but when you need a last minute goal against the run of play to beat a side Barcelona would normally beat 5-0, your teams are just not that good. Going by xG, and I know some don’t really like it but it tells a story, Atletico have never won a la liga title before, not even last season. Man City have won 4 of the last five PL titles and xG confirms that they are the best.What makes you say they are the third best squad in la liga. A squad of Felix, Griezmann, Suarez, De Paul, Herrera, Llorente, Oblak, Gimenez, Savic, Correa, Koke, Lodi, Carrasco, Lemar, Wass, Kondogbia, Hermoso, Cunha, Felipe, are not good enough to dominate bottom half teams?? How? How does that happen??? You ask me, they have the best squad in la liga. Yet, he argues with Xavi that they cannot challenge while playing better football, he argues with Klopp. What is his excuse for parking the bus against Leipzig and still losing then?? Chelsea where 9th in the league, they where largely expected to lose to Atletico, but Tuchel led them to a dominant two-legged victory; he praised Chelsea after the match and said they can win the whole thing, what was the difference between them and Chelsea? Obviously, one side where coached better, you may defend with all your lives, but ultimately, better structure and pressing from Chelsea meant Atletico were the ones that were likely to give in, not the other way around. His plan used to work against Liverpool, but as Liverpool became better in possession, it just did not work anymore, I still struggle to find a top level match where one team were so dominant as that second leg, unfortunately, Llorente was in the mood for an iconic moment. You see, my problem with Simeone has far more to do with the fact that he is not as good as he is made out to be than his style of play, Tuchel is relatively defensive, but he knows how to go about it, as such, he is capable of facing any team and manager on equal terms, the modern Mourinho. Simeone is a good coach, but relative to the quality of players he has, he has not done enough to be called a proven winner. If you did not watch it, go and see how Barcelona beat his side 4-2 with a squad not as good. Ten Hag in comparison, has the most goals per game of any Ajax manager, you seem to think Ajax have a right to win there, but you should do your research, it is not like France, Ajax had gone three and a half years without winning the eredivisie before he arrived, they have since won it twice, and would have most likely won it in 2019/20 as well, had it not been abandoned, if he wins this season, they would have won all the league titles available under him except one despite good competition from Feyenoord and especially, PSV Eindhoven. He also has the highest win percentage of any Ajax manager. About them having the best squad, PSV would like a word. Also, find out Ajax’s record in the CL before he came, find out how many times they were even there. If someone gave Ten Hag that Atletico squad, I guarantee you they would not be below Sevilla on the table, and given how the supposed best team Real Madrid have played so far, his team would be far ahead on top of the table. In fact, given how Real and Barca have been these past 3 seasons, I dare say, he would have won 3 or 4 on the trot, those sides may have larger budgets, but it is just not as considerable an advantage. Liverpool don’t have half as much money as City, but the advantage City gain as a result is just not that considerable. His first title win was impressive, but ‘not world class’ Ranieri has done even better, he has the squad now to challenge anyone, but he still goes about telling the people that they are the underdogs. But if you are still insistent, then let’s see how he successfully feeds Man Utd fans (‘best club in the country’) the underdog story, let’s see how he convinces the media that defending for your life with 20% possession and very good players is the only way you can challenge a club who just embarrassed you. Let’s see how he convinces the world that using all the dirty tricks in the books to waste time after going 1-0 up against Brighton is the best way to secure the victory.Sa’ad English moralising I just don’t understand how English websites/newspapers and English football teams think they can moralise about who should/shouldnt host a world cup. It’s quite absurd. Do you genuinely not understand the menace your war mongering governments/monarchy have been to the entire world. For centuries. CENTURIES!!!! Are people just allowed to be outraged by how governments treat people within the confines of their borders? Do we ignore how nations treat OTHER nations citizens? Does this fall outside of the outrage rulebook? Thats not to say the whole Qatar situation is not a disgrace. In many ways it is, in particular the immigrant worker situation which is quite unique to Qatar. But to act like Qatar are the bad guys and Gareth Southgate and his English army are the good guys is comical. Funnily enough, it probably sums up the English attitude to the world for the last 1000 or so years… Here come the pure English boys dressed in white, ready to civilise the world. Its army of well behaved English supporters ready to show the rest of the world manners and how to speak the queens english. HOORAY Of course, there is no way an English football team , who play under the English flag and sing an athem praising a monarchy that has wreaked havoc all around the world, are entitled to take a stand against a so called evil regime…. Are you mad? Seriously, have you no common sense whatsoever. Have you read a history book? Have you read a newspaper in the last few decades? You are not the good guys! Are you oblivious to the recent social upheavel based on your shameful history and shameful present? Statues to slave traders on your main streets…. Refusing immigrants from countries you are blowing up…This is of course normal to you. Its no big deal. You are numb to it. You vote for it… consistently… Its absolute comedy to see Ukranian flags flying around premier league grounds…England is a country that pumps out approx 500 billion euros worth of war mongering weaponry each year, weapons that are sold for never ending wars for never ending profit. A country that routinely bombs countries that it has a strategic interest in. A country that still occupies parts of countries that it has no business in. Absolute buffoons. You practically wrote the book on destroying smaller nations and are still adding chapters. And you are moralising?? GET IN THE BIN! YOUR FOOTBALL TEAMS LITERALLY WEAR POPPIES CELEBRATING SOLDIERS THAT KILL PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF QUEEN, COUNTRY AND IMPERIALISM. YOUR FANS LITERALLY BOO PLAYERS WHO REFUSE TO TAKE PART IN THIS NORTH KOREA STYLE CHARADE. Do you see any moral issue with this? Are you blind? Maybe F365 will have similar articles if the UK/Ireland win the Euro 2028 bid. Maybe Ireland will pull out of the competition due to the continued presence of british soldiers on its land. Perhaps eastern Europe will be so flooded with british made weapons at this stage that WW3 will have broken out and there wont be a tournament at all. Maybe Queen and country will have finally suceeded in civilising the rest of the world by blowing us all up. But yeah, Qatar, they bad. Go tell em Gareth!Shz World Cup boycott I am boycotting the World Cup in Qatar 2022. I made the decision a while ago, but have to share this news so I’m held accountable to see through on my commitment. I know it won’t make a jot of difference to the FIFA gravy train and the only one that will suffer with my boycott is me. However, it’s important for me to live with integrity and set an example to my kids. I cannot endorse 6500 immigrant workers losing their lives building stadiums for me to enjoy 4 weeks of football watching from my lounge, 4000 miles away. I cannot and will not approve of a country sports washing their human rights record which prevents and punishes freedom of sexual preference. I cannot abide by the detrimental environmental impact of building 7 new temporary stadiums. Theinfrastructure construction and operational elements of Qatar 2022 is projected to produce 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide– that is more than some countries’ total for a year. I want to support my children to make a positive impact in the world, challenge and apply critical thinking. Part of that critical thinking is to ask: Who benefits from this? In this scenario I can only see the beneficiaries as FIFA – a billion pound global corporation and Qatar, the 9th richest country in the world measured by gross national income. That’s not a good enough rationale for me. I love a World Cup, I got excited by the draw, the start of the journey, plotting the potential route to the final, the thought of buying panini sticker albums and packs with my kids, completing the wall chart, skiving work to watch random group games, listening to podcast deconstructing the action from the day before and watching games with friend in pubs. It’s going to be tough not to be involved in any of that and fundamentally choosing to ignore the pinnacle of one of my true passions. I love football. But quite frankly – f*ck FIFA for what they are doing. See you when it’s over!Stewart Cornelius  Thoughts on Grealish You asked for thoughts on Grealish. Your story today was recycled from a previous story claiming an inside source. But no inside source would suggest that the Grealish money would have been better spent on Kane for the simple reason that Man City tried three times to clinch the Kane transfer but was blocked by Levy the chairman. So much so that the Club said he refused to take their calls. Any insider knows this and Guardiola has repeated the story of their frustration to the world. This does discredit your claims about the Man City management. The idea was to sign them both. Grealish is not a striker. He’s a playmaker. He had two strikers to work with at Villa. Not signing Kane was not a mistake. It miscarried because of opposition by Spurs. Fans know this and even non fans know this. Plausible it isn’t. SincerelyJackie Litherland Hillsborough truth Yet again, we have people in the comments being allowed to perpetuate utter lies about the disaster at Hillsborough. It took 30 years to get some level of justice, with the blame laid at the door of police and other officials. But sadly, the passage of time allows for people to gloss over this and repeat the same vile lies that were shown in a certain newspaper way back then. Five years ago the BBC published an article dispelling many of the myths:Five Hillsborough myths dispelled by inquests jury But just for the trolls: Peter, Paul and Oliver Cromwell, here is some clarity regarding you blaming the deaths on contribution from ticketless fans: Myth 1: Liverpool fans arrived ‘late and without tickets’ After the disaster, allegations emerged from “unnamed sources” – later established to be a Police Federation spokesman and the Sheffield Conservative MP, Irvine Patnick – claiming Liverpool supporters had “deliberately arrived late determined to force entry” to the ground. What we know: While many Liverpool supporters did arrive after 14.30, evidence to the inquests suggested it was actually the police “failure to control the crowd” and “inadequate” turnstiles that led to the fatal crush. The claim that fans had “deliberately arrived late” formed the basis of the “rock solid” defence South Yorkshire Police [SYP] sought to present at the 1989 Taylor inquiry into the disaster. The aim was to “deflect blame on to supporters” and exonerate the police. The jury heard from former South Yorkshire Police inspector Clive Davis who recalled being told by former Ch Supt Terry Wain “to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs: on the drunken, ticketless Liverpool fans”. This was denied in evidence by Mr Wain. However, he admitted a report he prepared had exaggerated claims that “several thousand” spectators had arrived at the ground within minutes of kick-off. The inquests heard the 10,100 fans with standing tickets for the Leppings Lane end were expected to enter through just seven turnstiles, causing congestion outside the ground. Lord Justice Taylor, in his 1990 report into the disaster, concluded fans were reasonable to arrive between 14.30 and 14.40 as match tickets only requested people be in their places “15 minutes before the game”. He was also satisfied that the large concentration of fans who gathered Leppings Lane at 14.40 to 14.50 “did not arrive as a result of any concerted plan”. He concluded that police had “failed” to prepare for controlling the arrival of a large number of fans in a short period. Both the club and police “should have realised the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it” unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. He accepted there were “small groups without tickets” looking to “exploit any chance of getting into the ground”. But the main problem was simply one of “large numbers packed into the small area outside the turnstiles”. He stated categorically that “fans’ behaviour played no part in the disaster”. The Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) report concluded crowd congestion outside the stadium was “not caused by fans arriving late” for the kick-off. The turnstiles, it said, were “inadequate to process the crowd safely” and the rate of entry insufficient to prevent a dangerous build-up outside the ground. What the jury said: The behaviour of Liverpool supporters did not cause or contribute to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Can F365 please publish this so we can once again put this stuff to bed. Honestly, it’s so utterly depressing we’re still having to fight these lies some 33 years after.Bill Phabb, LFC  The right to boo I didn’t expect to write in about this but, here goes. It doesn’t matter the slightest that Maguire got booed. England fans have been wronguns for a long time. Longer than I’ve been around. It doesn’t matter that any player get’s booed, racial and homophobic abuse aside. It does matter though calling it “their democratic right” to boo (AK, LFC). What the fuck does that even mean? The fans haven’t elected these players to play. They haven’t elected the players for anything. There’s been zero votes for anything related to any player playing for any team ever. What am I missing here?Culk the Younger  A derby every week As things currently stand, QPR are just a win away from the play-off places and Fulham have looked a decent shout for automatic promotion all season. This means the capital’s representation in the top flight could be from next season – Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Spurs, West Ham, Fulham and QPR. That’s EIGHT teams. The capital has never had so many teams in the top flight – well certainly not to my mind anyway. Chelsea like to go around calling themselves the Pride of London despite the fact it’s Arsenal that’s brought more than half of the total top flight titles to London and nobody is, was or ever will be proud of Chelsea other than Blue fans themselves. London isn’t blue or red – it’s red, white and yellow in North London, Blue, white and red to the West, claret and red to the East and red, white, blue and yellow in the South and all sorts of other colours in between.

386,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-dusan-vlahovic-arsenal-fine-line-ambition-fantasy-calvert-lewin,"Vlahovic, Arsenal and the fine line between ambition and fantasy","Arsenal have chased Dusan Vlahovic for a year and have come unstuck. Should we praise the ambition or criticise the delusion? Arsenal have been chasing their tail searching for a new striker. Dusan Vlahovic was the man they wanted; rumours of their interest in the Serbia international surfaced nearly a year ago. Arsenal were reported to be willing to meet Fiorentina’s€80million asking price, but Vlahovic has never been interested. That should have been pretty clear through his agent’s refusal to pick up his phone– with the Champions League anthem as its ringtone – back in November, as Edu’s number appeared. Undeterred, Arsenal kept calling, entering further pointless negotiations with Fiorentina, right up until Vlahovic did the inevitable and agreed to join Juventus, a side in the European Cup. Arsenal need a striker and, assuming the reports are accurate, have wasted a huge amount of time and effort chasing one that was never going to join them. If only they had some self-awareness. “Historically, this club has targeted the best players in the world and the best players have always been attracted to Arsenal.That situation hasn’t changed. It is a big advantage for us.” Admitting Arsenal are in fact shopping below the top level wouldn’t have been the best ploy to lure one of those best strikers in the world to the club; Mikel Arteta may have been playing games. If he wasn’t, he’s deluded. The last players Arsenal signed that could be considered among ‘the best in the world’ were Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, who both joined in in the space of six months from summer 2017 to January 2018 for more than £100m combined. It could be argued Thomas Partey also belongs in that category, but even so, that would be one top-class signing in four-and-a-half seasons. They’ve made some very good buys and arguably Won The Transfer Window in the summer. Ben White, Aaron Ramsdale, Martin Odegaard and Takehiro Tomiyasu have all improved the Arsenal first team. But they didn’t exactly face stiff competition for them; most have simply proven to be far better signings than the majority first thought. It was not a transfer window in which Arsenal tried to sign ‘the best players in the world’, presumably because they realised they had no chance of doing so. It was a window in which Arsenal knew their place in the transfer market and bought players accordingly; it worked brilliantly. So why the sudden change of tack?  There are signs of progress under Arteta and they have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League, but no more than a chance – Manchester United are the favourites to land that coveted fourth spot. Vlahovic wanted a sure thing and Arsenal are a long way from being that, in a league in which four teams are vying for that last position. To be sure of playing Champions League football in England, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City are the only guaranteed options. Arsenal do represent a higher level than Fiorentina – the Serie A side finished 13th last season. But rather than diminishing Vlahovic’s returns, that lowly finish highlights just how outstanding he was. He scored 21 league goals – 20 in a 24-game spurt – for a team that finished just seven points above the relegation zone. The equivalent would have been Neal Maupay scoring 21 for Brighton. He scored one fewer than Mohamed Salah, two fewer than Harry Kane and three fewer than Romelu Lukaku, who joined the European champions for £100m. Arsenal were a step up, but Vlahovic had earned a jump. It was an Arsenal fantasy dressed up as ambition. So who do they turn to? Alexander Isak is another player consistently mentioned, but reports suggest they will have to wait until the summer to sign him. A short loan move to tide them over until he is open to negotiation is an option, or there’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin. A move for the Everton striker would be met with sniffiness from some Arsenal quarters – he’s not a marquee signing. But 19 Premier League goals in 38 starts since the start of the 2020-21 season is a very good return in a struggling side. Given the number of chances Arsenal create in comparison, they would likely be signing a 20-goal-a-season striker. And he’s the right calibre of player. Similar to White and Ramsdale, he plays for a what is currently a lesser Premier League club and has designs on Champions League football without being quite ready for it. He can grow with a young Arsenal team and become a much better player with the rest of them. Arsenal can be praised for their ambition when it comes to the Vlahovic chase, but deserve criticism if that pursuit means they end up with no-one. ",positive

The young centre-half has developed tremendously this season whilst on loan at Marseille. Man-child Jude Bellingham should dodge Premier League He received his first cap for the French national team last month, coming off the bench for 32 minutes against the Ivory Coast before playing the full 90 in a 5-0 win over South Africa. Saliba joined Arsenal for £27m in 2019 but has not made a single first-team appearance for the Premier League side. The 21-year-old spent 2019/20 on loan at Saint-Etienne, only to return as a member of the Under-23s side in north London. He was loaned out to Nice in January 2021, with no Gunners first-team experience under his belt, where he once again impressed in Ligue 1. Having previously discussed his Arsenal future, Saliba has now explained how his parent club are watching his progress. He has also admitted that returning to play ‘in the rotation as a substitute’ will be better than only playing for the U23s. “They are often in contact with my agent,” he told L’Equipe (via Sport Witness). “They send me messages. They watch my matches. They tell me that we have to continue like this. “I haven’t played much with the Gunners. The coach has made his choices, that’s life. I left on loan, I put the matches together, and I became an international. What happened to me forged a tougher mind, it is not because you have cost €30m that you are playing. I take it positively, even if there are times that you wonder. “For six months I saw I was the only in the group not to play, that hurt.” Saliba added:“Of course, I can’t be happy on Arsenal’s bench. I want to play as a starter. Afterwards, if I enter the rotation as a substitute, it’s not like being in the U23s and never being in the squad.” On potentially staying at Marseille, he said:“We’ll see after (the season). If I come back, it will be with great, great pleasure.” ",positive
388,https://www.football365.com/news/transfer-gossip-juventus-mo-salah-liverpool,Gossip: Juventus never saying never on Mo Salah move,"Juventus want to be seen to be interested in Mo Salah, while Kalvin Phillips could stay put at Leeds… JUVENTUS EYEING SALAH ‘Salah at Juve is a fairly difficult operation, but never say never,’ says Gazzetta. They are reporting that Juventus are ‘changing their skin’ and are ready to spend again, with the Egyptian’s contract situation at Liverpool intriguing just about every big club across Europe. The tone of the piece is that Juventus see Salah as possibly beyond them but they want to be involved in the conversation. It does seem like they want to be involved in every conversation, with the article mentioning various rather expensive Premier League players, including Antonio Rudiger, Jorginho and Paul Pogba. They mean business. Or at least they want people to think they mean business.  DEMBELE TO STAY PUT? There’s nothing like a run of seven assists and a goal in five La Liga games to make a club change their mind on a player. So it seems (according to Foot Mercato, at least) that Ousmane Dembele may well have the option of staying at Barcelona beyond this season, though the enormous wages he seeks might be a slight issue. The same report says he has a verbal agreement with PSG, though he will not be short of options if either side reneges on that agreement, with Newcastle United, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur all said to be interested. Tottenham? At those wages? Now we know it’s nonsense… Meanwhile, you will likely have read elsewhere that Franck Kessie will join Barcelona this summer on a free transfer. They could be proper good again, you know…   PHILLIPS TO STAY PUT TOO? Leeds United have offered Kalvin Phillips a new deal to ward off interest from several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, according toThe Times. He is one of many midfielders linked with United and their midfield void. The 26-year-old England midfielder has been linked with a number of different clubs – including West Ham and Aston Villa – but Leeds are desperate to tie down the local boy beyond 2024, when his current contract expires. They are apparently optimistic that he will sign.  ",negative
389,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-john-nicholson-whats-so-good-about-philippe-coutinho-aston-villa-liverpool,Phil from Brazil is back! Coutinho will be a bargain for Villa,"Philippe Coutinho is the latest subject in our ‘What’s So Good About…’ and Johnny Nic is thrilled to see the Brazilian returning to his Liverpool form for Aston Villa… Who’s this then? Philippe Coutinho Correia is a 29-year-old, 5ft 8in midfielder from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. He’s currently contracted to Barcelona but is on loan at Aston Villa where he scored one and assisted two goals against Leeds United midweek. He spent his early career in Vasco da Gama’s youth system and was a prodigious talent from a young age, playing for Brazil under-15s. Aged just 16, Inter Milan scouted the young Philippe, got four million euro out of their expensive leather wallet and handed it over for his services, allowing him to stay on loan at Vasco until he was 18 to keep within FIFA regulations. When he finally got to Italy, the 1950s railway branchline station master that is Rafa Benitez was Inter’s manager and declared Coutinho to be the future. This turned out not to be true. He struggled to make an impression and for his second season in Europe was sent on loan to Espanyol, playing 16 games and scoring five. Mauricio Pochettino was his manager at the time and about to become Southampton manager. Back at Inter the next season he was no further forward and so in January, following a tip-off from wiley, old Rafa, Inter took Liverpool’s £8.5million in return for the Brazilian’s services, piping Mo Po to his signature, who also fancied a slice of the Coutinho pie, after being impressed with him in Spain. He was to stay at Liverpool from 2012 to 2018 playing 201 games and scoring 54 times. He did take a wee while to settle, however, once he hit his stride, he became crucial to how the side played, so much so that he won Liverpool Fans’ Player of the Season Award: 2014/15 and again in 2015/16 and also Liverpool Players’ Player of the Season Award, Goal of the Season and Performance of the Season in each of those two seasons. The Football Supporters’ Federation also named him Player of the Year in 2016. Brazil Phil was a massive star and hero to the Kop, even though the club didn’t actually win anything in this period. The 2016-17 season was his best for goals, netting 14 in 36 games. But all was not well behind the scenes. Barcelona, opened up their safe, counted out £72 million and waved it at Liverpool, who said “do one will yer, la”. Two more bids were made and given the “jog on, mate, eh” response. A Barcelona director claimed Liverpool wanted £183 million quid. Liverpool said it wasn’t true, but it almost was. The final deal copped £105 million rising to £142 million if certain clauses were met. Report: Liverpool board were euphoric over Coutinho sale He had been on sizzling form for the Reds for the first half of the season Liverpool having registered 12 goals and nine assists in 20 appearances, but he was determined to get offski, so offski he went, leaving some ill-feeling in his wake. But life at the Catalan giants did not go smoothly and he struggled to match the form he had shown for Liverpool. He only played one full season of 54 games, scoring 11 times in 2018/19. In total he made 106 appearances, scoring 26 times. It was thought that a move would do him good and where better than German giants Bayern Munich? They coughed up an 8.3million euro loan fee, plus his wages, with an option to buy for an eye-watering 120million euros. Yeah, right. He played 38 games, scored 11 and won a Treble, including the Champions League. It had been a decent spell but Bayern didn’t want to buy him and back he went to Barcelona where his contract still did not expire until 2023. Notoriously crap coach Ronnie Koeman was now in charge and in December Philly C got knee knack and was out for the season. After another unsatisfactory start to this season, Aston Villa now managed by PC’s old captain said ‘we’ll take him off yer ‘ands, mate’ and he made a loan move, with an option to buy for a more reasonable £33million in the summer. Newcastle had been sniffing around waving giant bundles of blood-soaked cash as per usual, and his agent Kia Joorabchian was hoping to kick off a bidding war, but Phil wanted nothing to do with the Saudi mob and was delighted to hook up with Steven Gerrard once more. He hit the ground running, has started really well and looks to have made Villa significantly better. It’s been a long strange trip for the lad. He’s now played 454 games for club and country and scored 108 times. Internationally he’s got 65 caps and 19 goals but hasn’t really been in favour since 2019.  Why the love? It isn’t impossible that for some reason, the Premier League really suits how Coutinho plays. Because he was half the player he had been for Liverpool when in Spain and to a lesser degree in Germany. He was decent, that goes without saying, but the restless creativity, vision, ceaseless running and ability to unpick defences in tight spaces, seemed to have deserted him by and large. However, even though his three games at Villa is a small sample size to make a judgement from, the fact is, he already looks like the player he was at Liverpool. It is a strange situation, but one which Villa fans must be cock-a-hoop about. Is the Premier League played at a faster pace? Could that suit him? Is the defending much worse than in Spain and that means he has more room to play? Is it more physical? We certainly know the Premier League and everyone who it makes rich, on and off the pitch, act as paid propagandists for both its quality and competitiveness, despite this being at least contestable. Maybe it’s simply that new boss Steven Gerrard knows how and where to play him to get the best out of him, and others didn’t or couldn’t. In his peak Liverpool years, he was, at times, almost unplayable. With tremendous close control, light-footed, fast across the turf and the ability to pick out the most difficult and devastating passes, he was axiomatic to their best performances. But it doesn’t stop there, a superb striker of the ball, he can lash one into the top corner from fully 35 yards. He’s a brilliant free-kick taker and has got a great ping in his right foot to score up and over, curling free kicks, usually into the top left corner. If you let him cut in from the left on his right foot, he’ll batter it into either corner. He is an intelligent footballer who does everything with purpose and precision. The thing is, you couldn’t call him a robust physical player. He is, if not slight, then certainly not a giant slab of man beef. One of those players who, if he ran on snow, would leave no footprints. So that he can survive a physical game is, on the surface, remarkable. But he is a product of Vasco de Gama don’t forget and they forge hard, wee boys who know how to handle themselves. Oh yeah, he can also do that thing where you slow down, almost stop, then take off at top speed again, all in one flowing move. I love that. It is impossible to defend against and takes him past floundering defenders. Basically, Aston Villa have got one absolutely brilliant footballer on loan and can buy him in the summer, for, by today’s Alice In Wonderland Premier League standards, almost no money. Jammy gets.   Three great moments His work in the Villa v Leeds game made us all go, oh yeah, that’s the Coutinho I remember…   The lad knows how to strike a ball…   Some really brilliant assists here. The quality of his passing is extraordinary…  What’s So Good About… Steven Gerrard | Jordan Henderson | Jack Grealish  What the people say – Gets people off their seats at Villa Park. After Grealish left we’ve needed some new heroes and Coutinho, Buendia and JJ are going to be really fun to watch til the end of the season – Liverpool convincing them he was worth £142m is the greatest piece of alchemy known to man. – Adored the mad little fella. Having the ability is one thing but the vision on him. Some of the passes he made to Sturridge were unreal, let alone the incredible goals. Shame about his back, mind. – Coutinho is one of few top-level players who understands his role in life is to bring joy. Watching him play unconstrained and free to express himself is wonderful. One of the last “proper” Brazilian midfielders? – His remarkable powers of recovery from chronic back pain whenever an international was scheduled in 2017. Future days Already it isn’t too much of a stretch of imagination to think that Philippe will sign for Villa this summer. The thought of going back to the smouldering ruins where Barcelona once stood for yet another season, is surely unpalatable for him. He hasn’t been massively overworked in recent years and modern player welfare is so good now, he can expect to play for another nine or ten years. All of which is good news for Villa. They are currently 11th and ninth is not beyond them, 8th if results go their way. A positive top half finish, will give them confidence to push on for the Europa League next season and be one of those teams that the top three might draw with, or occasionally lose to and that’s about as much as 17 teams in the league can hope for. Clearly, they need to get rid of defenders who you know will commit a crime against football every game. But if they can shore up the back, with Coutinho pulling the strings in the front two thirds, you can see a great feature for the club and for their ever more impressive manager. ",positive

Ronaldo returned to Man Utd in the summer transfer window to much excitement with many supporters thinking his signing, coupled with the arrival of Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, could help propel the Red Devils towards the top of the Premier League. However, despite Ronaldo scoring 15 goals in all competitions this season, Man Utd have been poor with Ralf Rangnick’s side only moving into fourth place in midweek. Bruno and Ronaldo are the gems in the Man Utd turd… There have been numerous rumours of unrest in the Man Utd dressing room over Mason Greenwood’s arrest and the way Jesse Lingard has been treated by Rangnick. The latest speculation insisted that some Man Utd players were unhappy at Rangnick’s training methods and that they jokingly referred to assistant boss Chris Armas asfictional soccer coach Ted Lasso. And now The Daily Mirror claims Maguire and Ronaldo are ’embroiled in a power struggle over theManchester Unitedcaptaincy’ as Ralf Rangnick‘looks to take the pressure off him’. Maguire, though, is ‘reluctant to relinquish the armband for the rest of the season’ with the England internationalfearing he will lose ‘the captaincy on a permanent basis’. The Daily Mirror adds: ‘Interim boss Rangnick has called on Ronaldo to mentor the young players within the squad, which is understood to have led to further friction with Maguire. ‘United skipper Maguire is said to feel increasingly undermined by the 37-year-old superstar’s huge influence within the dressing-room, particularly with the younger players. ‘Ronaldo has positioned himself as the one setting the example for younger players and the need for one figure – himself – to get everyone pulling in the same direction. ‘Maguire is said to feel marginalised in terms of his authority within the United dressing-room, leading to him thinking some of the players are losing respect for him. ‘There is now a growing belief within the Old Trafford dressing-room that it is inevitable Ronaldo will replace Maguire – who has been struggling for form – as captain.’ ",positive

The Manchester Evening News claims that the break in fixtures for the Red Devils will ‘allow [Ralf] Rangnick and his staff the chance to take a closer look at potential summer transfer targets in action live’. There will be a ‘number of young exciting prospects in action’ when Crystal Palace take on Everton tomorrow. Olise is the pick of the bunch on current form with three assists and a goal in his last nine fixtures in all competitions, putting in a number of impressive performances. And now he has caught the eye of the Man Utd transfer team and ‘should tick many boxes from a United recruitment perspective’. One attraction of Olise is his versatility with the former Reading player capable of playing as a winger, an eight or a ten. Palace landed the Hammersmith-born midfielder for £8m in the summer transfer window but the MEN reckons it is ‘likely that they could attract three times that amount if they sold him now’. The MEN adds: ‘That’s something they’re probably not in a rush to do, but United interest could change that stance, especially if they were to put an attractive offer on the table.’  NEYMAR TO NEWCASTLE?Newcastle want Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar to lead their new project at St James’ Park, according to reports in Spain. The Brazilian has scored 334 goals in 545 club appearances since making his debut for Santos back in 2009 and now the Geordies want him to continue his brilliant scoring record in the Premier League. Newcastle became one of the wealthiest clubs in world football overnight following their Saudi-led takeover earlier in the season. The Magpies were quite sensible with their money in January, bringing in Dan Burn, Kieran Trippier, Matt Targett, Chris Wood and Bruno Guimaraes. Those five signings have helped pull Newcastle away from relegation danger as they look to put themselves in the best possible position to attract some bigger names in the summer. And Spanish website Fichajes claims that Neymar ‘is the star they want’ to lead their project after PSG were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16. It is understood the clubs owner ‘does not want him to continue at the club’ after the Brazilian has underperformed since moving to France. The report adds that ‘everything seems to indicate that his departure is imminent’ and that Newcastle now ‘have him in their sights’ as they want Neymar to be ‘the face of a project that aims to win the Premier League in the short term’.

Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles.

The Portugal captain is the Red Devils’ top scorer this season with 23 goals in 37 appearances across all competitions. Five ways for Man Utd to salvage what’s left of this wretched season He has scored five in his last three games – including a hat-trick against Norwich City on April 16. Despite his stellar goalscoring season, Ronaldo’s future is up in the air with Ten Hag replacing Ralf Rangnick in the dugout at the end of 2021/22. As per the Mirror, the Dutch manager is keen on building around ‘energy and youth’ with a big summer squad overhaul on the cards. They say that Ronaldo is ‘not guaranteed’ to play every game under Ten Hag, which will not sit well with the club legend who has scored 17 times in the Premier League since his return to Man Utd last summer.

The La Liga giants are keen on signing Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe – who is out of contract at the end of the season. Speaking earlier this week, PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino claimed that he and Mbappe will both be at the club next season. Asked in a press conference what the likelihood of him and the French forward being at the club next term was, he replied: “100 per cent in both cases.” Pochettino, who was overlooked for the Man Utd job, added: “That is how I feel today.

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night to move six points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham – who have a game in hand on Rangnick’s men – but it’s unlikely that that the Red Devils will now finish higher than sixth position. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Ten Hag has a huge job on his hands to get Man Utd competing for Premier League titles again and Neville has set out his timeline of expectations for the Dutchman. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they?

They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it?

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Crouch wrote in the Daily Mail: “Now I like being on the right side of history, so I don’t think it’s particularly wise to pick a Player of the Year before we know who has won what. “I’m often left surprised by how early they are generally done. The winner has to come from the best team and the best team is often unknown until May. “All the awards should be left as late as possible and I always thought voting for the PFA Player of the Year was done far too early, often months before the season finishes. “It seemed strange timing to me, with so much of the league left to play, and I could never quite get my head around why voting was not electronic either. There should be an app for your phone that takes 10 seconds to complete. More players might vote then, too! “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season. Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks. “Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them.

The way they fought and the way they understood how they had to manage the game in certain moments, it was phenomenal. “I am extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and to show the character they showed.” On the pressure of staying above Tottenham, Arteta added: “When you have to pass the ball from A to B under pressure or no pressure, this is an excuse. “We were just sloppy at times and not precise and that led to a game we didn’t want to play in many moments. “We recognise that and sometimes it happens.

Rodri headed City into a half-time lead and further goals in the second period from Nathan Ake, Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho lifted them back to the top of the table. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency City boss Pep Guardiola made five changes after his side’s midweek Champions League win against Real Madrid, but it made little difference as they marched on in defence of their domestic crown. They secured a third straight league win for the first time in 2022, but it was not the walk in the park the scoreline would suggest against an embattled Leeds side hungry for points in their fight to beat the drop. Leeds were much-improved following Monday’s goalless draw at Crystal Palace, but their first league defeat in six games leaves them one place and five points above third-bottom Everton, who have two games in hand. City were almost caught cold in the opening minutes when Rodrigo raced unopposed from halfway after a slip by Joao Cancelo, but Ilkay Gundogan rescued his team-mate with a vital block in the box. Leeds had been dealt another injury blow before kick-off when skipper Liam Cooper limped out of the warm-up and was replaced by Mateusz Klich. Robin Koch switched back to centre-half alongside Pascal Struijk and Leeds’ new-look defence was undone in the 13th minute. Stuart Dallas was penalised for his foul on Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden’s excellent outswinging free-kick was headed home by Rodri, who ghosted on to the ball unopposed. Leeds saw little of the ball, and showed little cohesion when they did, until the half-hour mark when they began to pose City some problems. Junior Firpo rifled a shot over the crossbar and as Leeds exposed gaps in City’s final third, Raphinha threatened in and around the box.

The home side’s wretched luck with injuries this season continued in first-half stoppage time when Dallas twisted his knee in a 50-50 challenge with Jack Grealish and was carried off the field on a stretcher. Leeds began the second half well, forcing City on to the back foot, but the visitors twice served warning with swift counter-attacks and doubled their lead from another set-piece in the 54th minute. Foden’s corner was headed goalwards by Ruben Dias and Ake turned to sweep the ball home from six yards at the far post. Ake hobbled off soon after and was replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko before Leeds went close through Raphinha, whose shot was deflected over by Aymeric Laporte after he had burst into the box. But City put the game to bed with an excellent third goal in the 78th minute. Ederson’s clearance was chested into Foden’s path and his through-ball was buried by Jesus. Cancelo was denied in a one-on-one by Illan Meslier soon after, but to their credit Leeds went down fighting. Daniel James and Sam Greenwood saw successive goalbound shots blocked and fellow substitute Joe Gelhardt’s effort was saved by Ederson before Fernandinho, a late replacement for Rodri, arrowed home a low shot in time added on.

404,https://www.football365.com/news/mediawatch-one-candidate-ruled-out-manchester-united-captaincy-obsession,One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues,"Ralf Rangnick may as well stop talking as words are being put in his mouth regardless. The Manchester United captaincy obsession continues. O Captain! My Captain! The tabloid obsession with which Manchester United player should be entrusted to wear a piece of cloth around their arm continues apace in The Sun, who tasked Ken Lawrence to run the rule over any candidates on show against Chelsea. He was not impressed. ‘HARRY MAGUIRE should hardly be that worried that he will lose the Manchester United captaincy once Erik Ten Hag shows up,’ he writes. ‘Interim managerRalf Rangnickdeclared that a vote should be held amongst the players for who will wear the famous arm band next season.’ Nope. Rangnick specifically said “it doesn’t make sense” to discuss the captaincy situation “because we all don’t know what kind of players will be here, what the group will look like”. He added: “I strongly believe that the captain should be elected by the team because he’s called the team manager and we always did that.The player with the highest amount of votes was the team captain at the end. That’s how I did it. I know that not a lot of head coaches do it that way. That’s what I would do if I was still the manager next season but in the end I’m not, so this is something that Erik will have to decide.” At no stage did he ‘declare that a vote should be held’. ‘And that means Maguire, missing against Chelsea and who will alsobe out with knee troublefor the remaining three games of United’s miserable campaign, won’t get the German’s recommendation to carry on.’ Because no-one will ‘get the German’s recommendation to carry on’. Because “it doesn’t make sense” to even talk about it currently. Lawrence proceeds to run down Bruno Fernandes, Scott McTominay and Cristiano Ronaldo, none of whom provided overwhelming evidence they should assume the captaincy. But this line on David de Gea stands out: ‘Yet as a goalkeeper he might be considered as being too far away from the action to influence his team mates.’ Pep Guardiola was in charge of a Champions League semi-final first leg earlier this week but even he would wince at this level of overthinking. It is a bit of fabric that goes around someone’s arm and let’s them call head or tails at the coin toss, not a sodding talking stick that only allows the person who holds it to speak.  Doss pot Rangnick continues to be wilfully misrepresented by the media, with Etienne Fermie of The Sun website a particular offender with this: ‘The latter days of his temporary tenure have been dogged by poor performances and claims ofdressing room unrestoff the pitch. ‘ButRangnick, who willcompile a dossierto hand over to successorErik ten Hag, is still sure of Ronaldo’s reliability on the field.’ There is a link to their rehash of the original Sunday People story in which said ‘dossier’ was reported. There is no mention whatsoever of Rangnick’s categorical dismissal of the claim as “completely false, completely untrue”. Weird.  Leg work Neil Custis of The Sun was at Old Trafford and seemed to have either Jack Grealish or Xherdan Shaqiri on his mind: ‘A golden opportunity presented itself on 27 minutes whenThomas Tuchel’sside calved through the Red Devils again.’ Must be his muscle memory kicking in.  Sol searching Rangnick has obviously been a monumental disappointment at Manchester United but there is an element of revisionism creeping in surrounding his predecessor. Ian Ladyman writes the following in the Daily Mail: ‘The United team bequeathed to Rangnick by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November was bad. This one is worse.’ Yet this one has lost as many games – 7 – in 26 matches under Rangnick this season as it did under Solskjaer in 16. Some of the results and many of the performances since December have been awful. But Manchester United were ‘worse’ in terms of league position and margins of defeat before. Watford 4-1 Manchester United – the most recent game in which the Hornets did not lose at home- was 160 days ago and had absolutely nothing to do with Rangnick.  Mad world ‘Maybe Gabriel Jesus leaves Manchester City because that is the club’s decision – but he would be mad to go of his own accord,’ writes Martin Samuel in the Daily Mail. How ‘mad’ of a 25-year-old regular Brazil international to want to start more than 23 of a possible 52 games for Manchester City so far this season. ‘Jesus, 25, has spent much of his time at the club playing second fiddle to various false nines, and now Erling Haaland is coming in the summer. ‘But that means Pep Guardiola’s preferred shape will at last involve a striker – and Haaland is not going to play every game, or get the whole 90 minutes when he does. There will be cup ties, rotation, substitutions. It does not follow that Jesus would be unused and ignored.’ It does follow that he would play even less than he is now and runouts in the League Cup third round, dead-rubber matches in the Champions League, the odd Premier League game and a load of substitute cameos might not suffice. The inevitable Divock Origi example is cited by Samuel and that is fine. Origi, of course, is expected to leave upon the expiration of his Liverpool contract this summer – a situation Jesus will be in when his Manchester City deal runs out in 2023. ‘If City want him, Jesus should stay,’ he concludes. ‘Haaland or not, where is going to be better than City?’ Nowhere. But there could be a handful of places deemed better than City’s bench. It does not take a rocket surgeon to figure out why a footballer might want to play more regular football.   Stuck in the middle It might be the last time Mediawatch brings this up, but just for old time’s sake… ‘Matic, the most impressive at Goodison Park over seven months ago, was only withdrawn due to a caution and Van de Beek, in his first major start for his new club, made way for Bruno Fernandes, who found Rashford for the clincher.

The England international shone for West Ham in the second part of last season after joining David Moyes’ side on loan for six months. Instead of pursuing a move away from the Red Devils in the summer he decided to stay and fight for his place despite slipping down the pecking order under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Despite making 22 appearances under Solskjaer and interim boss Rangnick this season, only four of those have come from the start of a match. And Lingard – who did reportedly look to leave in January – will now leave Old Trafford on a free transfer in the summer with Man Utd looking to clear out a number of players. Juan Mata, Edinson Cavaniand Phil Jones, who are also likely to leave in the summer, were given minutes as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night but Lingard was left on the bench by Rangnick. And the Manchester Evening News claim that Lingard was ‘upset’ with Rangnick in the aftermath of United’s win against the Bees after not being able to get on the pitch for a farewell appearance at Old Trafford. The newspaper’s sources close to Lingard insist that the winger ‘was dismayed by Rangnick’s decision to send on Edinson Cavani ahead of the academy graduate’ with Man Utd finishing the season with two away fixtures. Lingard’s brother,Louie Scott, took to social media after the match to hit out at Man Utd and their “classless” treatment of the winger. “20 years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,” Scott said on Instagram. “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league OK. “Class of ’92, Busby Babes, you’re run by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, god bless! Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send-off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” ",positive

The Spaniard produced a good performance for the Red Devils on Monday as they beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford with goals coming from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. Mata was making his first Premier League start of the campaign with the 34-year-old starting just three of his ten appearances in all competitions this term. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The decision by interim boss Rangnick to start Mata frustrated Man Utd legend Keane who thinks the German is “giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons”. “I’m surprised. It’s his first start of the season, he obviously knows he’s leaving the club. There’s some loyalty there, giving him a run-out. “He came on for 20 minutes the other night but starting a game is much different. It tells you where the mindset is. They are giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons.” 🗣 “I’m surprised.” Roy Keane says he wasn’t expecting Juan Mata to start over Marcus Rashford this evening for Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/MYVJQzJ9BS — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 But Rangnick was pleased with Mata’s performance against Brentford and when asked whether he could’ve used him more often, the Man Utd boss replied:“Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. “He had moments when he played like a magician.” Mata is out of contract at Man Utd at the end of the season and looks almost certain that he will leave the club in the summer. On Mata’s future, Rangnick added: “I don’t know [if he’s leaving]. He hasn’t confirmed that but it is possible. “It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time and played well for the club.” Phil Jones, who has also struggled for game time in recent seasons, got on the pitch for the final 15 minutes in what is likely to be his Old Trafford farewell with Man Utd finishing the season with away trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace. “For personal reasons he didn’t train a lot, yesterday was the first,” said Rangnick of Jones. “He asked me to allow him some time at home. Tonight was one of those nights I would have loved to have five subs.”  ",positive

Fans showed their anger at the Glazer family as their team earned themselves a 3-0 win against Brentford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

In spells we were too hectic. “But OK, fair play to Man United. I think they hit a very high performance first half – some of their better performance that I have seen so far so they did well. “Second half much more the Brentford team I want to see, much more front footed. “We had momentum with chances and half chances and we were definitely on top and then we make a stupid mistake for the penalty, an unnecessary mistake and that of course killed the game off I would say. “If you want to win here at Old Trafford, we can’t make a penalty and concede on a set piece.”  ",positive
408,https://www.football365.com/news/xi-big-six-premier-league-stars-ready-for-step-down,Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down,"Footballers frequently talk about being the best they can be and playing at the highest possible level. But they are often either promoted above their station or ultimately reach the top and come down the other side. Here’s an XI of players currently at a Big Six side in need of a step down. GK: Dean Henderson (Manchester United) Henderson has played three games of football this season. Thought to be vying with David de Gea to be No.1 on his return to Manchester United nearly two years ago, he’s now understandaby pretty peeved at the situation. Erik ten Hag is reportedly ‘concerned’ about De Gea, but if true, those doubts – thought to be around the Spaniard’s ability with the ball at his feet – are unlikely to be curbed by Henderson.  RB: Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Manchester United) Manchester United bought an excellent defensive right-back and Wan-Bissaka has – in the main – been an excellent defensive right-back for Manchester United. It’s hard not to feel sorry for the guy. United either bought him with an acceptance of his attacking limitations, which is moronic given the importance of forward-thinking full-backs in every other successful football team in European football. Or they believed they could coach him into becoming a real attacking force having seen no evidence that would become a reality, which is an incredibly naive way to spend £50m.  CB: Victor Lindelof (Manchester United) Lindelof has always seemed like a half-decent defender playing the part of a very good one. His tranquility often belies the chaos around him and not in a good way. While Harry Maguire is front and centre in the blame stakes, Lindelof shrinks into the background. He’s the sort of player that a person less au fait with United might struggle to name as part of their team or squad – he’s just there, not doing very much.  CB: Nathan Ake (Manchester City) “He’s so reliable, especially when you behave in your life like him, he always will do good. In the bad phases, always helping, exceptional person.” Pep Guardiola is very, very good at protesting too much, making squad players feel more integral than they clearly are. Ake is important to Guardiola – he wants four quality centre-backs – but the Dutch international is obviously fourth choice and could easily be the main man at an inferior club.  LB: Alex Telles (Manchester United) Bought as a replacement, or at least competition, for Luke Shaw in the summer of 2020, Telles has found himself on the bench for the majority of his Manchester United stay after his arrival appeared to give Shaw the kick in the backside he needed. Shaw’s injury in recent weeks has given Telles the chance to impress, but his time in the team has only really served to strengthen the view that he will forever be a back-up.  CM: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool) Georginio Wijnaldum’s departure gave the Ox an opportunity he has failed to grasp. And there is a sense that it was a last chance for a 28-year-old who has struggled with injury in his time at Anfield, but in truth has never met the mark required to play consistently for a title-chasing team. A move to a lesser Premier League side could easily result in a Jesse Lingard-like reminder of his quality.  CM: Harry Winks (Tottenham) In mid-February Harry Winks admitted – after five starts in six Premier League games under Antonio Conte – that he feared his Tottenham career was “dead and buried” before the Italian boss arrived at the club. Now, after just one more start from the last 11,with Rodrigo Bentancur in no small part to blame, his Tottenham career looks, once again, dead and buried.  AM: Lucas Moura (Tottenham) Lucas managed to beat off competition from Steven Bergwijn to be the A.N.Other alongside Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, but Dejan Kulusevski has made that spot his own and doesn’t look as though he will relinquish it. At just 29 the Brazilian has at least one move left in him and would offer Spurs the chance to raise £20m or so for a summer transfer kitty.  AM: Callum Hudson-Odoi (Chelsea) Frequently injured at the point at which he appears to be hitting top form, Chelsea should have taken the £50m Bayern Munich offered two years ago. A player with everything who shows his quality in increasingly frustrating glimpses. Still only 21 and yet it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  AM: Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)Ten Hag is set to hold Zoom meetings with all members of the Manchester United squad ahead of his arrival in the summer to give him a chance to assess them, while offering an opportunity for players like Rashford – who might be thinking of an exit – to assess him. Rashford isn’t alone in being a very fine United footballer whose form has nosedived this season. And amid apathy from the fans and worry over his place in the England set-up, parting company with his boyhood club may be the best recourse. He may need to take the opportunity for a sideways move, rather than a step down, while such offers are still a possibility.  ST: Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City) A goal or an assist every 99 minutes for Manchester City is an excellent record and yet, because he plays for Manchester City, it’s quite hard to truly tell how good he is. There’s little doubt he would be an improvement on Mikel Arteta’s options at Arsenal and that’s a move that seems about right. ",positive
409,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-manchester-city-cursed-real-madrid-everton-lampard-hate,"Manchester City are cursed and the Everton, Frank Lampard hate is weird","Manchester City put on an attacking clinic but still gave Real Madrid a chance, while there are defences of Everton and Frank Lampard. Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com. About last night… Football is brilliant. Jon, Lincoln.  Blimey.That did nothing for my dodgy ticker.But what a game.Sheesh. If you watched it, then I have no unique clinical analysis to offer.You saw what we all saw. If, however, you watched that as a neutral, and didn’t think that it was one of the best CL games of recent times (Note for trolls not THE best just one of them), then you’re probably one of the few mailers that like to write in about how boring it is to watch City because they are ‘robotic’ or ‘sterile’. If you couldn’t watch that and appreciate Vinicius Jr’s goal as a thing of beauty as well as Benzema’s skill and even more outrageous pen or Ferna’s delicious cross for Foden’s header and Bernardo’s sweet left foot strike then, might I respectfully suggest, perhaps you are not quite as neutral as you might like to think. Just a thought. Personally?I’ll take that kind of ‘robotic’ all day long, Mark (4-3.Without our first-choice defence.Get in!).MCFC.  A superb combination – a club that can’t win the champions league no matter how good they get, against a club that seems well able to win it no matter how average they get – and a game that really reflectedthat. I’m not normally one for putting too much stock in the idea that a club’s history and culture, successes and failures are all relevant factors in decidingwhat happens on the pitch, but are City just bloody cursed or what? City were awesome again last night, just as they have been countless times under Pep. I’m a Liverpool fan and I even think it would be a pity if they failed to win it eventually. But they keep making huge mistakes at huge moments, time and time again in Europe. And Madrid are good at …scoring goals- and that’s it! They’re not even good at creating lots of chances, they just take a few they get, almost as if it’s inevitable, simply becausethey’re Real Madrid. I’m positive that City will be the better team next week, but you just feel that, yet again with City in the UCL ,being good enough might not be good enough- and especially so againstthis lot. Bryan  Can the people who whined about the ending of the away goals rule in European football, step forward please? Free from the shackles of stick or twist caused by the away goals jeopardy, teams can just go blow for blow for every minute of every game. Just brilliant. Eoghan  The shame of it is that it was played to such a restricted television audience. This is Box Office football, and the sooner it is back on terrestrial television, the better. What a game. Bladey Mick (Wow!)  That Benzyma is some player Gaz, CFC, Sidcup (Real have got more lives than the cat next door)  After that Man City Vs Real Madrid match I am sure I am not alone when I say I cannot wait to see an article from Johnny ‘happy’ Nic saying how such matches are a stain on society, and how we are all a disgrace for not seeing that Concord Rangers v Slough on the same night was the more important (and better) match. All the best Lee, Boro  Leave Everton alone Where has all this hate for Everton come from? So they played Mourinhoball against Liverpool? It’s hardly the crime of the century. And wanting a club to end their nearly 70 year tenure in the top flight because they appointed Frank Lampard? Let’s have some perspective. I can think of loads more clubs with more disagreeable fans than Everton’s. My own club, me included, are incredibly annoying due to the number of keyboard warriors we have produced – I’ve been writing into F365’s mailbox for 20 years! I can’t wish any ill on Everton. They’re a great community club with a lovely bunch of fans and as a founding member of the Premier League and an ever present in the top flight in practically everyone you know’s lifetime, if they do go down then I’ll certainly miss them – even if no-one else will. I’m really hoping that we have secured European football and Everton are safe by the time Arsenal meet Everton on the final day of the season – it will be a meeting between the two teams with the longest continual runs in the top flight to date – I hope that run isn’t broken. Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London  Almost exactly 1 year ago 6 teams tried to join the “Super league” and screw over football as we all know and love it. Chelsea are/were owned by one of Putins best mates. Newcastle were bought by a country currently at war with a neighbour and possessing a horrendous human rights record. Yet Everton are being painted as the bad guys and getting a kicking here at every turn. Some balance might not go amiss. Steve Limerick Ireland  …but pile on Frank I for one will be very sad to see Everton go down, if that ends up their fate. Not because of their football particularly, though it was a lot better at the beginning of the season. I like their history, I like that they’ve struggled successfully against relegation and battled through. For me, it’s a shame that they’re struggling again after looking like they might have made some good signings and progress. Terrible ownership, terrible board, terrible managerial appointments. Maybe it’s a little bit of empathy from the plight of United. However, I can never wish a side to be relegated – especially when you know that you’ll likely never see them back in the top flight again. Ok, there’s an exception – I’d love to see West Ham disappear, but that’s a historic hatred of their scum supporters. Does anyone really hate Everton that much? But I cannot abide Lampard. Couldn’t abide him as a player – oooh he scored a lot of goals, while taking an absolute tonne of shots rather than pass to his colleagues in better positions, and IMO was regularly a waste of an England shirt (give me Scholes and Gerrard in the centre any day). Can’t really get on board with him as a person – maybei’m jealous of his massively unchallenging life from birth through to being gifted multi-million-pound management contracts he doesn’t in any way deserve. My hope is that the side somehow scrapes through and he’s ditched off in the most deserving and humiliating of ways. However, seeing these tedious red pile-ons in the mailbox should just remind everyone how utterly abhorrent so many gloating Liverpool fans are. And as if one of them complained about Everton players diving… honestly, self-awareness much? And that is why more fans would rather City won the league than Liverpool. Badwolf  And now leave Frank alone Dear F365. As a Spurs supporter I’m certainly no fan of Frank Lampard, I can recognise just how good a player he was though. I’m not sure I agree (or am that comfortable) with the kicking he seems to be getting from. He deserves to be criticised because his team are quite likely to be relegated but the criticism for him taking the job seems very bizarre. Why wouldn’t a manager take the reins of a prem team that are towards the bottom of the league if you have the confidence and vision? Plenty have had the same opportunity, plenty have failed as well, I’m not sure why Lampard is being singled out? The comparisons at the moment are with Eddie Howe and why he’s the poster boy for a team in dire straits, his last prem side were relegated, surely that made him an even bigger gamble for a relegation threatened club? I remember the defence on here of Marco Silva when he was appointed to help steer a relegation threatened Hull despite never having managed in the prem or been in a relegation scrap. Arteta’s appointment at Arsenal was initially welcomed and Vieira’s at Palace was also fine (he had only managed 30 or so games more than Lampard). Graham Potter had 51 or so games under his belt in the Championship but plenty in Sweden, again, none had any direct experience or success of the job they were then recruited for. As I said, I’m no Lampard nor Everton fan, I don’t really understand the glee of their demise because Frank was in your opinion unqualified for the task. We should be trying to nurture young managerial talent rather than hoping and praying they fail. Steve (THFC) The really frustrating thing now is that Lampard’s Everton, while not great, are probably not a relegation side. Benitez’s Everton fucked us — Jim Keoghan (@Jim_Keoghan) April 24, 2022   Toffees lament I’m not going to talk about the derby match any more. I imagine it’s pretty boring now and both sides have said all that can be said. Ste, L13 got it right when he says no one hates Everton as much as Evertonians, and as always it’s the hope that gets you. Jack Kildare, I generally don’t hear anyone defending Richarlison’s antics when it comes to faking injuries. I do know it is a source of frustration for many Evertonians. I think as fans we can all be guilty of excusing undesirable behaviour from our players (several things just jumped into your head right??) trying to waste a bit of time on the pitch is probably one of the least objectionable. Paul McDevitt has been listening to Everton podcasts for some reason? And is shocked to find some blinkered and passionate opinions contained within. Is he suggesting that Liverpool’s reputation and status played no part in those players joining them? Liverpool’s recruitment, scouting, backroom set up is excellent. They have consistently identified the right players and brought those players in to benefit the team. No one is denying that. But to suggest that the task isn’t made easier than it is for other clubs because of the worldwide reputation of Liverpool is just the kind of well-reasoned and not-at-all biased opinion I’d expect to hear in the local shouty fan podcast. And finally… To Frank Lampard, and some of the claims and opinions that have been expressed. James, Sussex nodded all the way through Jonny Nic’s article and wants to know why Everton didn’t get Eddie Howe. For a start, the article was nothing but click bait garbage. I sometimes like Jonny Nic’s articles, but they have been getting worse and worse lately. The thing is, I don’t actually believe that Jonny would want Everton to get relegated. But this pie in the sky “football would be so much better if we didn’t have capitalism or money or if Liverpool, City, Man U, Tottenham all f**ked off to Europe or all the players were happy to play for thruppence a season and pocket full of skittles” narrative is not rooted in any kind of realism or real world thinking. It’s click bate and its designed to drive traffic and comments on this site. Which I don’t have a problem with as I live in the real world and I know that if I want a site like this to continue, it might need a little click bate to help with revenue. However back to Frank. My simple opinion is, what up and coming successful manager, or even experienced manager would want to come and ruin their reputation at Everton? Who could we get? Do you think Eddie Howe or Graham Potter would want to risk their career by coming to us? Should we have gone back to Allerdyce and said, well since we are still paying you from the last time you were here why not come back and give it another go? The truth is, I have no idea how much scouting or research went into the latest manager recruitment process and how many turned us down. No one except the people involved do. What I do know is that the shortlist we were left with was woeful. I’d have given it to Dunc for the season and tried to get a proper manager in place for the summer. But I’m not running the club just as non of the fans are running the club. Apart from a few d*ckheads, most of the Everton fans were prepared to give Rafa a chance. Very few really wanted him in first place, BUT if he’d have actually won games and not dragged us into a relegation fight before selling one of our best players then he would still be here. The fact is, Frank Lampard is the manager now and what other choice have we got except to get behind him and hope that the decision pays off in the end. James, EFC  Gerrard knock life “The shark-infested waters of the middle of the Premier League, where it’s easy for hard-earned reputations to turn to dust” was a comment that really stood out to me from F365’s review of Gerrard’s Villa tenure. It really highlights how hard it is to move up the managerial ladder. During his time in charge, Villa have taken 27 points (8W, 3D, 9L) from a possible 60 in the League. If you were to extrapolate that over a season, it would get you to 51.3 points. On average that would land a team into 9th place. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. The best predictor of a club’s final league position is its player wage bill. While it is difficult to get a truly fair comparison betweenclubs, Aston Villa sit somewhere around 11th. So Gerrard’s tenure could be accurately described as maybe slightly better than par-for-the-course. Unfortunately, par-for-the-course is extremely unlikely to get Gerrard into the Liverpool hotseat. United on the other hand…. anyway I digress. Gerrard’s managerial CV shows he is no bluffer, but I think he is yet to show much evidence that he is the next Klopp. Oliver, London  Penalty nonsense I have lost track of how many times recently I’ve heard pundits saying they think Liverpool or Man City would have been given a penalty that other teams aren’t awarded. This is nonsense, and is only a “feeling” they have based on memorable incidents. When Liverpool or City are winning 4 or 5 nil, no one remembers the couple of penalties they were denied because, who cares? Obviously when it’s Everton’s only chance of getting something at Anfield, its going to be a big deal. Rather than basing it on a hunch, just look at the facts.Liverpool and City have been awarded just two more penalties than Everton and Brentford this season and just one more than Crystal Palace. Now I don’t know the actual numbers(I’m sure someone can tell us), but I’d be very surprised if the ratio of touches in the oppositionbox to penalties favours Liverpool or City over those teams at all. In fact, I’m fairly confident that the stats will show Liverpool should have way more than 2 penalties than Everton. Can I also remind people that around 2017/18, Liverpool went over a year without getting a penalty at Anfield. For an attacking team containing Mane and Salah, that’s ludicrous! Being a Liverpool fan, I can guarantee there is no way we get more penalties than we deserve. No doubt that will be dismissed as bias, but like I say, look at the facts. Regards Oliver Thompson  A point is a point A point is a point. But even if Leeds survive, the future is bleak. That was awful to watch, there is no plan in possession other than to give it away and try and win the ball future up to pitch (presumably to hoof it further and repeat). Phillips may aswell be the Yorkshire Pingu if he’s in a team this narrow. No more raking balls out to Raphinha who is then against an isolated full back with space to run into. Survival and living are two separate things. I might fail to do either going forward due to profuse bleeding from the eyes. A point is a point. A point is a point.  Tricky trees Within all the (absolutely warranted) mails on City and Real I just wanted to call out the performance of Nottingham Forest and Steve Cooper. Forest had 1 point from 7 games when Chris Hughton was fired. They are now 3rd in the league and have 3 games left in the season with automatic promotion in their own hands. A hell of a achievement and as a Villa supporter, I hope they manage to get up. Paul ",positive
410,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-consciously-uncouple,Jesus and Manchester City should consciously uncouple,"Gabriel Jesus seems likely to be leaving Manchester City in the summer and his goals against Watford were a timely reminder of his talents. Well, it was certainly a statement. Following a week of speculation about the addition ofErling Haaland to the Manchester City squad in the summer, a player likely to leave at the end of this season left a huge mark on City’s 5-1 demolition of Watford. Jesus resurrected his season a week after Easter; Gabriel scored four of Manchester City’s goals, the first player to score four goals in a Premier League match since Son Heung Min for Spurs at Southampton in September 2020. While the opposition was about as modest as can be found in the Premier League, it was a timely reminder of his talents as the business end of the season looms into view. But it doesn’t seem likely that Gabriel will be a Manchester City for that much longer. He’s not a great scorer of goals but his record is decent enough, with 121 in 313 appearances in all competitions since he signed for City for £27m in January 2017. But to look at his goalscoring record alone is to misinterpret a player who falls a little between two stools. Gabriel is able to player as both a winger and a striker and that degree of flexibility is very useful to Pep Guardiola and Manchester City. But City have been playing this season without having replaced Sergio Aguero, and Gabriel doesn’t quite offer consistent, razor-sharp clinicism in front of goal. He may have shanked four past Watford to go with his goal against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago, but these were his first Premier League goals since September 25, and he’s only scored seven Premier League goals in total this season, though it also worth remembering that although he was originally used as a forward when he arrived at the club, he’s been most commonly seen on the wing this season. Gabriel has a year left to run on his contract, but at 25 years of age had reached something of a crossroads. If they sold this summer, Manchester City would receive a transfer fee – though how much they’d be able to demand for a player in his position is open to question – while the player may be able to negotiate a better contract and signing-on fee, as well as potentially becoming the focal point of a new team as he reaches what should be his career peak. It’s a question of priorities. If Gabriel is primarily motivated by the accumulation of medals, he’s already done well out of Manchester City, with three Premier League titles, three EFL Cups and an FA Cup. Even if pushed down the pecking order at City, it’s not difficult to argue that his best chance of winning more silverware might also come at The Etihad, even if his own playing time was further limited by new acquisitions.    But other factors also come into play when deciding on a transfer. If he places great importance on status, barring perhaps four or five other clubs on the entire planet, leaving Manchester City may be considered taking ‘a step down’. But if playing time is important to him, he’d likely be better off elsewhere; if his work-rate on the pitch is anything to go by, it probably is. He may already be aware of the importance of this next decision – especially with his first child on the way. Small wonder that when questioned about it, he played his cards close to his chest. The club with the greatest interest in him are Arsenal. There remains a question mark over whether they will be able to offer him Champions League football next season, but it feels like a good fit. Arsenal have had a forward-shaped hole in the first-team squad since the departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Alexandre Lacazette is also expected to leave in the summer and they are in the coterie of clubs that can comfortably afford his wage demands, while Mikel Arteta is already fully familiar with him from his own time as Pep Guardiola’s assistant. It is being reported that this is almost a done deal, but at this point of the season it wouldn’t make a great deal of sense to recklessly make any form of announcement when both City and Arsenal need as little external distraction as possible. Furthermore, it seems entirely likely that City are already making plans for moving on without him, and they may already have lined up a replacement. Julian Alvarez signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with the club at the end of January; he remained with his ‘former’ club, River Plate, but it has been confirmed that he will be moving to The Etihad in the summer, and he is a forward who can also play on the right wing. Sometimes, a transfer makes sense for all parties. Manchester City have had good value from Gabriel Jesus, but are unlikely to be able to offer him the first-team football he would want. Arsenal need a new forward and can offer him better opportunities to play at a club close enough to the elite that it might not even feel much like a ‘step down’, and a player with enormous ability and an extraordinary work-rate gets the opportunity to step fully into the spotlight at what should be the perfect point in his career. With seven medals and seven trophies won in five-and-a-half years (so far), Gabriel and Manchester City have much to be grateful to each other for, but the end of this season is perfect timing to close this chapter.

The 21-year-old has put in a number of exceptional performances for the French side this season, playing 43 times in all competitions forJorge Sampaoli’s outfit. Saliba was allowed to leave Arsenal on loan in the summer with a number of players ahead of him in the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. Early losers: Average Arsenal playing averagely However, his recent call-up to the France national team has seen rumours that he could return to the Arsenal first team next campaign. His future remains undecided though and, ahead of talks with Arsenal over his future, Saliba has given Marseille fans hope that he could be around again next season. “There is always a chance,” Saliba told Le Parisien. “I do not hide that I am very happy in Marseille. “I have developed, I have passed a milestone. If I make it into France’s squad it’s thanks to Marseille, because there is a lot of visibility. “They are a very big club with a lot of pressure, but when you’re good there are a lot of good things that happen to you. “We will see in May or June depending on the discussions. Today, my future, I don’t know what it is.” It is not the first time Saliba has commented on his future with the centre-back insisting in an interview with L’Equipeearlier this month that he doesn’t want to be sitting on the Gunners’ bench next season. Saliba said: “They are often in contact with my agent. They send me messages. They watch my matches. They tell me that we have to continue like this. “I haven’t played much with the Gunners. The coach has made his choices, that’s life. I left on loan, I put the matches together, and I became an international. What happened to me forged a tougher mind, it is not because you have cost €30m that you are playing.

412,https://www.football365.com/news/bent-disagrees-arsenal-fans-over-huge-arteta-future-call,Pundit ‘disagrees’ with ‘a lot of Arsenal fans’ over huge Mikel Arteta decision,"Darren Bent would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. The Spaniard’s time at the Emirates Stadium has been full of highs and lows with the Gunners winning the FA Cup in his first six months in charge. It was disappointing first full season in charge at Arsenal for Arteta as they finished eighth in the Premier League, missing out on qualification for Europe. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature However, six new signings last summer helped Arteta remould his squad for this season and they are now favourites to finish fourth and secure Champions League football for next term. Arsenal – who beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday – are currently two points ahead of Tottenham with four games left of the season, including a north London derby, which could go a long way to deciding who will finish fourth. Despite that, there are still a number of doubters among the Arsenal fanbase that Arteta is the right man to lead the club forward in the long term, but Bent thinks they should keep the faith. Bent said on talkSPORT: “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” Meanwhile, former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell claims that Nicolas Pepe, who has been linked with a move away from the club in recent weeks, doesn’t have a future at the Emirates Stadium. Campbell told Football Insider: “Arsenal paid over the odds for him. “It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him. “You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again. “I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.” ",positive

Having been frustrated in the first half, Jurgen Klopp’s side scored two quick goals within ten minutes of the restart to hand them a healthy advantage heading into the second leg. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Henry believes the Reds “weren’t showing a lot” beforePervis Estupinan got in the way of a Jordan Henderson cross and deflected the ball into his own net. “If you look at the game, I think a lucky goal bailed them out, for me,” said Henry. “I think they would have knocked on the door, if not all night. “It’s a lucky goal, the own goal of Villarreal is a lucky goal and I think, before that, they weren’t showing a lot. “But, along the way, I would say, when you are going for the quadruple, then you need to have that luck. And, after that, there is nothing about luck.” Meanwhile, the BT Sport pundits believe the tie is still just about alive. “Villarreal have just got a pulse,” Owen said. “If Liverpool nicked another one it would have been game, set and match.” “I think three would have killed it, that would have been too much for Villarreal to come back from,” Peter Crouch echoed. “Two is a possibility but it’s a slim, slim chance when you watch Liverpool in the form they’re in at the moment.” And Owen believes Klopp made a mistake in bringing Joe Gomez on for Trent Alexander-Arnold with then minutes to play as he felt Liverpool should have gone for the jugular. “I thought he made substitutions that almost didn’t promote going for an extra goal,” Owen said. “Joe Gomez for Trent for starters is much more defensive when your right-back is one of the most attacking players you’ve got on the pitch. “I thought maybe not that he was settling for two, but I thought he was comfortable and rested a couple of legs. “They’re going to have to go out there knowing that the game is still alive. It’s still got something in it. If they concede the first goal, it’s really alive. An extra goal tonight would have put it to bed.” ",positive

It was reported last month that Arsenal are among the Premier League teams interested in Gakpo. He is valued at around€40m by PSV. Liverpool ‘chaos’; Spurs awarded Arsenal’s transfer trophy The 22-year-old has been in fantastic form for the Dutch side this season. He has grabbed nine goals and 13 assists in the league from his 21 games. Gakpo made his senior debut for the Netherlands last year and he has now been capped four times. The winger is expected to leave PSV this summer. He has revealed that he wants to play in the Premier League: “The Premier League is a big league. Virgil van Dijk plays there with Liverpool so I like to watch them,” Gakpo told The Sun. “We are not the same kind of league but I think we try to look at the Premier League and learn about it. Everybody wants to play one time in the Premier League. I don’t favour one team but I like Arsenal a lot. “I looked up to Henry when I was younger because he was a tall guy who played on the wing.” Elsewhere,Unai Emery says “noise” is the big difference between managing Villarreal and his previous clubs, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain. “The budget is important to have the best players but there are things that you can overcome with hard work. You have to create something else as a team, create a mentality and look for the details in the preparation. “Against a team that is normally better, we will be dominated for seventy or eighty minutes but there will remain 15 or 20% of the match during which you will have chances and that is what we will work on. “I impose the same demands on myself here as in Seville, at PSG or Arsenal. What changes here is that there is less ‘noise’ outside! At the same time, the noise, if you go out, you will hear it. “If you don’t go out, you don’t hear it.

Man-child Jude Bellingham should dodge Premier League He received his first cap for the French national team last month, coming off the bench for 32 minutes against the Ivory Coast before playing the full 90 in a 5-0 win over South Africa.

He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive

That is how this works. Also: TOP SECRET DOSSIERS. Secret agent Definitions of the word ‘secret’ include the following: ‘A pieceofinformationthat is onlyknownby onepersonor a fewpeopleand should not be told toothers’ ‘Kepthiddenorseparatefrom theknowledgeof others’ ‘Containing information whose unauthorised disclosure could endanger national security’ Well someone get on the phone to MI5 because this Sun back page… Here is tomorrow's @SunSport back page: https://t.co/sPLEQAa9Cr pic.twitter.com/FayQBPcbVd — Sun Sport (@SunSport) March 21, 2022  …spawns this exclusive headline on their website: ‘Erik ten Hag now FAVOURITE to become Man Utd boss after secret dossier puts him ahead of Mauricio Pochettino in race’ By ‘secret dossier’, they literally just mean ‘exhaustive background checks’ and other such things a football club ordinarily undertakes when identifying and assessing managerial candidates. But why not make it sound like some masked spy has infiltrated Carrington and dropped some indiscriminate files labelled ‘TOP SECRET’ (quoting their PhotoShop job) on Ralf Rangnick’s desk?  Lesson the blow The Manchester Evening News seem to agree that Ten Hag is the Old Trafford choice. Real Madrid lost at the weekend, after all. So they are going all in on this bandwagon. We are promised ‘three lessons Man United and Erik ten Hag can take from Xavi’s Barcelona rebuild’. And as good as Xavi has been since his appointment, is following a five-month-old blueprint really the best approach? Maybe. Maybe not. The only way to find out is to check these three lessons. ‘Make use of youth’ is fair and ‘get the structure in place and everything else will follow’ is imperative. But the first – ‘let the manager sell whoever he wants’ – is questionable. Apparently ‘all the deadwood was cleared out’ when Xavi arrived at Barcelona. ‘It didn’t matter if the players were sold at a loss or just loaned out, they were taken out of the picture completely.’ Barcelona loaned out three players in January: Alex Collado,Philippe Coutinho andInaki Pena. Sergio Aguero also retired. They sold no-one, at a loss or otherwise. That doesn’t sound like a revolutionary clear out; it’s actually very similar to what Man United actually did in the winter. Barcelona even desperately and publicly tried and failed to get rid of Ousmane Dembele, kept him and are now playing him again.  Squad goals Man United not playing a game for well over a fortnight has not prevented them dominating the headlines, such as this creative offering from the Daily Mirror website: ‘Man Utd misery compounded as Gareth Southgate snubs show how players are viewed’ Do go on. ‘Manchester United’s poor season is reflected in Gareth Southgate’sEngland squadfor the upcoming friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.’ Not entirely sure we follow here. Please explain. ‘United have endured a mixed campaign underOle Gunnar Solskjaerand Ralf Rangnick and the club has just two players in the Three Lions squad. Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are the only United players to have made the cut, withMarcus Rashford,Jadon Sancho, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jesse Lingard and Dean Henderson among those to be left out.’ Right. Gotcha. They only have two players in the England squad and that is officially bad. ‘United’s demise was underlined by the fact that, following theupdate of the squadon Monday,Crystal Palacenow have more players in the England squad than Rangnick’s side. Full-back Tyrick Mitchell has been added to the squad, which also includes centre-back Marc Guehi and midfielder Conor Gallagher.’ Wow. That does sound pretty poor, Crystal Palace having more players in the England squad than Man United. That really ought to compound their misery. Of course, this is the same England squad that contains one Chelsea player, one Liverpool player and one Tottenham player. It turns out Man United having two representatives does not prove how sh*t they are.  Ferry Maguire Martin Samuel of the Daily Mail has his own hot takes from Gareth Southgate’s latest international selection: ‘Southgate picks on form, we know that. Rashford is not the first player to be excluded after a fall in standards and won’t be the last. Yet how is that consistent with Harry Maguire’s place in the team? He looks short of confidence, he is making mistakes, United are fragile with him at the heart of defence. Yet Maguire is a guaranteed selection.’ He started nine of England’s last 11 matches, helping keep six clean sheets in that time. He played every knockout minute of their run to the Euro 2020 final and every knockout minute of their run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals. It is possible to count the amount of bad games Maguire has had for England on one hand. And as manager of an England team that has proved incredibly capable of masking the centre-half’s flaws, it is no surprise that Southgate picked him. ‘Southgate may counter that Maguire hasn’t let England down but he makes that argument about Jordan Pickford, too, and it isn’t strictly true. Both Maguire, and Pickford, have made mistakes in an England shirt, and Maguire’s for Manchester United of late have been glaring.’ There is a reason Samuel does not list those ‘mistakes’: they are few and far between. Maguire and Pickford have generally been very good for England and to pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous for the sake of it.   Shake it off ‘Gary Neville and Roy Keane want Manchester United to appoint old Liverpool enemy as manager’ – Liverpool Echo. It is one thing to hold a grudge. It is another entirely to describe someone as an ‘enemy’ because they ’caused controversy by refusing to shakeJurgen Klopp’s hand’ a few months ago. How many sodding times do we have to do this?  Title fight ‘Man City and Chelsea might be about to hand Liverpool major title boost’ – Liverpool Echo. If they both get through to the Champions League semi-final and draw each other. And if John Aldridge is right that Manchester City then losing ‘would mess them up big time’. Start engraving Liverpool’s name on the trophy now.

420,https://www.football365.com/news/man-united-give-up-ideal-world-manager,Man Utd give up on ‘ideal world’ manager,"Manchester United have already given up hope of landing their first choice to replace Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. The United hierarchy are currently undertaking a “thorough process” to select their new manager, with multiple top level bosses linked with the role. READ MORE: Top ten most misleading results of the Premier League season Carlo Ancelotti and Ralph Hasenhuttl are rumoured to have been on their shortlist, while the uncertainty at Chelsea has led to speculation over Thomas Tuchel. ButSky Sports report that as “media talk not reality”and United expect Chelsea’s new owners to make keeping Tuchel their priority at Stamford Bridge. The board are said to have whittled down the names to four –Mauricio Pochettino, Erik ten Hag, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique. Multiple sources admit they would “be surprised ifPochettino or Ten Hag were not at the helm”. Pochettino is seen as ‘the concrete choice’ to rival the top Premier League sides given how well he performed against them on a tight budget at Tottenham. And the club have not been put off by his time at Paris Saint-Germain,‘where the problem has not been the manager as the successes of Carlo Ancelotti, Unai Emery and Tuchel after departing, have proven’. One source told Sky Sports that “in an ideal world, Julian Nagelsmann would walk into the club this summer.” But United have apparently accepted that he despite his desire to manage in the Premier League, he would not swap Bayern Munich until he could move to a ‘more stable option, primed to lift silverware’. He is said to be likely to wait until Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp leave Man City or Liverpool. United’s new permanent manager will be derived from the four-man shortlist unless “there is a massive change in circumstance and a top manager that fits the long-term direction suddenly becomes available.” They want a new manager in place ahead of the new season, but suggestions that a pre-agreement could be struck by the end of this month are “overly optimistic.” ",positive

The former Basel defender has been at Dortmund since the start of 2019. He joined them for just over £15m. Akanji has played over 150 times for the Bundesliga side over the past few years. He also shone for Switzerland at last summer’s European Championships. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football The centre-back is out of contract in 2023 and it is ‘almost impossible’ that he will stay at Dortmund beyond this season. This is according to German outlet Bild (via Sport Witness). Dortmund have already settled deals to signNiklas Sule and Nico Schlotterbeck. The report adds that Arsenal have ‘put our feelers’ for the 26-year-old. It is said that Juventus are also ‘in the running’ for his services. Bild have previously reported that Akanji ‘dreams’ of playing in the Premier League. Elsewhere, Gunners legend Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal for their treatment of their “extraordinary” defender William Saliba. Arsenal paid £27m to sign the centre-back from Saint-Etienne in 2019. He is yet to make his debut for the Gunners. After spells at Saint-Etienne and Nice, the 21-year-old joined Marseille on loan before this season. Saliba has been one of the standout players in Ligue 1 this term as he has played 49 times for Marseille across all competitions. Henry feels for Saliba as he was forced out on loan before making an error for Arsenal: “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” Henry told Amazon Prime. “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” ",negative
422,https://www.football365.com/news/rangnick-tries-nonsense-manchester-united-questions-false-reports-mediawatch?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Rangnick tries not to answer nonsense Man Utd questions after ‘completely false’ reports,"Ralf Rangnick kept trying to tell journalists that their questions did not make sense. He will be glad to escape the English press. Right to VOTE This story is so big that The Sun have broken out the DOUBLE capitals. ‘Ralf Rangnick will NOT recommend Harry Maguire to be Man Utd captain under Erik ten Hag and says stars should VOTE’ Let’s read the full story by Neil Custis to see exactly what Ralf Rangnick says because this seems unnecessarily personal about Harry Maguire and he is usually quite careful about what he says. ‘Asked if he would recommendMaguireto incoming bossErik Ten Hag, Rangnick said: “I understand your question but again it doesn’t make sense because we don’t know what kind of players will be here, what the group will look like.”‘ Ah. So he specifically said the question about recommending Maguire ‘doesn’t make sense’ and the extrapolation from this as he will ‘NOT’ recommend the current captain (who he never mentions by name), not that it’s actually an irrelevance? Seems absolutely fair and definitely not designed to tap into anti-Harry Maguire sentiments among Manchester United fans. As for VOTE being in capitals…is The Sun now so anti-democracy that even the word ‘VOTE’ is worthy of astonishment?  An ELECTION?This incredulousness at the idea of a vote stretches to the Mail, because of course it does… ‘Ralf Rangnick fuels debate over whether Harry Maguire should remain as Man United captain under Erik ten Hag by insisting skippers should be ELECTED by team-mates…with out-of-sorts defender set to miss rest of season with injury’ ELECTED? What is this foreign madness?  Captain, my captainOver at the Manchester Evening News, we are told that ‘Erik ten Hag already has a candidate to replace Harry Maguire as Manchester United captain’. Does he? Or is this a right load of speculative bollocks? You guessed right. ‘Maguire has failed with the armband, meaning speculation is already mounting about who could sport it next season. Will Ten Hag allow Maguire to keep it in the hope that he can rebuild his career, or hand it to somebody else? Only time will tell.’ But doesn’t he ‘already have a candidate’? It turns out that the ‘candidate’ is David De Gea, based purely on the grounds that a) he has been quite good and b) he has been quite honest about Manchester United being shit this season. Mediawatch is not quite sure that those are the criteria for a captain but we’re happy to be corrected if indeed Ten Hag ‘already has a candidate’. ‘However, whilst he seems like the most suited candidate to replace Maguire as United skipper, Ten Hag’s style of play could impact his chances, with some United fans already believing that Dean Henderson could get the nod between the sticks next season, purely because of Ajax’s interest in him a few months ago and Ten Hag’s vision. It is a difficult one for Ten Hag to weigh up, but it is a decision he cannot afford to get wrong. ‘In the grand scheme of things, deciding on who sports the armband might seem irrelevant when considering what changes need to happen at Old Trafford this summer, but it is a decision that could go an awfully long way in instilling a winning mentality. Ten Hag cannot get it wrong.’ Anybody get the idea that it’s a decision he can’t get wrong? Which is odd because Mediawatch is pretty sure that Ten Hag will place the question of the Manchester United captaincy around 14th on his list of priorities. It’s really only in England that we are bizarrely obsessed with a piece of cloth on the arm of a man who points.  Oust of the redAs usual, the Mirror take it too far… ‘Ralf Rangnick explains how Harry Maguire could be ousted as Man Utd captain’ He really sodding doesn’t; he just explains the system he used in Germany. Please don’t make us feel sorry for Harry Maguire.   Stop making senseGoing back to that original quote from Ralf Rangnick when he says the question ‘doesn’t make sense’…it turns out that this is a theme. And the theme of The Sun – among others – pressing ahead with their narrative continues. The headline: ‘Ralf Rangnick admits Man Utd would be better off finishing EIGHTH and missing European football ahead of Ten Hag rebuild’ What he actually said: “It could be an advantage but that does not mean we will give away any of the remaining four games. For us it’s clear and our obligation. “This is our job, my job, the job of the players that we try to get the best possible results and then see at the end of the season in which position we will finish. “Now to speak about if that would be an advantage or not does not make sense because if I did that then this would be interpreted again.” Too late, Ralf. Too bloody late.  False narrativeIt’s little wonder that Ralf Rangnick is a little wary of the English press, having woken up on Sunday to the news that he ‘will present incoming bossErik ten Hagwith a shocking dossier of shame on every first teamManchester Unitedplayer’. Steve Bates – in a Sunday People exclusive – wrote that ‘Rangnick, 63, has told them he won’t hold back after believing he’s been let down and hung out to dry by a dressing room he’s privately branded “selfish, over-inflated, lacking quality and too powerful”. Senior sources inside United’s Carrington training ground say Rangnick has been staggered by the lack of professionalism amongst the first-team squad.’ In hindsight, alarm bells should have rung at the words ‘a brutal “no holes barred”rundown’. Pro tip: Don’t Google that at work. Rangnick’s response to that story on Wednesday: “This is completely false, completely untrue. The board has never asked me to prepare a dossier, neither for the board nor for Erik. “I also never said anything to nobody criticising the attitude of the players as being unprofessional or selfish. This is not true, I will always protect my players. I have never realised any issues of them being unprofessional or selfish.” Pretty unequivocal. So how are the Mirror reporting this story on their website – keeping in mind that the Bates story is run under the Mirror banner online because they are sister newspapers. ‘Ralf Rangnick has issued a strong defence of his Manchester United players after accusations of them being “selfish and unprofessional”. ‘The interim boss responded in the wake of criticism aimed at Man United’s underachieving stars after succumbing to a 3-1 defeat against Arsenal, just days after their 4-0 humbling at the hands of Liverpool. ‘Mirror Football exclusively revealed Rangnick hadput together a dossier of details about his squad to hand to Erik ten Hag, where members were apparently labelled “unprofessional and selfish”. But the German has launched an impassioned defence to shield his players, while admitting that results should be better.’ Ladies and gentlemen, we have a contender for an Olympic gold in gymnastics. Isn’t it odd how the quotes about the story being ‘completely false’ and ‘completely untrue’ are missing? Presumably a simple copy-and-paste error that will soon be rectified. ",positive

Ten Hag was confirmed last week as the new permanent Red Devils boss and will take over at the end of the season on a deal until June 2025, with the option of another year. The signings of Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho were meant to take Man Utd to another level this season but instead the club has gone backwards. Gossip: Man Utd to offer pair in part-ex for Barca midfielder The Red Devils are currently sixth in the Premier League table and look very likely to miss out on Champions League qualification with fourth-placed Arsenal now six points ahead of them. Ten Hag has a big job to unite the dressing room in the summer with Paul Scholes revealing Jesse Lingard had told him that it was a “disaster”. And now the Daily Mirror claims that the current Ajax boss ‘will hold one-on-one meetings’ with his Man Utd players ‘to get a head-start on the major overhaul he faces’. They will be held over Zoom and Ten Hag ‘will use the interviews to give him an idea of who is best suited to captain his side, with current skipper Harry Maguire not certain to keep the armband’. A Man Utd source told the Daily Mirror: “Erik is meticulous in his planning. He wants to know where everyone’s at with their mentality and situation at the club and has said he wants to discuss their futures regarding who wants to stay and who wants to go. “He wants to give everyone a chance to discuss any issues or problems in private, before he arrives, so he can get a head-start on the summer.'” Meanwhile, Man Utd defender Diogo Dalot admits that it will now be “really difficult” for the Red Devils to qualify for the Champions League. “It is difficult for us to accept as this club belongs in the Champions League,” Dalot told MUTV. “All I want to say is that if it is still mathematically possible then I will believe to the end. Obviously it is going to be really difficult and we need to be realistic, everybody can see that in football things can happen until the end.” ",negative

The England international has been the subject of widespread criticism and scrutiny this season after putting in a number of poor performances for the Red Devils. Police are now investigating after the Man Utd captain received a bomb threat on Wednesday with the Cheshire Constabulary conducting a sweep of his home. Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man Utd, Merseyside derby, Eriksen A spokesperson for Maguire said: “In the last 24 hours, Harry has received a serious threat to his family home. “He has reported this to the police who are now looking into the matter. The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry’s number one priority. “He will continue to prepare for this weekend’s fixture as normal and we will not be commenting in any further detail at this time.” Fortunately no devices were found during the sweep of his home but The Sun claims that ‘the threat was deemed so serious police returned yesterday with a sniffer dog to make a second sweep of the grounds and surrounding area’. A source close to Maguire told The Sun: “Harry will not be forced out of Manchester United by this kind of threat. “His number one priority will always be the safety of his family but he’s also got the strength of character to deal with this. It looks like the work of some cowardly fan. “If that proves to be the case, they are an utter disgrace to the name of this proud football club.” Meanwhile, former Man Utd midfielder Roy Keane insists he feels “sorry” for Maguire after being given the captaincy too early. “I feel sorry for Maguire,” Keane told LadBible. “If you go into a big club, it’s like, imagine if when I came to Man United when I was 20 or 21, quite young, and they went, Oh, you’re the captain. “I’d be thinking ‘That doesn’t say much about the rest of the group!’ Surely someone has got to be at the club a number of years to be captain. “(Who should be captain) atUnitednow? The fact we’ve got to discuss it or think about it is not good. It’s not good. “Well, it’s not good that Maguire’s got it because he was only new to the club himself a couple of years ago. “He was still getting used to (the club) and then all of a sudden he’s got that extra responsibility when he was trying to find his feet.” ",positive
425,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-uefa-gazprom-russia-ukraine-champions-league-abramovich-chelsea,UEFA must act now that Russia has done the same in Ukraine,"Russia has spent a lot of money on clubs and UEFA for more than a decade, but what happens now they’re at the point of war in Ukraine? As Kai Havertz’s header hit the back of the net for Chelsea’s first goal against Lille at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League, it was visible for all to see. Behind the goal, an electronic hoarding was shilling for Gazprom, a tournament sponsor for the last ten years, but now also a key player in a conflict, the likes of which European hasn’t seen in decades. At a time when the deaths of tens – perhaps hundreds – of thousands of people seem most dreadfully inevitable, perhaps the economics of elite-level football aren’t the most important thing. But to pursue with this line of thought would be misguided. Firstly, while elite-level professional football might not be the most important consideration at this time, it remains a multi-billion pound business. Football matters because it matters. And secondly, football is political – to claim otherwise is fundamentally disingenuous. Gazprom have not spent a decade sponsoring the Champions League because they need to raise their own brand awareness to sell more product, much as supporters have long enjoyed joking about craving a glass of Gazprom upon seeing their commercials. They are, of course, suppliers of natural gas, majority-owned by the Russian Federation itself. Russia has the largest natural gas reserves on the planet, and the gas and oil controlled by Gazprom accounts for around 40% of Russia’s annual budget. In what is a surprise to absolutely no one, plenty of Gazprom promotion so far on the advertising boards — FootballJOE (@FootballJOE) February 23, 2022  Many eastern European countries are highly dependent on natural gas from Gazprom, but Germany is their biggest client. Getting it to them requires passing it along pipelines through Ukraine, who was charging them to do so. The Nord Stream pipeline was built under the Baltic Sea to provide this gas without going through Ukraine, but this proved controversial from the outset. The German chancellor who waved it through, Gerhard Schroeder, became embroiled in a corruption scandal when it emerged that a secret €1m loan guarantee had been made to help to get it built. When Schroeder was voted out of office in 2005, he accepted a position overseeing the Nord Stream construction and was sharply criticised. He was elected onto the board of Gazprom earlier this month. In 2006, Gazprom signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with the financially troubled Schalke 04, who are based in Gelsenkirchen, in the middle of Germany’s energy industry. They also bought into Zenit St Petersburg in 2007, a club that has regularly been used as a PR tool since. When the shirt sponsorship deal with Schalke was announced, it was done so prior to a friendly match between Schalke and Zenit.  Gazprom also signed a similar sponsorship deal with another big European club in financial trouble, Red Star Belgrade, in 2011. Belgrade just happened to be very close to another gas pipeline, the South Stream. Advertisements for Nord Stream 2 – the second pipeline, approval for which was this week halted by the German government – appeared pitchside at Schalke, and their Champions League match in Basel in 2013 was even targeted by Greenpeace protesters. By this time, both Gazprom were also sponsoring Chelsea and UEFA. The 2018 World Cup, of course, was won by Russia at the same time that Qatar snatched the 2022 edition. This is, of course, how sportswashing works. Sponsorship money buying influence and credibility, quietening critics and giving a veneer to questionable, state-sponsored programmes, and football has gone in deep with it. Much has been made of the fact that this year’s Champions League final is being held in St Petersburg because it will likely have to be moved elsewhere, but this probably isn’t the biggest issue facing UEFA at present. If all that sponsorship money ends, it will leave a hole in the finances of European club football. The escalation of events creates many pressing problems for the game’s governing bodies. There are no Russian or Ukrainian clubs still playing in the Champions League or Europa Conference League, but two Russian clubs do remain in the Europa League: CSKA Moscow are already through to the round of 16 and Zenit have a play-off second leg due against Real Betis. Should they stay in the competition? Could the safety of players, staff and travelling supporters be guaranteed should they progress? Might the behaviour of the Russian government even justify excommunicating all Russian teams from international sport for the foreseeable future? And then there are those English clubs with connections to Russia. In parliament, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge questioned the Prime Minister over why more people had not been targeted, asking why most of those on what is known as ‘Navalny’s list’ – a list of 35 individuals compiled by the foundation of Russian opposition figurehead Alexei Navalny – were not included. It includes Roman Abramovich. Roman Abramovich – described as having a ""father and son"" relationship with Vladimir Putin – has amassed a British property empire worth £200 million. Not a penny of that is being touched by Boris Johnson's announced sanctions. — Ash Sarkar (@AyoCaesar) February 22, 2022  The Prime Minister responded by saying the UK can “certainly target members of the Duma [the Russian parliament],” adding that “Abramovich is already facing sanctions”. Labour MP Chris Bryant responded to this by saying: “The Prime Minister said that Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned. As I understand it, that is not true.” He then called upon Johnson to correct this record. While Abramovich does not appear on the official list of individuals being sanctioned, he was denied a visa following the Salisbury poisoning incident in 2018. Chelsea owe £1.5bn to Abramovich, but this isn’t as calamitous as it immediately sounds. He has been open to the sale of the club and has been since 2018. An investment bank was reported to have valued the club at £1.9bn then, yet Abramovich rejected an offer from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, for £2bn. Abramovich has also continued to put money into Chelsea – £19.9 million of interest-free loans in the financial year to June 2021 – despite having been a near-absentee landlord for some time because of his visa issues, so belts may have to be tightened. The same could come to pass on Merseyside, where Everton, through Alisher Usmanov, may have a similarly anxious time. Usmanov doesn’t have a shareholding in Everton, but he does have a £30 million first-refusal agreement in place for the naming rights at the new Bramley-Moor Dock stadium and sponsors the club’s training complex. He’s also on the list. Questions don’t apply solely to club sides, either, of course. The Russia national football team is due to be playing two home games in five days at the end of March, the first of which is a World Cup play-off against Poland. The Polish FA is already ‘seeking clarification’ over this fixture. Ukraine play Scotland in another play-off at the same time. Who’s guaranteeing safety at this match? This may sound a little bit like hyperbole, but five years ago the people of Salisbury probably wouldn’t have imagined that their city would the subject of a nerve agent attack, either. It’s difficult to say at the moment where all this ends up. It has felt for no small while as though few people have fully understood the seriousness of the situation in Ukraine and the ramifications of where all this aggression may leave us. But that’s for the future; for now, football is going to have to take action. Playing this season’s Champions League final in St Petersburg quite clearly cannot happen. Counter-intuitive it may be to say, but Johnson is right when he says there is (or at least should be) “no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries”.It’s difficult to see how Zenit and CSKA will be able to continue in the Europa League if things escalate much further. What happens with these scheduled World Cup qualifiers is anybody’s guess. And football needs to start to understand that UEFA are tied in because of their relationship with Gazprom – football’s ethical compass has been fundamentally corrupted by decades of an insatiable desire for money.

David Moyes’ side were left to rue defensive errors which allowed Frankfurt to take the lead inside the opening minute at the London Stadium through Ansgar Knauff’s header. West Ham have a lot of work to do, as Eintracht Frankfurt win with class The Hammers were able to draw level inside the first half, with Michail Antonio bundling the ball over the line for his first goal since March 2. However it was not enough for the London club on the night and Frankfurt were able to retake the lead in the second half, with Daichi Kamada slotting the ball past Alphonse Areola. Frankfurt had looked an enticing prospect for the Hammers, currently ninth in the Bundesliga, but they started the game full of confidence having knocked European giants Barcelona out in the quarter-finals. Inside the first minute, Frankfurt stunned West Ham to take the lead. The ball was played in from the left to Almamy Toure on the edge of the box and his lofted pass found Knauff who headed home. The home side tried to get back into it with a lofted cross towards Tomas Soucek, but it was just over the towering midfielder. Frankfurt lead after the first leg. But there's still plenty to play for in Germany. #UEL | #WHUSGE pic.twitter.com/WvyCSl7hFv — West Ham United (@WestHam) April 28, 2022 West Ham had an ideal chance to level the tie in the 13th minute when Jarrod Bowen drove through the Frankfurt defence but his final shot was tipped onto the woodwork by goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However the Hammers only had to wait until the 22nd minute to find the equaliser. Manuel Lanzini stepped up to take a free-kick and lofted it into the area, with Kurt Zouma flicking the ball back across goal for Antonio to bundle it over the line. In the 39th minute, West Ham found themselves exposed at the back as Knauff was played through with a ball that carved open the home side’s defence. The striker’s touch was poor and he rounded the keeper but ended up firing over the bar. The second half started in the same fashion as the first half ended, with West Ham having a chance when Antonio picked out Soucek, but the Czech international mistimed his volley, hitting it into the ground then wide of the target. Frankfurt retook the lead as West Ham yet again left themselves open at the back.  Kamada had the final touch after Craig Dawson stepped out of position to allow a ball from Jesper Lindstrom to get through the West Ham backline. Areola was equal to Djibril Sow’s attempt, but Kamada was able to tap home from the rebound. Minutes after coming on Said Benrahma almost levelled the tie with a clever strike from outside the area, but his deflected shot looped narrowly over the goal. West Ham tried to push for an equaliser but struggled to break through the German side’s defence and it was Frankfurt who almost wrapped it up in the 79th minute when Kamada’s deflected effort hit the woodwork. In added time, the Hammers had a final chance to level the tie with Bowen’s attempted overhead kick but despite a good connection his effort rebounded off the crossbar.  ",positive

Goals from Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen secured a memorable 3-0 away victory over Lyon and a 4-1 aggregate success, taking the Europa League debutants into the last four. Hammers make their mark in an extraordinary European week Moyes’ side were big underdogs heading to the city overlooked by the French Alps following last week’s 1-1 first-leg draw at the London Stadium. But it was hosts Lyon who were left with a mountain to climb after two goals in seven minutes at the end of the first half from Dawson and Rice put West Ham in control. When Bowen made it 3-0, Lyon heads dropped as the price of flights to Frankfurt rocketed – Eintracht Frankfurt having shocked Barcelona to reach the last four and book a meeting with the Hammers. “I’m extremely proud of how they performed,” said Moyes, who had to save West Ham from relegation less than two years ago. “It’s a great achievement for West Ham to reach a European semi-final and we are thrilled by it. It’s difficult to get the words for it. “We don’t get the trophy tonight so we won’t be jumping around. But we have come a long way in a short period and I’m extremely proud. “Lyon played really well for 25 minutes and delivered some great crosses which we didn’t defend well. This aged well😂👍 https://t.co/oYNOAE4DzK — Declan Rice (@_DeclanRice) April 14, 2022 “But we showed resilience and stayed in the game. We are still learning how to be better with the ball, but we knew we had power up front and we could hurt them. “We’re not favourites to win the tournament, but I want the players to think they are. Tonight was a great squad ethic and performance.” West Ham, without half of their usual back four due to Kurt Zouma’s injury and Aaron Cresswell’s suspension, got off to a nervy start when Cameroon forward Karl Toko Ekambi smacked a shot against the foot of Alphonse Areola’s near post. Yet they were able to gradually take Lyon’s sting out of the game, and it was centre-half Dawson, the £2million signing from Watford who has become something of a cult figure during West Ham’s European adventure, who enhanced his reputation further with a crashing near-post header in the 38th minute. The Hammers went 2-0 ahead moments before half-time when a poor clearing header from Emerson fell to Rice 20 yards out. The England midfielder’s shot was low and skidding, and goalkeeper Julian Pollersbeck was beaten by the bounce and a slight deflection off the toe of defender Castello Lukeba. Bowen, West Ham’s goalscorer in the first leg, fired them into dreamland three minutes into the second half with a precise finish, allowing Moyes’ side to see out the remainder of the match in an uncharacteristically calm fashion. Lyon’s angry fans attempted to storm through anti-riot barriers at full-time while Hammers supporters, high up at the vast Groupama Stadium, celebrated deliriously. Midfielder Pablo Fornals said: “As you can imagine, I don’t know where I am. Everyone in the dressing room is the same, the feeling is unbelievable. I’m really, really, really happy. “It was an unbelievable moment for everyone. The dressing room was like a big party. But this is how we have been playing as a team, as a family, everyone running for each other.” Spaniard Fornals, who misses out on a semi-final trip to Barca in his homeland, added: “Everyone in the semi-finals deserves it. I don’t really care who we are against, as long as we are all together. “We have big chances to play against every team. Everything can happen in Europe.”  ",positive

After an astonishing quartet of Champions League quarter-final second legs – in which the dullest game on offer was a 3-3 draw – came a Thursday night of absolute nonsense. Leicester had already done their bit in the Conference before West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt and the Europa League proper took centre stage. For West Ham, a quite dizzyingly perfect evening that frankly defies description. Lyon, after an enterprising first 15 minutes, were abysmal but that owed much to the Hammers’ lack of panic in those early moments and gradual but irrevocable seizing of control. In the end, 3-0 did not flatter the visitors who have spent this whole Europa League campaign looking far more seasoned than the European novices they are. They have arguably been the tournament’s standout side from day one and only Frankfurt’s own antics stop this being the tournament’s standout performance. Some commentators were wondering whether missing out on a trip to Barcelona would take the edge off this success. That is to miss the point of what West Ham should be – and are – thinking about here. This is not about a day out against the mighty Barcelona. This is about a chance to do something extraordinary. Something that, with all due respect to Eintracht Frankfurt, just got a whole lot likelier thanks to a pair of astonishing away performances. On the back of this result, West Ham have a truly spectacular chance to win the Europa League. Think what that means. A first trophy for 42 years, for one thing. A second European title, taking them level with Arsenal. A place in next season’s Champions League; if you’re looking for a spurious ‘downer’ on a night as memorable as this one for West Ham then maybe it’s that the current rules mean that elevation to the top table would not come at the expense of the Premier League’s fourth-place finishers which is quite likely to be Spurs. West Ham themselves were firmly in that race until the last few weeks, and in truth it is really the rigours of Thursday-Sunday football that has knocked them out of it as much as anything else. Especially as neither Spurs post-Christmas nor Arsenal at all faced the same burden. In the first half of the season, David Moyes and his team did remarkably well to balance the twin demands of European and domestic football, especially given last season’s league form already represented overachievement and the squad’s general lack of experience at juggling the demands of multiple competitions. Now, though, there is no balance to strike. It’s not just that winning the Europa League constitutes a more glorious, romantic and thrilling passage to Champions League qualification than finishing fourth; it’s that any sober judgement must now constitute it represents by far the most likely way of getting there. Eintracht Frankfurt – by coincidence the team West Ham met in their last European semi-final back in 1976 – are not to be underestimated or written off, but there is no point pretending it is as daunting a prospect as facing even this fallen Barcelona. Get through that and it’s a final against either RB Leipzig or Rangers. It truly is an outstanding opportunity. And this was an outstanding performance. All over the pitch, the Hammers were excellent. Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice were perhaps the standouts as they so often are, but the bargain of bargains Craig Dawson would not be far behind, nor the Czech pair of Tomas Soucek and Vladimir Coufal (players whose previous European experience is perhaps more significant than we realise) and nor would Michail Antonio whose hold-up play was exemplary. This joyous 3-0 romp was also built on the foundations of last week’s hard-earned 1-1 draw on a night when West Ham played the whole second half a man short after Aaron Cresswell’s harsh sending off. They could have lost this tie then. They didn’t, and have now reaped the benefits in spectacular style. It also marks an astonishing night for the Premier League. Two fine away performances from Leicester and the Hammers raise the very real prospect of eight different English clubs reaching European finals in the space of four seasons. That in itself is a feat very nearly as astonishing as tonight’s results in Barcelona and Lyon. ",positive

The visitors had some good fortune early on as Braga hit the post and had a goal ruled out by VAR. Abel Ruiz’s 40th minute goal proved to be the winner though. Rangers now need some inspiration if they are going to earn a last-four spot in the Europa League. Celtic and Rangers unite in anger at Old Firm ‘friendly’ jaunt After three losses in their last four outings, Giovanni Van Bronckhorst’s side are not in the best of form but will go into the second leg in Govan next Thursday, following the final pre-split fixture against St Mirren on Sunday, knowing they need a step up in quality. The Gers boss came under fire from some of his own fans following the Celtic defeat and he made three changes to the side which started against their city rivals. In came midfielders Scott Arfield and Glen Kamara and attacker Fashion Sakala with Aaron Ramsey, Joe Aribo and Kemar Roofe dropping to the bench. The visitors were cheered by a huge travelling support who lit flares before the game as the teams came out and the Ibrox side showed some early intent. In the fourth minute Braga keeper Matheus had to race out to thwart attacker Ryan Kent who had raced on to an Arfield pass, with Sakala shooting from the loose ball which deflected away from goal. It looked like a challenge between two evenly-matched teams but Rangers’ 40-year-old goalkeeper Allan McGregor, making his 100th appearance in Europe for the Govan club, saw little early action until the 25th minute when Ricardo Horta’s shot from 16 yards beat him only to rebound off the post with the Gers escaping and more good luck was just around the corner. In the 26th minute Andre Horta’s deflected shot from 16 yards found the net to the delight of the home fans but Italian referee Davide Massa looked at VAR and chalked it off for a Fabiano foul on Rangers midfielder Ryan Jack in the build-up. The Ibrox side’s threat had slowly subsided but Sakala had a decent chance in the 33rd minute from a break but after making himself a yard of space inside the Braga box he blasted the ball high over the bar. It looked like Rangers would reach the interval intact but their luck ran out when Ruiz took a pass from Iuri Medeiros and guided a shot low past McGregor from inside the box. The absence of injured Colombia striker Alfredo Morelos was glaring and Rangers needed to find something special but there seemed no spark to the start of the second half. Braga were as guilty of occasional lapses as Rangers but their lead looked safe enough and Van Bronckhorst acted on the hour, bringing on Borna Barisic, Roofe and Aribo for Leon Balogun, Jack and Sakala. In the 71st minute Gers centre-back Connor Goldson missed the target with a header from a James Tavernier corner and the unconvincing finish was typical of the Light Blues’ performance. Moments later, McGregor pushed a long-range effort from Andre Horta past the post for a corner which was defended. There was little more goalmouth action at either end and with only a one-goal deficit to overcome the incentive is there for an improved Rangers performance at Ibrox. ",positive

Anthony Elanga came off the bench to earn a draw away in Madrid on Wednesday night after Joao Felix had given the hosts the lead. F365 says: Manchester United eventually rise to the Atletico challenge It was a decent result for United, who will now fancy their chances of progression with the second leg at Old Trafford to come. Rangnick said he was “very disappointed” with his side’s first half display in particular, but Scholes believes didn’t think it was out of the ordinary as United have been “very lucky” in general under the German manager’s watch. “When you say strange performance, I don’t think it is a strange… it is a typical Man Utd performance these days, since November when this manager came in,” he said on BT Sport. “It’s been very much the same, they have been very lucky to get through games and win games but you have to say his record is very good. I think his substitutes as well, on Sunday he made a big call bringing Fred on [and] Fred scores the winner. “Tonight he has made a big call, we were all looking thinking “these subs look a little bit strange” and then Elanga comes on and scores a goal. So it is not strange for me, it is just a typical Man Utd performance tonight.” On the performance, Rangnick told BT Sport:“I don’t know if I rescued it but after the performance in the first half, it could only get better. What we played in the first half I still cannot believe. We played without conviction, without aggression and that is why we were struggling. “Second half we did better, more possession in areas that mattered and if we played another 10 minutes we might have won the game. We have to play better in the first half, I was very disappointed by that performance in the first half. “Against and with the ball we were far too apprehensive and did not take any risks. We only played it in our own half and then it is difficult against a team like Atletico. Their goal was difficult to defend, a brilliant cross and finish. We have to play with more conviction on the ball, we need more deep runs and the way we scored the goal was exactly that. This is how we have to play against them.” ",positive
432,https://www.football365.com/news/barcelona-look-worryingly-at-home-in-the-europa-league,Barcelona look worryingly at home in the Europa League,"Barcelona playing in the Europa League feels against the natural order of things, but by the end of a 1-1 draw with Napoli they looked every inch a second-tier side. Barcelona on a Thursday night, slugging it out with Napoli to try and reach a Europa League last-16 stage that already has West Ham in it by right. All feels a bit wrong, doesn’t it? Confusing and discombobulating. There’s a strange dreamlike quality to it; all the individual elements make sense, but they’re all just slightly out of context. And that sensation is only heightened by Barcelona having a familiarly unfamiliar starting front three of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang flanked by Adama Traore and Ferran Torres. The whole confusing mess is very Barcelona in 2022, a club where Luuk De Jong offers more in a 20-minute cameo from the bench than Frenkie De Jong had all night and in which their own player Ousmane Dembele has his every touch booed. And the match itself was a curious one as well, one which Barcelona largely dominated but didn’t really deserve to win and were quite lucky to draw via a marginal penalty awarded after a VAR intervention. That penalty was converted by Torres, who otherwise endured a nightmare evening as his struggles since returning to Spain continue. He missed four hugely presentable chances in the first half in varyingly embarrassing fashions, the worst of which after being sent clear by a clearly now much happier Aubameyang compounded by being instantly followed by Napoli’s breakaway opening goal. It was a bad goal all round for Barca, who switched off after Torres’ miss while Pedri clearly saw and then inexplicably failed to track the run of goalscorer Piotr Zielinski before Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved the Poland midfielder’s first shot but only managed to bounce it straight back to him for another go. Traore had his moments too and had clearly been the subject of much of a well-drilled and well-organised Napoli side’s preparation for this one. He rarely found himself with fewer than two minders during his 65 minutes on the pitch, and it’s an indictment of this iteration of Barcelona that they don’t have enough quality elsewhere to take advantage of the inevitable spaces created elsewhere. Aubameyang looked far closer to the player we all know than the empty husk of a man who has been going through the motions at the Emirates this season, but Torres was a desperate disappointment despite his goal. Even after the penalty he still spurned a further chance later on to win the game as Napoli hunkered down to take a draw back to Italy for the second leg. Barca weren’t terrible here by any stretch and may well go through in the return leg. But that in itself sort of sums up where they are. It might be acceptable for most clubs to be probably just about the fourth best team in Spain and in with a reasonable chance of reaching the last 16 of the Europa League but it won’t be tolerated for long here, and the atmosphere was a testy one throughout. Xavi, so central to so much that makes Barca’s current plight all the more striking, will get a longer rope than most but patience is not inexhaustible even for a club legend like him. They are what they are and that is an okayish side that lacks a bit of inspiration. That there is quite clearly a role for a journeyman like Luuk De Jong in this Barcelona squad despite the January upgrades is really quite damning. Being in the Europa League is one thing, but the real worry for Barcelona should be that for all the initial strangeness of seeing that incongruous Europa logo on those shirts and around that stadium, by the end of the night it all made perfect sense. Right now, this is precisely where they belong. ",positive
433,https://www.football365.com/news/warnock-sht-chelsea-lucky-not-azpilicueta,"Warnock’s talking sh*t – Chelsea are ‘lucky’, not Azpilicueta","Neil Warnock says Cesar Azpilicueta is “very fortunate” to have won it all at Chelsea as he’s “not a great defender”. What a load of hokum. Cesar Azpilicueta is Chelsea’s longest-serving player. Arriving in the same window as Eden Hazard, he’s been at Stamford Bridge for nine-and-a-half years. That alone, given it’s Chelsea, is an impressive feat. Only three other players – Andreas Christensen, N’Golo Kante and Marcos Alonso – have survived longer than five years. Signed by Roberto Di Matteo, Azpilicueta has seen six further managers come and go and over £1billion spent on new players, including £150m on full-backs. He’s made 459 appearances, nearly 200 of those as captain, and now – having lifted both the Champions League and Club World Cup trophies in the last nine months – has won every major honour available to him. In many ways, yes, he is “very fortunate”, just not in the way Neil Warnock claims. “I think Azpilicueta has been a very fortunate lad to be at a club like Chelsea. I don’t think he is a great defender.Sometimes in football you need a bit of luck and I think he’s had a bit of luck at the right time and in the right place.That’s what you need in football, you need a bit of luck to be successful.” Most footballers do need a bit of luck to break through, whether it’s being coached by the right people, scouted by the right club or finding good representation, but that’s not the fortune Warnock is claiming; he believes Apilicueta has somehow stumbled his way through nearly a decade at one of the most successful clubs in Europe, beguiling some of the best coaches in the world into thinking he’s good at football. Having got to Chelsea, the only way Azpilicueta can be considered ‘lucky’ is in the same way aretiree may consider themselves lucky as they look out into the garden they earned, from the holiday home they earned, bought with money made through hard work and talent. If there is a lucky party in all this, it’s Chelsea. Some have (at times) doubted whether Cesar Azpilicueta was the right man to captain Chelsea, largely because he does it differently to John Terry. But this is one of the truest examples of leadership. He took so much pressure off Havertz in a huge moment.pic.twitter.com/V0BrFbuQ1a — Adam Newson (@AdamNewson) February 13, 2022 At £7m from Marseille, he’s arguably the club’s greatest ever signing. With his sneaky penalty tactic to reduce pressure on Kai Havertz as the most recent example of many, he’s arguably the club’s greatest ever captain. In and out of the team under Frank Lampard, Azpilicueta has been a near ever-present under Thomas Tuchel. “He’s a huge, huge factor; a key factor and a key player for me at this club.He, for me, expresses everything that I think is typical for Chelsea: He’s a fighter, he’s a team player, he does not accept limits, he’s always available, a top, top professional and at the same time a very nice guy.It’s deep within him to be a team player, he’s very self-aware, very self-reflective and it’s a pure pleasure to have him in the group.” It’s glowing praise from Tuchel, and meant as such, but the language he uses can augment the trope that Azpilicueta is some sort of mind set consultant, an imposter in the team purely to gee up his more talented teammates. “A fighter”, “a team player”: descriptions not typically used for the most skilful players. In fact, often the reverse is true. Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe aren’t particularly cohesive footballers, but that doesn’t mean antithetical characters like Azpilicueta should bedenigrated by comparison. The Chelsea captain’s grit, determination and obsession with winning are perhaps his greatest strengths, but for some reason – maybe because those assets aren’t as quantifiable as goals, assists or mazy dribbles – they’re seen as evidence of a footballer who is less worthy of success. You need someone like him in your teamis another typical phrase, which again suggests they wouldn’t be in the team on sheer footballing talent alone, that it’s their mentality that earns them their spot. That’s not a bad thing necessarily, but there’s this odd perception that if your mentality is your strongest suit, that you’re in some way stealing a living in football. And the possibility that your second strongest suit – one-on-one defending in Azpilicueta’s case – is outstanding and the best in your team, is for some reason ignored, with harping on about mentality the easy, lazy recourse. James Milner has been tarred with a similar brush, and like Azpilicueta, also suffers because of his versatility, which continues to mar reputations. Azpilicueta was the first-choice left-back in the title-winning campaign under Jose Mourinho, moved to centre-back to win it under Antonio Conte, captained the side from right-back to win the Europa League under Maurizio Sarri, and played at centre-back, right-back and right wing-back on the way to lifting the Champions League trophy with Thomas Tuchel last season. That is extraordinary brilliance, and should be acknowledged as such. Chelsea may have won all of these trophies without Azpilicueta, butthey would rather be with him than against him(another backhanded compliment). Yes, because of his mentality, but also because he’s an outstandingly talented defender and footballer. Azpilicueta is not the sort to rise to such guff from Warnock, but were he to respond like one of the two managers under whom he’s won the Premier League, he would require all eight of his fingers to illustrate his trophy haul while demanding “respect, respect, respect”.

Apparently, we can add Armando Broja’s name to the list of players Mikel Arteta is keen to sign. Football London reckons the 20-year-old is high on Arsenal’s wishlist after a fine breakthrough season at Southampton, where he has bagged eight goals in all competitions. Of course, Broja is on loan at St Mary’s from Chelsea, who may have plans of their own for Broja. Which almost certainly don’t involve selling him to a London rival for anything less than silly money. In the meantime, Arteta is said to be lining up in training with Gabriel Martinelli as a No.9 while the manager waits for another opportunity to strengthen his frontline. F365 Says: Wilshere Arsenal contract an easy Arteta win  BLUES PRIORITISE KOUNDE DEAL With Broja’s return, Chelsea can focus on strengthening other areas, with the centre of their defence and midfield more of a priority for the Blues. The Telegraph says the signing of Jules Kounde is their primary aim for the summer. Chelsea tried to recruit the Sevilla centre-back last year but no deal could be reached with the Spanish club. That hasn’t deterred them, and the Club World Cup winners will go back for the 23-year-old before the start of next season. The report also states that alongside Kounde, the Blues are keen on both Declan Rice and Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni.  LIVERPOOL JOIN ZANIOLO RACE In news which seems very convenient for Nicolo Zaniolo’s agent, Liverpool are reported to have joined the list of the suitors keen to take 22-year-old. Zaniolo is approaching renewal time at Roma, with his representatives due to speak with the club imminently over an extension to his terms that are currently due to expire in 2024. Ahead of those talks, Calciomercato suggests Liverpool are sniffing around the Italy international, who can play in an attacking midfield role or from the flank. Juventus and Atletico Madrid are also waiting to pounce.  ",positive
435,https://www.football365.com/news/pundit-insists-chelsea-broja-force-transfer-arsenal-summer,Pundit insists Chelsea star may have to force move to Arsenal,"Kevin Campbell has suggested that Chelsea youngster Armando Broja could have to force a move to Arsenal in the summer. The 20-year-old, on loan at Southampton from Chelsea, has impressed at St Mary’s this season, scoring six goals from 12 Premier League starts. Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl hasstated his desire to keep Brojaat the club next season, and they’ve been linked with a £30m move to sign the Albania international on a permanent basis. Liverpool fans should be happiest – with Arsenal not far behind Leeds United, Everton and Wolves were all linked with Broja in the January transfer window and a report earlier this week claimed he was also high on Mikel Arteta’s wishlist at Arsenal. The Gunners terminated Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s contract in January, while Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah look set to leave the club on free transfers in the summer. Arsenal will be in the market for at least one striker in the summer but Campbell thinks Broja could be difficult to get out of Stamford Bridge. “The thing is with Chelsea, they have so many players,” Campbell told Football Insider. “They might well say they don’t want to sell him to a rival. But if the young man wants a career, then he won’t want to be going out on loan all the time or stuck in the reserves – he’ll want to move. “I don’t know how strong the interest is, but he’s certainly performing brilliantly at Southampton. He looks a right handful and he’s a young striker, which ties into the model at Arsenal right now. “I don’t know what their stance is on selling to a top-four rival, but Chelsea won’t be able to keep everybody happy this summer – that’s for sure.” Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards was blown away by Broja’s performance against Man Utd as Southampton drew 1-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday. Richards was impressed by his ability to bully two experienced centre-backs, he said on BBC Sport:“Broja, I know we’ve mentioned him before, but he’s bullying not only Maguire but he’s bullying Varane as well, which I couldn’t quite understand for someone so young.” ",positive

Broja has impressed for the Saints this season, scoring nine goals in all competitions for Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side, while he has also starred for Albania, registering three goals and two assists in seven World Cup qualifiers. READ MORE: Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters His form has drawn the attention of admirers across Europe, with a report on Thursday suggesting Napoli have the 20-year-old in the ‘spotlight’ as a potential replacement for Victor Osimhen, who’s heavily linked with Manchester United. But Tuttomercato (via Sport Witness) claim it’s unlikely Napoli will be able to lure Broja this summer, with Tuchel keen on having the striker in his squad next season. It’s claimed Tuchel wants to ‘bring him home’ from St Mary’s, and the Albanian will ‘return to Chelsea’, then ‘decide his future’. The report concedes that the club’s ongoing search for a new owner makes it a ‘complicated situation’ as Broja and his representatives don’t know who they will hold talks with. But the ‘feeling is he will remain, in any case, in the Premier League’. Hasenhuttl certainly hopes to extend Broja’s loan for another season at Southampton, but admits they are also struggling to find the right person or people at Stamford Bridge to negotiate with. With Chelsea’s future clouded in uncertainty amid ongoing takeover talks, the Austrian concedes his club will have to remain patient for the time being as they focus on their quest for a top-half finish. “We are discussing this topic in the moment,” Hasenhuttl said of Broja’s situation. “We all know the situation at Chelsea that there are a lot of changes there. “In the moment, it’s not so easy to find the right person to talk to and to speak about futures of players. “It’s maybe easier to concentrate on your job, to do a good job until the end of the season.

Striker Broja has shone for Saints this season and is poised to return for Saturday’s Premier League clash with Arsenal after being ineligible for last weekend’s 6-0 thrashing at the hands of his parent club. BT Sport pearl clutching, ‘clever’ Foden and Atletico anti-football Manager Hasenhuttl has regularly spoken of his desire to prolong the 20-year-old’s stay at St Mary’s beyond this campaign.

That helps him, that helps us. “The higher we end up in the table, the more attractive we are for all of the players and this is the goal for the last seven games we have.” Albania international Broja has hit nine goals in all competitions since temporarily swapping Stamford Bridge for the south coast. Yet the Slough-born frontman has not found the net in the league for more than two months. With Saints having taken only a point from their last five top-flight games – including the hammering against Thomas Tuchel’s European champions – Hasenhuttl is eager for Broja to rediscover top form, beginning against Mikel Arteta’s Gunners. “Broja on his best level is definitely a player that can help us,” added the Southampton boss. “But the important thing is that he also has to step up and find the way back to his best performances, like we all have to. This is the goal for the weekend.” Despite their recent poor run, 14th-placed Southampton remain just a point off 10th position. Hasenhuttl, who has suffered 9-0 losses to Leicester and Manchester United during his tenure, wants his players to swiftly move on from their latest heavy defeat. “You get this experience when you are manager of this football club and we’ve definitely had these moments in the time we were working together,” he said of the Chelsea loss. “There is still a lot to win this season. “We have still a very good situation with 36 points, it’s very tight in the middle of the table and the important thing is we find back to the basics, to the fundamentals. “We have a strong opponent on the weekend coming to us and hopefully we show a different face.” ",positive

Four minutes after coming on as a substitute, Chukwueze swept home a cross by Gerard Moreno to cancel out Robert Lewandowski’s 52nd-minute opener and send the LaLiga side through by virtue of a 2-1 aggregate scoreline. Going Dutch is the only reason Koeman rides again Villarreal had withstood mounting Bayern pressure in the second half, with Lucas Hernandez and Thomas Muller among those who had a chance to win it before the visitors sealed the deal with extra-time looming. The hosts had looked listless for much of the first period and it took until just before the half-hour mark for them to muster a shot on target when Jamal Musiala headed straight at Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were coping comfortably with Bayern’s one-dimensional approaches and looked increasingly confident of clinging onto the hard-fought single-goal advantage they had forged in the first leg.

But it was a different story after the break as Bayern finally got into gear, and Dayot Upamecano should have scored from a clever cut-back by the busy Leroy Sane in the 51st minute. Lewandowski ended a strong spell of pressure by poking Bayern in front on the night moments later, sparking a spell of pressure that saw Hernandez shoot straight at Rulli, and Muller miss a glorious chance with a close-range header from another Sane cross. In the midst of the chances, Moreno had served a warning by flashing the ball across the face of the Bayern box on a swift counter-attack, and that danger became a reality four minutes after Chukwueze’s introduction.

The striker is out of contract this summer and he looks set to depart Liverpool. Italian side AC Milan look to be leading the race to sign him. The famous F365 England World Cup ladder Origi is a beloved figure at Liverpool as he scored in the Champions League final in 2019. But he has barely featured for the Reds this season. AC Milan have also been linked with Armando Broja of late. The Chelsea youngster has spent this season on loan at Southampton. The 20-year-old has been a star player for the Saints this term as he has been involved in ten goals across all competitions. Federico Zancan, a journalist for Sky Italia, has encouraged Milan to sign Broja instead of Origi: “He’s a part-time player, and despite having little space, he has remained and become a cult for Liverpool fans. He’s a strong player and is very attractive to big teams in Europe. In the last season, Klopp has also used him out wide,” Zancan said via Sport Witness). On Broja, Zancan added: “He is a very strong player and is waiting to be discovered. I would take him instead of Origi. He is owned by Chelsea, so it will be difficult to go get him but the London team will be able to sell him given the many talents they have at home. But it’s complicated.” Elsewhere, Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand insists that Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson is “vital” for both club and country. Henderson arrived at Liverpool from Sunderland in 2011. 11 years and 433 appearances later and the 31-year-old has captained the Reds to glory in the Premier League, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and Carabao Cup. He has had to face fierce criticism for club and country over the years but he seems to now be more appreciated by neutral supporters due to his success on and off the pitch in recent seasons. Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips were England’s main two midfielders as they reached the Euro 2020 final last year and Ferdinand was asked whether Henderson deserves his place in the England team. Ferdinand said: “When he doesn’t play for Liverpool, they’re not as good. It’s a fact. “I just feel that someone like Jordan Henderson offers more than just ability in a Liverpool shirt and in an England shirt. I think he’s vital. “Whether he plays or not, now that’s a different story because that’s debatable. But being in this as a squad member, there’s no doubt in my mind.” ",positive

The Gunnerswere eager to sign the Serbia international in the January transfer window, but the striker was not interested in joining the Premier League club. He joined Juventus from Fiorentina late in the winter window, signing a four-and-a-half-year contract after a £63m deal was agreed. That Arsenal agenda and other bollocks in the Mailbox Arsenal terminated Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s contract at the end of January as he joined Barcelona on a free transfer, while Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette will be out of contract in the summer with no contract renewals on the horizon. Now the Gunners are likely to target a couple of strikers in the summer transfer window and the Daily Express reckons their shortlist has now swelled from three names to six. Real Sociedad’s Alexander Isak, Jonathan David of Lille and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin were also linked at the same time as Vlahovic but after the Serbian rejected the Gunners they added three more names. Benfica’s Darwin Nunez, Napoli’s Victor Osimhen and Southampton loanee Armando Broja are the latest names on the list, while talks have ‘already taken place’ with Nunez. Arsenal know they ‘won’t be alone’ in their pursuit of the €65m-rated Benfica forward after he has scored 24 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season for the Portuguese outfit. Nunez ‘fits the profile’ Mikel Arteta is looking for but there will be fierce competition from fellow Premier League sides Newcastle United and West Ham. On Napoli’s Osimhen, the report insists that his £80m price tag ‘could rule the Nigerian out of the running’ despite his impressive scoring record. One player who is easing Arteta’s goalscoring worries is Gabriel Martinelli with the 20-year-old recently called up to the senior Brazil squad for the first time ever. On the moment he found out about his call-up, Martinelli told Globo: “When I got home [from training], I went through the door, sat on the couch with my dad, and Tite started saying the summons. “I was very happy, with my father, my agents were also here. It was a very special moment, for being the first. It will forever be etched in my memory. As I said, I’ll try to make the best of it.” Martinelli added: “Everyone has a great affection for Brazil, the players of our team when they talk about Brazil know that we had many quality players and we still have them today. “Lacazette always makes fun of me and Gab [Gabriel Magalhães]. Even being from other countries, there is this recognition of the Brazilian team. In my opinion, it remains one of the greatest shirts in the world.”  ",positive
441,https://www.football365.com/news/transfer-gossip-manchester-united-move-40m-target-fierce-hatred-tielemans,Gossip: Man Utd move to £40m target due to ‘fierce hatred’,"Kalvin Phillips is off the table so Manchester United will switch their attention to Youri Tielemans, while Arsenal are in a Bukayo Saka panic. YOURI IN LUCK Another disappointing draw after taking the lead against limited opposition exposed their need for a world-class striker. But that is surely not the transfer priority of Manchester United this summer when their central midfield remains as pale as it has been for years. Those links with Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips persist but the former would cost around £100m and the latter is not likely to cross that particular divide, especially not with a new Leeds contract in the pipeline. As the Daily Star says, the ‘fierce hatred’ between them and Manchester United would make any move incredibly complicated. That report does shed a light on another possible target. They point out that Leicester ‘could be forced to cash in on’ Youri Tielemans as his Foxes deal edges towards expiration. It runs out in summer 2023, meaning this summer could well present their last chance at recouping the £40m fee paid to Monaco in 2019. That is the precise sum Manchester United feel they can procure Tielemans for, using the ‘good relationship’ with Leicester that they established during the Harry Maguire negotiations.  BUK THE TREND Not only that deal but also the entire level of investment at Manchester United is likely to depend on Champions League qualification this season. The same stands for Tottenham and Arsenal, whose own rejuvenation projects are relying on that economic boost of sitting at Europe’s top table. In the case of the Gunners, they want a right-back, a central midfielder and two strikers after using January to lay some rather troublesome groundwork. The Daily Mail add that a new contract for Bukayo Saka sits towards the top of that list of preferences. They discuss the ’emerging concerns’ within the club about how this rebuild will be impacted by which competition they qualify for. It is feared that talks over Saka would become ‘significantly harder’ outside the Champions League, while persuading Alexander Isak to join would also be complex if they don’t finish in the top four come May.  I KANE HERE FOR LOVE But yes, Tottenham also seem to be counting on Champions League qualification. There are going to be some incredibly disappointed Big Six executives by the end of the season. In their case, it is more about keeping players rather than signing them right now. And Harry Kane is good again so they’d probably rather avoid the circus of last summer. As if eight goals in his last 14 Tottenham games didn’t underline his renewed vigour under Antonio Conte, Fabrizio Romano is here to say Kane might well be happier to stay than he was a few months ago. The 28-year-old could even earn himself a new contract – although it should be said that his current one still has more than two years left to run. Harry Kane’s understood to be ‘more than happy’ with Conte.

442,https://www.football365.com/news/ferdinand-blasts-crazy-man-utd-maguire-burnley-draw,Ferdinand blasts ‘crazy’ Man Utd star in Burnley draw,"Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd defender Harry Maguire was “lucky to stay on the pitch” during their 1-1 draw at Burnley. Man Utd dominated the first half at Turf Moor but, after two strikes were ruled out, had only Paul Pogba’s first league goal in over a year to show for it. And that proved costly as Burnley emerged from the tunnel a different team after the break, levelling swiftly through Jay Rodriguez’s 100th league goal – and first in 50 league appearances – before threatening a winner through the lively Wout Weghorst. F365 says: Man Utd need a world class striker Coming after Friday’s FA Cup exit at the hands of Middlesbrough, it was another frustrating night for Man Utd, whose problems remain obvious at both ends of the pitch 12 games into Ralf Rangnick’s interim reign. Maguire was at fault for the Burnley equaliser from Rodriguez before the England international was lucky to only receive a yellow card when he brought the Burnley striker down on the halfway line later in the match. And Ferdinand was critical of the 28-year-old’s performance and wonders whether Maguire is having a “hangover from the Euros”. “The goal was poor on Harry’s part. I’m sure behind closed doors he will take responsibility but he doesn’t need to come out here and go crazy about it, they need to iron it out,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport. “I think the challenge he made just over the half way line, he’s lucky to stay on the pitch. I feel the striker is running in on goal there. “It’s a performance I’m sure he’ll want to erase and get into the next game as quick as possible but these things happen. “This season you’ve definitely seen that, whether that’s a hangover from the Euros physically and mentally I’m not sure. “There hasn’t been the consistency you expect from a player of his stature. “We can level it at Harry Maguire but this whole team has to take responsibility. They’re not performing consistently enough through the whole 90 minutes of the game.” Not the result that your support deserved, Reds. Thanks for your magnificent backing, as always.#MUFC | #BURMUN pic.twitter.com/5iGeMs0c3h — Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 8, 2022 Meanwhile,Rangnick criticised the officials for disallowing first a Raphael Varane header because Maguire had been offside, then a Josh Brownhill own goal because Pogba had fouled Erik Pieters in the build-up, but accepted his side had not done enough. “We scored three goals in the first half, I couldn’t blame the team for not having a killer instinct in the first half,” Rangnick said on BT Sport. “But yes, at the end, in the last 25 minutes as I said we had a lot of set-pieces, a lot of free-kicks, corner kicks. In the end it was also a little question of luck, with (a chance for) Rafa Varane, the header of Cristiano Ronaldo, the header of Harry Maguire. “But again, in the end, one point for a performance like this is just not enough.”  ",positive

444,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-everton-1-0-chelsea-substance-over-style-relegation-dogfight,Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight,"It was a huge win for Chelsea legend Frank Lampard’s Everton, who played with the fight and desire befitting what is turning into quite the relegation battle. It was as frustrated as Chelsea have looked, and they’ve played this game at least 25 times this season. They had 78 per cent of the ball, did nothing with it and allowed themselves to be riled by Everton. Kai Havertz was the case in point. He had 30 touches in the first half but none in the box and spent most of the time being wound up by Yerry Mina, who dealt with him brilliantly. Everton were aggressive and defended as one. The problem, if you can call it one, was their inability to string more than two passes together. Abdoulaye Doucoure was excellent, Fabian Delph was typically dynamic, but neither of them were able to put their foot on the ball and dictate play for more than a few seconds. They were relying on a Chelsea mistake, which Cesar Azpilicueta dutifully proferred shortly after half-time. The Chelsea captain had plenty of time to play the ball long for Reece James or pass it back to Edouard Mendy, did neither and was robbed by Richarlison, who calmly slotted the ball into the corner. The ploy to frustrate that ended in defeat to Liverpool is a viable method against this Chelsea side, who have been profligate in one box and mistake-ridden in the other for weeks. Bide your time and they will hand you a reward for your patience and hard work. And as Chelsea tried to break out of their funk, with Jordan Pickford making one brilliant save to deny Azpilicueta after Mason Mount hit both posts, before getting the ball smashed in the chops from the resulting corner, Everton could easily have doubled their lead as Richarlison continued to be buzz around and irritate the Chelsea defence. The Brazilian was at his pestering best and had to be replaced in the 80th minute, having run himself into the ground. It wasn’t pretty from Everton. There was very little skill and only fleeting quality to speak of, but they did the ugly stuff so well. It’s as though they have now finally realised they’re in a relegation battle and – roared on by the Goodison Park crowd – are weighting their efforts hugely in favour of substance over style. That’s absolutely how it should be. Frank Lampard, frequently criticised for his inability to organise his teams defensively, both in his time at Chelsea and more recently with Everton, played this one perfectly. They sat deep for the majority of the game, allowing no space for Havertz or Timo Werner to hurt them in behind, pushing up occasionally to press in packs and harass what is an increasingly shaky Chelsea backline into mistakes. And they fully deserved the victory. Pickford did make some world class saves, but an Everton xG of 1.82 to Chelsea’s 0.94 illustrates just how effective the home side were compared to their opponents. They played Chelsea at a good time – Thomas Tuchel’s side don’t appear to have anything left in the tank this season – but if Everton can harness the passion they showed on Sunday and use that as the bedrock for their remaining five games, they will still be a Premier League outfit next season.

The United States international has played 19 times this season and has been utilised as a winger, wing-back and striker by Tuchel. He has only managed three goals and one assist for the Blues in 2021/22. Hudson-Odoi and a dribble down memory lane for Chelsea Pulisic joined Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund for £57.6m in January 2019 but has not quite met the expectations that come alongside his price tag. He is currently on international duty, and during a press conference expressed his desire to play in his preferred position. “It’s tough,” he said (quotes via Sky Sports). “I haven’t always been playing in the positions I want to play in. But I think it’s a good quality to be versatile and be able to play in all kinds of positions and have different strengths on the pitch. “So, yeah, I’ve learned a lot and I think I’m ready to hopefully be in a spot in the next couple of games that I’m more comfortable in. “Obviously it’s been up and down this year, for sure,” added Pulisic. “Not exactly where I want to be and how I want things to be right now. But, yeah, I’m just going to keep going and, like I said, it doesn’t affect me when I come here so I’m excited to be here. “When I come to the national team it’s, ‘How are things at Chelsea? What’s this, what’s that?’. And, yeah, things are… it’s tough. It’s tough.

Second-half substitute Pulisic swept home Marcos Alonso’s low cross at Stamford Bridge to seal Chelsea’s first home win in four matches in all competitions. Jorginho, Chelsea blushes saved as top four all but secure The USA international’s crisp finish also offered Jorginho a major reprieve, with the Italy midfielder having missed a penalty with just four minutes left on the clock in an incident that also saw West Ham reduced to 10 men. Craig Dawson was sent off for hauling back Romelu Lukaku in the box, gifting Chelsea the perfect chance to turn a dispiriting performance into a much-needed win. Jorginho stepped up and delivered his trademark hop, skip and side-footed penalty effort – only to see Lukasz Fabianski guess correctly and pull off a comfortable save.

Look what it meant! 😎 pic.twitter.com/AeKWVoqsZW — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 24, 2022 But just when another penalty failure looked set to haunt the 30-year-old at Stamford Bridge, up popped Pulisic with a vital rescue act. A win to keep Chelsea solidly in third place in the Premier League table, but given its dramatic nature also a result that ought to boost some weary bodies and minds in west London. Manager Thomas Tuchel admitted on Friday that his players are “fragile”, tired and running short of ideas on how to fix their ailing home form. A dismal first half devoid of any invention or quality did absolutely nothing to disabuse anyone in the ground of those notions. The much-changed Hammers were content to sit in two banks of four and invite Chelsea to break down their regimented set-up.  The Blues had no answers before the break, and turned around as flat as they were frustrated. The hosts finally upped the ante and the tempo after the interval, with a deflection helping Fabianski to keep out N’Golo Kante’s strike. Trevoh Chalobah’s 20-yard drive forced Fabianski into another save, but still Chelsea failed to fire. The Blues’ malaise was encapsulated by Thiago Silva powering between West Ham’s lines and picking his spot with a shot – only to see team-mate Timo Werner deflect his effort wide. Werner was flagged for offside just for good measure. Dawson’s fine block thwarted Mason Mount and Werner could only blast wide after collecting the loose ball in the six-yard box. Werner was then presented with the chance of the match as the ball dropped to him just eight yards out, but the Germany forward could not connect properly at full stretch, allowing Fabianski a straightforward save. Pulisic, Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech replaced Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Kai Havertz and Werner for the final 15 minutes as the Blues went for broke. The triple substitution paid off in the end, but not without further drama. Lukaku thought he had produced a vital act by drawing the penalty from Dawson, only for Jorginho – so often so secure from the spot – to miss again. Pulisic stepped into the break as the super sub instead then, making no mistake when racing onto the ball with the goal at his mercy. ",positive

Blues owner Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The Russian-Israeli billionaire was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. The Blues must operate under strict Government licence, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. Every Premier League club’s worst signing of the season New York merchant bank the Raine Group is overseeing the sale process, with bidders continuing to wait to discover whether they have made the shortlist of candidates. Chelsea have been in good form while the ownership situation has been unfolding but Pulisic admits it will be “nice to have a break” with the US men’s national team before returning to finish the season. “It’s been a crazy situation, to be honest, but we’ve been able to focus on our game and just worry about playing over there,” said Pulisic, who is currently on international duty with the United States. “I’m just excited in general to come play with the US national team because I love this group of guys and I love this team and it’ll be nice to have a break, see something a bit different, and then I’ll be ready to go back and finish off the season strong.” Meanwhile, Muslim community leaders in Chicago have called on Chelsea fans to reject cancel culture and embrace “decent man” Tom Ricketts and his bid to buy the Blues. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family are among the suitors locked in the bidding process to succeed Roman Abramovich as Chelsea owner. Family patriarch Joe Ricketts was accused of Islamophobia in 2019, calling Muslims “my enemy” in leaked emails. Chelsea fans have voiced their concerns via the social media hashtag ‘NoToRicketts’, while also raising issues with the club, though Joe Ricketts has no role at the Cubs nor in the bid to buy the Blues.

Rehab explained how he met with the Cubs hierarchy in the wake of those 2019 leaked emails, and the steps the Chicago baseball side’s chiefs have taken since to prove their commitment to diversity and inclusion. “We became aware as everybody did about Joe Ricketts, the father, making some pretty problematic anti-Muslim statements,” Rehab told the PA news agency. “We were very offended, and immediately reached out to the Cubs at the time, Tom Ricketts and Julian Green, and they both responded. “They came to my office here in down town Chicago and we brought other Muslim organisations to the table for this meeting. “We were very clear and very stern in our rebuke of Joe Ricketts and his statements, and the association to the Cubs. “They distanced themselves, they apologised for the remarks, we went back and forth and we put together some concrete steps to show in action both the Cubs and the Ricketts family a genuine position on diversity and inclusiveness. “I’m not going to buy into this fad in the world of cancel and destroy on a mistake. If one persists with no regret on a mistake and doubles down, that’s a different story. “But if you’re someone who has made a mistake, and in this case it wasn’t even Tom; it was problematic but to be fair it was one step removed. “And then for that person to do all they can, do all the right things. We had expectations as to what the right things would be and that’s what they did.”  ",positive

Mount has spent his whole career with the Blues. Following spells at Vitesse and Derby County, he made his senior debut for Chelsea in 2019. The midfielder has been a key player in recent years as he has played just short of 150 times for his boyhood club. He has also been capped 26 times by England. The top 10 worst transfer mistakes of the season Chelsea have fallen away in the race for the Premier League title as they sit third. They are 16 points adrift of leaders Man City with two games in hand. Romelu Lukaku returned to Chelsea last summer but he has struggled of late. He was left on the bench as they beat Burnley 4-0 last time out. Kai Havertz has played up front over Lukaku and the German netted a brace against the Clarets. Without Mount and Havertz in operating supporting areas, Poyet has suggested that Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Timo Werner make Chelsea “more predictable”: “They boast many different kinds of players, but if I’m being honest, right now, when Mason Mount isn’t at his best – or isn’t playing – Chelsea miss creativity,” Poyet claimed (via the Daily Star) “They’re a little more predictable when Mount’s not on his game. Pulisic, Hudson-Odoi and Werner – you know what these players are going to do. You can prepare better for those names. “But Mount is the kind of player who makes special things happen. His timing, understanding, positioning, is so good, he’s hard to play against. “Because of the quantity of games and the changes that Thomas Tuchel makes, he doesn’t have that option to play Mount every week, and so every time he doesn’t feature, that creativity is gone. “I’d normally expect Kai Havertz to share some of that responsibility with Mason. “But because of the problems with Romelu Lukaku, Havertz is playing up front, where we don’t really get to see him at his best. “My opinion on Chelsea hasn’t changed. I thought at the beginning of the season that they needed to be title contenders. “When you are the Champions League winners, and you then go and sign a striker for £90m, that means you need to challenge for the title – it’s really simple. “We can’t make excuses; we can’t blame COVID, injuries or anything… Chelsea needed to be title contenders this year – that’s the bottom line. “It’s because of Chelsea; they cannot blame anyone. Look, they haven’t lost too many games, but their issue has been too many draws. That’s why they’re so far behind Manchester City and Liverpool.” ",positive

Dembele is expected to leave Barcelona this summer as his contract is expiring in June. The winger was linked with Chelsea in January. The Spanish giants were keen to make money on him instead of losing him for free. Chelsea are through to the CWC final, but few in Europe care The 24-year-old joined Barcelona in 2017 from Borussia Dortmundfor €105m plus add-ons. He has struggled over the past couple of years. Werner and Pulisic have both joined the Blues in recent years from RB Leipzig and Dortmund. They made the move to the Premier League for significant fees. The attacking duo have had Covid-19 this season but they have not consistently impressed when given the chance. Johnson has hinted that Chelsea could let Pulisic or Werner leave to sign Dembele: “I don’t think Chelsea need him [Dembele], but I think he could help. He’s obviously a great player,”Johnson said (via The Metro). “Christian Pulisic isn’t really happening at the moment. Timo Werner’s not really happening at the moment. “So if you’ve got a player who can come in and push them all for places and maybe they could trade one the other way, I reckon Chelsea would be interested in Dembele.” Johnson went onto suggest that it would be “absolute madness” if Chelsea sacked Thomas Tuchel: “I’d like to think Tuchel will still be at the club next season, but it’s the hottest seat in world football. “I don’t think it’d surprise anybody if he wasn’t at Chelsea but I think it would be absolute madness for them to sack him. “What he’s done in such a short period of time, and I think they are improving, if they keep him another season I think they’d be doing the right thing. “I can’t imagine someone will walk in and pick up from where he’s left off and improve them immediately. I think it would be a mistake if he was to come under pressure.” ",negative

He is currently on international duty, and during a press conference expressed his desire to play in his preferred position. “It’s tough,” he said (quotes via Sky Sports). “I haven’t always been playing in the positions I want to play in. But I think it’s a good quality to be versatile and be able to play in all kinds of positions and have different strengths on the pitch. “So, yeah, I’ve learned a lot and I think I’m ready to hopefully be in a spot in the next couple of games that I’m more comfortable in. “Obviously it’s been up and down this year, for sure,” added Pulisic. “Not exactly where I want to be and how I want things to be right now. But, yeah, I’m just going to keep going and, like I said, it doesn’t affect me when I come here so I’m excited to be here. “When I come to the national team it’s, ‘How are things at Chelsea? What’s this, what’s that?’. And, yeah, things are… it’s tough. It’s tough.

Enrique added: “Gavi has a lot of potential, he’s very young. Barcelona need money as well, so maybe that’s an option. If he joins Liverpool he will still have a lot to learn but he’s a very, very good player with a lot of talent. And every player under Klopp improves. “If Barcelona are happy to sell, he can definitely do very well for Liverpool. I’m sure Klopp would get the maximum from him. I don’t see Barcelona selling to Liverpool, unless he’s on a low salary. “But the problem at Barcelona is the players on big salaries. For Liverpool, he’s a great player and great players are always welcome.” Mo Salah came seventh in the Ballon d’Or rankings earlier this month with Klopp and some fans confused as to why he didn’t finish higher. Enrique thinks Salah should’ve been higher but doesn’t agree with the notion that he should have won the accolade. The Spaniard continued: “Salah was too low on the Ballon d’Or rankings but he shouldn’t have won it. It’s not just about personal numbers, it’s about the team as well. That’s the way the Ballon d’Or has been for a long time. “Messi won the Copa America, Lewandowski won the Bundesliga and other titles, and their numbers were massive. There was no fight for those top two positions but Salah should definitely have been third or fourth. He was the main man to take Liverpool to the Champions League.”  ",positive

Lingard spent the second-half of last season with the Hammers, and was in fine form for Moyes’ outfit. They tried to bring him back to the club last summer and again in January but United refused to allow him to leave. He is now set to depart in the summer as a free agent and could make to move back to the London Stadium. Former Hammers man Cottee has urged his old side to bring him back and also tipped Everton defender Michael Keane as possible option. Cottee said (quotes via Metro): “West Ham needs to sign players like [Jesse] Lingard, like Michael Keane. “Players like that, good English players, coming and buying into what David Moyes got going on and want to be a part of the squad and that good team spirit they’ve got there.” Cottee also criticised the club for not investing in the January transfer window, and urged them to bring in up to six new names in the summer. “I think first and foremost West Ham should have signed players in the January window. That would have helped what’s going on. “The main priority in terms of this summer transfer window is to sign a centre-forward. They’ve had two years without one. “Michail Antonio is a fabulous player. I love watching him play but he is a converted right-back who became a centre-forward. He’s not a natural centre-forward. “Then you look at the midfield. What do you do with players like [Andriy] Yarmolenko, Alex Král and [Nikola] Vlasic who’s been very disappointing this year? These players haven’t quite progressed as they should have done. “West Ham, without a doubt, probably needs five or six new players into the squad. They’ve also got quite a few players out of contract, five or six players leaving so that’s a surplus of requirements. It’s exciting times at the football club.” ",positive

The Belgium international came off the bench for the last 20 minutes against the Red Devils at Old Trafford but failed to impact the game. Lukaku has now failed to score in his last ten appearances in the Premier League with his last goal in the competition coming at the end of December against Brighton. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” 🗣 “His attitude doesn’t seem right.” Roy Keane on Romelu Lukaku’s performance for Chelsea tonight pic.twitter.com/jd0dp8EZZp — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 28, 2022 Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was frustrated that his side didn’t take all three points against Man Utd on Thursday with the Blues failing turn their chances into goals. “A little bit (frustrated not to win),” Tuchel said with a smile. “We were very strong on and off the ball, very dominant on the ball, very aggressive off it. “A lot of ball wins, a lot of deliveries, a lot of half chances, a lot of spaces we found around the box. “But unfortunately we lacked precision in the box, a bit of determination to finish it off, even very early in the match, but also throughout the whole match. “Unfortunately when we had it we gave it away in one minute, so it started all over again. “But reaction was good again, so I am very happy with the performance because it was a huge team effort. “I think we showed what it needs to win on a big stage, in a big stadium, like on the focus level and the physical input level. “We played with a huge team effort with a lot of quality, but unfortunately we don’t have what we deserved, so we have to live with a point.”  ",positive

The winger moved to the Emirates Stadium in 2019 for £72m from French club Lille after contributing 22 goals and 11 assists in the 2018/19 Ligue Un season. Although he has showed glimpses of his talent in moments at Arsenal, Pepe has failed to recreate that clinical and creative side to his game in north London. He has only hit double figures for Premier League goals once in his time at Arsenal and, with his contract running out in 2024, Pepe and the club have some thinking to do this summer over his future at the club. Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season Speaking on Monday, Pepe said: “I am focused on how well we do until the end of the season and the club’s target, which is getting into theChampions League. Then we will see what happens.” On his conversations with Arteta, Pepe added: “When a team is winning it is hard for a coach to make changes. “Mikel Arteta has explained that to me and the coach knows what I think and how hard I’m working. It is also about communication. Sometimes it’s not easy to communicate with the language barrier. It has been a tough season for me. Of course, it is frustrating not to play. No player enjoys not playing but I have to respect the coach’s decision and the team is doing well at the moment.

Beaumelle said: “When I watch Nico on the bench it is painful for him as he loves to play and it is painful for me because I need my players on the pitch for club games. I would like him to play more as I am sure he can bring a lot of solutions. “When you see what he brings to Ivory Coast, I would like to see him bring so much fun and joy and happiness and goals with the red jersey.”  ",positive

Rashford has endured a wretched season and, once again, he was anonymous against Chelsea on Thursday night. That hasn’t put off some of the England striker’s admirers, with Barcelona said to be keen. According to Football Insider, Arsenal have also made their interest known. Apparently, the Gunners have set aside £45million to spend on a striker capable of slotting straight into Mikel Arteta’s side.

465,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-chelsea-need-stability-clarity-thomas-tuchel-exit-rumours,Chelsea need stability and clarity as Thomas Tuchel exit rumours begin to swirl again,"Chelsea are resigned to losing Rudiger and Christensen, but now the rumours concern Thomas Tuchel too. The new owners can’t arrive too soon. These remain uncertain times for Chelsea. The race to take over the club seems to be permanently a couple of days away without having yet arrived, and while it remains highly likely that they will return to the Champions League come the end of the season, work will have to be carried out on the playing squad during the summer and nobody yet knows what the appetite for spending will be on the part of those new owners. The transfer saga that has been looming over the club for the whole of this season is approaching its endgame, and it doesn’t look like a successful result for the club. Antonio Rudiger was left out in the cold by Frank Lampard but has grown exponentially as a player under the guidance of Tuchel; Chelsea have been prevented from discussing a new contract with him since the sanctions against Roman Abramovich were put in place, but an earlier, substantially improved offer was rejected and Real Madrid have swooped. The Bernabeu now seems almost certain to be his home from this summer. It is completely understandable that the loss of a player with such leadership qualities should have sent a cold chill through Stamford Bridge. When a player of this stature leaves a club, they leave a space behind them that is far greater than anything visible from the 90 minutes that the rest of us see once or twice a week. It’s about the atmosphere around the training ground, the dressing room and the gym. It’s about having a structure in which there are players who stand out as an example to players of all ages, an example that others can follow. Everybody at Stamford Bridge already knows that the loss of Antonio Rudiger will be a big loss to Chelsea. Rudiger won’t be the only defender to leave Stamford Bridge for Chelsea this summer, either. Andreas Christensen’s contract expires at the end of this season, and it already seems almost certain that he will be leaving for Barcelona, although this hasn’t been officially confirmed yet. Further threat to their defensive stability was averted after Cesar Azpilicueta signed a year’s extension on his contract which could only be agreed under current sanctions because it was an extension.  In the slipstream of these ongoing rumours has now come the rumour that Thomas Tuchel could be considering his future with the club due to, according to reports, ‘the paralysing restrictions the club is operating under’. But how likely is this? The timing would certainly be odd. Tuchel has been working under these restrictions for the last couple of months and the point at which confirmation of a new owner should be imminent seems like a very strange time to be bailing on the club. Normality should soon return to Stamford Bridge. It won’t be the same normality that existed under Abramovich’s ownership – it seems unlikely that the new owners will be either willing or able to support the sort of losses that he underwrote – but the existential threat that has been hanging over the club will be lifted, commercial activities can begin again, and the all-important work that needs to be carried out on the playing squad will be able to start. It would be extremely surprising if, having rode out this extremely difficult period in the club’s history, he left the club just as that period was coming to an end. Tuchel has history, of course. His two previous jobs have both seen a deterioration in his relationship with his employers, and while this is understandable in the case of PSG (a club that looks close to unmanageable the best of times), when combined with the same thing at Borussia Dortmund, it starts to look like a pattern. But for all of that, it should be added that Tuchel has been an outstanding spokesman for Chelsea during their recent difficulties, and that as yet the rumours remain anonymous and unsubstantiated. But while the arrival of new owners at Chelsea will finally close the door on a difficult period for the club, this doesn’t mean that other issues will all magically vanish with them. The squad is due some attention beyond the replacement of Rudiger and Christensen. N’Golo Kante, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho and Thiago Silva and the aforementioned Cesar Azpilicueta are all out of contract in the summer of 2023. The unsuccessful signing of Romelu Lukaku and what happens next with him, amid rumours that he wants to return to Inter, will have to be addressed. Stamford Bridge is no nearer to getting its much-needed renovation, although all three bidders for the club have committed to it. After the last couple of months, Chelsea could probably do with some stability and a clear vision for the future. No-one knows who the new owners will even be, still less what sort of money they will spend during the summer transfer window. It may well be that, whoever they are, they’ll be looking to make ‘signals of intent’, and the summer transfer window is a perfect time to do that. But spending that money is one thing; spending it wisely is something else altogether, and it can hardly be said that Chelsea did that last summer. The circumstances of the last couple of months have largely been out of the club’s control, but those days are soon to end. Confirmation of the identity of the club’s new owners will not only be the ending of one chapter; they will also mark the beginning of another.  ",positive
466,https://www.football365.com/news/lukaku-told-apologise-chelsea-fans-tuchel-crazy-comments,Lukaku told to apologise to Chelsea fans for ‘crazy’ comments,"Former Premier League footballers Trevor Sinclair and Darren Bent have told “disrespectful” Romelu Lukaku to apologise to Chelsea fans after his comments about Inter Milan. Lukaku became the seventh-most expensive player in Chelsea’s history when rejoining the club in a £97.5million deal from Inter Milan in August. The Belgium striker has scored seven times in a season hampered by injury and Covid-19, claiming three goals in his last four appearances. Liverpool legends star in XI that led on NYD but fell away But Chelsea boss Tuchel has frequently left Lukaku out of the starting XI even when he has been fit. Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, Lukaku said: “Physically I’m fine, even better than before. “After two years in Italy, in which I worked a lot at Inter with trainers and nutritionists, I am physically fine. “But I’m not happy with the situation, this is normal. I think the coach has chosen to play with another system, I just have to not give up and continue to work and be a professional. “I am not happy with the situation, but I am a worker and I must not give up.” Despite his comments, it has been reported that the interview was conducted several weeks ago and Lukaku has since talked through his differences with the manager. Lukaku was a sensation in his two seasons at Inter after leaving Manchester United in August 2019. The 28-year-old scored 64 goals in 95 appearances and last season helped Inter to a first Serie A title since 2010. Lukaku said: “How I left Inter, how I communicated with the fans, this bothers me because it is not the right time now, but even when I left it was not the right time. “Now I think it is right to speak because I have always said that I have Inter in my heart, I will return to play there, I really hope so. “I am in love with Italy, this is rightly the time to talk and let people know what really happened without talking badly about people because I am not like that. “I want to say a big apology to the Inter fans because I think the way I left should have been different. “I really hope in the depths of my heart to return to Inter, not at the end of my career, but at a still good level to hopefully win more.” 🔵 “Every time I’ve seen a #CFC game, they’re always singing his name. He’s loved by the fans but he’s not playing regularly.” 👀 “If he’s left out again after scoring against Brighton, there must be a problem!” Ray Parlour reacts to Romelu Lukaku’s latest comments on Chelsea. pic.twitter.com/GEtAUc7NIU — talkSPORT (@talkSPORT) December 31, 2021 Former England international Sinclair was surprised by the comments and has urged Lukaku to apologise to the Chelsea supporters. Sinclair told talkSPORT: “I’m in absolute shock. I was atChelsea’s win against Villaand I watched him in the warm up. “I was intrigued because he was out for a while and wondered what his mood was going to be like – he was smiling, laughing, he looked like he was loving being back in the Chelsea squad. “The second-half performance cemented what I was thinking. He looked happy, he played happy, got a goal, an elite striker’s goal and then the third goal where he won the penalty I thought was one of the best runs to earn a penalty from him I’ve seen in a long time. “For him to come out with those comments, I think he should be apologising to the Chelsea fans. That’s so disrespectful to the Chelsea fans. “I think that’s so disrespectful to the Chelsea manager. I’d be astounded if he hadn’t had a conversation with Thomas Tuchel about this. “He might not have got the answer he wanted but you don’t come out in public and say this. I think it’s disrespectful to his teammates and I think it’s disrespectful to the owner. “He’s 28 years old. A lot of Chelsea’s front line will look up to Lukaku, I think he’s let them all down.” Fellow talkSPORT pundit Bent added: “Some of the quotes are just crazy. “One of the quotes where he says he hopes to return to Inter Milan and not at the end of his career, while he’s at his peak still. That could be soon! He’s not getting any younger. “It is a bombshell. I can understand his frustrations at not playing because there have been times where he’s been available and Thomas Tuchel has opted to go for Christian Pulisic as a false nine or Kai Havertz. “But to be so public about it, that’s a hammer blow forChelsea Football Club.”  ",positive

Tuchel’s Chelsea predecessor Lampard sent the German coach a good luck message when the former Paris St Germain boss took the Stamford Bridge helm in January 2021. MAILBOX: Four reasons why Everton fans are firmly behind under-fire Frank Lampard Lampard is now battling to keep Everton in the Premier League, with the struggling Toffees managing just one win in six matches in all competitions. Tuchel admitted he’s excited to meet Lampard after Chelsea’s record-goalscorer sent him a good luck message when he took over the club. “He sent me a very kind, respectful message after I took over at Chelsea that meant a lot,” said Tuchel, of Lampard. “I was a huge fan of him as a player and he is and will remain a legend at our club and this is a given. “I was very happy when he wrote me that message and it was very gentlemanly. “We didn’t have the chance to go out and have lunch and he took the chance to go and take charge of Everton. “He took an assistant from us, Joe Edwards, we were not so happy! Just joking. We will meet some friendly faces with Joe and Ashley Cole and Frank, who I have never met in person. “It is a very exciting week for me, I would love to meet him. We need the points, they need the points urgently as well.” Lampard handed the likes of Reece James and Mason Mount their Chelsea breakthroughs in his west London managerial tenure. Tuchel has been at regular pains to express his admiration for Chelsea’s academy system, with the club now having produced a glut of current homegrown senior stars. Asked if he had Lampard to thank for the nucleus of quality academy stars at his disposal, Tuchel insisted the former Blues midfielder would not have promoted anyone who did not warrant their chance. “I don’t know if it is gratitude. I don’t think Frank did it to do them a favour,” said Tuchel. “I think every coach does it because it is all about helping the team. It is not about age in any direction. “If Thiago (Silva) helps us we don’t care about how old he is. And we don’t care how young somebody is. When you are ready you are ready. I strongly believe you find your way if you have what it takes. “I am very grateful for the quality the academy produces and grateful for the culture at Chelsea to push these boys through and this is top, top quality. “It is our job to let them play and to prepare and push them on this kind of level. This is what Chelsea is about.” ",positive

With half a dozen out-of-contract stars on their way too, the new manager will then look to sign seven recruits, with Ajax’s Noussair Mazraoui, PSG’s Presnel Kimpembe, Antonio Rudiger, Declan Rice, Ruben Neves, Harry Kane and Christopher Nkunku on his list of targets. The Guardian also puts West Ham midfielder Rice high on Ten Hag’s wishlist, while Sky Sports are specific with positions rather than names, with a centre-back, two central midfielders, a winger and a striker all among the new manager’s priorities. The Telegraph pinpoint some of the attacking players United will target, with Benfica goalscorer Darwin Nunez a prime candidate for the centre-forward role, while wingers Antony of Ajax and Villarreal’s Arnaut Danjuma could offer the supply line.  Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man Utd, Merseyside derby, Eriksen  CITY PONDER PAIRING HAALAND WITH MBAPPE Manchester City will spend their summer p*ssing off Real Madrid, apparently… It seems City have beaten Real to Erling Haaland, and one report suggests they had so much fun that they want to do it all again over Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe is set to become a free agent when his PSG contract expires this summer. The Parisians have bent over backwards for the France star but it seems the forward is determined to move on. Real have led the race for Mbappe ever since free-agency came into view but Fichajes reckons City are ready to dip their toe in the water with a late proposal. Sounds like horse sh*t to us, but…  REAL WATCHING NEW TOON STAR Real Madrid are also casting their eye towards Tyneside, where Bruno Guimaraes is currently winning hearts and minds in Eddie Howe’s midfield. The Brazilian joined Newcastle in January but has wasted little time in getting the Geordies hot with three goals in 12 games, including a brace last weekend against Leicester. AS says such form hasn’t gone unnoticed at the Bernabeu, with Real having monitored the 24-year-old during his time at Lyon. A move in unlikely this summer but Real are already making plans for 2023, when Guimaraes could become a target. MILAN EYE LUKAKU BARGAIN Romelu Lukaku has found it rather more difficult to make friends at his new club. Which will happen when you play like a drain and tell the world you wish you were still at your old club. The feeling is Chelsea would sell their record signing if they could get a decent chunk of the £97.5million they paid Inter last summer. AC Milan certainly couldn’t offer that, but Goal says they believe there is a deal to be done anyway. Apparently, the Rossoneri hope Chelsea’s incoming new owners will be content to cut their losses on Lukaku and sell for less than what they might expect. And even then, they are pinning their hopes on the Blues funding a percentage of the Belgian’s massive salary. ",positive

The 17-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool in recent months. He made his senior debut for Barcelona last August as the Spanish giants beat Getafe 2-1 in La Liga. 16 Conclusions: Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United (9-0 agg) Gavi has been a regular for his boyhood club this season. He has played 41 times across all competitions. This includes 21 starts in La Liga. He has grabbed two goals and six assists in the league this campaign. The midfielder would likely cost clubs€50m as that fee would activate his release clause. Despite his positive showings, McManaman believes Liverpool should hold off signing the youngster: “Liverpool don’t need Gavi at this moment in time,” McManaman said (quotes via Liverpool Echo). “Maybe they could have an eye on him for the future, but I just think at this moment it won’t happen. “He needs to stay at Barcelona and play football. He needs to fill out and get more experience and become a proper La Liga or Premier League player and he needs to play more games. “At this moment in time, for that kind of money, when Liverpool have got about seven midfielders anyway, I just can’t see it happening. You need to see him play a lot more games. “If you were picking between Jude Bellingham or Gavi you’d pick Jude because of the size of him, the experience he has and the fact that he’s played 100 more games. “Gavi is a wonderful talent but I just think he’s far too young at the moment for Liverpool to be even looking at signing him for a fee like that.” Elsewhere, Steven Gerrard thinks Jurgen Klopp is “one in a million”: “He’s so comfortable in himself, so much belief and charisma in himself, what he’s done before, the character, the man I don’t think he’s seen it as a threat. I think previous managers might have. “But I always got a feeling he was open arms, excited to have me in. I felt uncomfortable going back to Melwood. I’d been to America and when you’ve been away for a certain amount of time you feel like you don’t belong there, although you do. “Every time I’ve seen Jurgen Klopp whether it be anywhere, I see him walking his dog, and it’s open arms and it’s real. Liverpool fans should enjoy Jurgen Klopp, I think he’s one in a million, he’s that good.” ",positive

With Champions League qualification all but beyond them following defeats at Liverpool and Arsenal, interim boss Ralf Rangnick’s side escaped with a point on a night dominated for the most part by Thomas Tuchel’s Blues. Resilience makes Emma Hayes’ Chelsea the favourites over Arsenal in tight WSL title race Marcos Alonso’s volley was the only goal wasteful Chelsea managed against United’s porous defence and that was cancelled out two minutes later as star man Ronaldo struck to seal a 1-1 draw. The build-up was dominated by news that Rangnick was considering taking over as Austria manager and protests against the Glazer family’s ownership at a second-straight home match. ‘Glazers out’ read a banner above the tunnel before kick-off at Old Trafford, where a mixture of David De Gea’s saves and poor-decision making meant Chelsea failed to turn their 11 shots into a deserved lead. Tuchel’s men finally broke the deadlock when Alonso volleyed home in the 60th minute but it did not kick open the floodgates. Instead, former Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic’s clipped ball put Ronaldo through to equalise. Outstanding Reece James struck the post in the closing stages but United, without eight players on Thursday, somehow ended Chelsea’s club record run of eight-successive away wins in all competitions. It was one-way traffic in the first half, with James stinging De Gea’s palms from 20 yards before slipping in Timo Werner to get away a low shot on goal. Appreciating 🤝🔴#MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/8vqdwln3LA — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 Man Utd managed to avoid conceding inside the opening five minutes in a third-successive match, but the space Chelsea continued to find was alarming. Kai Havertz directed the ball wide after stand-in United skipper Bruno Fernandes saw a tame header saved at the other end, with Ronaldo clobbering a hopeful overhead kick off target. They were rare voyages forwards by United as Chelsea all too easily found space and created chances. De Gea raged at his defence when N’Golo Kante got a shot on target as protesters entered the ground, having missed a minute for each of the Glazers’ 17 years in charge. There were continued chants against United’s owners as the team struggled, with Havertz lashing an effort into the side-netting after Chelsea broke through the giants gaps left by the home side on a rapid counter. Next it was De Gea denying the Germany international, who was played through by Kante but could not beat the outstretched goalkeeper. Tuchel looked furious on the touchline. A wicked James cross just evaded fellow wing-back Alonso at the far post as the Chelsea onslaught continued, with De Gea denying Havertz as he stretched to reach a close-range header. Somehow United managed to go into half-time with the match still scoreless. Mason Mount dragged a chance wide 34 seconds into the second half as Chelsea continued to toy with the home side, who had Fernandes to thank for getting back and prevent Havertz putting Kante free. Werner just failed to get a stud on a whipped Mount cross but United’s goal would finally be breached in the 60th minute. James was given time to float over a cross from the right that Havertz flicked on for Alonso to hit a crashing volley at the far post.  But Man Utd are a peculiar side and have an unrelenting great leading the line. Some sloppy possession allowed Matic to put Ronaldo behind with a clever pass, with the veteran lashing home a 62nd-minute equaliser in front of the Stretford End. Matic and James tangled and De Gea shoved Mount as things became heated between two frustrated teams. Boos greeted former United striker Romelu Lukaku’s introduction as he came on with Christian Pulisic in a bid to swing the match back Chelsea’s way. James came agonisingly close to putting the visitors back ahead in the 80th minute, but his beautiful left-footed effort curled onto the post. Victor Lindelof saw a stoppage-time header denied and the highlight of the closing stages the introduction of exciting 17-year-old talent Alejandro Garnacho for his United debut.  ",positive

The former Republic of Ireland international played 480 times for the Red Devils over 13 seasons, winning seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League. He played alongside a number of amazing players during his time at Old Trafford and Sky Sports asked him to pick hisgreatest Man Utd XI of the Premier League era on their Monday Night Football show. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United. Brucey was a good player and a brilliant player.” “We’d obviously play with a high line!” 🤣 David Beckham 🌟 Rooney 🙌 @GNev2 👀 Roy Keane reveals his ULTIMATE Man Utd Premier League XI 🤩 pic.twitter.com/7nhb19EljG — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 Scholes and Nicky Butt were two more Man Utd legends to miss out on Keane’s team but he just couldn’t see past Robson and Ince in centre midfield. Keane continued: “I’m certainly not going to pick myself. Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and a very good team-mate.” On leaving Cantona out, Keane said: “Eric was a brilliant player for Man United. I’m upset to leave Eric out. Eric was a brilliant character and produced in the big games.”  ",positive

But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games.

So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive

475,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-haaland-manchester-city-sporting-sportswashing-triumph,Haaland to City could be sporting and sportswashing triumph,"Erling Haaland seems Manchester City-bound, which seems a little bit at odds with Norwegian opposition to Qatar. According to some media outlets, the deal is just about done. Erling Braut Haaland, the Ivan Drago of European football, will be a Manchester City player next season, with City having apparently met the €75m (£62m, at current exchange rates) release clause in the 21-year-old striker’s contract with Borussia Dortmund. The £62m fee under-values the player at current market rates, but this doesn’t mean that Haaland will come cheap. The agent Mino Raiola has to get his cut, and if the quoted wage of £500,000 a week is correct, then City’s financial outlay for his wages alone on a five-year contract will be more than £130m, pushing the overall cost to more than £200m. In the super-heated world of elite football finances, quality does not come cheap. Everybody already knows what Manchester City will be getting for their money. Haaland is only 21 years old, yet he has already managed just about a goal a game throughout his career, with 82 in 85 for Borussia Dortmund and 15 in 17 for the Norwegian national team. An almost immeasurably strong team will be made even stronger. Now let’s talk sportswashing because we must continue to talk sportswashing or we are part of the problem. Haaland is Norwegian and Norwegian football has been at the forefront of protests against this winter’s World Cup finals being held in Qatar. When Norway played Gibraltar and Turkey in international friendlies in March 2021, for example, their players took to the pitch wearing t-shirts with ‘Human rights on and off the pitch’ emblazoned across them. Under a threat of being banned from the 2026 World Cup by FIFA, the Norwegian FA eventually voted to continue anyway, but it all ended up somewhat academic; Norway finished in third place in their group and failed even to make the play-offs. The words printed on Haaland’s t-shirt will be ringing pretty empty if he signs for City, but none of this should be surprising; if there’s one lesson that the 21st century should have taught all of us, it’s that the human rights of others usually take a distant second place to someone throwing astronomical amounts of money at you. And perhaps the Haaland headlines will distract from some of the less favourable headlines that the United Arab Emirates have been making of late, and since Sheikh Mansour, the owner of the Abu Dhabi United Group, is the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, minister of presidential affairs, the half-brother of the current President of the UAE, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and is married to one of the daughters of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, it probably does warrant a mention.  The UAE’s prevarication over Russia’s invasion and subsequent destruction of Ukraine has led to a reappraisal of where the Emirati sees its future international relationships, with further fault-lines over their normalisation of relationships with noted warmonger President Assad of Syria and their involvement in the war in Yemen. If anything, relations between the countries of the west and of the Middle East seem likely to take a sharp downward turn over the coming years. The growth in the potential for hostility has also been put under the spotlight by allegations that the British government was targeted by spyware attacks emanating from the UAE in a report by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which claimed that ‘in 2020 and 2021 we observed and notified the government of the United Kingdom of multiple suspected instances of Pegasus spyware infections within official UK networks’ and that the ‘suspected infection at the UK prime minister’s office was associated with a Pegasus operator we link to the UAE.’ The uncomfortable headlines have spread as far as Manchester City, with further allegations having been made by the German news outlet Der Spiegel about the relationship between Abu Dhabi and the club. These include claims that the club liaised with a government agency to fulfil payments to the club owed by a private company under the control of Sheikh Mansour, that they paid transfer fees for under-age players, and that they supplemented the wages of former manager Roberto Mancini by means of a secret consultancy contract. Manchester City’s biggest opposition in the acquisition of Haaland had been Real Madrid, but it has been reported that they are entirely focussed on seeking to persuade Kylian Mbappe that his future would be better served in Madrid than in Paris. Real have made repeated attempts to prise Mbappe from PSG, including a €50m offer in the January transfer window despite the fact that his contract expires this summer. This offer was rejected, but the transfer merry-go-round seems set to spin at an extremely high velocity. From an entirely footballing perspective, the deal for Haaland makes perfect sense. Manchester City have been playing without a ‘recognised’ striker all season, though it should be noted that this hasn’t prevented them from scoring 118 goals in all competitions, and Haaland is likely the best fit to complete that particular jigsaw. There are one or two potential clouds on the horizon, not least of which is that he has appeared somewhat injury-prone throughout his short career, and it’s worth pondering how the highly physical Premier League will impact upon this. But the size of the release clause makes Haaland a steal in a world in which clubs will drop nine figures on players such as Jack Grealish. But it is ultimately difficult to detach this signing from all the sportswashing. Don’t worry about the links to despots like Assad and Putin or the spying on the British government; concentrate on the shiny new footballer instead. There will be plenty on hand to tell us just how great it is ‘for the Premier League’ that such a player as Haaland is coming to these shores, but these takes will overlook that his arrival at this particular club at this particular time may well prove to be a significant milestone on the road to the elimination of competitive balance within the league. Manchester City’s thinking on the subject might well be, appropriately enough, that ‘if it dies, it dies’.  ",positive

Jesus has been heavily linked with a move to the Gunners of late. Fabrizio Romano revealed back in March that he would be available for around £50m. Man City paid £27m to sign Jesus fromPalmeiras in 2016. He has grabbed 95 goals and 46 assists from his 232 outings for the English side. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Jesus has been in fantastic form in recent weeks. He scored four goals against Watford last month and he netted against Real Madrid at the Etihad. Meanwhile, Man City are closing in on the signing of Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. Di Marzio has suggested that Jesus would be “difficult” to replace if he joined Arsenal: “Seeing [Gabriel Jesus] playing against Real Madrid, I don’t think Guardiola will allow him to leave, even if they sign Haaland. Which they will, because they are very, very close,” Di Marzio told wettfreunde. “They still need another striker. A different type of striker. Haaland is a different type. [Gabriel Jesus] will stay because it’s difficult to find a player like him. Manchester City doesn’t need to sell a player in order to get funds to buy another player. They have the possibility to buy all the players they want. “It depends on Gabriel Jesus in the end and if he is okay with playing less with Haaland coming. It depends on his attitude, knowing another incredible striker like Haaland will arrive.” Di Marzio went onto suggest that Haaland may not “arrive and play immediately” next season: “When Jack Grealish arrived last year for £100m, Gabriel Jesus stayed, and now he’s playing and Grealish is on the bench. So nobody knows if Haaland will arrive and play immediately, and be one of the ‘untouchable’ strikers of Guardiola. “You never know with [Guardiola]. If you don’t do the right tactical movements that Guardiola wants, then you stay on the bench. “I think Gabriel Jesus is in the perfect situation now in Guardiola’s system. He understands, probably for the first time, what Guardiola is asking him to do.” ",positive
477,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-united-risk-executive-stress-over-retaining-ed-woodward,Man United risk executive stress over retaining Ed Woodward,"Press reports earlier this year announced the resignation of Ed Woodward from Manchester United at the end of 2021 but he may not be going very far after all. It was one of those moments that came and went in such a way that it prompted a double-take. In the slipstream of the announcement of the European Super League at the end of April, there was an outpouring of anger from supporters at the decision taken by England’s six biggest clubs to unilaterally break away to join the new competition. Among the angriest protests of all came at Old Trafford, before a scheduled Premier League match between Manchester United and Liverpool on May 2. Supporters protested outside the stadium before breaking in, getting onto the pitch and into the stands. Kick-off was first delayed, but it didn’t take long before the match was postponed, eventually being played 11 days after its originally scheduled date. One of the more surprising effects of the implosion of the European Super League at the end of last season was the contrition. Liverpool’s John W Henry issued an infamous apology in which he looked like he may well have been kidnapped himself. Spurs hastily arranged meetings between the club and supporters groups. And at Manchester United, Ed Woodward fell on his sword. Well… almost. There was always something eyebrow-raising about the non-resignation of Ed Woodward. At the time, this was spun very much as a matter of conscience over the European Super League decision. Consider, for example, this contemporaneous report from Sky Sports: ‘Man Utd executive vice-chairman resigned over belief he could not support Super League plans’. Seems pretty conclusive, doesn’t it? It took six months for the truth to come out. The Athletic wrote a lengthy report (£) which filled in some of the blanks regarding what happened at the time, notably that Luke Shaw had accused Woodward of treating the players ‘like children’ during the meeting about the decision to sign up to the competition without consulting with them in any way whatsoever. Woodward’s involvement in the plot was laid bare, including details of meetings with the government and the sheer duplicity of how the league came about in terms of the clubs’ dealings with UEFA at the time. The key detail in all of this was something that was given a bit of a pass. Ed Woodward didn’t resign as executive vice chairman of Manchester United in April; he announced that he would be leaving his post at the end of this year. Indeed, Woodward has returned to Old Trafford this season, for United’s home matches against Newcastle – which marked Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to the club – and then again for the home match against Aston Villa.  But now we’re in the last few weeks of this year, and talk is starting to grow that Woodward is going to be staying on after all. The Daily Mail reports that he is now in talks with the club about staying on in a consultancy role after he formally leaves his executive position, and this is already causing a familiar outrage among Manchester United supporters. The article itself says that ‘insiders say it is commonplace when chief executives leave a company to strike an agreement which allows the firm to call upon their knowledge if required’, but this raises questions of its own. The impression given from the reporting of Woodward’s initial resignation was that he had fallen on his sword, with the implication of it being a clean break. Talk of him leaving at the end of the year was tolerated by supporters on the implicit understanding that finding a replacement for an executive position might be a lengthy process, and one which should not be rushed. At no point at that time was it mentioned that, ‘Oh, by the way, it’s pretty common in business for resigning executives to be kept on in a non-executive capacity’. Indeed, in these particular circumstances, it is not unreasonable to assume that the resignee would not be taking on such a position, even if it is common business practice to do so. This could be extrapolated further as yet another example of the way in which corporate practices themselves are broken, and of how executives routinely look after their own. It may well be legal. It may well be normal business practice. But this doesn’t make it right, and when we look back over that period, the whole process – the resignation (with a caveat that it’ll be later in the year) followed by reports several months later that he’s going to retain some form of influence within the club – looks shady and duplicitous, as if it was always the plan to give the impression that he was resigning as an acknowledgement of the vast anger over both the European Super League and the way in which Manchester United have been run for years, while changing as little as possible in actual, practical terms. Ed Woodward has come to be symbolic of the pall that has descended over Old Trafford in recent years, a world in which official noodle partners and social media brand engagement are at least as important as winning football matches. At Manchester United, the anti-European Super League protests had the extra edge of that context behind them, a bubbling well of anger that has been simmering for years and has occasionally come to blowing altogether. Manchester’s history of radicalism stretches back a long way, and one particular story springs immediately to mind. In 1976, The Sex Pistols crash-landed into British pop culture with a show at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester to 40 people, a show which is widely thought to have blown punk rock in this country. But less than two years later the band were at the point of collapse, and at the end of what would turn out to be their last show, at the Winterland in San Francisco, a weary Johnny Rotten asked the audience, ‘Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?’ Manchester United supporters who’d been expecting Ed Woodward to be gone from Old Trafford by the end of this year might well be thinking exactly that.

The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive

It was confirmed last month that Ten Hag will become the new permanent Red Devils boss once the current campaign ends with interim manager Ralf Rangnick heading into a consultancy role. Rangnick had sparked rumours there could be a major overhaul of the playing staff in the next transfer window when he claimed there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope However, a report in ESPN last week insisted that Man Utd have moved to distance themselves from Rangnick’s claims and instead expect to sign three players. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino toldThe Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks). He is brilliant at keeping the ball and helping his team dictate play. “I can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy him.” Redknapp recently told Ten Hag to sign “good, honest pros” as his priority in the summer transfer window after rumours of unrest in the Man Utd dressing room this season. “Ten Hag will need to have a look at the players he wants to keep,” Redknapp toldSky Sports. “As bad as things are at the moment, things can change quickly with one or two good signings. “Who do you get? It’s not easy but the ideal one is Declan Rice, and West Ham fans won’t thank me for this. “You want good, honest pros who can really play, people like Rice. That’s the market they’ve got to be looking for, that can work hard in training and play the right way. “Could you go and get Harry Kane from Tottenham this summer? I’m not saying he’s going to leave but that’s the sort of player you are going to need, players that will come in and set the right culture.” ",positive

A temporary amendment to the rules had been implemented to increase the number of substitutions from three when football resumed in the summer of 2020 following its mid-season suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The changes were extended last summer by the International Football Association Board’s advisory panel for a further 18 months before a permanent decision was made in October to keep the option of using five substitutes in place. Liverpool trio among Europe’s top five for most appearances… However, despite clubs across Europe following IFAB’s proposal, the Premier League had decided against using the recommendations for the 2020-21 campaign and instead reverted back to three substitutions. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp and Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola were both critics of not adopting the changes for the current domestic league campaign when it was allowed in European competitions as well as for England’s domestic cup fixtures. Premier League Shareholders met today and discussed a range of matters. Clubs agreed to change the rules relating to substitute players.

Following further discussions on Thursday, it was decided to adopt the new regulations from the start of the 2022-2023 campaign which will be officially implemented at the annual general meeting. The Premier League also confirmed the 2022 summer transfer window will open on June 10 and close at 11pm BST on September 1, which will bring it in line with other European leagues, while Covid-19 protocols will move to symptomatic testing of players and staff rather than twice-weekly.

The Government has placed the club under a special licence after sanctioning owner Roman Abramovich over his ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The licence is designed to prevent Chelsea – and by extension Abramovich – generating any new revenue, including from ticket sales. READ MORE: Ten stars who would solve issues if they were ten years younger Chelsea released a statement on Monday afternoon saying they were pressing the Government for the right to sell tickets, and that the club were holding daily meetings to get the licence amended. The club also revealed the Premier League and the FA had raised concerns over the licence, which prevents Chelsea selling new tickets to home areas of the ground, to away supporters visiting Stamford Bridge or to Chelsea fans wishing to watch their team on the road. “We are pressing the Government to allow our supporters to have access to tickets,” the club statement said. “Meetings are taking place daily in search of a resolution. In addition, the Premier League and FA are also discussing with the Government the sporting integrity issues raised if they do not permit fans to attend. “We are aware of the high level of frustration our supporters are facing over this issue, and we are doing everything we can to resolve it as soon as possible.” The licence has already been amended since it was first imposed, with the limit on matchday spending increased from £500,000 to £900,000, and the club have already insisted they will push to have it further amended in order for them to be able to operate as close to normal as possible. The club said they were awaiting further updates from the Government regarding the sale of further tickets for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough this weekend. Meanwhile, Chelsea fans have again been urged to stop chanting Abramovich’s name. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said it was “completely inappropriate” to sing in support of the billionaire, who has brought unprecedented success to Chelsea since he bought the club in 2003. Downing Street said supporters should not let that blind them to Abramovich’s association to Putin, the man who ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We recognise the strength of feeling around people’s clubs, but that does not excuse behaviour which is completely inappropriate at this time,” the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. “I think people can show passion and support for their club without resorting to that sort of stuff.” The Government has said it is still “open” to Chelsea being sold but that a new application would be needed to enable a sale. So far, the spokesman said, the club had not applied for a variation to its strict special licence. “We are open to the sale of the club, we would consider an application for a licence to allow that to happen in the right circumstances,” the spokesman said. “But it is for Chelsea to determine the exact process. My understanding is potential buyers would approach the club, who would then need to apply for a further amended licence to facilitate the sale. “As far as I’m aware that hasn’t happened at this point.” ",positive
482,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-man-utd-ten-hag-liverpool-chelsea-2-4-arsenal-reaction,Reasons for optimism over the state of Man Utd…,"One Mailboxer isn’t panicking like many Man Utd fans over their current state of shambles, while we also have missives in reaction to Tuchel getting it all wrong against Arsenal. Get your mails in to theeditor@football365.com… Reason for United optimism Like many others, I noticed that Man Utd were rubbish on Tuesday night. Without their best centre back (Varane). And best left back (Shaw). And two preferred central midfielders (I struggle to describe McFred as “best”, although that’s probably true). And best centre forward (Ronaldo). Under an ineffectual interim manager. The night after a team member’s son died. Against quite possibly the best team in the world. The consensus is that last night showed us the true picture of where United are now. The team is a shambles. Bad with the ball. Bad without the ball. Gutless. A disgrace. I understand the reaction. They were very poor. But as bad as United have been this season, they’re almost exactly as good as Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham, and they’re better than everyone else outside The Big Three. Everyone seems to just shrug this off as a minor anomaly in the Unified Theory of United Rubbishness. But it’s not an anomaly, it disproves the theory. Rubbish teams aren’t better than most other teams, so Man United aren’t rubbish. They’re just a lot worse than we expect them to be. If “United consistently perform below expectations” generated more clicks, we would all have a different view of this situation. The click-bait that F365 so enjoys calling out has created an environment around United that’s so febrile the entire football community has come to accept something that can be disproved just by looking at the league table. That’s the reason for optimism. As bad as United have been relative to our collective expectations of them, they’re still better than almost everyone else. I can hear Johny Nic beating away, on his keyboard, thinking about the financial chasm between teams and the impact this has on sporting outcomes, but that’s another argument for another day (unless you’re Johny, in which case it’s always an argument for right now). In De Gea, Varane, Bruno and potentially Sancho they have a spine of top quality players on long term deals. Add to that McFred and Lindelof who clearly aren’t top level but are functional and at least try, and appear to be decent characters. Then there’s the English lads – Shaw, Maguire and Rashford – who shouldn’t be beyond salvaging from their current malaise. And DVB – has to be a player in there somewhere and Ten Hag has a better chance of finding him than most. Those players supplemented by the youth – Elanga, Williams, Garner, Tuanzebe (not really a youth), Mejbri, Pellistri – should be enough to compete for minor European places with proper coaching. Obviously you would want to bring some players in, but only a few. I was going to suggest some names but hopefully they’re young players I’ve barely heard of who have the right mental as well as physical attributes, and maybe a Tielemans type signing if one is available for a reasonable fee. With the players who leave, you’ve offset the cost of missing out on the Champions League in saved wages alone. Then you see who makes it from the young players, let the world see the style of play the manager is implementing, and start adding the extra quality needed to be back in Champions League contention the next season. That kind of rebuild is probably unthinkable to those in charge of the club, but the opportunity is there for them. As this season has proved, they can be bad and still be better than almost everyone else. Embracing a drastic rebuild now doesn’t have to make them any worse than they are currently, and it could make them better much faster than people are predicting.Andy B – London (note, better doesn’t mean as good as this Liverpool, they are really, really good)  Pity party This is an email about pity, which hurts most of all. What has bothered me most in the fallout from the most recent shallacking is the wave of pity that has befallen our club. Pity is rarely bestowed upon equals, or those who have a perception of parity. The knowing smirks among Liverpool players. The head tilt from Klopp to Rangnick with arms outstretched, like an old family member seeing someone for the first time in twenty years at a funeral. The old, “It’s wonderful to see you but it’s a shame it’s under these circumstances”. The hugs after the whistle between the two teams. Liverpool players almost looking too embarrassed to celebrate, like they had just beaten Sydney FC in the Steve Finnan pre-season cup somewhere in Middle Earth. For comparison, go back and watch the immediate aftermath of the 2009 loss at OT to Pool or the 6-1 loss to City in 2011. The opposition dancing around like they had conquered Goliath, our players leaving the field as if SAF was running punishment training at Carrington in fifteen minutes. SAF rushing a handshake as though he was playing fingers are lava. What is worse is the self-pity shown by the players, throwing hands up in the air, kicking posts and signage, looking up to the heavens for respite (little do they know that Cantona is still here with us on earth). True rivals do not pity each other. They f*cking hate one another. I want to be goaded when I go to work the day after a loss from my scouse mate knowing that one day I’ll be able to return the favour. All I got in the coffee room was a light pat on the back – condescending as though a heavier touch from him would destroy my remaining spirit. He couldn’t offer me the milk quick enough before putting it back in the fridge. So here we are, the pitied ones. One of the world’s most well-known teams, with replica jerseys of replica jerseys walking around every corner of the Earth. Even Roy Keane is broken. What a pity.Aidan  Shopping in the budget aisle It must be hard, Colin Crust, to face your team shopping in the “middle basket”, as they’re not the type of players that could get you top four. You certainly couldn’t get top four, win the premier league or the Champions League with off-brand players like relegated Hull’s Andy Robertson, or Southampton’s erratic Sadio Mane. Failed youngsters like Mohammed Salah and Jordan Henderson won’t work, nor will a faded journeyman such as James Milner. If he was any good, his club wouldn’t have let him go. Heaven forfend you buy a player from German nobodies, Hoffenheim or Schalk, and end up with a non-scoring striker like Firmino or a centre half that keeps charging off into the distance, like Joel Matip. It’s only trusted, world class, readymade stars that could ever get you there. Manchester United should try that for once. I’m sure there are some big stars out there. Heck, I hear France’s talismanic playmaker is about to be available for a free… and he counts as homegrown! You numpty.Andrew M Rangnick’s ten-man shortlist on Man Utd’s £20m budget  United reflect Prem weakness When people complain of it being a “weaker” Premier League this season, I think what they’re getting at is that *this* Manchester United side are still within touching distance of a top-four finish. *This* Manchester United “team” who turned in *that* non-performance at Anfield last night is somehow still in contention to be playing Champions League football next season. Say no more.Lee, not the Liverpool fan one who seems to write in every day  Soz, Solskjaer F365 and Sarah Winterburn absolutely owe an unconditional apology to Solskjaer. It seems the PE fraudster who kept harping on about DNA and nostalgia wasn’t really the problem after all. Everything that went well under him was despite him only due to Bruno, it’s the same Bruno now isn’t it? Everything that didn’t work was his fault, yet we’ve become even more worse than ever before. That first half, I haven’t ever seen anything that bad all my life, they were bloody scared of football! Statements coming from the club that it won’t take us 30 years ffs the delusion of grandeur! I don’t remember Liverpool being this atrocious during our dominant period. They were poor but at least they put in the effort and the fight!Manyooligan SoC  Shocking oversight Have to say I was appalled at the Sky Sports punditry team toward the end of Tuesday night’s game – Hannibal Mejbri running around like a headless chicken, picks up a yellow card and is only saved a second one after a stern talking-to from Martin Atkinson, and nobody can come up with ‘Hannibal Lecture’ to mention in commentary? Poor.Dave Horgan, Dublin Tuchel f***ed it Tuchel has to shoulder the blame for that defensive “masterclass”. As soon as the line ups were released, it was obvious that Chelsea would lose. How on earth he expected to win with that defence, I’ll never know. The only positive, hopefully this contributes towards Tottenham not getting 4th, although at this point, I’m not sure if Chelsea will even manage it…James, Gravesend, CFC  …Sometimes all you can do is sit back and laugh, the best one liner from the game is when Thomas Tuchel is blaming the quality of the pitch, Chelsea played at Stamford Bridge….. Frustrating when we have seen the performance we put in against Real Madrid but then witness the comedy that was tonight, fair play to Arsenal though hopefully we still finish in the Top 4, but anything is possible if we play as poorly as that again.The Admin @ At The Bridge Pod  Chelsea are safe Betteridge’s law of headlines: Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word “no”. Headline: Have Arsenal turned this into a race for two CL places? Answer: No Let’s be realistic. Chelsea are 5 points ahead with a game in hand. Even if they had an absolute stinker and from their final 7 games picked up 3 wins, a draw and 3 defeats they’d still finish with 72 points. That would mean Arsenal and Spurs both would need 16 out of a possible 18 points to overtake them (as Chelsea have a far superior goal difference). Given that Arsenal and Spurs are still to play each other, they’d both need to win all their games and draw the North London Derby for that to happen. For Chelsea to finish 5th, they’d have to suffer a catastrophic loss of form and would need Spurs AND Arsenal to pick up close to maximum points. There is absolutely nothing in the form of those teams to suggest that’s about to happen.Mike, LFC, London  Optimistic Gunner I’m not too surprised by Arsenal’s win over Chelsea, we’ve become something of their bogey team over the last couple of years, winning 3 of the last 4 league games against them + the FA Cup final win against them 20 months ago. I have been a huge lover of the 3-4-3 (or 3-4-1-2) formation for well over a decade. I am always surprised that more teams don’t use it and I was not surprised at Conte’s Chelsea demonstrating their dominance in 2017 when he reintroduced it to the English League and had so many teams copy the formation. I really think that is the way for Arsenal to go for the season’s remainder, especially considering the leaky defence and losing 4 out of 5 games in the last month. Holding can actually win headers, catering for Ben White’s weakness. With Partey out, an extra CB helps cover Xhaka’s ineptitude (pleeeeeeease sell him in the next window, Mikel). 3-4-3 would set the team up for Saliba to slot into the back line next season alongside White and Gabriel. It has also freshened up our attack, as seen with Saka’s free-roaming role at Stamford Bridge fresh with the knowledge that Elneny and White would slot in if he was caught out of position, and Martinelli and Smith-Rowe in theory being able to play in the midfield 4 or the front 3. Nketiah finally scores in the league (it’s April), yes we need him and Laca to do a job for the last few rounds but a team who wants to finish top 4 should not have Nketiah, Laca or Xhaka in the starting 11. Darwin Nunez would be a dream signing but honestly the Arsenal transfer team need to work a few miracles to get signings in for next season after the weak showing in the last few weeks. I think it really is a coin toss at the moment between Arsenal and Spurs for 4th (surely Chelsea don’t let a 5 point lead slip this late in the season…) Finally, on Arteta. 4th would be an exceptional achievement considering preseason expectations. This is his second full season at Arsenal, plus he actually has won a trophy or 2 already, unlike Solskjaer or the ridiculously-overrated Pocchetino at Spurs. Along with most Arsenal fans, I think finishing 5th or 6th will still be seen as progress and we would then be back playing in Europe with the aim of springboarding into the top 4 next season.Andrew M, AFC (Looks like it could be an extremely tasty NLD in a few weeks), Australia  ",positive

Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

Elsewhere, City are sniffing around Declan Rice… RASHFORD TO BE USED AS BARCA BAIT Manchester United have already rolled back on Ralf Rangnick’s assertion last week that Manchester United could recruit ‘six, eight, 10’ players this summer by briefing that three new signings is a more realistic ambition. A centre-back is known to be one of the priority positions – again – and ESPN says Villarreal defender Pau Torres is known to be on the list of possible targets. Ajax’s Jurrien Timber is also said to have been approached by intermediaries. If at least one midfielder doesn’t arrive, Erik ten Hag might as well not bother boarding the plane to Manchester. This morning, in keeping with the Dutch theme, there is renewed talk of a move for Frenkie De Jong. According to El Chiringuito, Barcelona are prepared to let De Jong leave this summer for a fee in the region of £58million. Rather than stump up the cash, Fichajes reckons United might put together a package including Marcus Rashford and Alex Telles to trade in exchange for the former Ajax midfielder.  Premier League winners and losers  POGBA CHECKS OUT AFTER REAL, PSG OFFERS United need midfielders as a priority with Nemanja Matic having confirmed already that he will leave, adding to a shortage of manpower in the Old Trafford engine room. Paul Pogba is off too. The France star is yet to confirm as much but there is no chance he will sign a new contract and will instead leave as a free agent. The Mirror says Pogba has already begun the exit process by leaving the squad’s WhatsApp group having received contract offers from elsewhere. Apparently, both Real Madrid and PSG have put terms to Pogba, which you can bet are not as lucrative as Mino Raiola might have hoped when the possibility of free-agency became a realistic prospect.  WARY CITY PONDER RICE MOVE United, of course, remain keen on Declan Rice and Harry Kane, but ESPN says but West Ham and Tottenham have made it known that only a mind-blowing offer would tempt either club into selling the England stars. West Ham’s stance doesn’t appear to have put off Manchester City. Pep Guardiola has been a long-term admirer of Rice, along with United and Chelsea, and The Telegraph says City are weighing up the prospect of moving for the £150million-rated midfielder this summer. City, though, are said to be wary of being dragged into another saga like the Kane palaver last summer when Tottenham stuck to their guns and refused to negotiate over the the striker. After stumping up early for Jack Grealish, City dragged their heels over Kane and Spurs stood firm. With Erling Haaland set to arrive early this summer, City don’t fancy a repeat of last year’s shenanigans, however much Pep fancies Rice in his midfield. ",positive

The signings of Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho in the summer was meant to catapult the Red Devils into the Premier League title mix. But it has had the opposite impact with Man Utd going backwards this season after finishing last campaign in second place. Man Utd duo join Everton’s Gordon in Prem weekend’s worst XI… Ralf Rangnick’s side currently find themselves in sixth position in the Premier League and crucially trail fourth-placed Arsenal – who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot – by six points. The interim boss will be replaced by Ten Hag in the summer with Man Utd announcing last week that the Dutchman has signed a deal until the summer of 2025, with an option of a further year. After losing 4-0 to Liverpool recently, Rangnick insisted that Man Utd could bring in as many as ten players in the summer with the squad needing a complete overhaul. He said: “If you analyse the situation it is not difficult… for me, it is clear there will be six, seven, eight, maybe ten new players. Before you sign those players you need to be aware how you want to play.” However, ESPN now claim that United have told Ten Hag that ‘he will have to oversee an evolution rather than revolution of the squad when he takes over’ with club chiefs ‘distancing themselves’ from Rangnick’s suggestion of a high volume of new signings. Ten Hag will be given ‘significant funds’ with the recruitment team ‘working to a plan of bringing in three new players’ in the summer window. The Dutchman’s summer budget has been ‘set at between £100m and £150m’ and the current Ajax boss ‘will get a veto on any signings’. ESPN add that Ten Hag’s budget will be ‘bolstered by any outgoings and the club are willing to listen to offers forEric Bailly,Phil Jones,Anthony Martial,Alex TellesandAaron Wan-Bissaka.’ Rangnick expressed his embarrassment at their performance against Liverpool earlier this month and claimed Man Utd are six years behind their arch-rivals. “It’s embarrassing, it’s completely disappointing, in a way also humiliating,” Rangnick told beIN Sports. “We have to accept Liverpool are six years ahead of us. “When you compare that squad that Liverpool has to the one Jurgen Klopp inherited when he came six years ago… At the end of his first season, they finished eighth, had a point average of 1.6. This is roughly where we are right now with our current team. “This team needs to be rebuilt, it’s clear. A game like the one today showed that even in a drastic way that this rebuild is necessary.” ",negative
486,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-quadruple-horribly-wrong-manchester-united-city-chelsea,Warnings from history: Where previous QUAD BIDS went horribly wrong,"Oh for fu… Okay, go on then. We’re going to have to talk about Quadruples whether you, I or Jurgen Klopp like it or not. The simple fact is that Liverpool have won the Carabao while remaining in contention for all the other pots and pans and that means we will have headlines like ‘FAB FOUR’ and ‘FOUR SIGHT’ and ‘Liverpool Chase Historic Quadruple After Edging Out Norwich To Reach FA Cup Quarter-Final’ right up until they are out of contention for one such pot (or pan). The thing about the Quadruple is that nobody ever wins it because, clearly, winning all four tournaments in one season is rock hard. But everything is impossible until it is done, and plenty of teams have come pretty close and not all of them are Manchester City. So let’s look back at previous QUAD BIDS and how each and every one ended in shameful, dismal failure. Manchester United, 1998/99Premier League: WonFA Cup: WonChampions League: WonLeague Cup: Quarter-finals A philosophical question for you: if a Quadruple bid ends before anyone even actually realises it’s started, does it make a sound? Clearly, nobody was talking about a Quadruple – or even a Treble for that matter – when Manchester United travelled to White Hart Lane in December 1998 for a League Cup quarter-final against Spurs. They were third in the league, five points behind leaders Aston Villa, hadn’t started their FA Cup campaign and were not yet certain of qualification from a Champions League Group of Death alongside Bayern Munich and Barcelona. But given everything that happened across the rest of that season, and while acknowledging that the Butterfly Effect applies to quickfire Chris Armstrong doubles after half-time every bit as much as it does to the flapping wings of world-destroying insects, you could make a decent case that this is actually the closest anyone has ever come and they didn’t even know it. Sure, maybe the distraction of a two-legged semi-final against Wimbledon and a final against Leicester might have derailed United’s loftier ambitions but also, probably not. And given that even a phenomenally mediocre Spurs team managed to negotiate those games and actually win themselves a trophy (arguably a more notable thing than United’s Treble) you’d have to imagine an all-conquering United would also have done so. Essentially it boils down to this: all else being equal, United only needed to see off teams who finished the season 11th, 16th and 10th to add a final (but first) coat of shiny gloss to their greatest ever season.  Arsenal, 2003/04Premier League: WonFA Cup: Semi-finalsChampions League: Quarter-finalsLeague Cup: Semi-finals Bit harsh maybe to sully an unbeaten Premier League season with ‘What if?’ chatter, but Arsenal really were a few moments here and there away from something even more spectacular. If you take an unbeaten league season as the baseline, then ending the season with only one trophy isn’t great is it? You know, relatively speaking. All three cups were distinctly winnable as well. This season’s Big Six botherers-in-chief Middlesbrough were Arsenal’s destroyers back then as well, beating the so-called ‘Invincibles’ home and away in the League Cup semi-final and then going on to defeat Bolton at the Millennium Stadium. Arsenal should definitely have won that one, really. Old rivals Manchester United knocked Arsenal out at the same stage of the FA Cup, but it was the Champions League – the one trophy that continues to elude Arsenal – that was perhaps the real near-miss of that season. Wayne Bridge’s 87th-minute goal secured victory for Chelsea at Highbury in a wide-open tournament that ended with Jose Mourinho and Porto beating Monaco in the final. So, in summary: Arsenal’s Invincibles are massive, massive frauds. Next.  Chelsea, 2006/07Premier League: 2ndFA Cup: WinnersChampions League: Semi-finalsLeague Cup: Winners In terms of keeping the dream alive as long as possible, few QUAD TILTS can match Chelsea’s 2006/07 effort even if they ultimately missed out on the two biggest gongs. Jose Mourinho’s teak-tough bastards got all the way to May with the Quad still very much on having pocketed the League Cup and reached the FA Cup final – which they would also go on to win – while battling with Manchester United for the league title. Liverpool awaited in the Champions League semi-final. Chelsea led 1-0 after the first leg at Stamford Bridge, but Daniel Agger’s goal levelled the tie at Anfield and ultimately sent it to penalties where Arjen Robben and Geremi misses left Liverpool 4-1 winners. The crestfallen Blues then drew their three remaining Premier League games – making it five league draws in a row – as Manchester United took the title.  Manchester United, 2008/09Premier League: WonFA Cup: Semi-finalsChampions League: Runner-up League Cup: Won Ten years after being denied by Spurs in their previous quad hunt, United got revenge – it was all anybody could talk about in the build-up – by beating Tottenham on penalties in the League Cup final thanks to some Ben Foster heroics. It all went tits up in April, though, when United failed to recreate that shoot-out success after another goalless 120 minutes against Everton in the FA Cup semi-final. United did win eight of their last nine games to secure the Premier League title, including that weird week where Federico Macheda became the most important footballer in the country, but failed to defend their Champions League crown after getting schooled by absolutely peak Barcelona in the final. No shame in that, of course. That defeat to Everton, taking with it the chance of an at-the-time-unprecedented domestic treble, constitutes the real dropped bollock here.  Manchester City, 2013/14Premier League: WonFA Cup: Quarter-finalsChampions League: Last 16League Cup: Won Not that close really, but still notable for being the first time City’s obvious brilliance prompted chatter around their potential to scoop the lot. Wigan were City’s nemesis at the time, though. Having hilariously and inexplicably denied City in the 2013 FA Cup final, Wigan returned to banter them off a second time. Sunderland had been dispatched in the League Cup final a week earlier, and City would famously go on to pip slippy Liverpool to the league title with five straight wins at the end of the season. But the quad dream came crashing down a week after the League Cup win as Wigan stunned the Etihad with a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup quarter-final before Barcelona completed the formalities of a last-16 Champions League win with a 2-1 victory at Camp Nou having won the first leg 2-0 in Manchester.  Manchester City, 2017/18Premier League: WonFA Cup: Fifth roundChampions League: Quarter-finalsLeague Cup: Won Wigan again. What witchcraft is this? The Latics once again denied the League Cup winners and record-breaking Premier League champions in the FA Cup. Fifth round this time. The Champions League tilt would come unstuck in a mad tie against domestic opposition miles beneath them in the Premier League table – not for the last time – as Liverpool served notice of the force they were about to become, swatting City aside 3-0 at Anfield before winning 2-1 in the return leg. Manchester City, 2018/19Premier League: WonFA Cup: WonChampions League: Quarter-finalsLeague Cup: Won The second Treble winners to see their Quadruple hopes dashed by Spurs. When’s the parade, yeah? Trophy for that, is there? Hmm? But unlike United’s 1998/99 bid that only became apparent with the benefit of hindsight, City’s 2018/19 was so dominated by talk of Quadruples that their unprecedented Domestic Treble drew mainly shoulder shrugs and indifference. The dream died on a gloriously silly night of European football at the Etihad as Spurs arrived with a hard-won 1-0 first-leg lead they gave back almost instantly before Son Heung-Min scored two just as quick to take Mauricio Pochettino’s side into an improbable two-goal lead with away-goal buffer to boot. City roared back; with barely 20 minutes on the clock the scoreline was an absurd 3-2 to City on the night with Spurs narrowly ahead in the tie by virtue of those away goals. When Sergio Aguero scored on the hour, City appeared to have done enough only for Fernando Llorente to scramble home a highly controversial third Spurs goal to restore their away-goal advantage. City thought they had won it again in stoppage time only for an agonisingly long VAR check to spot an offside in the build-up. Reading all that back, it is truly incredible to think that wasn’t even Spurs’ maddest away night of a Champions League run so unutterably bonkers that UEFA had no choice but to scrap the away goals rule altogether in direct response. Maybe. Also a reminder of one of the key things that makes a Quad so very hard to pull off: football is really bloody daft.  Manchester City, 2020/21Premier League: WonFA Cup: Semi-finalsChampions League: Runner-upLeague Cup: Won No Spurs or Wigan whimsy this time around, with Chelsea proving to be City’s undoing on this occasion. That’s slightly less embarrassing, at least, but it did happen twice. The Quadruple has arguably never felt quite so feasible as it did on the morning of April 17 last year when City, already in the Champions League last four and cruising to the league title with the Carabao safely in their pocket after Ryan Mason’s Spurs had been dealt with at Wembley, prepared to take on Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final. But a close-fought game was decided by Hakim Ziyech’s goal. As if that wasn’t enough, Chelsea would go on to repeat the punishment in the Champions League final in Porto six weeks later, Kai Havertz this time netting the only goal as City’s bid to land all four trophies ended with a mere and quite shameful two. Can Liverpool do better this time around, or will they too join the sorry ranks of the above teams of charlatans and frauds and wastrels who must now, sadly, be considered absolute bottle job losers?

United are searching for someone to take over from Ralf Rangnick, who is currently in interim charge at the club. READ MORE: Warnings from history: Where previous QUAD BIDS went horribly wrong Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag are thought to be the top candidates to take permanent charge, but ESPN claim Ancelotti has now emerged as a candidate as United ‘explore contingency plans’. The club are considering a move for the former Chelsea and Everton manager after United CEO Richard Arnold sought the advice of Sir Alex Ferguson. The report claims that while Ferguson is an admirer of Pochettino, the former United boss has urged the club to look into the possibility of Ancelotti moving to Old Trafford on a short-term contract. United would prefer a long-term manager to take over but there are complications with their top targets. Pochettino has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, while Ten Hag is said to have concerns about the set-up at United. Currently in charge at Real Madrid, Ancelotti has a close personal relationship with Ferguson, and the report states that he’s ‘seen asthe type of coach who could be successful during a short stint because of his extensive experience in the Premier League and Champions League while also having a track record of managing squads full of high-profile players’. Real Madrid have a six-point lead at the top of LaLiga under Ancelotti, but the 62-year-old has faced criticism following his team’s performance against Pochettino’s Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. United’s football director John Murtough revealed this week the club is undertaking a “thorough process” to pick their new permanent manager. “We know that consistency is key as we strive for a top-four finish this season,” Murtough said. “I want to reiterate however that this is not the ultimate objective for Manchester United, and everyone at the club is focused on challenging for the top trophies. “We are now conducting a thorough process for the appointment of a new permanent manager who will take charge this summer, with the objective to get us back to challenging for those domestic and European titles.” ",positive

Having finished runners-up in last season’s Premier League and Europa League, a feeling of progress and hope was fuelled as stadiums returned to full capacities and new faces bolstered the squad. Varane was paraded in front of Old Trafford’s first full house in 17 months ahead of the season opener against Leeds and watched his new club run amok 5-1 against their rivals. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival only heightened expectation but Man Utd soon ran aground, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer exiting and interim boss Ralf Rangnick struggling to turn things around. The Old Trafford giants are set to end a poor campaign by missing out on Champions League qualification but Varane, who has won trophies aplenty with France and Madrid, is confident next season will be better. “It’s been a frustrating season,” he told the PA news agency after scoring in Monday’s 3-0 victory against Brentford. “I think it’s good to finish at home in Old Trafford with a win. “We have to keep pushing and to fight until the end for our fans, so it was a great attitude from the team and an emotional day. “We want to finish the season with something positive and we have to play for our fans and for our pride. “I think we can improve (defensively). I think we have good players and we have to defend together closer. “I think this season we were a little bit irregular and I think we can improve and do better next season. “I’m always positive and I think with a good pre-season, with good work, we can prepare well for next season and be ready to fight for every trophy. That’s the ambition of this club.” 🔺 That first-goal feeling ⚽️ 🔺 Praise for @Cristiano 🇵🇹 🔺 Looking ahead to 2022/23 💭 Get @RaphaelVarane‘s reaction to #MUNBRE 💬👇#MUFC — Manchester United (@ManUtd) May 3, 2022 Man Utd are without silverware since winning the Europa League final in 2017 against Ajax, whose current manager will be taking over at Old Trafford this summer. Ten Hag has impressed onlookers with his work in Amsterdam, where he is on course to win a third Eredivisie title and captured the imagination with their remarkable run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019. “Yeah, I played against them in the Champions League and they played very well,” Varane said with a laugh, reflecting on Ajax’s shock last-16 win at Real Madrid that season. “I’m very excited to work with him. “I’m looking forward to working with him. I think he has good experience and he’s a good person to work in this club.” Ten Hag has big some decisions to make and a dressing room culture to reshape when he takes the Old Trafford reins. Varane knows United’s defence is an area that requires improvement but believes in the quality of their central defenders and pointed to the wider consistency required to be successful. “I think we have good players, players with experience,” he said when asked about his fellow centre-backs. “I think it’s not just about the defence but the whole team. I think we can improve, we can defend better. “We can be more in control during games. Sometimes we’re able to play very well 20-30 minutes and then play bad 10 or 15 minutes. We lost a lot of points like this. “I think if we are consistent, we can improve a lot, so I think it’s a collective work we have to do.” Varane is also hoping to display his individual quality on a more consistent basis after injuries disrupted a first season at Man Utd that has not gone how anyone envisaged. “Yes, but the experience it’s amazing,” he said. “The feeling to be a United player is something special. “I am very happy to play in the Premier League and it’s a great experience. “Obviously, it’s not the result what we expected but I’m still positive and I think that the next season will be better. “I think I need a full pre-season to be fit but I think next season will be better. “I think this season was not bad but we can improve and we can do better.”  ",positive

Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. This followed his prolific spells at Real Madrid and Juventus. The 37-year-old has been criticised at times this season but his contribution in terms of goals cannot be disputed. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters The forward has netted 23 goals from his 37 appearances across all competitions this term. This includes eight goals in his last five Premier League games. Last time out he earned United a point at Old Trafford against Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea. The Blues were by far the better side on the night but they did not make the most of their chances. Keane argued post-match that Ronaldo would score even more goals if he played for Chelsea: “I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn’t do in terms of his pressing but he was never great at that anyway,” Keane said (quotes via Football London). “He is the greatest at what is the hardest part of the game, putting the ball in the back of the net. “You see the chances that Chelsea were creating. Imagine if he was in the Chelsea team, he’d probably get 50 goals. He’s in a poor Manchester United team who aren’t creating many chances for him and he’s producing.” Keane also stated that there was a problem with the “attitude” of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku: After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” ",positive
490,https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-1-0-aston-villa-red-devils-knock-out-valiant-villa,Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa: Red Devils knock out valiant Villa,"Scott McTominay’s early header was enough to see Manchester United defeat Aston Villa in the third round of the FA Cup. After a weekend of intrigue and upsets, the third round ended with an all-Premier League encounter and one of Liverpool’s greatest-ever players managing at Old Trafford for the first time. Monday’s tie lacked goals but provided plenty of entertainment, with McTominay’s header the difference as Ralf Rangnick’s United secured a hard-fought 1-0 win to set up a fourth-round date at home to Middlesbrough. Rangnick and ‘one of football’s great misnomers’ revealed Villa already had an Old Trafford win under their belt this season and will leave ruing what could have been given the number of chances they created after falling behind in the eighth minute. Ollie Watkins cannoned an effort off the crossbar in the first half and, while United had chances to extend their lead, the visitors looked as unruffled as their constantly goaded manager. Danny Ings saw an equaliser ruled out after a lengthy video assistant referee review, with Jacob Ramsey’s block on Edinson Cavani the apparent reason, before Watkins saw a leveller chalked off for offside. United looked there for the taking but Gerrard’s side could not eke out an equaliser in a tie that adds spice to Saturday evening’s Premier League meeting between the clubs at Villa Park. Into the fourth round of the #FACup! 🔴#MUFC — Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 10, 2022 Gerrard was jeered on his way out for the match and stared at the pocket of United fans that were chanting loudest about him. That section held up a large banner as kick-off approach that read ‘Standards’ alongside images of club greats – a poignant message given the recent issues that were obvious in last Monday’s 1-0 home loss to Wolves. The Red Devils showed a much-needed reaction in the early stages and just eight minutes were on the clock when Fred swung in a cross from the right that McTominay glanced home. Rangnick was elated on the touchline but soon saw his side lack the control he craves. Tyrone Mings met a corner with a flicked header to the far post, where Watkins would have converted was it not for a crucial Victor Lindelof touch. Emiliano Buendia showed skill and strength to wriggle through the heart of the United side and drag across the face of goal, before John McGinn forced David De Gea into an excellent one-handed stop. Villa’s strong response continued as Buendia had a shot and, after Emiliano Martinez denied Cavani on the break, came even closer to levelling. A poor, heavy touch by returning Lindelof was raced onto by Watkins, who cut in and rattled the crossbar from six yards out.  A low Ramsey strike deflected narrowly wide off McTominay as Villa looked dangerous, only for a break in play to change the rhythm as half-time approached. Stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes saw an effort blocked and Martinez tipped over Luke Shaw’s great 30-yard effort, with Rashford’s delay in crossing to unmarked Mason Greenwood in stoppage time allowing Villa to cut the ball out. The visitors returned from the break strongly and were celebrating what they thought was an equaliser just five minutes into the second half. Ezri Konsa headed a free-kick back across the face of goal for Ings to bundle home, but after a VAR review for offside, which included Michael Oliver checking the monitor, Villa saw it disallowed. But the decision appeared to be for Ramsey blocking Cavani in the build-up rather than offside for a Watkins touch before Ings turned in. Whatever the reason, tension had grown and Villa soon cursed another ruled out goal, although Ings was clearly offside before racing through and clipping over De Gea for Watkins to score. Cash saw a thumping drive from the edge of the box denied by De Gea, who berated his defence when Watkins was afforded time to bend just wide. Donny Van De Beek replaced Cavani as United desperately looked to gain some control in the final 20 minutes, with fans making their frustration known when Greenwood shot as Rashford waited. Villa pushed to take the match into extra time but could not find the goal they craved. ",positive
491,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-man-utd-reboot-rangnick-glazers-ronaldo,Maybe only full meltdown can trigger required reboot at Man Utd,"Man Utd may well finish fourth, allowing the cycle of sh*t to keep spinning. Does it have to get much worse at Old Trafford before it gets better? It’s the hope that kills you. At least that’s what always seems to be the case with Manchester United. The Red Devils moved into the FA Cup fourth round on Monday night, beating a well-fancied Aston Villa side to make it just one defeat in 10 matches since the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. That, of course, doesn’t come close to telling the full story. United were fortunate, not because of VAR, but because Villa failed to make the most of the moments they created. United plodded and toiled. Again. Victory was achieved and progress gained but it was another utterly joyless performance. Who enjoyed it least – players, management or fans – it is hard to tell. Playing for and watching Manchester United should be a pleasure but, along the way, it seems to have become a chore. Everyone looks so bloody miserable. Perhaps with good reason. Because, once again, it appears United have taken another wrong turn. They appointed a man with a reputation for building clubs and teams from the bottom up, but gave him only six months to re-float the Titanic and a squad of players wholly unsuited and unmoved by his – or anyone else’s – approach. The club have been treading on rakes ever since Sir Alex Ferguson walked away almost nine years ago but perhaps only now the reality is starting to dawn on some people at Old Trafford. With the current personnel, their fortunes don’t look like greatly improving any time soon, so maybe it has to get a lot worse before it gets better. The United hierarchy have spent the last God-knows-how-many seasons trying to salvage what they can from the last, all the while throwing more money at a project that most would now say is doomed to fail. At no single point have they settled on a clear plan, instead bumbling from one mess to another, with the odd glimmer of hope prompting optimism for a brighter future. Which never comes. After almost a decade which has seen four managers try and fail, and a fifth flailing in style if not in results, maybe now is the time to rip it up and start again? What would that involve? Purely from a football perspective, first and foremost, giving a manager or management team the power, space and backing to clear out the dressing-room. United’s squad is a rabble gathered by a variety of managers using a range of methods and means. You have star names struggling to justify huge reputations; players bought for big money who’ve failed to take the expected step; academy graduates of varying quality; youngsters bought from other clubs going nowhere fast; and players lingering from previous regimes going through the motions while banking the kind of wages no other club would contemplate paying them. Ranking the 29 Manchester United players by right to gripe So it is no wonder that cliques form and managers struggle to unify the squad behind any particular philosophy. The only thing that unites the vast majority of them is that they aren’t good enough, individually or collectively, to take United where they allegedly expect to be. A simple sniff test demonstrates that: how many of this squad would Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola take at Liverpool or City? But United can’t dismantle the squad. Or rather, they won’t. The reasons for that go above the dressing room and manager to the executives and owners. For as long as the squad is there or thereabouts – ‘there’ being the top four – the owners are content. Sure, they’ll offer the odd gesture to provide the illusion of intent, but within the boardroom, there is absolutely no appetite to commit to the investment, planning and graft required to haul United back to competitiveness at the highest level. ‘Protecting assets’ has been a higher priority in recent years – and they’ve f***ed that too. They offered huge contracts to players like Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones and Eric Bailly to avoid losing them for nothing, only to watch them rot and, in some cases, leave for free anyway. In the case of Jesse Lingard, they turned down offers last summer believing him to be worth more, only to then pay him £100,000 a week for another season before he walks away a free agent a year later. But the Glazers can stomach that, all the while the Champions League cash keeps rolling in and the commercial operation retains its license to print money. Ed Woodward was overseeing that operation since 2013, despite being Boris levels of unfit for his office, but he will be replaced at the start of next month. By his own sodding clone. Because why fix something that, to the Glazers, isn’t broken? Manchester United confirm the appointment at NYSE of Richard Arnold as CEO. Arnold is a rugby fan and Bristol Uni graduate who worked at PWC who effectively replaces Ed Woodward, the rugby fan graduate from Bristol Uni who worked at PWC. Expect big changes. pic.twitter.com/zFehiCrTJx — Price Of Football (@KieranMaguire) January 6, 2022  Between them, Richard Arnold and John Murtough will decide who will be the next man to take on managing United. Perhaps it will be Ralf Rangnick, who could recommend himself for the job if and when he moves to an advisory position. It almost doesn’t matter because the cycle of mediocrity will most likely continue. United look as well placed as anyone to sneak into fourth place, keeping them in the Champions League after what they will doubtless label another ‘transitional season’. Which is the only type of season they have at Old Trafford these days. Maybe what they need to trigger a real and tangible reboot – not the ‘cultural’ sort that Woodward and co blathered about while signing Aaron Wan-Bissaka for £50million – is a nuclear meltdown, rather than the death by a thousand clumsy cuts they are currently enduring. Which might mean defeats to Middlesbrough and Atletico Madrid in the cups and the results their performances deserve to leave them in mid-table in the Premier League at the end of the season, rather than the bottom of the top where they’ve loitered since Fergie left. Only then might the penny drop among the United hierarchy – though it would be wise not to lump on that. Will the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Raphael Varane, Marcus Rashford – and any other individuals you believe are worth keeping – stick around to deal with the fall-out? It’s not like they could be any unhappier, if we believe their current demeanour. Being part of a genuine rebuild, from the bottom up, must be better than whatever this is right now.  ",positive
492,https://www.football365.com/news/transfer-gossip-man-utd-pull-out-haaland-city-ronaldo-crisis-talks,Gossip: Haaland expects City offer as Man Utd pull out; Ronaldo ‘crisis talks’,"Erling Haaland is expecting an offer from Man City as Man Utd pull out of the race, while Cristiano Ronaldo is holding ‘crisis talks’ with his agent… HAALAND PREDICTS MAN CITY OFFER Erling Haaland has “assumed” there will be an offer from Man City for his services this summer, according toMarca journalist Mario Cortegana, after Man Utd pulled out of the race to sign him. Haaland is expected to leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer transfer window with the top clubs in Europe looking to trigger his reported€75m release clause, which comes into play at the end of the season. The Norway international has scored 17 goals in 19 matches in all competitions this campaign for the Bundesliga outfit, taking his total to 76 goals in 76 matches for Dortmund. That goalscoring record has seen clubs falling over themselves to sign the striker with reports that the race is now just down to Real Madrid and Premier League champions City. The Daily Star claimed on Friday that Man Utd had pulled out of the race to sign Haaland and Marca‘s Cortegana insists that Haaland “prefers to go to Real Madrid”. “Haaland has not made a definitive decision yet,” Cortegana said. “The player prefers to go to Real Madrid, as he has told various people close to him. “Haaland has told people in his entourage that he is very attracted by the possibility of Real Madrid, its grandeur, the premiere of the completely remodelled stadium at Christmas 2022. “Haaland has commented on the departures to FC Barcelona and the Premier League, too. He has assumed that he has the Premier League giants after him, and Guardiola’s team (Manchester City) are looking for a striker. “Real Madrid approach this situation with the intention of trying, but also with pessimism. With the club-states, it is much more difficult to compete, but Real Madrid will certainly try, as they did last year when Chelsea’s approaches came out, which were real.” “They know that Mino Raiola is going to open an auction for Haaland; that’s why the player doesn’t know yet what he’s going to do and doesn’t have an agreement with anyone.”  RONALDO ‘VERY CONCERNED’ ABOUT MAN UTD Cristiano Ronaldo has discussed his future at Man Utd in ‘crisis talks’ with his agent Jorge Mendes, according to a report in The Sun. The Portugal international ‘fears his dream return to Old Trafford is in danger of ending in disaster’ and is ‘disillusioned with interim managerRalf Rangnick’s tactics and style of football’. Results have been okay under Rangnick in the Premier League with ten points from a possible 15 but the performances have particuarly concerned fans and players too.

There are quite a lot of problems and Cristiano is feeling the pressure and is very stressed by the situation. “He desperately wants his United move to be a success, but he is starting to recognise that winning trophies with the current set up could be a real struggle. “Jorge came to see him and they spent time chatting through how things are going, what they think are the problems, how they might be solved and what the solutions may be.

493,https://www.football365.com/news/done-deal-varane-confirmed-by-man-utd-before-pl-opener,Done deal: Varane confirmed by Man Utd before PL opener,"Manchester United have confirmed the signing of France international defender Raphael Varane from Real Madrid on a four-year contract. The Red Devils confirmed thatan agreement had been reachedfor the transfer over two weeks ago. The deal is reportedly worth £34million rising to £42million with add-ons. Gossip: Spurs eye £115.4m swoop as Liverpool get double boost The 28-year-old joined Madrid in 2011 from RC Lens for around £10m. Varane made 360 appearances for the Spanish giants, winning the Champions League and Club World Cup four times and LaLiga three times. He was also an integral part of the France squad that won the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The centre-back was presented to the Man Utd fans at Old Trafford before their Premier League opener against Leeds United. He told the club’s official website: “Manchester United is one of the most iconic clubs in world football and the chance to come here and play in the Premier League is something I couldn’t turn down. “There is a lot more that I want to achieve in my career and I know I’m joining a squad full of great players who will all have the same determination to win matches and trophies. Having spoken to the manager I can see how much progress has been made over the last few seasons and I now join a group ready to play at the highest level. “I want to make an impact here and I will give everything to become part of this club’s illustrious history.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: “I’m absolutely delighted that we have managed to secure one of the best defenders in the world over the last 10 years. “Raphaël is a proven winner who we have tracked over a long period of time and we know just how much of a dedicated professional he is “We have great depth of international defenders and he will add his immense skill set and leadership to that group. He is a unique defender with a rare combination of top-level attributes that I know will rub off on our younger players. “He has won everything there is to win but I know that he is still determined to succeed, I can’t wait to welcome him into the squad.” ",positive
494,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-wan-bissaka-man-utd-diogo-dalot-ralf-rangnick,Wan-Bissaka struggling to survive Man Utd’s latest cultural reset…,"Without Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s seemingly unshakeable faith, Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s prospects at Man Utd look bleak. It’s not all his fault… Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s career at Manchester United thus far has prompted many questions. Who decided the former Crystal Palace right-back was the best of the 804 right-backs the Red Devils supposedly looked at? Eight-hundred and four? Really? What did they see in Wan-Bissaka – that no one else did – to pay the most expensive fee in history for a player with fewer than 50 senior appearances? And more pertinently now, two and a half years after United forked out £50million for the uncapped defender, does Wan-Bissaka have a future at Old Trafford? With Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gone and Ralf Rangnick getting his feet under the table, the answer to that final question looks increasingly unlikely to be a positive one for Wan-Bissaka. The 24-year-old was handed a reprieve in the summer when United baulked at paying a reasonable fee for Kieran Trippier and instead opted to muddle on and make do with a right-back who, after a couple of seasons as a Red Devil, appears wholly unsuited to his role. Perhaps it simply wasn’t possible to do the proper due diligence on Wan-Bissaka when there were 803 other candidates to analyse for the right-back job. Assumptions must have been made. In 42 appearances for Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace, he hardly had an expansive body of work to demonstrate his attacking prowess, but since Wan-Bissaka was a winger-turned-defender, presumably the expectation was that he would know his way to the final third. Evidently not. In two years as United’s undisputed first-choice right-back, Wan-Bissaka still needs a map and a compass when crossing the halfway line. It has become uncomfortable to watch. Perhaps if he was a proficient winger, there would have been little need for Palace to convert him. Wan-Bissaka has his qualities, of that there is no question. If humanity ever needs a sliding tackle or block to save the world, then Wan-Bissaka’s our man. When it comes to one-versus-one defending, the Croydon-born star caught on quick since his conversion to a full-back was first mooted by Kevin Keen when it was noted that he wasn’t scoring or assisting enough as an Under-20 winger. Switching so late makes it inevitable that there are still aspects of his defending, particularly as part of a unit, that remain askew. Wan-Bissaka too often drifts off when defending crosses from the opposite flank, and he hasn’t nailed down yet exactly when to press or hold his ground in a whatever shape United’s defence is taking on any particular day. Perhaps that is something Rangnick can help with. Solskjaer and his coaching crew did not seem to spend much time actually coaching but, as we have seen already, the new manager can spot a flaw and take the necessary steps to rectify it.  That, though, is unlikely to be enough to convince Rangnick that Wan-Bissaka should retain his status as United’s unchallenged right-back. In the German’s system, there are very specific demands on full-backs, few of which Wan-Bissaka appears confident of meeting. While Solskjaer’s demise is bad news for Wan-Bissaka, Diogo Dalot is presumably cock-a-hoop. The continued exile of Dalot while Wan-Bissaka so clearly struggled was one of the unfathomable themes of Solskjaer’s reign. If Dalot couldn’t get a look in while Wan-Bissaka toiled, how low must the ex-manager have rated the talents of a player once described as the best young right-back in the world by Jose Mourinho? Dalot is almost the exact opposite of Wan-Bissaka: raw defensively; better going forward. If one of the Toshiba contraptions in the Carrington transfer bunker could combine the attributes of two players, between them, they might make for one decent right-back. Or one God-awful one. There were many statistical improvements in United’s first attempt at Ralfball on Sunday, and Dalot offered one of the more stark individual numbers. Diogo Dalot passes the ball into the penalty area 5 times vs. Crystal Palace, more than any other player on the pitch. One of those passes lead to the winning goal, too. 👌 pic.twitter.com/OyllqEyn5J — Statman Dave (@StatmanDave) December 6, 2021  In the metric above, per 90 minutes, Dalot is operating at a similar level to the Premier League’s best attacking full-backs, albeit with far fewer minutes under his belt. Dalot is averaging 2.33 passes per 90 into the opposition box. Joao Cancelo is on 2.55; Trent Alexander-Arnold is averaging 2.76; Reece James’ average per 90 is 2.35. Wan-Bissaka’s stands at 0.69. He has attempted nine passes into the box in 13 starts; Dalot trails by two in two starts and four substitute appearances. United are to blame more than Wan-Bissaka for the predicament he finds himself in. There was no evidence that he was suited to playing as a marauding full-back but still, befuddled by his Britishness and their own bullsh*t about ‘cultural resets’, they still paid a record fee for a player they had a free run at. Then, when it was obvious he wasn’t comfortable in the role he was signed for, they refused to spend half the money again on Trippier. Similarly to Solskjaer, it is damning to think where Wan-Bissaka might go should he be shown the Old Trafford door. Which clubs would want him and how much would they be willing to pay? Everton for £20million? Most managers would take a similarly dim view of Wan-Bissaka’s limitations as Gareth Southgate.So United, especially while they are dreadful at selling players, are stuck with a right-back not fit for his purpose. Unless Rangnick can inspire a sudden, drastic and unexpected improvement. As individual projects go, Wan-Bissaka is certainly the biggest on the new manager’s to-do list. ",positive

THREE-WAY BATTLE FOR RICHARLISON The headline is that Manchester United have made enquiries about Everton forward Richarlison but Brazil’s UOL Sport claim that the really strong interest comes from Newcastle and Tottenham and that he wants to stay in the Premier League, where he has been occasionally brilliant for both Watford and the Toffees, though there was interest from PSG and Juventus last summer. So how much? Everton are said to want £67m, though they would be lucky to get anywhere near that number if Everton were relegated from the top flight (which looks entirely possible). Could he be part of a United rebuild?  TIELEMANS BATTLE IS ON Here’s CBS journalist Ben Jacobs on that situation: Manchester United and Arsenal continue to pursue Youri Tielemans. 25m is a bargain price. Nothing much in the West Ham links. David Moyes admires Tielemans but Hammers not currently frontrunners. There is no truth in repeated Liverpool links. #LFC have other priorities. — Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) April 8, 2022  That really is a bargain price. And it might be that Arsenal can only realistically do that deal if they get into the Champions League. Could Spurs be interested if they trump both and finish fourth?  REAL MADRID PLAN INVOLVES HAZARD EXIT According to Sport, ‘Real Madrid is hoping to score a luxury double in this next transfer market’ and that means signing both Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland, which would create a truly ludicrous front line. It is thought that Haaland was ‘suspicious’ about such a move because of Karim Benzema’s continued brilliance, but he has been reassured that he would be Madrid’s leading man next season and beyond. The fly in the ointment is that Real Madrid are already paying really quite a lot of money to some very expensive forwards, and one of those is Eden Hazard. It is thought that Arsenal are interested in a loan with option to buy so it’s now over to the Belgian to agree to a return to London and the Premier League. Marco Asensio is also available and AC Milan are leading that particular chase, though there is competition from the Premier League.  NEWCASTLE TO GO FULL ENGLISH? Newcastle have been strongly linked with two English players in Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and West Ham winger Jarrod Bowen. Phillips has been strongly linked with Manchester United and Aston Villa but I News claim that Newcastle are very interested in a player who could cost as much as £55m this summer. Bowen has been linked with Liverpool but that seems unlikely after the signing of Luis Diaz so Newcastle could have a clear run at him. The Hammers will have to decide whether they can sanction the sale of both Bowen and Declan Rice (£120m should be enough there) this summer. ",positive

The Reds and the Citizens have matched each others last four results as both sides look to avoid slipping up at a crucial moment in their pursuit of the title. City currently lead Liverpool by one point with five matches of the campaign remaining with Jurgen Klopp’s side appearing to have the tougher run of fixtures. Big Midweek: City v Real, Danjuma at Anfield, West Ham, Rangnick, Forest However, Carragher believes both sides – who have only lost five matches all season between them – will drop points before the end of the season but that the forwards at Liverpool’s disposal gives them the “slight edge”. “We’re talking about two brilliant teams,” Carragher on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “You can’t really split them in an area of the game, but I can see both of them dropping points, I do believe that. “If you look at the attacking stats, this is when Liverpool have the slight edge, you look at the goals per game they have the slight edge. “Liverpool have scored 85 goals, Man City 80, when you talk about not having a striker the goals are still absolutely phenomenal from Man City. “The XG per game shows that Liverpool have the edge.Man City’s top scorer is De Bruyne with 11, and for Liverpool it’s Salah with 22. There’s a big difference. “Man City obviously spread the goals out a bit more, but the numbers in terms of their top scorers show Liverpool have a big advantage in attack.” 🗣 “This is where Liverpool have the slight edge.” Jamie Carragher pinpoints where Manchester City could drop points in their remaining Premier League games. pic.twitter.com/m8coIUZQMa — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 25, 2022 Carragher added: “If Man City are to drop points, it would be down to the fact they could have games where they fail to score. “Man City have failed to score in four games this season – Liverpool only one – and they have only scored once in seven games too, so that’s 11 games where they have scored one goal or zero goals. “So, you think, if Man City are going to drop points, it must be from a 0-0, there’s been evidence of that this season in games that we’ve seen.” Speaking about both side’s defensive capabilities, Carragher continued: “We should add that lot of those games where Liverpool dropped points were early on in the season and there has been a change, defensively, in the second half of the season. “But, if Liverpool drop points, you feel like it wouldn’t be a 0-0, it would be a 2-2. “The perceived weaknesses of the two sides are that City haven’t got a striker, and Liverpool’s high line. But I think in some ways those are both strengths for them as well. “The defensive stats show City have the edge. Most people would say Liverpool have the best defender in the world in Virgil van Dijk, but as a team, City are better defensively and that might have something to do with not having a striker. “Maybe having more control of the ball in the game means people can’t attack them.Again the numbers are very close. Man City just have the edge. “Where there is a big difference is the xG per game. It’s almost a third higher for Liverpool. “There’s nothing in the clean sheets but the big one that stands out is that Manchester City have only conceded one goal from a set-piece, Liverpool seven.”  ",negative

The Reds beat the Toffees in the Merseyside derby 2-0 on Sunday but Frank Lampard’s side made life difficult for their arch-rivals before Andy Robertson broke the deadlock on 62 minutes. Jurgen Klopp brought Divock Origi and Luis Diaz off the bench and the changes worked as Origi headed in the second goal from Diaz’s acrobatic effort and the Belgium international also had a hand in the opener. Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism There were a few controversial moments in the game with Everton feeling they should’ve had a second-half penalty, while Sadio Mane was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch after poking Mason Holgate in the face. A number of comments by the Sky Sports commentary team of Martin Tyler and Jamie Carragher incensed Stubbs during the match. Stubbs tweeted: “Will have to turn this commentary off I think @Everton because it’s so biased!! “Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my a**e.” Will have to turn this commentary off I think @everton because it’s so biased!! Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my arse 🤷🏼‍♂️💙 — Alan Stubbs (@alanstubbs_6) April 24, 2022 Carragher annoyed a number of fans on social media after the former Liverpool centre-back told Richarlison to get up despite the Everton attacker rolling his ankle. “Honestly, get up. Get up, carry on,” Carragher said of Richarlison on commentary. “If [Abdoulaye] Doucoure gets a yellow card because his teammate goes down. Stupid from Doucoure trying to stop the game but Richarlison… there’s nothing wrong with him.” Stubbs appeared this morning on BBC Radio Five Live and he revealed his frustration that major decisions went against Everton. He said: “Everton had a game plan to try and frustrate Liverpool and they did that for large parts of the game. Some major decisions also went against them, for instance the penalty. The first incident isn’t but the second one (Matip on Gordon) is a clear penalty there is no doubt about that. The referee is in a great position and he bottled it. There is no other way to describe it. “Everton have been on the end of dubious VAR decisions in recent months but that is not the reason they are in the position they are in.” When asked whether Everton will stay up, Stubbs added: “I hope so. I have everything crossed. But it’s going to be close.” Stubbs also urged the players to show they have what it takes to stay in the Premier League after Burnley’s victory on Saturday plunged the Toffees into the relegation zone. Stubbs continued: “I know Frank Lampard’s record doesn’t look great but he has inherited a group of players where a lot of the damage was done before him and he had to pick up the pieces. “Could he have done more? Certainly. But ultimately it comes down to the players. They have not performed well enough this season, though there has been signs of improvement in the last three performances. “When you are down the bottom every run-in is tough. They have another tough game on Sunday at home to Chelsea. “It’s not about talk, it’s about actions. We have heard the talk all season about ‘we are too good to go down’. Well now is the time for the players to stand up and be counted.”  ",negative

Jurgen Klopp changed the game by bringing on Divock Origi and Luis Diaz in the second half with the former involved in the build-up to Andy Robertson’s opening goal before getting on the scoresheet himself. Everton youngster Anthony Gordon was booked for diving in the first half under a challenge from Naby Keita and the simulation came back to haunt him in the second half as he was denied a penalty. ‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox… With the score still level at 0-0, Gordon – who had caused Liverpool problems all game – went down after being bundled over by Joel Matip but the referee waved away his penalty protests. But Campbell was adamant that it should’ve been a spot-kick and insists the referee “bottled” the decision. Campbell said on Sky Sports: “This is a pen for me. It’s a push in the back. He’s in the box, it’s a push in the back. He’s nowhere near the ball, he pushes him. “You see that. If that was at the other end, I’m sure this stadium would have gone crazy. That’s the one break that Everton needed. “I thought the referee bottled it a little bit, if I’m honest with you.” 🗣 “I’ve gone one v one with him and I’ve got the better of him and he’s stood on me foot.” Anthony Gordon explains why he feels he should’ve had a penalty and that he didn’t deserve a yellow card for his “dive” pic.twitter.com/lhCkgxiwqB — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 24, 2022 Former Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher warned Gordon that he doesn’t want to get a reputation as a diver. Carragher added: “He’s got to be careful, Anthony Gordon. He’s a great lad and a great player, one of the best players on the pitch today, caused Liverpool massive problems. “But he’s just got to be careful of that, it’s not the first time, the one in the first half, and it definitely will be in referee’s heads.” Fellow pundit Graeme Souness reckons Gordon “planted a seed” in the referee’s mind after the simulation in the first half. Souness said: “He’s planted a seed in the referee’s head, in the very first few minutes when he dived to try and get a penalty. “You can bet, if we’re players out there, we’re in the referee’s ear: ‘he’s a diver, ref.’ You’re planting a seed in the ref’s head as well.”  ",positive

Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com. Europa League key to Man City downfall Despite Liverpool’s impressive form, I’ve long maintained City are strong favourites for the league. However, there’s always that glimmer of hope and last night was a game that I had naivelypegged as a possibility where City might drop points. Yes, Leeds are poor, but fighting for their lives, a raucous Elland Road, sandwiched between the Madrid games? It seemed like there was a chance. It wasn’t to be and we’re now running out of games whereCity conceivablymight not win. I’d rule out the home games. As good as Newcastle’s form is and however motivated Gerrard might be, I can’t see Newcastle or Villa getting anythingat the Ethiad. Which leaves Wolves away and West Ham away. Wolves seem to have decided European football isn’t for them and ended the season early, so the London Stadium does seem like the only real possible candidate for a result. Which makes Thursday night absolutely key. Win it and West Ham will put out a second string against City, 3 days before the Europa league final. Lose on Thursday and West Ham will be desperate for points to be back in the Europa league next season. What happens on Thursday could be the decisive factor in who wins the title. Of course, it might all be for nothing. There’s no guarantee of Liverpool winning their remaining 4 games and even a full strengthWest Ham wouldbe underdogs against this City team. But as much as I’d love to see West Ham win the Europa League, I’ll be hoping they crashout on Thursday and give City a proper match.Mike, LFC, London READ MORE: Man City show shower mentality in Leeds paper storm to douse Liverpool hopes  Klopp’s gambleYou’ve got to hand it to Klopp today. He took a gamble with that line up but it paid off. Ultimately it means Trent got a full week off and Fabinho, Salah and Mané didn’t have to play a full 90 minutes. You could see a couple of times Klopp lost his sh*t on the touch line as our forwards wasted a few big chances and fair play to him. Newcastle looked decent and forced us into bringing on our best players to try and contain the game. I think a lot of their players have an awful lot to play for this season so it’s no surprise they’re working so hard. I just hope they do something similar against Man City because they could’ve snatched a point today and you never know… Robertson is such a class act. Just tears up and down that left side for 90 minutes every three days and doesn’t seem to show any signs of fatigue or complacency. This has possibly been his best season for Liverpool which was hard to imagine when he’s already had some outstanding seasons. Credit to BT Sport too for trying to create some controversy from the least controversial tackle of the game in the build up to the goal. It wasn’t the most exciting match they did well to get so much talking out of such a non-event.Minty, LFC Newcastle assessment As a Magpie, the best thing I can say about that match is that it had absolutely no bearing on the relegation battle, which I wouldn’t have believed in December. Liverpool are irritating AF, but they’re just so good. It was like they had an extra man on the pitch the entire 90 minutes. Liverpool easily did to us what we’ve recently been just managing to do to other teams: press hard enough to deny them time on the ball and take at least one of the chances on offer. More often than not, our passes were between stationary players, leaving us flat-footed and vulnerable to Liverpool’s press. They nearly marked St. Maximin out of the match, collapsing blind alleys around him time after time. Almiron’s speed counted for little against Liverpool’s midfield and defense, and the like rest of the forward and midfield lines, he simply was not as good as the opponents he faced. Even Guimaraes, though Bruno might have done better with more speed and touch around him in midfield. Shelvey’s immobility in particular was a real handicap. You can’t really fault the way we defended. Krafth, who couldn’t cope with the pace, was blown after 65 minutes; it was amazing he made 84 without us conceding again. A brave, but revealing performance. Lascelles again did quite well in defense, replacing Schar. Burn was immense, as usual. I can’t think of a situation he didn’t deal with well; he was standing still for the goal, but once the ball was past him, there was little he could’ve done. Heck, I was pleased that we managed to put the ball in the net at all, even if it was offside. All things must pass, and 0-1 to Liverpool is about the best imaginable way for our home win streak to have ended. I would’ve loved, it, loved it if we’d put a dent in their title hopes, though.Chris C, Toon Army DC Newcastle positivity The Newcastle-Liverpool game just finished and have to applaud Newcastle for sticking to a much more positive game plan than the one Everton put in place. Howe has done a great job. A lot of forward pressing kept Liverpool under pressure. And they managed to keep Liverpool’s opportunities to a minimum without a low block of two banks of 4 or 5. And apart from a couple of pushes in the game, it was a relatively clean game with no gamesmanship. Heck, they did much better than Villareal. Hopefully Emery wasn’t watching and getting a few tips. What a contrast between two English managers in Howe and Lampard. Newcastle are going to do well next season.Paul McDevitt  Crystal Palace thoughts Had my hair cut an hour before kickoff in Soton v Crystal Palace. Don’t worry, my hair is probably still longer than yours. Not sure this is sustainable as a means of ensuring a Palace win but needs must. *On Monday night, the Eagles struggled through a feisty 0-0 draw with Leeds United, in which the referee took a very lenient approach towards some of the crunching tackles that flew in. Predictably, Wilfried Zaha was the most often targeted, on the receiving end of several fouls that merited yellow cards (but did not), only for Kalvin Phillips to call him a diver after the match. I’m obligated to point out that in the three seasons since VAR was introduced, the only occasion on which a referee decided Zaha had dived, he was forced to overturn his decision and award a kick from the penalty mark. We can but speculate on what might have happened today with one of Phillips’s teammates had they been previously dissuaded from flying into the sort of challenges where people end up getting hurt. *The after-effects of Monday’s game took their toll on the Palace team, with Patrick Vieira taking the bold decision to put Zaha on the bench from the start. This decision looked to have backfired early on when Soton took the lead, yet another goal Vieira’s team have conceded from a corner. After that, Palace dominated the game. Jeffrey Schlupp found plenty of space behind the Saints defence. as his side created several good chances. The equaliser arrived courtesy of a fantastic move finished off by Eberechi Eze. It’s been a long road back from his horrific injury, he’s had limited playing time and not really shown his full potential when he has played. That said, he has had to learn new roles in the team and his commitment has never been in question while we acknowledge he is a work in progress. I’m really pleased for him to get his goal today. *Shortly after the goal, enter Zaha. Appropriately enough for today’s opposition, I can’t think of a player who has that important to his team and that fun to watch since Matthew Le Tissier in his pomp. For clarity I am talking exclusively about his playing career. Combined with the later introduction of Michael Olise, Vieira made changes knowing full well the game was there to be won. Inevitably, it was the man who can legitimately claim to be Palace’s greatest ever player who settled the tie with a moment of trademark magic. Readers with long memories may recall the time Zaha was sent off for sarcastically clapping a referee, and James Ward-Prowse celebrating the decision like he’d scored a goal. It shows just how much more mature Zaha is than you or I that he didn’t celebrate in Ward-Prowse’s face, Martin Keown-style. Or do a Jurgen Klinsmann dive. *Speaking of that ridiculous officiating line in the sand, prior to that red card, Zaha had scored four goals in 23 appearances; he then scored six in his next 13; when he was sent from the field against Tottenham earlier this season, I suggested a similar effect may take place. Sure enough, having scored five goals before the Boxing Day game, he has scored seven since returning from suspension (and AFCON), which makes this his most prolific season in the top flight. *This was the first time all season that Palace have recovered from a losing position to win a game, and remarkably the first game they’ve won by a single goal. The result doesn’t really affect too much in the grand scheme of things; all either side is playing for is exactly where they will finish in the midtable pack. However, this was an important demonstration from Vieira that his side can carve out results when their attacking verve doesn’t immediately blow teams away. *With this result, Palace match their points total from 34 games last season, but with a goal difference of+3 compared to -20. While this matters little in the bigger picture, just as the number of times they’ve won the xG battle, it does indicate how much more attacking they have been this year. By coincidence, their next match sees them face Roy Hodgson’s Watford, a fixture that will see the Hornets relegated if they don’t win. *There is a lot of noise suggesting Aaron Wan-Bissaka could be set to re-join Palace on loan next season. As often as possible during his time at Old Trafford I’ve been saying he’s not good enough for Manchester United and they should send him back, and people are starting to think my motivations are self-interested. Despite what is said about him, Wan-Bissaka is a great player; however, he established himself thus in a team that did a lot of defending, where he was able to show off his incredible tackling. The trouble is, he joined a Manchester United team wanting their right-back to be a bit more attacking than he would be for Roy Hodgson, which isn’t his strongest suit. The trouble is, at no point did it occur to anyone at Manchester United to teach him how to play the way they needed him to. *When Burnley announced they had terminated Sean Dyche’s contract, I was one of the very few people to suggest that it wasn’t a mistake and that Dyche’s playing style had held the Clarets back. That an inexperienced manager has taken over and simply encouraged his team to attack cannot be a coincidence.Ed Quoththeraven   ‘Childish’ Leeds If anyone ever needed reminding why football fans have a reputation for being boorish, immature, intellectually challenged halfwits, thank you Leeds for doing the honours.

Been a long time since I’ve been awestruck at something so idiotic, childish and pointless.Marc, MCFC,Bolton  League One promotion This is it. 45 rounds of football, and it’s all come down to this. As a Wycombe fan, writing this as he’s traveling to the match. I’m bricking it. First it speaks to the quality of the league, that only one team in both the relegation, and promotion spots, is mathematically secure (well, in the case of Crewe, insecure) Three teams can win the league, three teams can get automatic promotion, six teams are involved in the chase to ensure they have playoffs to play after today, whilst five teams at the Bottom have everything to give today. Thought I would give my views on the promotion candidates and their matches, since honestly I’m just nervous and need to get it off my chest Wigan Vs Shrewsbury – won’t imagine any surprises for Wigan. Should be a fairly easy, if not nervous, victory and trophy for them. Rotherham Vs Gillingham – theoretically an easier match than Wigan’s, but they need Wigan to lose or draw to have a chance at winning that title. Should secure the automatic promotion though MK Dons Vs Plymouth – this is the big match today, MK want the chance of automatic if Rotherham lose or draw, whilst Plymouth need a win to ensure they stay ahead of Wycombe. Could honestly go either way, both teams have everything to gain and nothing to lose, so should be a very interesting match Sunderland Vs Morecambe – As much as I don’t want to admit it, Sunderland should have this. As a Wycombe fan I’m split between wanting them to lose now, or possibly getting them in the playoffs and having another chance to rile up Sunderland fans again. Wycombe Vs Burton – Theoretically a good game, and Wycombe have absolutely nothing to lose. Can theoretically overtake Plymouth even if they win, since we are only 2 behind on GD and we beat them in the H2H comparison. We’ll have a packed out away stand which hopefully will help. I’m loving today. I’ll take a day like this over the Premier League any day. This has been an incredible competitive league with alot of amazing matches, and win or lose, I’ve loved it allDaragh Milsom  ",positive

Silent Man City and more mails…,"Should Frank Lampard be getting more stick at Everton or has it gone too far? Plus, a quiet Tuesday night at the Etihad,Robo Pep, Arsenal relegated andskills… Send your thoughts totheeditor@football365.com… A quiet Tuesday night in Manchester Rare that I have time to watch a non-Liverpool game these days but my wife and youngest son are in hospital (they’re fine, don’t worry) so I had time on my hands. Amazing game, of course, but did anyone else think the crowd was incrediblyflat? I’m not one get into a “My dad’s harder than your dad” argument, so I’m not coming at this comparingCity to Liverpool or anything. It’s not a criticism, just an observation. Man City have some incrediblesupporters. Go back and watch the highlights of their playoff semi finals and final from division 2 and the atmosphere is fantastic. When the goals go in, fans are going ballistic. Last night, that just wasn’t the case. I watched thesecond goal go in,to go 2-0 up,after 10 minutes,against Real Madrid in the Champions League semi final and I couldn’t believe it. It was like it was a Premier League game against Watford. In most stadiums, you’d expect theplace to then be absolutely bouncing following the goal. Non-stop singing,non-stop cheering. It wasn’t the case at all. It was quiet. There was a section of the crowd you could hear throughout the game but the majority were pretty quiet for a game of that magnitude. Is this purely the result of the day-tripper type fans that larger clubs attract now? I mean don’t get me wrong, some Premier League atmospheresare flat as anything, Anfield included, but most fans get up for it for the big games. Speaking of fans, City fans booing the theme of the tournament that their club is desperate to win remains extremely silly. It’s like a teenager who thinks he’s being edgy for some minor act of rebellion, when actually they just come across like a knob. Seriously, you’re not some hard done by underdog, give it a rest.Mike, LFC, London  Robo PepJust a quick rebuttal to Mark (MCFC) — I am indeed one of those people that find watching City suffocate the life out of teams by flooding the midfield dull as ditchwater. And I think last night’s madness of a game and the excitement it generated just shows how dull City normally are — do you think Pep is happy about the lack of control City had in that game? Or do you think he would have much preferred the usual 95% City possession followed by a pull back for one of the 450 midfielders to score a couple? Basically City got involved in a proper game, a real ding-dong last night, not the usual sterile game they usually play where they are 4-0 up after 20 minutes. I think I speak for all of football in requesting Keegan comes back after Pep has gone.Dan, London  The irony… …of Fenandinho being outwitted by Vinicius Jr and failing to make his customary tactical foul on the halfway line was particularly delicious last nightSteve Leeds – really looking forward to playing City next – hopefully they will be as profligate in front of goal as they were last night – I’d take 0-4 right now PS Yorkshire Pingu – that’s genius  What is the point of Everton?Questions this morning on why people suddenly want Everton to be relegated prompted me to ask the question… what is the point of Everton? Everton have been ever present in the Premier League and in that time (this is the 30thseason) they have never finished in the top 3 (and obviously never in the bottom 3). 29 previous seasons of never competing for the title and never being relegated. In that time Norwich, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Blackburn, Newcastle and Leicester have all finished in the top 3 but not Everton. They have reached 1 FA Cup final in the last 25 years and haven’t reached the League Cup final since the 1980s. Everton have never actually won the League Cup which puts them in the shadow of such luminaries as Oxford United, Stoke, Swansea, QPR, Swindon, Luton, Birmingham and West Brom. Since the start of the Premier League both Middlesbrough and Fulham have reached European finals but Everton haven’t. Coventry City, Blackburn, Newcastle and Sunderland have all had a Premier League top scorer but Everton haven’t. They haven’t had a Player of the Year since the mid-1980s and have never had a Young Player of the Year. The sun rises and sets, players come and go, Prime Ministers are convicted of criminal offences and pandemics threaten our existence but through it all Everton finish mid-table. Always and forever mid-table. I mean, seriously, what is the point of Everton?Micki Attridge  Lack of leadership…Before getting to my main point, a shout out to City and RM for an entertaining game last night. To Mark’s point, as a neutral it was definitely fun to watch. City should have had a couple more – at least. And a rebuttal to James EFC. It seems Evertonions keep making the same point without hearing what is being said or the rationality of it. So I’ll say it again. If Liverpool are buying players from other premier league clubs, then those other premier league clubs must have been able to convince those players to play for them. The point? Everton could equally have signed said players no? So, to be clear. If Hull could find Robertson, Newcastle Wijnaldum, Southampton Mane and Van Dyke, Wolves Jota, for example, why couldn’t Everton?Liverpool didn’t bring those players into the Premier League. Everton have been absolute b*ll*cks at scouting talent for a long time. It’s got nothing to do with the fact the players would prefer to go to Liverpool – of course they would right now – but that wasn’t the case when Liverpool were building their team looking for hidden gems to fit their system. So rather than see big bad Liverpool as the cause of Everton’s problems or to excuse the ultimately pitiful time wasting, focus on why when Everton did decide to play, they could play and why those same players have not turned up like that away from home for so long. It’s because, like their fans, they are blaming everything and everyone else for their fate rather than standing up to be counted. That’s why Everton are in such trouble, why neutrals don’t like whining Frank – who isn’t showing any leadership either.Paul McDevitt  Lampard vs BenitezHello As a plastic LFC fan, I have a soft spot for Rafa & am not a great fan of Frank Lampard, so I’m clearly biased, but I’m not sure why Frank L is not getting even more stick than he has been. No real ‘new manager bounce’ and his record is even worse than Rafa’s: Rafael Benitez@ Everton: W 7 D 5 L 10 Frank Lampard@ Everton W 5 D 1 L9KC, Cork  Frank hate…Yeah I don’t really get the hate for Frank at F365 towers. Anti-English/British sentiment is fairly common on the site. Mainly from Johnny N. Now I’m all for a wee bit of anti-English sentiment. My recent mails re: geo politics and football caused quite a stir amongst the Queens’ loyal followers. I just don’t really understand the hatred of the English when it comes to football. I like English football. Hell I even like the English football team AND its manager. I never thought id say those words in my life. As with almost all leagues in Europe/the world, the majority of managers within that league, tend to be from that country. These people often know the clubs, know the language, have the visa, know the dressing rooms, understand the league, understand the club/expectations etc etc. It seems a fairly logical place to start. Unless there is some clear managerial genius available from Dusseldorf for a decent price that is willing to go to a relegation troubled borefest like Everton, then you’re flipping a coin really. Do you want to avoid relegation by playing total football, or do you want to avoid relegation by old school English “get faaaaaaacking stuck in you muggggs” tactics. With a piss poor team like Everton, either way seems as likely as the other to produce success. Franks way doesn’t seem to be working. I’m not sure the “insert hipster Dutch coach’s name here” way would work either. Better the devil you know perhaps? David Moyes didn’t deserve that West Ham job. Yet hes created a Champions League challenging team. Sometimes it works. Steven Gerard probably didn’t deserve that Villa job. Sometimes it kind of works. Frank Lampard didn’t deserve that Everton Job. Sometimes it doesn’t work. You are as likely to get the same above results with Frank Lampard from London as you are with Frunk Vun Lampardstank from Hamburg. No doubt all the football hipsters would say otherwise.Let’s not act like any of the managers outside the top 6 or 7 are doing anything of much interest. Be they from Plymouth or Paris, be it tippy tappy or hoofy smashy football… its all pretty much dross. The most important thing F365 Towers seems to not understand. It’s that English/British Managers are good craic. Allardyce, Redknapp, Warnock, Fergie, Bassett… They’re fun, they’re ridiculous, they are incredibly lacking in self-awareness. They make great TV. They will say funny things about their wives and curse on TV. It’s great. We should be encouraging the next lineage of this type of manager. Not frothing at the mouth anytime some lad from over the pond manages to get his team to string 3 passes together. So choose 4-4-2, choose 6 pints the night before the match, choose chat sh*t get banged, choose VINDALOO, choose idiotic interviews out the car window on transfer deadline day, choose losing the English job after a few weeks due to corruption, choose steak and kidney pies, choose saying “we woz robbed” after every defeat, choose blaming the ref, choose signing George Weahs cousin, choose hoofing the ball to the centre forward… (Born Slippy by Underworld fades in…)Shz  Graham Simons asked the Mailbox “Where has all this hate for Everton come from?” One word answer – Richarlison. Simples.Bladey Mick (Worst footballer ever….)  Arsenal relegatedPlenty of people I know would love Arsenal to get relegated, Graham – they just aren’t in a position it might happen. Shame really.Dan M  Who else has skills named after them? I told my wife Benzema scored a Panenka penalty. She looked at me like I was speaking in code. It got me thinking, other than the Cruyff turn, does anyone else have a skill or technique named after them? That Ronaldinho dummy trick, is that one? I know there are awards (Puskas) and even positions (Makelele), but for the life of me I can’t think of skills. I’m sure I practised a McManaman turn in my school days, but might be making that up?

Just like Jose ‘FOR 62 minutes, Frank Lampard pulled off his best Jose Mourinho impersonation and frustrated the hell out of Anfield.’ That would be a lovely opening line to Dave Kidd’s Merseyside derby match report in The Sun if Jose Mourinho sides had not conceded in the 24th and 26th minutes of his last two (losing) trips to Anfield.  On the rilesWe are being a little facetious of course because Kidd was actually going all the way back to 2014 by referencing Chelsea’s win at Anfield which derailed Liverpool’s title bid. And we are supposed to believe that Everton only losing 2-0 to Liverpool is worthy of that kind of comparison… ‘Everton’s 68-year stay in the top flight may be in severe peril but Lampard and his team deserve some credit for riling Liverpool’s players, fans and fan-boy Sky pundit Jamie Carragher to the point of distraction.’ Yes, well done Frank. The one place where simply ‘riling’ Liverpool is worthy of great praise is The Sun. ‘There were obvious similarities with the infamous Demba Ba match in 2014, when Mourinho’s Chelsea side – including Lampard and Mo Salah – derailed Liverpool’s title bid with a 2-0 victory and a defensive masterclass.’ Chelsea were 1-0 up by half-time in that game so the ‘obvious similarities’ were put to bed pretty bloody early on. Oh and Operation No Blame Lampard is truly on here… ‘Liverpool fans taunted their opponents by gleefully chanting the name of Rafa Benitez – now even more cherished by the red half of the city, for having done such a fine job of propelling the blue half towards the Championship.’ He was sacked with Everton six points clear of the relegation zone, fella. We think Lampard might be a bit responsible. But also, well done for ‘riling’ Liverpool as your team lost 2-0.  Vague-abonds‘NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED: Carragher pinpoints games where Liverpool and Man City could slip up in close run title race’ is the leading headline on the Mirror Sport headline. Except, well, he never says anything about the faint-hearted and never actually pin-points (‘find or identify with great accuracy or precision’)any games other than to say that “for both teams, the game in-between a Champions League semi-final will take so much out of you”. But ‘Carragher says playing loads of games is really hard’ doth butter no parsnips/claim no easy clicks.  Poking holes‘Liverpool star Fabinho pokes fun at Richarlison with cheeky social media post showing his beaten Everton rival clutching his face in pain after the pair’s clash during feisty Merseyside derby’ is the headline (yes, that’s a headline not an opening paragraph) on MailOnline. This is the ‘cheeky social media post’ in question: What a win! Until the end, boys! 💪🏾🙏🏽🔴 pic.twitter.com/x7RfdeeEAL — Fabinho (@_fabinhotavares) April 24, 2022  How very ‘cheeky’ to include two pics featuring Fabinho himself, as he (or a member of his team) does after every single Liverpool game. He ‘couldn’t resist poking fun at Richarlison as he took to social media after the 2-0 victory’ apparently. Well he could resist. Because he did.  VAR from an explanationOver at the Liverpool Echo, they are more than happy to fan all of the flames with this click-tastic headline: ‘Premier League confirm why VAR didn’t give two decisions for Everton against Liverpool’ Oh this will be good. Though the Premier League commenting on VAR decisions is curious. But here we go, we have clicked… ‘The Premier League have confirmed why two controversial decisions went against Everton in their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday afternoon.’ Come on then. Let’s hear it… ‘Frank Lampard particularly bemoaned an incidentin the second half of the game when Anthony Gordon was seemingly brought down inside the box by Joel Matip. Despite the winger’s appeals, Stuart Attwell decided against awarding a spot kick. ‘Earlier on in the match, numerous supporters had also spotted incidents involving Sadio Mane shortly before half time. TheLiverpoolstar looked to raise his hand to the faces of both Allan and Mason Holgate, but escaped a red card.’ Yes, yes. Let’s get to the part where the Premier League have confirmed something that they’re not actually in control of… ‘The ECHO understands both incidents were checked by the VAR, although that wasn’t clear from inside the stadium. On both occasions, it was deemed that there was not enough to intervene with the on-field decisions that were given.’ So no Premier League confirmation at all but rather a repeat of the EXACT SITUATION THAT OCCURS IN EVERY SINGLE PREMIER LEAGUE GAME. But we clicked so who are the f***ing idiots here?   Should we just…Elsewhere on the Liverpool Echo, they are following the Reach guidelines for confusing the hell out of people into clicking with one of those random quote headlines that seems to be all the rage in certain quarters. After years of picking out the best quotes for headlines, the current trend is to pick a couple of random, anodyne words to confound the readers into a click. Frankly, it’s shit. ”Will have’ – John Terry makes Anthony Gordon prediction after Everton performance’ ‘Will have’? What sort of a quote is that? What John Terry actually said on Instagram: “I love watching this young man. Top player who will have a big career in the game. Gives everything for the shirt every week.” There are at least three better quotes to highlight than ‘will have’ but that’s not the point here, is it? The point is to confuse you into clicking. Should we just headline this Mediawatch as ‘should we just’? Actually, that’s not a bad idea…  ",positive
502,https://www.football365.com/news/jurgen-klopps-liverpool-contract-great-for-the-premier-league-bad-for-premier-league-clubs,"Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool contract: Great for the Premier League, bad for Premier League clubs","Jurgen Klopp has signed a new deal, Liverpool are buzzing and the Premier League is rubbing its hands together. The clubs in the Premier League sigh and prepare for four more years of domination and biannual (probably quadannual) drubbings. Klopp’s new deal at Anfield takes him through to the summer of 2026. It’s brilliant news for Liverpool, obviously. The club love him, the fans love him, the players love him and the feeling goes both ways. Klopp is now synonymous with Liverpool Football Club; may God help the poor sod who will eventually replace him. But he’s just as valuable a commodity to the Premier League. Klopp, as a manager, is ‘worth the entrance fee alone’ – worth spending half your wages on 27 different platforms to watch him fist-pumping at the Kop, grimacing like a gladiator removing their latest head, conducting those special Anfield nights. He’s the box office manager of a box office football team playing box office football. And the Premier League smiles, pats him on the cap and reaps the rewards. The English top flight is no longer The Best League In The World simply because English people said so often enough. It is now actually the best league in the world, owing to it having the best football teams. After a fallow period of five years without a representative in the Champions League final, should Manchester City and Liverpool hold onto their advantages in the semi-finals this season, seven of the last ten finalists will have hailed from this green and pleasant land. The news of Klopp’s extension as good as guarantees further years of supremacy. It’s not just about Liverpool, but about the inability for those who wish to compete to rest on their laurels. The Premier League bar is as high as it’s ever been, and given Liverpool’s brilliance on the pitch, where they swarm over and suffocate opponents to win game after game with no let up,and off it, where they have an extraordinary record of making perfect signings, the ceiling may not yet be in sight. It’s a harrowing thought for all Premier League clubs, including Manchester City, who are right there alongside them. The Premier League will want to bleed what has become a wonderful – if slightly too respectful – rivalry for the four years Klopp is now committed to, at the very least. That relies on Pep Guardiola. Both City and Liverpool are excellent football teams with very gifted footballers, but the reason either is able to keep pace with the other is down to their managers. Liverpool without Klopp would not be in this title race and the same goes for City without Guardiola.  The City boss is about to enter the final year of his contract at the Etihad and will have spent seven seasons at the club by the summer of 2023. He has extraordinary footballers at his disposal, at a football club with extraordinary resources to continue to develop and improve. But that alone may not be enough for him to extend his deal; he’s been on the verge of leaving on more than one occasion and this is comfortably the longest he’s stayed at one club. If anything was to persaude him to remain it may well be the promise of further great battles with his affable nemesis on Merseyside. Draining though that sounds to us mortals, these guys live for the stress of competition at the highest level, and there is, and will be, no higher level while these two masters continue to push each other. It’s terrible news for those playing catch up – 2026 is a long way off.Mikel Arteta will be in the process of extending his ‘process’, Harry Kane will be 33 and still trophyless at Tottenham (or Manchester United), Chelsea will be firmly reduced to a cup team losing two finals a season, and Wayne Rooney will be overseeing the overhaul of the overhaul at Old Trafford. With one flick of his pen, Klopp has fail-safed Liverpool’s future,cemented the Premier League’s top spot in the European league hierarchy for the foreseeable, and f***ed all of us except Manchester City, who will be f***ing us further.

503,https://www.football365.com/news/klopp-doubts-new-deal-liverpool-deciding-factor-salah-mane,"Klopp doubts his new deal at Liverpool will be deciding factor for Salah, Mane futures","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp does not believe his new deal will be the deciding factor on whether the likes of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane commit their long-term futures to the club. The pair, along with Roberto Firmino and midfielder Naby Keita, have contracts which expire next summer and negotiations have dragged on for some time. With Klopp now staying until 2026, there is a greater degree of security at the club but the German is not convinced that will make a huge difference to individual players’ decisions. Liverpool press to depress opponents as Klopp keeps complacency completely at bay “That is more a question for the boys, what it exactly means for them but all fine, my relationship with them is great,” he said. “My point is in life there are more important things to think about, not only who is the manager but knowing who the manager and coaching staff is is important thing because when you know what you have with other clubs where you could go, you don’t know exactly. “There is no 100 per cent in this business but I think it is pretty likely I will stay for a little bit longer because other coaches are there at other clubs. “If it is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. “It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.” Salah’s contract negotiations have dragged on for several months now, with the Egypt international stressing last week the delay was “not about money at all”. However, whether the guarantee of working with Klopp for the final peak years of his career will be persuasive enough for him to accept an offer below a reported £400,000-plus a week remains to be seen. But whichever way that decision goes Klopp will not hold it against him or any other player who sees their future elsewhere. Asked whether players in the past had spoken to him about his own future before committing theirs, Klopp added: “That happened as well. I don’t judge loyalty because of these kind of things. “From my side yes, if I commit, I commit but I know a player’s career is 15 years and I have great relationships today with former players of mine who wanted to leave in specific moments when I thought ‘That’s a shame you go now’. “If a player tells you early enough he wants to go then you have to deal with it: is there a club that wants him, is there a transfer fee? “If a player is coming at the last moment and tells you on Sunday when the transfer window closes on the Monday ‘By the way, I can’t stay here’ then (it’s) ‘Sorry my friend, that’s not possible’. “To plan we need decisions at a specific point and that’s what we are working on. “But I don’t judge people if they are loyal or not if they say during a contract ‘I want to go somewhere else and see what the weather is like or how the grass is there’. “That’s not the case. I think you see loyalty in other areas.” Join us LIVE as the boss speaks to the media ahead of the trip to face Newcastle United tomorrow! 🎙#NEWLIV https://t.co/3lPLfIFvOn — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 29, 2022 Klopp takes his side to Newcastle for the lunchtime kick-off on Saturday looking to put the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City, who are the late game at Leeds, by opening up a two-point gap at the top. With one foot in the Champions League final, holding a 2-0 lead over Villarreal ahead of a trip to Spain next week, and an FA Cup final against Chelsea in a fortnight, an unprecedented but unlikely quadruple remains on track. Klopp said him signing a new contract is the start of a new era at the club. “We don’t think about changing the team in the next two or three years or whatever, but you have to prepare the little things so that you are ready for the future as well,” he said. “That’s why I really think it’s a really good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place. “We cannot wait 10 years. We have to do it now. It’s no threat. This is only the start, to be honest. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. “There’s nothing guaranteed, it’s why we have to enjoy the journey.

504,https://www.football365.com/news/premier-league-preview-newcastle-liverpool-man-city-leeds-kalvin-phillips-frank-lampard-everton-arsenal,"Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea","It’s another huge weekend at the top and bottom of the Premier League, with Liverpool facing their toughest remaining fixture while Frank Lampard takes on some familiar faces… Game to watch – Newcastle v Liverpool Liverpool start the Premier League weekend with probably their toughest assignment of the five left between now and the end of the season. Which is further testament to the job being done by Eddie Howe at Newcastle. This is a clash of the top-flight’s two most in-form teams of 2022. Howe’s Newcastle entered January second-from-bottom of the table, with all hopes pinned on the winter window as their only route out of danger. Of course, spending £92million helped but there is much more behind the Magpies’ stunning revival, with Howe at the core of it all. Since the turn of the year, Newcastle have earned six fewer points than Liverpool but two more than Manchester City. Only City have beaten the Toon on Tyneside since Howe took over and they are currently on a six-game winning streak at home, their best run since 2004, to take them to ninth in the table. So the prospect of going to a stirringly unified St James’ Park on Saturday lunchtime, in between Champions League semi-final legs, has to be the most daunting test Liverpool have remaining as they bid to chase down City at the summit. Tyneside is the only place that could currently give Anfield a run in the optimism stakes and Howe has harnessed that energy perfectly. Liverpool can’t hope to quieten the crowd, but in their current form, you wouldn’t bet against the Reds if they had half a million flag-waving Geordies inside St James’ Park on Saturday. Their biggest threat is a Newcastle side pulling for each other like few other teams at present with the licence and freedom to express themselves. Jurgen Klopp reckons the Reds are up against the schedulers too having tried and failed to get this game shifted from the lunchtime slot after a Wednesday night European game. Some rotation is inevitable but Klopp has a balancing act to perform with Newcastle energised and primed to expose any weariness or rustiness.  Cheeky Punt  Player to watch – Kalvin Phillips If Liverpool come through their Tyneside trip unscathed, the pressure is heaped upon Manchester City to keep pace on Saturday evening when they cross the Pennines to visit Dirty Leeds. Jesse Marsch’s men may remain in a relegation fight but the Yorkshiremen are currently unbeaten in five games as they prepare to welcome a City side that has beaten them only once in three attempts since the start of last season. Admittedly, that was a 7-0 pummelling at the Etihad earlier this season, but Marsch has instilled some backbone into the side that was ravaged by injuries when they were embarrassed by the champions before Christmas. Part of that renewed resilience stems from Phillips’ return, with the England midfielder playing 90 minutes for Leeds on Monday night for the first time since November. Phillips helped Leeds earn consecutive clean sheets for the first time since his last full outing, also against Palace at Elland Road. At Selhurst Park, Marsch described Leeds defensively as being able to bend without breaking, and the aim will be the same against City on Saturday. Phillips is still, in his own words, getting up to speed with fitness and the demands of Marsch’s system, but the Manchester United target will be key to Leeds stopping the leaders, whatever form and shape they take while Pep Guardiola juggles their domestic duties with the Champions League semi-final second leg at Real Madrid in midweek.  Manager to watch – Frank Lampard Lampard will be hoping City can do them a favour at Leeds and Watford can stop Burnley’s revival before the Everton boss comes up against his former side Chelsea on Sunday lunchtime, by which time they could be five points adrift of safety. The Everton manager has taken a kicking lately, especially so after the Merseyside derby, when the Toffees went to Anfield and highlighted their own inferiority to their neighbours. Such tactics were the act of a man made desperate by his team’s plight and while they were easier to explain away at Anfield, Goodison Park won’t accept a repeat of that approach on home soil against Thomas Tuchel’s Blues. Evertonians, and the Premier League table, demand a home win, or at the very least the intent to claim one. Lampard’s blueprint will likely resemble that which almost held Manchester City at Goodison when Everton were denied a stonewall penalty late on that could have boosted them and Liverpool in their respective fights at each end of the table. The Toffees have been considerably more resilient at home and Everton supporters are rallying with orchestrated shows of support before and during the visit of Chelsea. Lampard has to tap into that positivity and empower his side to attack a Chelsea side that has conceded 13 goals in seven games. Before two away games, one point might not be enough for the Toffees.  Team to watch – Arsenal Tune in at 4:30pm on Sunday to see which Arsenal shows up for the London derby at West Ham… Might it be the imperious Gunners who dominated Chelsea in their last capital clash; will we see again the nervous side which turned over Manchester United despite never looking comfortable; or could the team who lost three on the bounce to Brighton, Palace and Southampton show up to once again derail their top-four ambitions? Fortunately for Arsenal, Spurs are similarly as flaky; United are a mess; West Ham have other priorities and are focusing on a route to the Champions League via Europa League glory. The fact the Hammers’ semi-final clashes with Eintracht Frankfurt sandwich this derby could also play into Mikel Arteta’s hands when he takes the Gunners to the London Stadium. David Moyes made six changes last week at Chelsea and the Irons boss looks set to repeat his rotation this weekend, especially with four centre-backs potentially missing. Arsenal have somewhat ridden their luck to regain control of the race for fourth but the breaks won’t keep coming if they fluff their lines again this weekend. A convincing performance is optional but three points are compulsory.   EFL game to watch –QPR v Sheffield United The Blades’ trip to Loftus Road kicks off a frenetic penultimate round of Championship fixtures, with the eight clubs below Fulham all potential play-off contenders. United currently occupy sixth place – the final play-off berth – and need a win against Rangers, who have fallen way off the pace in the promotion race, to make the final-day meeting with champions-elect Fulham a little less daunting. You can watch Fulham’s attempt to sew up the title against fifth-placed Luton on Monday, with a fairly inconsequential meeting between Barnsley and Preston also televised on Saturday afternoon. For a full preview of the second-tier action, check out Benjamin Bloom’s Champ Big Weekend.  European game to watch – AC Milan v Fiorentina The title races in France and Germany have already been wrapped up while Real Madrid only need a point at home to Espanyol on Saturday afternoon to clinch the La Liga crown. So beyond these shores, it’s off to Italy for the most exciting climax… Inter had the chance to go top on Wednesday evening when they played their game in hand against Bologna. But the Nerazzurri f***ed it in calamitous style, going down 2-1 like this… CATASTROPHIC! 😲 It's a nightmare for Inter Milan's second choice goalkeeper, Ionuț Radu. Could that cost them the Serie A title? pic.twitter.com/7NcXOxiMwZ — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 27, 2022  So with four games remaining, Milan hold retain a two-point lead at the summit before they host Fiorentina on Sunday afternoon before Inter go to Udinese.

A thrilling 2-2 draw at the Etihad left the situation at the top of the Premier League unchanged with Pep Guardiola’s side leading by one point, with just seven games remaining. The run-in suggests City have the greater advantage as they face Brighton, Watford, Leeds and Newcastle – all teams in the bottom half – before facing Wolves, West Ham and then Aston Villa away on the final day of the season. 16 Conclusions: Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool Liverpool, by comparison, have to play top-seven sides Manchester United and Tottenham as well as Merseyside rivals Everton, while also having to tackle Villa, Wolves, Newcastle and Southampton. “We want to win every game we’re in, no matter the opposition we come up against,” the defender told beIN Sports. “It says a lot about us that we’ve got that slight disappointment not to come here (to City) and win. “It was very important for us not to lose this game, we’re still in a decent position but it is in their hands. “A few years ago (in 2018-19 when they were pipped to the title by a single point) this is what happened. They (City) went on a really good run and we weren’t able to capitalise on that. Hopefully, this time around, they will drop a few points for us. “Every week there is a surprising result in the Premier League. We’re just hoping we are not on the end of one and City are. “It is seven games. Who knows what will happen, hopefully we make it exciting. It might go down to the last day again.” 44 – Since the start of 2018-19, Trent Alexander-Arnold has assisted more Premier League goals than any other player (44). His assist for Diogo Jota today means he has now set up at least one goal against all other 19 current Premier League sides. Unstoppable. pic.twitter.com/kiVtJFUJQz — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 10, 2022  On Saturday the two teams face each other again but this time in a make-or-break FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Manager Jurgen Klopp believes their experience at the Etihad will help somewhat in planning for that game, although he expects another high-intensity, absorbing encounter. But his immediate focus has to be on Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Benfica, over whom they hold a 3-1 advantage. “Would I loved to have won the game? Yeah. Would it have changed our situation? Not really, not now,” Klopp told BBC Sport after his side failed to get the win which would have lifted them above City into top spot. “I’m already in the Benfica mood but we will use this game and try to understand. We will see what they do next time, what we will do next time. “The main problem for the (semi-final) game is extra time – you can’t see for 120 minutes this kind of football. Thank God we can use five substitutes.”  ",positive

The England international has emerged as one of the best passers in world football in recent years at Anfield. Alexander-Arnold has got 43 assists Premier League assists over the last four seasons and has become one of the most important attacking players at Liverpool. Gossip: Liverpool eye Bayern slayer; Ten Hag wants Neves at Man Utd The Liverpool wing-back was brilliant again as the Reds beat Benfica 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, showing off his range of passing. And former Chelsea and Liverpool midfielder Cole likened him to Man Utd and England legend Beckham but thinks he is actually “better” in many ways. “Look, it doesn’t need words. It’s Beckham-like but I think he’s actually a better passer than Beckham, a better crosser than Beckham,” Cole toldBT Sport. “That’s saying something because Becks was the best of my generation. The problem England have got is we’ve also got [Chelsea right-back] Reece James. “You cannot leave either of them out, they’ve both got outstanding attributes.

And it’s not usually passes that do that to me. It’s out or order the way he passes the ball. It’s not only the execution, it’s the vision.” Meanwhile, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has played down suggestions that their crunch clash with Manchester City is a Premier League title decider. “If we win against City, which is already difficult enough, I think no one would think, ‘that’s it, decided’, because of the quality of the opponent,” said Klopp. “We play now against the best team in the world but we will give it a try anyway. “Everyone knows about the importance of the next game, but after this game there will be other game in another competition but also in the Premier League as well. “If you cannot be first you want to be second, if you are behind then you want to come closer, if you are close you want to overtake. “That’s the situation and we will give it a proper try.”  ",positive

Lingard has fallen down the pecking order at Man Utd in recent years. The Englishman failed to make a Premier League appearance during the first half of the 2020/21 campaign. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope West Ham signed him on loan at the start of 2021 and he shone for the Hammers. He grabbed nine goals and four assists from his 16 outings for David Moyes’ side. Lingard was expected to depart Man Utd last summer but he ended up staying. He has only started four games this term and he is out of contract in June. Newcastle attempted to sign him in January but Man Utd refused to let their player leave. ESPN are now reporting that Lingard is ‘set to leave’ United. The clubs ‘leading the chase’ to sign him are AC Milan and Juventus. The two Serie A clubs have ‘registered their interest’ in him but it is noted that ‘there is competition from clubs in the Premier League and abroad.’ Ralf Rangnick thinks Man Utd could need as many as three new strikers in the summer transfer window with the interim boss refusing to answer a question on Cristiano Ronaldo’s future. Ronaldo has scored 23 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this campaign after joining from Serie A side Juventus in the summer transfer window. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Erik ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” ",positive
508,https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-midfield-targets-rice-gravenberch-tchouameni-haidara-phillips,Man Utd’s five midfield targets: the cases for and against,"Manchester United’s priority for the summer transfer window is said to be a central midfielder. But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive

Tchouameni has emerged as one of the finest young talents in European football in the last year, starring for Monaco and the France international team. READ MORE: 2020 vision: Every PL club’s best signing of the decade so far Paul Pogba played alongsideTchouameni in France’s 2-1 win over Spain in the Nations League final in October, and hailed his “extraordinary” talent. Pogba said:“Very, very good. He’s not a boy, he’s a man. “It’s a pleasure to play next to him. He brings a lot of energy. A lot of energy, extraordinary technical and physical quality. “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” Despite Chelsea’s strength in the two holding midfield roles, they have struggled with absnences in those positions this season, and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho both now 30 years old, Tuchel wants fresh blood in the middle of the park. Conor Gallagher is expected to return from his loan at Crystal Palace to stake a claim for a place in the Chelsea team next season, but his form hasn’t lessened their interest in Tchouameni. The 21-year-old – valued by Monaco at €80million – is also on United’s radar, with some reports suggesting the Red Devils are leading the race. But Marca (via football.london) claim Tuchel has singled outTchouameni as his number one target and he’s told Chelsea to land him ‘at all costs’ this summer. In an interview with L’Equipe, Tchouameni has previously discussed his future, insisting that he does not let it distract him from his work with Monaco. “I remember I was in Paris, after the Nations League. I woke up and my phone had blown up,” he said. “My father called me, we talked about everything and he told me that I was on the front page of Marca. I went on Twitter and saw for myself. “I told him it was cool, but what does it actually matter? It doesn’t. The front page of Marca will not define me or allow me to perform well in matches. It’s not real life, but it is the media world, the football business. They talk about me today but tomorrow, they’ll be talking about another. “In the dressing room, they put the cover up and laughed’ ‘Oh, you’re leaving us already?’ It’s flattering, but I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about it.” ",positive

Tchouameni is on the wishlists of a number of top European clubs, including Manchester United and Chelsea, but Liverpool have also entered the fray. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The 22-year-old midfielder has been a stalwart for Monaco since his £16m move from Bordeaux in the summer of 2020. The Times claim ‘the clever recruitment of the likes of Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Ibrahima Konaté in recent transfer windows has maintained the club’s forward momentum by freshening up the squad and that approach is likely to continue’. The report continues, ‘they like Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni, although they are aware the France international is attracting interest from Real Madrid. Whether they press ahead with interest depends on a number of factors, including price, but it would be a midfielder with a similar profile to the powerful Tchouaméni that they would target should he be out of reach’. It’s also claimed that the club is interested inAberdeen’s 18-year-old right back Calvin Ramsay, who is also wanted by Leeds United, while a deal forFulham’s Fabio Carvalho, 19, has already been lined up. Liverpool’s desire to continue to improve the squad has been boosted by ‘positive noises’ from Jurgen Klopp over signing a new deal at the club. President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal with his ulterior motive to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’.

The Frenchman has also been linked with a move to Manchester United. It is said that Monaco’s asking price ‘could go up to £50m’. Following a spell at Bordeaux, Tchouameni made the move to Monaco during the winter transfer window in 2020. Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together The 22-year-old has been an ever-present for Monaco over the past two seasons. He has been in fine form as he has played 47 times this term across all competitions. Tchouameni made his senior debut for France last year and he has now been capped eight times. Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna has revealed (via Twitter) that Liverpool are targeting Tchouameni. It is said that ‘contacts have been initiated’ between Liverpool and Monaco. In a boost to Liverpool, the player is reportedly ‘interested in the idea’ of playing in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has been taken aback by the recent performances of Divock Origi: “If you are in a rhythm, the easy bit is coming on and making an impact as a sub,” Owen said. “Everyone is tiring and it’s a free punch, that’s the easy bit. “The hard bit is the never playing bit. You get out of rhythm. Your mindset is not playing. “You go to bed on a Friday and you don’t even expect to play. “If you keep doing the right things, keep eating the right food, go to bed at the right time, and training perfectly. And you keep getting disappointed every weekend, then something switches off, at some point. “For him to stay at that level and that sharpness, and every single time he is called upon he comes on and makes a difference is quite staggering. “He doesn’t lose his fitness, his sharpness, he doesn’t lose anything, appetite and his attitude. “If I kept coming on and scoring, and being brushed aside and not starting and not playing, I’d start to get sickened by it. “So fair play to him, [he’s got] a great attitude.” ",positive

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive

In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive

The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere. Everything was prepared to give us a knock as well but because we were prepared for a fight we came through.” ",positive

He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

Jurgen Klopp’s side overcame Villarreal 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final and are now huge favourites to make the final of Europe’s showcase competition for the third time in five seasons. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe The quadruple would be an unprecedented feat in England and both Ferdinand and fellow BT Sport pundit Michael Owen were in awe of the Reds on Wednesday. “This is the best Liverpool team I’ve ever seen,” Ferdinand said. “They’re relentless with and without the ball. It’s the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application, you marvel at it. “That [the quadruple] has got to be the aim. They are going to set themselves the target. “If they achieve it they’re immortal, they are above anyone that has played the game in this country. Whether they can achieve it remains to be seen. But they’re ticking boxes along the way at the moment.” Former Reds striker Owen concurred with Ferdinand’s assessment. “This was total dominance,” added Owen. “It’s the best team I’ve ever seen in a red shirt. “They swarm you. Villarreal must think ‘what’s hit us?’ It’s impossible to stop this unbelievable press. They’re relentless. “Imagine it [the quadruple]. It’s impossible… but now you’re thinking can it happen? The way they’re playing, the belief, you’re thinking can it happen?” Klopp said after his side’s victory that they “had a lot of good moments”. “It was a brilliant game. The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp said. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive

Increasingly stranger things Ian Ladyman of the Daily Mail understandably enjoyed himself at the Etihad but something was eating him up inside: ‘We are four years in to the second decade of Middle East ownership now and watching this incredible game of European football it was hard not to wonder what further fabulous dramas may lie ahead. ‘More particularly, it seemed increasingly strange – as City traded thunderous blows with the best team in Spain – to ponder why Pep Guardiola would even think about leaving when his current contract expires at the end of next season.’ That does seem an ‘increasingly strange’ angle to ‘ponder’ after ‘watching this incredible game of European football’, which is presumably why literally no-one else did. But here we are. Guardiola has a contract that runs until 2023. He has been at Manchester City since 2016. This is already his longest unbroken spell as manager of one club by two years. That tenure, a four-year reign at Barcelona, came to an end because of a self-confessed need to “recharge my batteries”. It is not difficult to figure out why Guardiola might leave when his deal expires. But again, why is this hypothetical scenario that might come to pass in 13 months’ timeeven a subject of discussion after the first leg of an enthralling Champions League semi-final? There is no answer. Only more instances of things seeming strange. ‘This is the City team that Guardiola built and much as they were brilliantly expansive and precocious here, it is one that will only grow better, wiser and more talented from this point. ‘Next season, for example, the Premier League leaders are expected to have the Norwegian forward Erling Haaland in their ranks. ‘So, yes, it seems strange that Guardiola would even think about leaving as he has previously suggested he will.’ It would be strange if Guardiola didn’t think about leaving when his current contract of employment runs out. It would be strange if Guardiola was even looking beyond May, considering this season could yet end with Manchester City winning no trophies or claiming a Premier and Champions League double. It is downright bizarre that this is such a point of focus. ‘For all its quirks, this has the look of the greatest City team Guardiola has assembled in his six years in England. Its rivalry with Liverpool is magnetic. ‘If Guardiola does not continue to work here beyond next season, it’s hard to wonder where he will go. Even harder to work out why.’ It truly is impossible to predict what a man who took a sabbatical after four years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching could potentially do after seven years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching. Hopefully by the end of that seventh year, Ladyman has figured out the ‘increasingly strange’ world of football contracts.  Pep talk ‘Pep Guardiola must be furious with narrow Man City win – Real Madrid are comeback kings’ – the Daily Mirror headline to John Cross’ opinion piece. ‘Pep Guardiola’s delight with Manchester City’s swashbuckling win against Real Madrid outweighed any frustration about their inability to put the Champions League semi-final to bed in a jaw-dropping first leg’ – MailOnline.  Spill the Thi The biggest story on Wednesday, of course, is not Manchester City beating Real Madrid 4-3 in a thriller. It’s that Rio Ferdinand has said some words about Thiago Alcantara. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to sign for Man United before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich and says his ‘ridiculous’ form shows ‘players need time’… as he tips Jadon Sancho to emulate him,’ is the beefyMailOnline headline. They add with no little specificity that ‘Ferdinand reveals the player told him he was keen on becoming a Red Devil in 2020 when he was linked with a move away from the Bundesliga’. Except Ferdinand revealed no such thing. He was asked about Manchester United’s previous interest in the midfielder, said that he “spoke to him” and Thiago “wanted to come to United”. But this was in 2013. Not 2020, and definitely not ‘before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich’. Ferdinand has even spoken about this at length before on this very same podcast. Still, if one outlet blinks then others must follow: ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara “wanted” to join Man Utd before Liverpool transfer’ – Daily Mirror website. ”I spoke to him’ – Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago transfer claim over Liverpool and Man United’ – Liverpool Echo, who echo the demonstrably erroneous claim that ‘the former England international has claimedThiagotold him he was keen on a move to Old Trafford in 2020’. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to make Man Utd transfer before moving to rivals Liverpool’ – The Sun website, who even quote Ferdinand as saying “I spoke to him at the time he joined” Liverpool to make it sound more current, when he said no such thing.  But credit where it’s due: Manchester Evening News say ‘Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago admission over Manchester United ‘interest’, yet they clarify that he is talking about a situation many years ago, instead of following everyone else in pretending Thiago rejected Manchester United in favour of Liverpool. Actual fair play.  Saint Etienne “Anfield is hell!” – Villarreal’s Etienne Capoue claims Liverpool have worst stadium’ …to play at as a visiting team, as the Daily Mirror website well knows.  Trophy strife The Liverpool Echo headline: ‘Liverpool trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’ The Liverpool Echo sub-headline: ‘All Liverpool fans will want the quadruple from here if possible – but is there one trophy that means more than the others?’ You would hope so, considering Liverpool’s ‘trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’. Yet of the two writers tasked with debating the point, Sean Bradbury argues the case for the Premier League and Richard Garnett is in favour of the Champions League.

Thiago was criticised last season for playing a part in the Reds poor that saw them in sixth place in the Premier League table at the beginning of April. They recovered to finish third in the end and they have had a great season this campaign with an amazing Quadruple still within their grasp. Revealed: The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago Thiago produced an incredible performance as Liverpool beat Man Utd 4-0 eight days ago and has put in a number of high-level displays this term. When he joined Liverpool he was regarded as one of the best midfielders in world football and he is now living up to that tag this season. “Thiago has been the stand-out midfielder for the last few weeks and months he’s been absolutely top,” Ferdinand said on hisVibe With FiveYouTube channel. “You look at his stats. Thiago’s pass accuracy by the way in the last two games against Everton and Man Utd 98.4 percent against Everton and 95.6 percent against Everton. That is ridiculous. “I spoke to him at the time. He speaks perfect English, he was a great guy, wanted to come to United. But you look at him now and he couldn’t be happier.” A number of Man Utd signings, such as Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, have not hit the ground running at Old Trafford and Ferdinand has urged his fellow Red Devils supporters to see Thiago as an example of players needing time to settle. “There were ex-players I saw saying ‘he’s side to side, doesn’t play the ball forward he isn’t ready-made for this league’. Players need time. “It goes back to this thing with managers and Man Utd as well the club need to give the manager at Man Utd patience, the clubs need and the fans need to give players that come in from other leagues especially patience. “Sancho is another example. I bet you see a better player with Sancho next season for sure.” ",positive

Goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus,Phil Fodenand Bernardo Silva made sure that the Citizens kept their noses in front of Real in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final clash. Vinicius Junior had a quiet opening 45 minutes at the Etihad Stadium but came alive after the break with Fernandinho – who normally plays in midfield – slotting in at right-back after replacing John Stones on 36 minutes. Champions League? You’re having a right f***ing laugh Vinicius scored a brilliant individual goal for the Spanish giants in between Karim Benzema’s brace and Ferdinand thought the decision to put Fernandinho at right-back cost Man City. “Yeah, I didn’t have that. I didn’t have that in training!” 🫢 “I grabbed Joleon. I said ‘Oh my god, how dare he!'” 😂@JoleonLescott and @rioferdy5 on THAT Benzema penalty! The centre-back union can only sit back and admire…#UCL pic.twitter.com/m9BIcVbwno — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 26, 2022 “It was a fantastic game, the game ebbed and flowed in different ways,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “Momentumchanged many times during the game, moments of absolute class from individuals. “City will be a bit frustrated, you can see that. I think Pep will have a lot to say in that changing room. Real MadridI think will be buoyed I think by the way they showed the character and courage to come back. “But I still fancy City to go over there [to Madrid] and finish the job off. I think a big, big change in the way the game went was when Stones coming off. I think Stones’ injury destabilised the City team. “Unfortunately, Fernandinho at 36 years old having to play right-back against one of the most in-form wingers in the game at the moment, that was a vulnerability then in that Man City team.” Fellow pundit Steve McManaman was frustrated that Man City allowed Real back into the game and thinks they should’ve been out of sight at the end of the first leg. “You never accuse City of being naïve but they were at times,” McManaman added. “They shouldn’t have let Madrid back into the game. I don’t know what it was, whether they were just overly confident because they were so far ahead, so superior, as soon as they went two goals ahead they started to drop deep, even the third goal, the Panenka penalty, they [Madrid] just had a chance prior to that, you’re thinking to yourself, ‘how’s that happened?’. “City should be just controlling the game. I still think City will score goals and probably win the game over there, the way they played, but they’ve given Madrid a glimmer of hope. “And once they go back there with the fans it will be a different scenario to tonight.”  ",positive

The 25-year-old has made 31 starts this campaign and has found the back of the net 12 times whilst providing nine assists. He has been hotly tipped to receive an England call-up amid his terrific form, with the next international break taking place in late March. Liverpool have Salah situation wrong and Leeds fans want more Liverpool were rumoured to be interested in the Hammers man earlier in the season but now his form has only served to increase their desire to bring Bowen to Anfield in the summer. GiveMeSport transfer insider Dean Jones has claimed: ‘Maybe Jarrod Bowen is next on their radar and he’s somebody they’re seriously interested in.’ The Reds reinforced their forward line in January when they invested £37m on Luis Diaz, with the fee potentially reaching £49m if the winger triggers certain add-ons. Liverpool are trying to tie Mo Salah down to a new contract with the Egyptian’s deal expiring in the summer of 2023. There have been rumours that the Reds will attempt to bring the average age of their frontline down further and now Bowen could be their main summer target after he ‘caught the attention of Jurgen Klopp’s side’. Meanwhile, John Barnes doubts Bowen would ever be able to replace Salah but the former Liverpool midfielder doesn’t doubt the West Ham player’s class. “Jarrod Bowen is playing for a team that are in the top four or five in the Premier League, so he’s playing at the very top – as of right now,” Barnes toldBonusCodeBets. “He needs time to develop; he’s in his first real season playing for a better side. “Bowen’s never going to sign for Liverpool and replace Mohamed Salah. He is a different type of player to Mo, he isn’t going to score 30 goals a season, that’s not what Jarrod Bowen does. “In terms of his talent, can he play at big top five club? Absolutely.” Joe Cole was waxing lyrical about Bowen after their recent draw against Newcastle with the former West Ham midfielder claiming the 25-year-old is “getting better and better”. Cole said on BT Sport: “He’s unbelievable, every time I watch him I’ve been so impressed with him. He’s getting better and better and better. He’s movement is so good.

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive

Spurs have been consistently linked with De Vrij in recent months. The former Lazio centre-back has been with Inter Milan since 2018. He has played more than 150 times for Milan over the past four seasons. Ranking Spurs players by where they sit on Conte’s sh*tlist De Vrij played under Conte at Inter Milan. Together they helped the club win the Serie A title in 2020/21. Conte has been Tottenham boss since November. In January, he raided Juventus as the Londoners signedRodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski. On De Vrij, InterLive (via Sport Witness) have suggested that Milan ‘could lose one of their pillars’ this summer. Tottenham are interested in the Dutchman at the ‘request of Conte’. The 30-year-old would be offered a four-year deal that is worth around€6.5m each season. The report adds that Inter Milan will ‘close the deal’ this summer if they receive a bid in the region of€25-30m for De Vrij. Elsewhere, Conte has insisted that he has the patience to see the job through at Tottenham after they were dumped out of the FA Cup at Middlesbrough. The Championship side followed up their fourth-round giant-killing of Manchester United with another Premier League scalp as teenager Josh Coburn’s extra-time goal earned a deserved 1-0 win at the Riverside Stadium. “In this moment I’m the last person, I don’t think about myself. When I speak with my players and in my team I say that we have to think about ‘us’. Not ‘me’. “For me no problem and for me there is the desire, the will, the patience to try to continue to work very hard to improve, to make this team more stable than the past, because I think this is the key that can change the situation. “I try every day through the work.

Spurs have been consistently linked with De Vrij in recent months. The former Lazio centre-back has been with Inter Milan since 2018. He has played more than 150 times for Milan over the past four seasons. Ranking Spurs players by where they sit on Conte’s sh*tlist De Vrij played under Conte at Inter Milan. Together they helped the club win the Serie A title in 2020/21. Conte has been Tottenham boss since November. In January, he raided Juventus as the Londoners signedRodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski. On De Vrij, InterLive (via Sport Witness) have suggested that Milan ‘could lose one of their pillars’ this summer. Tottenham are interested in the Dutchman at the ‘request of Conte’. The 30-year-old would be offered a four-year deal that is worth around€6.5m each season. The report adds that Inter Milan will ‘close the deal’ this summer if they receive a bid in the region of€25-30m for De Vrij. Elsewhere, Conte has insisted that he has the patience to see the job through at Tottenham after they were dumped out of the FA Cup at Middlesbrough. The Championship side followed up their fourth-round giant-killing of Manchester United with another Premier League scalp as teenager Josh Coburn’s extra-time goal earned a deserved 1-0 win at the Riverside Stadium. “In this moment I’m the last person, I don’t think about myself. When I speak with my players and in my team I say that we have to think about ‘us’. Not ‘me’. “For me no problem and for me there is the desire, the will, the patience to try to continue to work very hard to improve, to make this team more stable than the past, because I think this is the key that can change the situation. “I try every day through the work.

The Italian was desperate for reinforcements last month at Tottenham but, after the club missed out on deals for Adama Traoreand Luis Diaz, they only brought in Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur on deadline day. On the same day Conte saw the club’s two most expensive players – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso – leave on loan, with Dele Alli joining Everton on a free transfer and Bryan Gil going to Valencia less than six months after his £25m arrival from Sevilla. Premier League winners and losers A report has claimed that Harry Kane will only commit his future to Spurs if they back Conte in the transfer market and now Italian website Inter Live reckon they will do just that by trying to sign Inter Milan duoLautaro Martinez and Stefan de Vrij. Tottenham had lost three Premier League matches in a row before their dramatic late 3-2 victory over champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Their poor form and lack of activity in the January market seemed to have demoralised Conte in recent interviews but they bounced back to maintain the seven-point gap to fourth-placed Manchester United, who they have three games in hand on. And Inter Live insist that Conte now ‘expects signings of players ready to win’ in the summer transfer window if he is to remain as boss beyond the summer and De Vrij and Martinez tick those boxes. Conte won the Serie A title last season with the duo key cogs in his winning team and now it is claimed that Spurs are prepared to pay€90-100m in a double swoop for the Inter pair. However, it is understood that Tottenham would fall around €20m short of their valuation as the Nerazzurri ‘would ask for €110-120m for both of them’. Inter Live describe it as a ‘difficult operation’ for Spurs but that landing De Vrij and Martinez ‘would make the discontented Conte happy’. ",positive

Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick could return to Leipzig for a midfielder… LIVERPOOL KEEN ON CRANKY CAMAVINGA Eduardo Camavinga only joined Real Madrid in the summer, when Manchester United were thought to be interested in the France midfielder. But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool. Apparently, the 19-year-old ‘has a monumental rage’ over his situation at Real and is open to loan or permanent offers, and Jurgen Klopp is still keen to take the former Rennes star. Having done a deal to sign Camavinga in the summer which could cost them up to £35million, Real are said to want a profit on the midfielder.

Fabrizio Romano says the Red Devils’ renewal offer to Pogba is still on the table, where it has been since the summer. There are no negotiations with other clubs over a possible January sale, while Pogba is still said to be assessing his options. Indeed, the Mirror reports that if Pogba wants to leave United next month, he will have to push for a move. But Ralf Rangnick is still exploring the market for midfielders and the Mirror reckons the United boss could make contact with former club RB Leipzig to discuss a deal for Amadou Haidara.

De Vrij is entering the final 18 months of his contract at the San Siro, where he played for Conte before the manager moved on. The Sun rehashes a report from Swiss website 4-4-2.com that suggests Spurs are keen on Matthijs De Ligt – but they won’t pay the ridiculous release clause that comes into play next summer. De Ligt could leave Juventus for around £130million at the end of the season, with Barcelona and Chelsea interested. But those clubs too would also be looking to negotiate on that figure. ",positive

The pressure at the bottom of the table has shifted on to 18th-placed Everton and Leeds, who dropped to 17th following Burnley’s win. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward An own goal from James Tarkowski handed the home side the lead, and the visitors can consider themselves unlucky with the manner of the goal, as Juraj Kucka’s strike rebounded off the crossbar and into the net off the back of the Burnley defender. Burnley left it late to find a leveller, with Jack Cork heading in an 83rd-minute equaliser before Josh Brownhill’s strike sealed the comeback victory for the visitors. The Hornets had started the game second from bottom and nine points behind their opponents with five games remaining, however they now require wins in all their remaining matches this season as well as a big goal-difference swing to remain in the top flight. Burnley’s turnaround after parting company with Sean Dyche continued, with the Clarets taking 10 points from four games since Mike Jackson took over at Turf Moor. Watford opened the scoring with an eighth-minute own goal from Tarkowski. Joao Pedro had an opportunity to double his side’s lead in the 14th minute when he cleverly controlled a long ball from goalkeeper Ben Foster, taking the ball away from the defender, before firing over the bar. 🤩 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗬 𝗔𝗧 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗚𝗘 𝗥𝗢𝗔𝗗!!!#WATBUR | #UTC pic.twitter.com/8vz2vy6TBI — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) April 30, 2022 Burnley looked to hit back, with their first significant chance of the game, but Brownhill’s strike from distance skidded wide of the target. The visitors looked to have been given a way back into the game when referee Craig Pawson pointed at the penalty spot, but it was correctly overturned by VAR and a free-kick awarded instead. Burnley looked to get on the front foot at the start of the second half, with Nathan Collins attempting to lift the ball goalwards, only for Foster to make a straightforward save. However, Ismaila Sarr drove forward to create an opportunity, and the ball fell to Kucka, but his well-hit strike was saved by an outstretched Nick Pope. Burnley had a good chance in the 74th minute when Ashley Barnes’ header was tipped onto the crossbar by Foster who then managed to scramble the ball away. Foster had to make another save less than four minutes later with Burnley continuing to push for the equaliser. Burnley had been pushing throughout the second half for an equaliser, which came in the 83rd minute, as Cork timed his run well to head home from a ball from Charlie Taylor down the left. Less than three minutes later the Clarets had taken the lead, with Watford struggling to contain the visitors. The hosts were unable to clear their lines before the ball fell to Brownhill who fired it into the bottom corner, before sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate with the travelling support.

The summer signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were meant to catapult the Red Devils nearer to the Premier League title but they have gone backwards instead.

A couple of players up front. Huge!” Keane added: “Fernandes doesn’t get the ball back for you. Nobody mentions will he miss out. [Marcus] Rashford doesn’t do nowhere near enough. Sometimes they go to close people down but they are not really going after people, they’re just going through the motions. “We saw that again tonight with the amount of chances Chelsea created because players were going through the motions.

The Reds produced a good display to beat Eddie Howe’s side 1-0 on Saturday with Naby Keita scoring the only goal of the game as they put pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City. Klopp chose to leave out Salah for their trip to St James’ Park, as well as another couple of regulars, and Liverpool should’ve probably won by a greater margin. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Neville doubted Klopp’s decision on Saturday, as well as Pep Guardiola’s choice to leave out Kevin de Bruyne in their 4-1 win at Leeds United, but admits that the two managers will have made their squad “feel a million dollars”. Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “It’s the first time Jurgen Klopp’s left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don’t know. But when I saw that, I thought, ‘Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?’. “I just thought because he’s played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that’s a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he’s number one. So can we get through without him? “So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that’s the two best players – I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance – but those are the two star players. To come through those games without their two star players, the rest of the squad will feel a million dollars, and you’ve rested your two best players.” Access all areas ✅ Go behind the scenes of our win over Newcastle United at St. James’ Park 📽 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 2, 2022 Neville added: “What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they’re basically empowering the squad. You hear managers say ‘I’ve got a great squad’, but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? “Where you know if you don’t win there is a large consequence, or you’re probably going to lose a league title, or you’re going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win – you’ve empowered everybody. “You’ve made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone’s had a game, no one feels like there’s a first eleven. “It’s a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you’re going to go for three and four trophies because you’re going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it’s for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. “It’s really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you’re going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. “We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they’re contributing to the success, and it’s not just a token gesture where you’re being played in the sort of weak games.”  ",positive

The 29-year-old has been in brilliant form again this season with 30 goals and 14 assists in all competitions for Jurgen Klopp’s men. That takes the Egypt international’s tally since he joined the club from Roma in 2017 to 155 goals in 248 appearances. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Salah will have one year remaining on his contract at the end of the current season with no sign of a breakthrough in talks between his representatives and Liverpool. The Egyptian has repeatedly claimed that he wants to stay at Liverpool and recently insisted that the slow progress in negotiations is not “about the money”. Salah told FourFourTwo last month: “I don’t know, I have one year left. I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. “So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly. I have one year left and the fans know what I want. “I’m not worried, I don’t let myself worry about something. The season didn’t finish yet, so let’s finish it in the best possible way – that’s the most important thing. Then in the last year, we’re going to see what’s going to happen.” But the Daily Telegraph claim that Liverpool are now heading into ‘forced to sell territory’ with such little time on Salah’s contract and the fact that he will be able to leave next summer on a free transfer. The report adds that Salah is ‘tempted to move on for a new challenge, possibly in Spain, maybe in Paris.’ Liverpool boss Klopp recently signed a new deal until 2026 but he dismissed the idea that his decision to remain will be a deciding factor for the likes of Salah and Sadio Mane to commit their long-term futures to the club. Klopp said: “That is more a question for the boys, what it exactly means for them but all fine, my relationship with them is great. “My point is in life there are more important things to think about, not only who is the manager but knowing who the manager and coaching staff is is important thing because when you know what you have with other clubs where you could go, you don’t know exactly. “There is no 100 per cent in this business but I think it is pretty likely I will stay for a little bit longer because other coaches are there at other clubs. “If it is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. “It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.” ",positive

Ajax could be an option for me, and a return to The Netherlands could be an option for me. The World Cup is coming.” Speaking on Tottenham’s win over Leicester, Antonio Conte stated that they “have to be satisfied” with their position in the Premier League: “It was a good performance against a really good team. The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason, we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive

I think you see the job he’s done. To be here from the start when he first came in and see that process bit by bit, seeing signs but not having the consistency every week and then building it and we’re getting better and the counter-press coming on and then the quality with the ball. “It’s been one big process.

The Gunners struck from corners in each half to secure a crucial three points in their race for Champions League qualification and for the time being hold off closest rivals Tottenham, who overcame Leicester 3-1 earlier in the day. 16 Conclusions: Patched-up and knackered West Ham 1-2 Arsenal set-pieces Bukayo Saka was an influential figure throughout and Arsenal would have won more comfortably had Eddie Nketiah not been so wasteful, but West Ham were magnificent given their Europa League semi-final commitments and shortage of defenders. Star forward Michail Antonio only appeared as a second-half substitute after Thursday night’s 2-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt and Declan Rice started even though the away leg is only four days away. West Ham’s biggest problems were in defence, however, where injury and suspension left Kurt Zouma as the only fit centre-back and at times even he appeared to still be hampered by his recent ankle injury. But they emptied the tanks and took the game to their London rivals for long spells, looking the stronger side and equalising through Jarrod Bowen before eventually falling to a defeat that mathematicaly ends their own designs on fourth place. For all the demands of their European campaign, West Ham started brightly and Aaron Ramsdale needed to act decisively to deal with an inswinging corner by Bowen. Saka was determined to make something happen for Arsenal during a promising attack that eventually came to a halt. The Hammers were on top but there were few thrills at either end and when Holding inexplicably passed the ball into touch it summed up a lifeless opening spell. When action did occasionally break out it took place at Arsenal’s end and in the 30th minute it needed a determined block from Holding to deny Manuel Lanzini from close range after Vladimir Coufal’s pass had deflected off Nuno Tavares. Rice shot straight into the arms of Ramsdale but soon after it became the Gunners’ turn to threaten, with Nketiah the catalyst as they crept ahead against the run of play. Nketiah threaded his way into the box to force a save from Lukasz Fabianski and from the ensuing corner Saka found Holding, who nodded home his first Premier League goal. Rice was at the heart of West Ham’s response that meant they entered half-time all square as he forced a smart save from Ramsdale before launching the move that led to their equaliser.

The second half started at a frantic pace as Bowen was shown a yellow card for simulation as he avoided Ramsdale’s lunge, amid a breathless spell for West Ham that ended abruptly when Arsenal added a second. Once again they pounced from a corner as the ball found Gabriel Martinelli, who crossed to his unmarked namesake and fellow Brazilian for a diving header that beat Fabianski at the far post. A flare hurled from the away fans’ section was cleared off the pitch and play resumed with Nketiah failing to make the most of a strong chance as Arsenal broke incisively. Nketiah’s wasteful afternoon continued as he sent his best opportunity yet wide of the right post, but the visitors had already done enough for the win in spite of West Ham’s late endeavour.

Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player. But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive
536,https://www.football365.com/news/everton-1-0-chelsea-richarlison-nets-huge-winning-goal-azpilicueta-mistake,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison nets huge winning goal thanks to Azpilicueta mistake,"Richarlison made the most of a mistake from Cesar Azpilicueta to score a huge winner for struggling Everton against Chelsea. The Brazil international scored the 90th-minute equaliser against Leicester here last time out but his 46th-minute strike was far more significant, because of the three points it secured in their bid for Premier League survival. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight However, it would have meant little without a brilliant recovery save inches from the line from Cesar Azpilicueta’s shot by Jordan Pickford, who had been beaten by Mason Mount’s strike off both posts. Frank Lampard’s side were, for once, both effective and efficient at either ends of the pitch against his former team. as they allied the commitment shown in defeat in last weekend’s Merseyside derby defeat with a real desire to win, with their 67-year top-flight status in real danger. Home form, considering they are so woeful on the road, was always likely to be their route to salvation and 10 points from the last four games at Goodison Park have proved essential in just keeping them afloat in 18th place. Victory means they now have a couple of teams two points above them to target in the relegation battle as Leeds, with a vastly-inferior goal difference and Arsenal and Chelsea to play in their next two fixtures, have been dragged into the mire. The recent form of Richarlison, who has been far from prolific in the absence of injured England striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, has been welcome to a team struggling for goals. His four goals in his last five league matches is as many as he scored in his first 21 of the season. But arguably more important on this occasion was the performance of Pickford, who after facing no shots on target for almost an hour, then produced an impromptu cameo to keep Chelsea at bay and the lead intact. His superb denial of Azpilicueta, scrambling across his goal having been beaten by Mount, had social media drawing comparisons with Gordon Banks’ save against Pele in the 1970 World Cup. While that may be a slight exaggeration, the significance of it in terms of the club’s future may be far more meaningful. The part played by Everton’s fans should also not be under-estimated: from the underhand tactic of letting off fireworks outside Chelsea’s hotel in the early hours to lining Goodison Road in their thousands armed with blue smoke canisters and flags to welcome the team coach. Everton set up in a 5-4-1 formation, with Alex Iwobi right wing-back and Seamus Coleman tucking inside, but far from being defensive it provided them with the security to harry and harrass a Chelsea side who struggled to find any fluency. Yerry Mina’s return at centre-back, after being rested for last weekend’s Merseyside derby defeat, also brought some much-needed assurance to the back five. The first half ended with more yellow cards (five) than shots on target (one) but all that changed just 59 seconds after the interval. Richarlison charged down an Azpilicueta clearance on the edge of his own area and the loose ball kindly dropped to Demarai Gray, who teed up his team-mate to sweep a shot past Edouard Mendy. Richarlison celebrated by grabbing a smoke canister thrown from the Gwladys Street end and hurling it back into the crowd. Us rn: pic.twitter.com/sQ8goLbD0l — Everton (@Everton) May 1, 2022 The lead should have really been doubled moments later but unfortunately for the Toffees the ball dropped to left wing-back Vitalii Mykolenko at the far post and he blazed wide with only Mendy to beat. At that point Pickford stepped forward to enhance his position as England’s number one with his superb goalline stop and then, with barely any time to think at the next phase of play, taking a shot from Antonio Rudiger full in the face. He was soon at it again with a one-handed save from a Ruben Loftus-Cheek drive but with the pressure growing and nerves jangling Everton, buoyed by the inspirational form of their goalkeeper, put everything on the line to keep a clean sheet. In seven minutes of added time Pickford got down low to block a Thiago Silva shot as Everton held on. ",positive

538,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-postponed,16 Conclusions: Tottenham Hotspur P-P Arsenal,"16 conclusions, as Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have their match postponed just over 24 hours before kick-off because Arsenal couldn’t raise a team… 1. There may have been some people who didn’t check, and who just turned up at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as if by muscle memory. It does happen. But those who did turn up for the second North London Derby of the season without having checked a newspaper or website first will have been disappointed upon turning up to a largely empty ground.  2. The Premier League finally called the match off, early on Saturday afternoon. This followed a request to postpone made by Arsenal on Friday because they only had 12 fit players for the match. Within Premier League rules, clubs have to have a minimum of 14 players available. It should be pointed out that this is a Premier League rule rather than a ‘law of the game’. Under those, the minimum number of players required to start a match is seven.  3. The controversy over this postponement cannot be seen in isolation from other controversies over postponements that have been building up over recent weeks. This weekend’s postponement was a tinderbox of potentially flammable materials, a derby match between two fierce rivals, both of whom are seeking a highly lucrative return to the Champions League, with just a couple of points between them, and both of whose form has ebbed and flowed to wild degrees since the start of the season. But the controversy over the North London Derby has to also be seen in a broader context. Since the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus became prevalent in December, its far higher transmission rates have forced more than 20 match postponements in the Premier League alone, as infection rates have soared amongst the general population. But as time has progressed, there has been greater ill-feeling over matches being postponed, with claims being made that clubs have been gaming the system by getting matches postponed for reasons that have little to do with the pandemic.  4. In the case of the Tottenham vs Arsenal match, only one of the absences was due to a positive Covid case (although a further positive test has also been reported by the club since), with the remainder of the absences being common or garden injuries or players who are unavailable due to their involvement in the African Cup of Nations, which is currently taking place in Cameroon. In its statement on this postponement, the Premier League stated: ‘All clubs are able to apply for a postponement if COVID-19 infections are a factor in their request’. The argument runs that Covid is really a minor reason behind the postponement of this match, and that while the letter of the law has been adhered to, its spirit might not be.  5. There seems little doubt that the Premier League would only take the decision to allow a match to be postponed extremely reluctantly. There is still space to fit in the postponed fixtures and have the season finish on time, but the longer time progresses, the more postponements there may need to be, and the less time there will be to fit them in. On top of this, the Premier League has a very lucrative set of television contracts, and it seems unlikely that Sky will have been very happy at having to fill a two-hour slot for a match which would have attracted a large audience, especially not at fairly short notice. There are competing pressures on the Premier League, both to postpone matches and to keep them going, and this should be recognised, regardless of what other criticisms might be made be made of the way in which this is being handled.  6. The official reaction from Tottenham to the postponement was extremely angry, with the club seeing fit to post a statement outlining their objections. In it, they point out that, ‘we ourselves were disqualified from the European Conference League after a significant number of COVID cases meant we needed to reschedule a fixture and our application to move our Leicester fixture was not approved – only for it to be subsequently postponed when Leicester applied’, that, ‘we do not believe it was the intent to deal with player availability unrelated to COVID’, and that, ‘we may now be seeing the unintended consequences of this rule’. Their wording does little to mask an apparent belief that Arsenal have been ‘gaming the system’.  7. This match certainly isn’t the first to face such an allegation. Indeed, just about every match that is postponed is now routinely accompanied by such allegations. The highest-profile have been directed at Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp over the postponement of their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, particularly after it emerged that this match was postponed over what turned out to be a series of false positive tests. Game off. What started out as postponements due to a pandemic has now become about clubs not having their best team . The Premier League must stop this now , draw a line in the sand and say all games go ahead unless you have an exceptional amount of CV cases . It’s wrong 👍 — Gary Neville (@GNev2) January 15, 2022  8. Trying to pick apart the specific reasoning why Tottenham might want this game to go ahead and Arsenal seems fairly straightforward. Tottenham would have welcomed the opportunity to play an under-strength Arsenal team, while Arsenal would rather all their players were back to full fitness first. But beyond that, the picture is somewhat muddier due to both teams’ inconsistency. Tottenham might well have wanted this game to go ahead, but they’d still have gone into it off the back of a lacklustre performance over two legs in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and underwhelming performances against Southampton and Watford in the League, and Morecambe in the FA Cup. Arsenal’s inconsistency has been of a different hue to that of Tottenham Hotspur. They may have lost to Manchester City – who hasn’t? – but their performance in this match was more a continuation of that which had preceded it; a run of four straight wins, during which they scored 14 goals. They likely would have gone into this match as favourites to win, all things being equal, and those look in from outside might have been forgiven wondering why the team in the better form wanted it called off.  9. So, what of these injuries, suspensions, and withdrawals, then? Well, Martin Odegaard had tested positive for Covid-19 prior to Thursday’s rescheduled Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield and Granit Xhaka was suspended after getting himself sent off in that match, while Thomas Partey, Mohamed Elneny, Nicolas Pepe and Omar Rekik are all on AFCON duty (as was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, though his involvement in that has been curtailed by Covid, and he’d have been unlikely to feature in Mikel Arteta’s plans anyway). There have also been eyebrows raised at this happening not long after Arsenal had loaned Ashley Matland-Niles to Roma and Folarin Balogun to Middlesbrough.  10. The only statement that Arsenal have made on the matter is confirmation that the match was postponed on their official website, along with an explanation that, ‘we know how much this match means to our fans around the world, but the Premier League has made the decision to postpone the match, due to many players across our squad currently being unavailable as a result of COVID-19, existing and recent injuries, in addition to players away with their countries at AFCON.’ 🚨 Our match against Tottenham on Sunday, January 16 has been postponed. #TOTARS — Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 15, 2022  The bare facts are the bare facts. If Arsenal did only have twelve fit players for this match, there was little question that this match would be called off, providing they could verify that to the Premier League. Critics have argued that football clubs have vast pools of their players at their disposal, and youth, reserve or academy players could be called up if the situation is desperate enough, but why should Arsenal be punished when they’ve stayed within the rules and other clubs have also been accused of ‘gaming the system’ too?  11. But it’s not difficult to see all sides of this debate, and Tottenham are probably justified in their unhappiness over the cancellation of this fixture as well. In December, they had to forfeit a decisive Europa Conference League fixture against Rennes despite having a Covid outbreak, and when they tried to rearrange it for the following week (because UEFA rules state that all group matches must be played by the end of the year) the Premier League then said no, because they couldn’t move Tottenham’s scheduled match against Leicester. The match ended up being postponed anyway upon Leicester’s request, but by this time it was was too late for Tottenham to reschedule their match against Rennes. Tottenham were effectively expelled from the Europa Conference League, but the Premier League would likely counter by saying that Tottenham’s issue with this should be with UEFA rather than them.  12. It has also been noted that, despite there having been 32 matches to play over the course of a long weekend, there were no Covid-inspired cancellations of FA Cup third round matches a week earlier. A cynic might argue that Premier League clubs have little interest in postponing fixtures if they can play a quarter of a first team padded out with squad, reserve and youth team players instead.  13. It probably shouldn’t be that surprising that requests for the postponement of matches are met with such cynicism when society in a broader sense seems to be having a crisis of confidence over taking anything in good faith any more. Add that the the inherent tribalism in football and the internet’s tendency to put everybody in an echo chamber, and you have a culture in which Liverpool requesting the postponement of a match one week and Arsenal requesting one the next causes allegations of corruption to emanate against everybody involved, regardless of whether they may be true.  14. With only just over half the season played, there’s no way that anybody can say for certain how the second half of this season plays out, either. It seems likely that we are at or are near the top of this wave of the pandemic, but no-one can say with 100% certainty what will happen between now and the end of May, with regard to public health, new waves or new variants of the virus. And there remains little no chance of there being any further changes to the rules before the end of this season. It would take something that we can’t predict right now for this season extended, and curtailment seems out of the question.  15. There is a growing body of opinion which believes it now inevitable that Covid will become endemic within our society, and that we will have to adapt in time to manage it as we would the flu or the common cold. It certainly seems inconceivable that we won’t still need protocols of some description in place for the start of next season. The Premier League’s Annual General Meeting in June will be the time for this to happen. It’s also worth remembering that ‘the Premier League’ is ultimately little more than a collection of its twenty clubs. Everything has been voted through, and Premier League clubs have every opportunity to tighten the rules come the end of the season, should they wish to.  16. It should be absolutely clear that this is not an issue that is a problem of one, two or more clubs. This whole mess is a failure on the part of the Premier League. Looking forward to this season, it shouldn’t have been difficult to foresee that there were likely to be new flare-ups of the virus, and that circumstances could change extremely quickly. The Africa Cup of Nations was a known variable. Clubs knew that it would be played in January. It was also clear that the compacted nature of the previous two calendars meant that injuries through wear and tear were likely to be higher this season. They did look at the rules and they did change them, but it is clear that in an era when the financial costs of dropping a single point can run to tens of millions of pounds, those rules need to be watertight. The very reason we have rules in the first place is partly because clubs can’t be trusted to run their own affairs. There’s nothing unusual about that. It’s just human nature. But the rules that the Premier League put in place should have been watertight and flexible, while being impossible to game. Instead, over much of the last few weeks they’ve looked as though they’ve been winging it. The empty seats at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for this match probably couldn’t have been avoided, but the rancour that has accompanied it probably could.  ",neutral

After an October offer to make him the Premier League’s highest-paid player, negotiations are now off with United and he is bound for PSG. There is no other serious competition for his signature. There’s also talk in The Sun about Romelu Lukaku being offered to PSG, though it would be cheaper for them to move forAjax star Anthony or Amine Gouiri of Nice as a replacement for Kylian Mbappe. They really could be a retirement home for all manner of overpaid Premier League flops.  ARSENAL WANT NEVES ‘Wolves midfielder RubenNevesis emerging as one of Arsenal’s top summer transfer targets,’ says Sky Sports, which is not a new claim, though the valuation of £50-60m just might be. That sounds like something of a bargain to us and if that’s too rich for the Gunners, then Barcelona, Manchester United or Tottenham will surely pay that price for a player who could yet decide the title race. The Gunners are looking for a long-term partner for Thomas Partey in midfield and Neves is definitely an upgrade on Granit Xhaka. Another option is Aston Villa man Douglas Luiz. They are also in the market for a striker (or two, surely?) and a more attacking right-back.  NEWCASTLE TURN TO TROSSARD While many presumed that Allan Saint-Maximin would be part of the ‘new Newcastle’, the Mail are the latest to say that actually, the Frenchman will be sold to help fund a splurge on new players. One of those new players might be Brighton’s Belgian winger Leandro Trossard, who wants to leave the Seagulls for a new challenge.Nottingham Forest’s Brennan Johnson and Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby are also being eyed. Newcastle have already raided Brighton for Dan Burn and Dan Ashworth, and may get prickly if they come back for both Trossard and midfielder Yves Bissouma, also a target for Newcastle and every other Premier League club with ambitions to break up the Big Six.

The Spanish defender joined Serie A side Udinese on loan during the January transfer window having struggled for game time at the Emirates. De Gea breaks top 10 keepers with most PL clean sheets And Mari has opened up on his Arsenal exit, saying that Arteta was excellent in assisting his transfer to the Italian league. “In the winter, we made commitments together,” Mari told ESPN. “I explained my situation to him, my feelings. I don’t play in the last six months. “[He said] the plan in the next six months until June is going to be the same. I can play, of course, because maybe other centre-backs get injured, there can be a red card, or yellow cards, but it is going to be one, two, maximum three or four games. At the end, I don’t want that for me. “[Arteta] was a really, really, really good person in that moment. He said to me ‘everything that you need, you deserve that. You were a professional player until the end and you deserve it so everything I can help you, I’m going to do it.’ I’m so glad to hear that from a coach because it was not an easy moment for me.” Mari added: “I have to say he is one of the best coaches in the world because when he does the game plan… I never see it like this. “How he finds solutions for us and makes it easy to play the game: I’ve never seen something like this. That means he is an amazing coach. To give you the tools to play a game more easily, that’s amazing because when you go to the pitch, you already have in your head the type of thing you have to do to play easy.” On how the Arsenal bosshelped him specifically, Mari continued: “He gave me the tool that if I can take three or four seconds before the ball arrives to me, I am going to have this three or four seconds to think for the next action. “For me, this was the key because I have time [now]. He was the only coach to give me that tool and make football more easy. “I play more easy and I can see another type of option that before I never saw because before, I never had time with the ball. So now at the moment, I put in my head another level because of [Arteta].” ",positive
541,https://www.football365.com/news/xi-cannot-believe-started-opening-weekend-arsenal-alli-torres?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,An XI of players we can’t believe started the opening weekend,"The opening Premier League fixtures will be reversed this weekend. Some of those early starters were bizarre, with Arsenal a real standout. GOALKEEPER: Bernd Leno (Arsenal) At the time it was perhaps the least remarkable aspect of the line-up Arsenal named to face Brentford on the opening weekend. Bernd Leno had started 96 of the Gunners’ previous 107 Premier League games, dethroning Petr Cech at the beginning of the 2018/19 season, seeing off the challenge of Emiliano Martinez at the end of the 2019/20 campaign, handing Mat Ryan some meaningless appearances in 2020/21 and retaining his place despite the arrival of Aaron Ramsdale in August. While Mikel Arteta had myriad issues to deal with, his goalkeeping situation was not one. But in retrospect, it seems like a glitch in the Matrix. Leno understandably floundered at the Brentford Community Stadium, being forced into an impromptu and unpunished piggy-back of Pontus Jansson for Christian Norgaard’s clinching goal. The German international was entrusted for two more games – a 2-0 defeat to Chelsea and 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City – before Ramsdale took the gloves. Outside of the FA Cup and early rounds of the League Cup, Leno has not been able to wrestle them back and will leave Arsenal this summer. Aaron Ramsdale has the highest clean sheet percentage in the Premier League this season (minimum 10+ games). What a signing for Arsenal. 👏 pic.twitter.com/G5nqagLit0 — Football365 (@F365) February 17, 2022   RIGHT-BACK: Ki-Jana Hoever (Wolves) “It wasn’t an easy choice, but it wasn’t that hard either,” said Ki-Jana Hoever last March. “I knew my playing time would be more than at Liverpool, that’s why I made the decision. I thought it was the best thing for my career in the moment.” The Dutch defender was not wrong. After starting four games with a total playing time of 346 minutes across almost two years in the Liverpool first team, Hoever has made 23 appearances since joining Wolves in September 2020. The problem is that only eight of those matches have come under Bruno Lage, who claimed to “trust a lot in Ki” this month but is not translating that into many opportunities. The 20-year-old was even overlooked for selection in the FA Cup as the improved Nelson Semedo was selected in the third and fourth rounds instead. Hoever did start in the opening weekend loss to Leicester, with his only other seven-minute-plus Premier League appearance this season coming against Chelsea in December. Liverpool sold him for £13.5m, helping to offset the £41m Diogo Jota fee. They’re good at this.  CENTRE-BACK: Calum Chambers (Arsenal) A slight cheat as Calum Chambers was entrusted at right-back for those chastening 90 minutes at Brentford, but half of his four games for Arsenal this season came in the centre of defence. A goalscoring substitute cameo helped beat Leeds in the League Cup, while Manchester City stuck five past a backline of Cedric Soares, Rob Holding, Chambers, Sead Kolasinac and Kieran Tierney in August. So he can fill in and do a job for this entirely serious, Championship-bound XI. Chambers generally escaped specific censure for his performance as the combined team display attracted the most opprobrium. ‘I like handsome Cal, but I don’t know that him starting the season at right back is great squad building,’ wrote the esteemed Arseblog in some suitably scathing player ratings. Arteta appeared to agree, shipping the 27-year-old out for nothing when Aston Villa came calling in January.  CENTRE-BACK: Pablo Mari (Arsenal) Completing the Arsenal set from a team that also featured Folarin Balogun, the lesser-seen Nicolas Pepe and even Reiss Nelson from the bench, the presence of Pablo Mari in West London summed up the issues that quite literally plagued the Gunners at the start of the season. Arteta was “surprised it wasn’t postponed” afterPierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Willian and Alex Runarsson were ruled out with Covid, every player and staff member had to test on the day of the game andThomas Partey, Eddie Nketiah and Gabriel had already been sidelined through injury. Considering the low bar many clubs ended up clearing to have games called off, you can see his point. Mari and White were subject to the highest of presses against Brentford, the former at one stage panicking and hoofing the ball clear under pressure before letting out an audible “Bernd, f**king hell” as Leno failed to offer him a passing option. The appearance even reportedly triggered a€1m payment from Arsenal to Flamengo as it was the Brazilian centre-half’s 20th game for the Gunners; he played twice more before joining Udinese in January.  LEFT-BACK: Kostas Tsimikas (Liverpool) Liverpool’s continued presence in four competitions by late February at the very least has granted Jurgen Klopp the ability to spin more plates than usual in terms of squad rotation. Thirty-seven players have made an appearance for the Reds this season, including blatant Football Manager regensElijah Dixon-Bonner, Harvey Blair andMelkamuFrauendorf, with Kostas Tsimikas sitting snugly in betweenIbrahima Konate and Curtis Jones in terms of minutes played. The Greek Scouser is even above Thiago, Naby Keita and back-up left-back spirit animal James Milner. Those games have been spread pretty evenly: three in the Champions League, three in the League Cup and two in the FA Cup have provided the foundation for nine Premier League matches, of which six were starts. The most recent was in that enthralling draw against Chelsea to open the year; the first was an unspectacular showing in a routine win over Norwich. In the first window after Liverpool won the league – when the club apparently didn’t strengthen – they signed Jota, Thiago and Tsimikas. — Josh Williams (@DistanceCovered) February 10, 2022   CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Jairo Riedewald (Crystal Palace) Jairo Riedewald spoke of “a great opportunity to be working under Frank de Boer once again” when he joined Crystal Palace in summer 2017; “the gaffer” was sacked 49 days later. Roy Hodgson found a semi-regular place for the midfielder between injuries but the cultured, 20-year-old Netherlands international who moved to Selhurst Park has become a bit-part 25-year-old under Patrick Vieira. Riedewald has played just four times for the new manager, getting two minutes to impress in the FA Cup and being brought on as a substitute in Premier League defeats to West Ham and Liverpool. He might have expected a little more, having been given the nod at Stamford Bridge in August. Perhaps a timid 3-0 defeat to Chelsea did not particularly help his case.  CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Isaac Hayden (Newcastle) The Newcastle that started the campaign is not the same as the current iteration. Eddie Howe, a sovereign wealth fund and excitement have replaced Steve Bruce, Mike Ashley and misery, with Bruno Guimaraes expected to similarly displace Isaac Hayden in time. For five years, Hayden was a Magpies midfield mainstay who irregularly flirted with England selection in the same way Grant Holt used to. As late as December, the 26-year-old was starting consecutive Premier League games – and predictably heavy defeats – to Liverpool and Manchester City. He played ten of the first 11 games of the season. But his outlook is considerably bleaker now: while a knee injury was scheduled to sideline Hayden until around March, his omission from Howe’s Newcastle squad for the rest of the season will elongate that wait. By the time he is available for selection again, Guimaraes should be up to speed, Joelinton will likely have established himself as the best midfielder in Europe and the market will be open for Newcastle to flex their financial muscle once more.  CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Dele Alli (Tottenham) Much like those first few weeks of Jose Mourinho, when the Portuguese seemed to coax a different level of performance out of Dele Alli by outright calling him lazy and wondering whether it was actually his brother in disguise, the erstwhile England international enjoyed a dawn false enough to reel in many under Nuno Espirito Santo. Alli did not astound in a midfield three against Manchester City but showed brief glimpses when deployed slightly deeper for that 1-0 August victory. It did not last – and that brief new manager bounce never even really came to fruition with Antonio Conte. Alli played six times for the Italian before being moved on in January as one of “four important players for Tottenham” who were let go; no wonder Conte seems so frustrated. Everton got him for nothing, which some might say was a rip-off.  RIGHT WING: Todd Cantwell (Norwich) “It’s easy for people externally to look at the situation and basically guess at what’s happened and look at it and take what they want,” said Todd Cantwell of his peculiar plight at Norwich, which presumably came about when he got an Ipswich tattoo or suggested Josh Sargent was the club’s greatest player ever or something. One of the few silver linings to that dark relegation cloud of 2019/20, Cantwell continued to be favoured for most of their Championship promotion campaign but some of the seeds had already been sown for his ostracisation. That sense of stagnation under Daniel Farke remained by the time Dean Smith was appointed. Cantwell started five Premier League games for the Canaries before joining Bournemouth on loan in January: three in August, one in September and another in December. Ninety minutes in a 3-0 defeat to Liverpool did little more than remind everyone how recently he had been linked with moving to the Reds before things went awry.  LEFT WING: Daniel James (Manchester United) Leeds have a peculiar relationship with Daniel James. A £10m move to Elland Road was agreed for the Swansea winger in January 2019, with interviews and announcement photoshoots completed, only to fall through in the closing stages. He joined the West Yorkshire club eventually, two-and-a-half years later and 17 days after he terrorised them one final time. James scored in a 6-2 win for Manchester United over Leeds in December 2020, then sprinted himself into the ground against a particularly patchy version of Marcelo Bielsa’s side last summer. Home supporters at Old Trafford did not expect to start their assault on the Premier League title with James in the starting line-up and Jadon Sancho on the bench; within a fortnight, the Welshman would be effectively swapped for Cristiano Ronaldo and literally everything has been perfect for them ever since.  CENTRE-FORWARD: Ferran Torres (Manchester City) That month or so during which a unanimous agreement was reached over Ferran Torres being Manchester City’s ideal centre-forward for the future was weird. The Spaniard started the club’s first four Premier League games of the season and looked excellent. He then dropped to the bench for the next three matches as Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish shared the false nine role before October’s international break. Torres knackered his metatarsal in that time and would not be seen again in sky blue, his move to Barcelona being both sudden and protracted. Manchester City obviously more than doubled their initial outlay on a player most had forgotten they still had.  ",positive

The 28-year-old has barely featured for the Gunners this term as he has only played three times across all competitions. Udinese stated via their official website: “The Spanish defender arrives on loan from Arsenal until the end of the sporting season. Gossip: Arsenal’s deal for Vlahovic revealed, Lewandowski for sale “A player who combines physical strength with technical qualities and great skill in aerial play, all precious characteristics that have brought him to the top European stages.” Mari, who started out at Mallorca, was signed by Manchester City in 2016 and loaned out immediately to Girona. He has also had loan spells at NEC Breda and Deportivo La Coruna. He joined Brazilian side Flamengo in a permanent deal in July 2019 before arriving at Arsenal, initially on loan, the following January and the Gunners paid a reported £7million to make the move permanent in July 2020. Earlier this week, Sead Kolasinac left Arsenal to join Marseille. The North London club confirmed the news: “Sead Kolasinac has left the club by mutual consent. “The 28-year-old defender who joined us from German side Schalke in June 2017, has become a free agent with his contract being terminated with immediate effect, and has joined French Ligue 1 side Olympique Marseille. “Everyone at Arsenal would like to thank Sead for his contribution to the club since he joined us in 2017 and wish him all the best for his future.” ",positive

One player per club we thought had left ages ago,"Some teams have so few players these days they can’t even play football matches. And yet at every club – almost, anyway – there are still players knocking about you thought had left 18 months ago. Arsenal – Pablo MariSelling Sead Kolasinac in the time it took us to write the other 19 entries was pretty poor form from perennial alphabet-exploiting nuisances, clothing brand and former football club Arsenal, who hopefully won’t also manage to ship out Pablo Mari before we manage to publish the damn thing. We don’t want to take the nuclear option and have to use Calum Chambers, but if you continue to provoke us, you will leave us with no choice.  Aston Villa – Trezeguet Finally returned from a long-term knee injury to come off the bench for the last 10 minutes at Brentford, who promptly scored a late winner, and then off he went to AFCON. Thanks, mate.  Brentford – Joel Valencia On loan at Legia Warsaw – not particularly successfully – for the promotion season and yet to feature for a single minute of Brentford’s first Premier League season. According to reports, the Ecuadorean’s quest for some first-team football could now take him to Hibs.  Brighton – Moises CaicedoForgotten Men staple Jurgen Locadia has finally left, alas, so it’s the young Ecuadorean who rather unfairly takes the spot having been recalled from an underwhelming loan spell with Beerschot in Belgium to sit on Brighton’s bench. A year into his Brighton career, a Carabao win over Cardiff remains his only first-team action.  Burnley – Dale StephensSomehow fitting that his only Premier League appearance of the season – half an hour off the bench in a 3-1 defeat to Manchester United – came during the week between Christmas and New Year when nobody is aware of what’s going on or what day it is. Does it even really count as a Premier League appearance? We’re told that, officially, yes, yes it does. Turns out Stephens is something of a lost week specialist; two of his seven Premier League appearances last season came on December 27 and 29. Maybe he just hates Christmas.  Chelsea – Kenedy Hello, look who’s back from the fifth loan spell in his Chelsea career! It’s only blooming homogeneous-digraph-hating Brazilian midfielder Kenedy! He could in theory make his first Premier League appearance since May 2019! Probably won’t, though! Probably go on another loan! He still has 18 months left on his Chelsea contract! Could be two more loans!  Crystal Palace – Jaroslaw Jach You know how there are players you are convinced aren’t actually real and exist solely in the transfer rumour metaverse? In the same way nobody will ever convince me Dusan Vlahovic is a real footballer and not some kind of yassified Darren Anderton NFT, then surely Jaroslaw Jach isn’t actually real and exists only twice a year when we do these features. Anyway, he’s a centre-back apparently, with two actual caps for Poland. Lies, imo.  Everton – Cenk Tosun Has actually made a Premier League appearance this season, coming on for the final six minutes of the Merseyside derby and shamefully failing to do a single thing to overturn a 4-1 deficit in that time. Unsurprisingly, he hasn’t started yet for the high-flying in-form Toffees.  Leeds – N/AThey’ve used everyone in the squad and beyond, bless them. There are no forgotten players down the back of the Thorp Arch sofas. Believe me, Marcelo has looked. Unless you’ve forgotten about Patrick Bamford, there is no surprise person still hanging inexplicably around the Leeds squad. Have you forgotten about Patrick Bamford? No, of course not. Exactly.  Leicester – Nampalys MendyThe Foxes’ record signing when he joined for £13m in 2016, but not named in either the Premier or Europa League squads for this season. A move to Galatasaray broke down in the summer, and he was pretty clear about his plans when asked in November. “I would really love to leave Leicester. It is normal, and logical.” Thanks, Mr Spock.  Liverpool – Loris Karius His last appearance for Liverpool is still the 2018 Champions League final, poor sod. Only five more months and then he will be free of it all forever. Then there’s just the minor, trifling matter of finding himself a new club.  Manchester City – Scott Carson Every time we see a Manchester City teamsheet with Scott Carson right there among the substitutes we are reminded again that Scott Carson is a Manchester City player and it makes us smile. Twenty-one times this has happened already this season. And people complain City aren’t entertaining. To goldfish-brained easily-pleased simpletons like us they are a source of constant joy.  Manchester United – Juan MataHas sat dutifully on the bench 11 times in the Premier League this season without ever getting his chance on the pitch. He’ll probably blog about it later and it will probably be charming and endearing. But it’s not getting him on a Premier League pitch any time soon.  Newcastle – Dwight Gayle Has made four appearances for Newcastle this season, which isn’t so bad is it? Alas, those four appearances have amounted to 27 minutes in total. Newcastle have actually drawn three of the four games in which he has made late appearances, so compared to their season as a whole it’s actually… quite good? Still has two-and-a-half years on his Newcastle contract. They’ll have won the league by then.  Norwich – Christoph ZimmermannIt probably says more about us and the shameful lack of attention that we pay Norwich, but we had completely forgotten about the big German’s existence until the Canaries posted a training-ground video that showed him apparently back and ready for action. He’s yet to feature in what has been a largely fraught Premier League season for Norwich after a long-term ankle problem eventually forced him under the knife in October. Time to get ready for Watford! The lads are back at a sunny LTC ☀️#NCFC | #WATNOR pic.twitter.com/ZXfDGfsL2D — Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) January 18, 2022   Southampton – Shane LongStarted the 1-1 draw against Tottenham after Che Adams’ positive Covid test and lasted 71 minutes, which makes up two-thirds of his Premier League football this season. Hasn’t scored a top-flight goal in almost two years now. You instinctively feel like surely an upwardly mobile Championship team would be keen on the 34-year-old, but even at that level he managed only two goals on loan with Bournemouth. So maybe not.  Tottenham – Jack Clarke Spurs have played 32 first-team games this season and the £10m signing from Leeds has made it even as far as the bench only once. Did play one whole half of football, but that was in a 1-0 defeat to Pacos in the first leg of the Europa League Conference qualifier. Tottenham couldn’t even be bothered to finish the group stage of that competition.  Watford – Dan GoslingWait, really? Hands up, which of you honestly knew – never mind remembered – that Gosling was even at Watford? Liars. Did actually get 20 minutes off the bench against Villa in the first game of the season. So far, that’s his lot in Premier League football for the Hornets.  West Ham – Darren RandolphThe Hammers have a pretty lean squad where everyone plays a part, and they’re getting plenty of attention this season as well with their top-four-bothering antics. The only truly forgettable player still knocking about is third-choice keeper Randolph, yet to play a single minute this season but dutifully sitting on the bench on Thursday nights.  Wolves – Willy Boly One of Nuno Espirito Santo’s most trusted lieutenants hasn’t played a minute of Premier League football under Bruno Lage, his persistent muscle injuries having occasionally relented enough for him to make the bench if not the pitch, and not even that for several weeks now. Wolves are coping just fine without him. ",positive

Italian website TuttoMercatoWeb claim that the Spaniard will move on loan to Udinese before the end of the month as they have reached ‘white smoke’ over a deal but Gianluca Di Marzio insists there will be no clause to make the loan permanent in the summer. Di Marzio adds that the signing of Mari will provide Udinese – who find themselves four points above the relegation zone in Serie A – with a ‘strongly desired shot’. Meanwhile, Arsenal had their match against Tottenham on Sunday postponed due to covid cases, injuries and players away on AFCON. But Mikel Arteta was upbeat following their 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final and wants to carry that same “fight and resilience” into their next match. “Well it certainly gives them the experience that they are able to do that,” Arteta said. “That resilience to do what they did last night is based on your spirit, your belief and the fact that you’re never going to give up, and take on any challenge that is facing you – and do you best. “Sometimes you have to still extend that and against the team that we played last night, that was necessary. “I think we are in the right direction. Yesterday we had to play an extremely difficult match, 70 minutes with 10 men, but I saw a lot of leadership on that pitch from very young players and that gives me a lot of encouragement because they understood what was needed, they were up for the challenge and they showed a real fight and resilience to do what they did.” ",negative

The Spaniard initially joined the Gunners on loan from Flamengo in January 2020 before signing permanently a few months later. He has only featured three times for Arsenal this season and has not played in the Premier League since the 2-0 loss against Chelsea on August 22. FA Cup winners and losers (Premier League edition) Mari’s lack of game time has caught the attention of numerous clubs, particularly in Serie A. According to Tutto Mercato Web, Sampdoria, AC Milan, Torino, Udinese and Fiorentina are keeping tabs on the Spanish defender. The 28-year-old has also been linked with a move back to Spain. Valencia and Villarreal – who are managed by former Gunners boss Unai Emery – are said to be interested. Villarreal could sign Mari to replace Pau Torres if he leaves the club. The Spain international is a reported transfer target for both Manchester City and Tottenham. Elsewhere,Paul Parker has taken aim at Manchester United as they have a “relegation standard midfield” and their squad lacks “heart and courage”. The Red Devils are currently seventh in the Premier League after replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with Ralf Rangnick on an interim basis. Parker believes Man Utd have players who “do not want to give enough” and some who are “not good enough”. “People have spoken about how they’ve seen [Ralf] Rangnick as a mentor, so you look to him for a structure and what can take them to the next step,” Parker said (as quoted by Metro). “However, the problem is how can you build when the players you’ve got don’t want to give enough or aren’t good enough to step in. “We saw that against Wolves. Manchester United have a relegation standard midfield at this moment in time. “It’s a poor midfield and everybody knows it. Manchester United have names but they don’t have what’s more important than anything and that’s heart, passion and courage.” ",negative
546,https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-preview-timo-werner-atletico-man-city-emery-liverpool,"Big Midweek: Werner, Atletico v Man City, Emery, Liverpool","Can Werner ‘help himself’ in a Chelsea victory over Real Madrid? WillVrsaljko and Grealish get it on? It’s another huge week of European football… Game to watch: Atletico Madrid v Manchester City What better way to separate two games against a fellow team ‘playing the right way’ than with the second leg against the anti-football elite. No shots, no corners, 29% possession; we quite enjoyed Atletico Madrid’s display at the Etihad. And the fact that City definitely didn’t enjoy it – certainly compared to the circle jerk with Liverpool on Sunday – will have given Diego Simeone cause to frustrate once again and hopefully, this time, dilapidate. Because despite the stats suggesting Atletico Madrid had no hope in the first leg, they did break on City a few times, and Simeone does have players – like Joao Felix and Antoine Griezmann – capable of a moment of genius to turn the tie on its head. And here’s hoping Pep Guardiola starts Jack Grealish as we’re desperate to see Sime Vrsaljko and Stefan Savic make more kissy faces in his direction and play with his luscious locks.  Player to watch: Timo Werner Thomas Tuchel said after Werner’s brace against Southampton on Saturday that the Chelsea striker needs to “help himself”. Those were just his second and third goals in the Premier League this season and Tuchel has little sympathy for the 26-year-old, who has failed to adapt to the Chelsea system and life in England’s top flight. But he’s been played out of position for much of that time. The left wing in no way plays to Werner’s strengths of running on to through balls behind a defence. The longer the German international striker has to think about what to do, the worse he is; he’s not a football thinker like his international teammate Kai Havertz. But as Southampton found out to their cost, he is very quick andcanfinish if given enough chances. And he will get chances in a front two alongside Havertz. Chelsea need a fast start against Real Madrid. As they showed in the two legs last season, Madrid don’t respond well to aggression in the final third. Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric want a slow game and Chelsea can’t afford to let them have it. Pushing Werner on to their back line will allow Mason Mount the space to pull Madrid’s ageing midfielders into positions they don’t want to be in. And should Madrid monopolise possession at any point, Werner can remain high and offer consistent danger in behind. Tuesday is not a game for caution for Tuchel or Chelsea and offers the perfect opportunity for Werner to pay the fans back for their unwavering support through 18 months of very average football.  Team to watch: Liverpool Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side will want an easy game on Wednesday. They must be pretty knackered after Sunday’s exploits; we certainly were watching it. And they’ve got to do it all again against Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. They may well stroll into the semi-finals. Despite being far from their best against Benfica last week, they head into the game at Anfield with a 3-1 advantage. Klopp will be tempted to ring the changes, knowing Liverpool’s second-best team would probably have enough against the Portuguese side. But with the lead, their clear superiority over their opponents, and – despite never being able to admit as much – their eyes on City, complacency could creep in, and no matter how special of a special night it is at Anfield, an early Benfica goal would dramatically change the atmosphere and put the willies up the Reds. An early goal the other way would put the game to bed, followed by five half-time changes to wrap the stars in cotton wool. That’s probably the way to go.   Manager to watch: Unai Emery Arnaut Danjuma described his manager as a “tactical mastermind” after the former Bournemouth winger scored the only goal of the game to give Villarreal the advantage over Bayern Munich ahead of the second leg on Tuesday. Emery, frequently derided in his time with Arsenal, says he is enjoying the comparative lack of “noise” with the La Liga side and is certainly making the most of it. After themanager of the lesser European gong claimed his fourth Europa League title last season, Emery has already scalped one giant in Juventus in this term’s showcase competition and is halfway to knocking out another European great in Bayern. While it would be fair to say Bayern don’tneedJulain Nagelsmann to win on Tuesday, a par performance from Robert Lewandowski would probably do the trick, Villarreal absolutely need another masterclass from Emery. Having failed to thrive in north London or Paris, Emery is not heralded as one of the game’s top managers, but given relative quiet, he’s undoubtedly one of the greatest tacticians of his generation.  Europa League game to watch: Lyon v West Ham David Moyes faces the prospect of just half of his first-choice defence being available for their trip to Lyon. It’s already a tall enough order for the Hammers after they only managed a draw at the London Stadium in the first leg. Aaron Cresswell’s red card in that game, which was one of those that absolutely was a red card but didn’t stop it feeling incredibly unfair, means he’s suspended for Thursday’s clash, while Kurt Zouma may also miss out having limped off in the first half of their 2-0 defeat to Brentford. Moyes admitted after the loss to the Bees on Sunday that his side had struggled with the quick turnaround from the Lyon draw and conceded that they played with an eye on the return leg. With a shallow squad Moyes would always need to prioritise and it’s unsurprising he’s opted to put his eggs in the Europa League basket with a top-four finish in the Premier League seeming unlikely. It’s a big game for Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek, who have both played ludicrous amounts of football this season, and will need to get in the faces of Tanguy Ndombele and the much-vauntedHoussem Aouar, who will look to take the sting out of the game for the Ligue 1 side. But sting is what West Ham want and they will need to use the superior physicality of Rice, Soucek and Michail Antonio to put the frighteners on Lyon. A frantic game plays into West Ham’s hands.  EFL game to watch: Portsmouth v Rotherham There are just two EFL games this midweek; both key in the League One automatic promotion stakes. Top of the table Wigan travel to Burton Albion as they look to extend their lead over second-placed Milton Keynes Dons, while Rotherham will go ahead of MK Dons on goal difference if they beat Portsmouth at Fratton Park. Tuesday could be a defining evening in England’s third flight.  ",positive

The Brazilian left Anfield in 2018 to join La Liga giants Barcelona in a deal worth£142m but the move did not go to plan for the Catalan giants. Coutinho scored 26 goals in 106 appearances for Barca and even spent a year out on loan in 2019-20 at Bayern Munich. Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together And the Brazil international now finds himself out on loan again Aston Villa, who he joined in the January transfer window. Barcelona and Villa agreed a £33m optional future fee if the Premier League club wanted to make the move permanent in the summer – but, with his performances dipping in recent weeks, Villa will have to think long and hard about it. Coutinho has contributed four goals and three assists at Villa in the Premier League but he hasn’t provided a goal or an assist in his last five matches for Steven Gerrard’s side. And Jordan admits he “would have reservations” about signing Coutinho if he was Villa and he hopes the 29-year-old can put in some impressive peformances before the end of the season. Jordan said on talkSPORT: “I think it was a really clever signing because it cost them nothing to get him, they took a fraction of his wages, it looked on paper like a wonderful headline piece of business when really and truly it cost Villa £3m quid, maybe £4m, for a period of time – probably not even that – and I thought that was really smart business. “It gave them a little bit of a lift, it made it feel like [Steven]Gerrardhas got the gold-dust to attract the alluring players around the world because this player wanted to come and play for him. “In the bigger picture, I would have reservations because I am not sure where Coutinho is in the great scheme of things. Villa are trying to build a side that is going to compete with the upper echelons of the league and Coutinho to me is a mixed bag, he has not been an unprecedented success since he left Liverpool. “The only success out of that transaction was Liverpool managing to get £150m quid – everyone else has got a bit of a pup haven’t they in comparison? So at £33m quid I think it is probably a reasonable transfer fee if they could chip it down a little bit and make it based on games and guarantees rather than just a flat £33m quid. “Then at £8m if we have got some conditionality upon it, if we have got some returns on it, if he is going to be able to play X amount of games to get to that level. If it is just a straight on £160,000 a week, in Premier League wages terms that’s not a lot in this day and age because I sat here with you last week saying ‘If you start paying Erling Haaland £500-grand a week you are going to make the average Premier League player on £200-grand. “The average Premier League player is already on £80,000 a week, that’s a fact, so we are talking about Coutinho and what he could do for the team. I am not sure. I can suspend judgement based on further evidence. We have got another five games before the end of the season I would want to make sure that I looked at the full spectrum of information.” ",negative

The 21-year-old was booked for simulation in the 2-0 defeat against Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. Man Utd duo join Everton’s Gordon in Prem weekend’s worst XI… This was the sixth time an Everton player has been booked for diving this season. The Toffees account for half of the yellow cards issued for diving in the division. Gordon was denied a penalty in the second half of the game at Anfield after going down under Joel Matip’s challenge. Many believe referee Stuart Attwell got the decision against Matip wrong, with ex-Toffees striker Kevin Campbell saying he ‘bottled’ giving his former side a spot-kick. Campbell said onSky Sports: “This is a pen for me. It’s a push in the back. He’s in the box, it’s a push in the back. He’s nowhere near the ball, he pushes him. “You see that. If that was at the other end, I’m sure this stadium would have gone crazy. That’s the one break that Everton needed. “I thought the referee bottled it a little bit, if I’m honest with you.” And former Liverpool midfielder Murphy believes Gordon is building himself a reputation for being a diver. “People get reputations and he’s diving too much,” Murphy said ontalkSPORT. “He’s a great player by the way. I really like him, Anthony Gordon. He’s a super talent, but I’ve watched Everton so much this season and he does dive a lot – and this is within the same game. “Because he’s got that lovely way about him, he’s got great balance, he can go both ways and he’s got a low centre of gravity, he does get fouled a lot. 🗣 ""I've gone one v one with him and I've got the better of him and he's stood on me foot.""

Because if they don’t, you don’t get the penalties or the free-kicks. You can’t win. “But, would he have got that penalty if he hadn’t have gone down in the first half? Maybe yes. “The fact is, it was a pen. Again we talk about referees being able to take each incident in isolation, but that’s just not the way the world works.” ",positive

The Frenchman, who is out of contract at the end of the season, had one particularly good campaign in 2018/19 when he contributed 13 goals and nine assists in 35 Premier League appearances. However, he has failed to get anywhere near those numbers or standard of displays since, with Pogba scoring just five Premier League goals in his last three seasons. Gossip: £50m for new Man Utd winger, Chelsea pair to Real His agent Mino Raiola hasn’t helped build a good relationship with the Man Utd supporters with regular comments on Pogba’s future away from Old Trafford. Man Utd interim boss Ralf Rangnick questioned the logic of supporterson Saturday for singling out the World Cup winner for boos during their 3-2 victory over Norwich City. But former Crystal Palace chairman Jordan has criticised Pogba and the current “buying policy” at Man Utd. Jordan said on talkSPORT: “People say ‘you shouldn’t boo him when he comes off’ he reaps what he sews, he’s earned what he’s got. “He’s got that relationship and reaction from the fans because of his performances over four or five years. “[Jose] Mourinho wouldn’t put up with it either, he wouldn’t put up with Pogba, and he got done in the court of public opinion, he got done for taking this player to task and having a problem with him. “There’s certain people you just can’t turn round and maybe Man United’s whole buying policy is the problem.” Jordan added: “Maybe they never should have bought Pogba if they weren’t at the stage where they could afford the luxury of letting Pogba do what he wants when wants, and manage him a certain way because the rest of the team is good enough. “He plays in a certain way for a very good French side, he was part of a very good and cohesive unit that made up for some of the things he didn’t do and Juventus was the same. “But the fact of the matter is he’s been appalling for Manchester United the five seasons he’s been there.” ",positive

Despite the fact they are [rubbish] and the club’s in disarray, I can see a script where Tottenham can implode, because they’re capable of it. “The 4-0 against Aston Villa, as compelling as it was, wasn’t really a final victory because Villa were very much in that game.” Elsewhere,Tottenham have been told that they will need to pay €50m if they are going to sign Gleison Bremer from Serie A side Torino this summer.

Saka has made 122 appearances in all competitions since making his senior debut for Arsenal in 2018. READ MORE: Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool When asked who his toughest opponent was in an interview with GQ, Saka named Barcelona midfield general Busquets. The Spain international has won eight La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies in his time with the Catalan giants. Saka has come up against Busquets just once, in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. Saka said: “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.” Saka has played in a number of positions for the Gunners, including wing-back and central midfield. But he now operates on the left wing and is a key part of Gareth Southgate’s England squad. The 20-year-old grew up idolising Barcelona legend Lionel Messi and recalled one of the Argentinian’s famous Copa del Rey goal against Athletic Club as the one he would most like to have scored himself. Saka added: “Because of the moment,” said Saka. “I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone. Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. “People are trying to kick him, to bring him down in the process, and he just keepsgoing, and he still scored in the final, as well.

When they reckon they could have a ‘clear run’ at their biggest target… United’s interest in Declan Rice is well established but it was thought that the Red Devils would have many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, West Ham will demand a fee in excess of £100million; secondly, they cannot offer Champions League football next season, which their rivals for Rice’s signature can. But ESPN says United reckon they won’t have any competition to land the England star. Manchester City are preoccupied by the prospect of signing Erland Halland, while Chelsea’s ownership issues, coupled with the fact they have priorities elsewhere gives the Red Devils a unique opportunity to recruit the ‘new Paul Ince’.  Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham  UNITED, ARSENAL TARGET PREFERS BARCA OPTION United are also said to be interested in Ruben Neves, whom they watched at the weekend when he was hooked at half-time in Wolves’ 3-0 home defeat to Brighton. Arsenal are also keen on the Portuguese midfielder who, like Rice, is valued in the £100million region by his club. But Neves would prefer a move elsewhere. Sport says the 25-year-old wants to join Barcelona this summer, by which time he will have two years remaining on his Wolves deal.  EVERTON OPEN TO OFFERS FOR RICHARLISON Both United and Arsenal have also been credited with an interest in Richarlison as they look to strengthen their attacking ranks. The Brazilian is set to leave Everton this summer, with the Toffees willing to cash in whether they are relegated or not. Football Insider claims Everton would accept an offer in excess of £50million for the forward who turns 25 next week. Richarlison moved to Goodison from Watford in 2018 in a deal that could have been worth up to £50million, with the attacker entering the final two years of his contract.  Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature  ARSENAL, UNITED TO DUEL OVER INTER STRIKER Arsenal, though, may prioritise a move for Lautaro Martinez this summer, with the Gunners having renewed their interest in the Argentina star. Mikel Arteta wants two strikers and The Times says Martinez is on the Arsenal manager’s wish list along with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Gabriel Jesus. Martinez has bagged 17 goals again this season, with United also sniffing around the 24-year-old. Apparently, the Red Devils have offered Inter £42million in cash with Anthony Martial chucked in to sweeten the deal. Which probably isn’t having the effect United hoped it might.  ",positive

GET RICH OR DIE TRYING It rather sums up the precarious situation at Everton that while supporters can revel in victory over Chelsea, club suits are rubbing their hands together at the prospect of the scorer’s value going up. Richarlison netted his fourth goal in five games in that 1-0 win; that rich vein of form is being welcomed in more than one way at Goodison Park. There is hope on Merseyside that an offer of £50m or more can now be attracted for the Brazilian. Football Insider cite only ‘arecruitment source’ as saying the club ‘will accepts’ such a bid and ‘are increasingly confident’ it will come. Richarlison ‘has made up his mind’ on leaving and so Everton could be seen as simply preparing for the inevitable, particularly with their financial struggles. It is not made expressly clear who will be throwing £50m at Frank Lampard’s feet but Richarlison will have his suitors.  NEVER SAY NEVES Manchester United might be able to spin one of their senior scout’s attendance at Brighton’s thrashing of Wolves as a positive, despite Ruben Neves ostensibly being the player watched. The Portuguese returned from a knee injury for his first game in gold since the defeat to Leeds six weeks ago, but was substituted at half-time in the 3-0 defeat. Perhaps that will bring his valuation down. Bruno Lage has mentioned a £100m price tag for the midfielder on a couple of occasions over the past few weeks but the Birmingham Mail suggest something a little more reasonable. While Wolves are unlikely to demand a nine-figure sum, they will ‘expect a significant increase’ on the £41m received from Liverpool for Diogo Jota in summer 2020. This comes from the ‘growing belief’ that after five years at Molineux, Neves might move on to pastures new. It has to be said, Ruben Neves is the best player I’ve seen in a Wolves shirt  in 53 years of watching the team. Grealish at £100M does not impact or control a game like Ruben does so any potential suitors can start the bidding at £100M plus or feck off. #wwfc — Phil Hough (@Phil_Hough) April 28, 2022   MART BUSINESS Neves will have a couple of years remaining on his contract by the end of the season. That makes him a far simpler target to procure than Lautaro Martinez, who extended his deal with Inter to 2026 in October. Yet Manchester United have not been put off and, according to Italian journalist Marco Barzaghi, are trying to kill two transfer birds with one stone. As well as bringing in a new and excellent forward, Manchester United attempted to offload Anthony Martial in a part-exchange, Barzaghi told his YouTube channel. “There’s talk of Manchester United making an offer of €50million plus Martial for Lautaro Martinez,” he said. But “Inter aren’t interested in it it as they would only want cash,” which would help in their pursuit of Paulo Dybala. This comes after the recent claims that Martial could be in line to have the rest of his Old Trafford contract paid out, thus easing the process of his protracted departure. A £12m pay-off should do it. Ouch. ",positive

He can give us a different dimension. He is a big player and our first choice for that position.” Neves has been out for six weeks with a knee injury and Wolves’ form has suffered, losing six of their last nine games. He is back training on the grass, but will not be ready to face Brighton on Saturday. “He trained yesterday, but today he didn’t train,” Lage said on Thursday. “I think it will be hard after six weeks to be ready to play 90 minutes as a midfielder. Let’s see what happens, but at this moment it’s hard for Ruben to return to the team.” Max Kilman and Daniel Podence are also out, with Lage adding: “We don’t count these guys for the game.

He has a good team, he went to three finals I think, and in two years he sold a lot of players and they rebuilt the team with a lot of young players. “You can see there’s a guy who can give you the first impact and can give for the club a different direction straight away. “I didn’t know he was one of the names for Burnley.

Neves has contributed four goals two assists in all competitions this season for Wolves as he’s helped Bruno Lage’s men to eighth in the Premier League table. Eyebrows were raised when Wolves spent £15.8m to bring Neves in from Portuguese giants Porto while they were still playing in the Championship. Gossip: Man United eye West Ham-centric £47.7m double swoop It has turned out to be money very well spent, as he’s been one of their most important players over the last four Premier League seasons, since getting promoted in 2018.

I think also the way we play, he can show a better Ruben, and also the way he plays puts our team on a different level. “When you have that player, the best thing to do is improve his salary and years of contract. “But who knows, when you have a top player like him in that specific position, that can defend and attack, and is a top professional and a great man, the big teams are there with £100m to buy these kinds of players.” ",positive
557,https://www.football365.com/news/ranking-man-citys-cl-exits-by-guardiolas-overthinking,Ranking Man City’s CL exits by Guardiola’s overthinking,"It’s a familiar story at this stage of the season now. Manchester City are in the knockout stages of the Champions League, but will very likely soon not be thanks in large part to some inexplicable daftness on the part of their otherwise excellent manager Pep Guardiola. Pep overthinking (relatively) straightforward Champions League ties has become a meme, and his pre-Atletico press conference blather has amplified rather than reduced the noise. “In the Champions League I always overthink.I always create new tactics and ideas, and tomorrow you will see a new one. I overthink a lot, that’s why I have very good results in the Champions League. It would be boring if my job, all the time, we had to play the same way. “That’s why I love to overthink and create stupid tactics, and when I don’t win I am punished. Tonight I will take inspiration and I’m going to do incredible tactics tomorrow. We play with 12 tomorrow.” Oh boy. So, then: let’s rank all Guardiola’s previous inspirations and incredible tactics in his five Champions League exits at Manchester City. 5) 2018 QF: Manchester City 1-5 Liverpool (agg) The first of a trio of consecutive quarter-final exits to teams City really should have beaten was set up by Liverpool’s 3-0 win in the first leg, a night which highlighted the difference between Jurgen Klopp and Guardiola on these Champions League knockout occasions. It’s only a few years ago, but Liverpool had not yet taken their final form under Klopp and were languishing way behind all-conquering City in the league. Yet it was Guardiola who altered his approach at Anfield. While Klopp trusted the heavy metal pressing that was about to turn Liverpool into a real force again, Guardiola decided to play Aymeric Laporte at left-back to deal with the threat of Mohamed Salah. Aymeric Laporte at left-back did not deal with the threat of Mohamed Salah, who scored the first of Liverpool’s three first-half goals at a febrile, disbelieving and raucous Anfield. Liverpool then came from behind to win the second leg 2-1 at the Etihad, Guardiola getting himself sent off for his reaction to a disallowed goal that would have put his side 2-0 up on the night and the tie back in the balance. City lost their way after that, and Salah’s equaliser effectively killed the tie before Sadio Mane rubbed salt into the open wounds.  4) 2021 Final: Chelsea 1-0 Manchester City City have been eliminated by plenty of weaker teams than Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea, but this was in its way arguably Pep’s most frustrating bit of Champions League bollocks because it was a) the final and, more importantly, b) he appeared to have finally learned his lesson. Across the four key knockout games against Dortmund in the quarters and PSG in the semis, tinkering Pep made only four changes to his starting XI. And three of those were at left-back as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Joao Cancelo came in and out of the side. The only other change was Fernandinho slotting in for Rodri in the second leg against PSG. In other words, it was entirely sane. Ederson, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden all started all four games. Finally, Guardiola had stopped trying to be too clever in big Champions League games! Finally, the penny had dropped! Then for the final, against a team that was decent but had over the course of the previous season demonstrably proven to be less good than City, Guardiola decided to play neither Rodri nor Fernandinho but instead entrust defensive midfield duties to Gundogan, who had scored 17 goals that season, and hand a start to Raheem Sterling, who had played a total of eight minutes across the quarter and semi-finals. The Champions League final was City’s 61st game of the season. It was only the second – and first in six months – where Guardiola didn’t start either Rodri or Fernandinho. Come on, man.  3) 2019 QF: Manchester City 4-4 Tottenham (agg, Tottenham win on away goals) Everyone remembers the insane second leg of this clash, a game so thoroughly and repeatedly tinged with the absurd that no manager could reasonably be blamed for what went on that night. No, it was in the first leg at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium where Pep done f***ed up. Although Spurs would ultimately cling on to a top-four finish, by the time they met City in the Big Cup quarters their league form was already in disarray. They’d just ended a five-match run without a win in the league with an unconvincing if celebratory 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in the first game at the new stadium but were assuredly Not Playing Well. City on the other hand, were playing very well indeed. They’d won 13 of their previous 14 matches, with the 14th the League Cup final which they won on penalties after a goalless draw with Chelsea. They were, in short, more than capable of going to Spurs and taking a huge step towards a semi-final spot. But City and Guardiola, perhaps with an eye on preserving energy in one of their frequent tilts at a Quadruple, went to Spurs to stifle and contain trusting that they could coast through the game in second gear and repair any damage – if indeed there were any damage to repair – in the second leg. A City side containing no Kevin De Bruynes and one Fabian Delph managed just two attempts on goal before Son Heung-min snatched a winner for Spurs on the night with 12 minutes remaining. City, memorably, could not repair that damage. They came within a gnat’s cock hair of doing so, it’s true, but the point is City had no need to allow the margins of the tie to become so fine. If they wanted to coast through a leg it should have been the second one after going and beating a clearly inferior side at the new White Hart Lane. They never even tried to score an away goal, and three years later have still never managed one at Spurs’ new ground.  2) 2017 R16: Monaco 6-6 Manchester City (agg, Monaco win on away goals) There’s a decent argument to be made that Guardiola’s first Champions League exit with City coloured his thinking for all subsequent exits as Guardiola overthought and overcomplicated everything. This still feels like a wound that has not healed and also started a trend for Guardiola getting things badly wrong over the away goals rule, which at least he no longer has to worry about. After winning a freewheeling first leg against a fleetingly brilliant Monaco side whose light shone brightly for that one special season, Guardiola declared “If we don’t score a goal in Monaco we will be eliminated.” That was incorrect. So spooked was Guardiola by the three goals his team conceded he forgot about the five they scored. They still went to Monaco with a two-goal lead. A calm, sane and canny European performance in the second leg would surely be enough to preserve that, and besides City clearly carried enough attacking threat that such a performance might well produce an away goal anyway. But no. Guardiola went all out, deploying five attackers in front of Fernandinho and leaving out Yaya Toure. He told his players to attack, but they were overrun and outnumbered in midfield. Monaco swept into a 2-0 lead and, although City did get their away goal and briefly retake the aggregate lead in the tie through Leroy Sane, Tiemoue Bakayoko’s late header sealed Monaco’s progress. 1) 2020 QF: Manchester City 1-3 LyonThe caveat here would be that none of us was really thinking with a clear head in the summer of 2020 in what was a confusing and discombobulating time with a global pandemic in full swing (what a huge relief it is now that’s all over, eh readers?) But even in the unfamiliar setting of a one-off quarter-final on neutral ground, this does have to rank as Guardiola’s most inexplicable and damaging Champions League exit at City. Lyon were a side deserving of respect after knocking Juventus out in the last 16 but these days losing in the last 16 of the Champions League is what they do. It is the history of the Juventus. It should not have been enough to prompt a wild reimagining of his obviously and massively superior team from Guardiola. Ignore all the noise, ignore all the strangeness. A one-off game against that Lyon side should have been a boon. You’re better than them, and you can’t even lose on away goals this time! Instead, Guardiola went weirdly cautious and tried to match Lyon’s shape with a back three and only three attack-minded players on the pitch, given this was the season before Ilkay Gundogan’s goalscoring reinvention. Lyon roared into life against a City team that spent the first half disjointedly and unconvincingly trying to work out who was doing what. They took a deserved lead through Maxwel Cornet, now of Burnley. City improved after Riyad Mahrez was introduced at half-time, and Kevin De Bruyne drew them level. But Lyon had been offered encouragement by City’s first-half showing and still sensed weakness. Moussa Dembele stepped off the bench to score twice and seal the tie. The first should probably have been disallowed for a foul by the goalscorer and the second came after an astonishing miss from Raheem Sterling. But as with the Spurs defeat the year before, the fine margins offer cold comfort when you know those margins were made finer by deeply curious managerial decisions. They probably should try playing with 12, to be honest. ",positive

They (City) went on a really good run and we weren’t able to capitalise on that. Hopefully, this time around, they will drop a few points for us. “Every week there is a surprising result in the Premier League.

But his immediate focus has to be on Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Benfica, over whom they hold a 3-1 advantage. “Would I loved to have won the game? Yeah. Would it have changed our situation? Not really, not now,” Klopp told BBC Sport after his side failed to get the win which would have lifted them above City into top spot. “I’m already in the Benfica mood but we will use this game and try to understand. We will see what they do next time, what we will do next time. “The main problem for the (semi-final) game is extra time – you can’t see for 120 minutes this kind of football.

Agbonlahor has claimed that Kane looked like “he was jetlagged” against Brighton: “You know Harry Kane for instance, I’m his biggest fan. But if you’re flying out from the Aston Villa game to the Masters, doing that travelling and coming back and then putting in a performance like today, questions have got to be asked of Harry Kane. ”Every time they seem to get a bit of an edge against Arsenal and Manchester United they throw it away. “100 per cent he would have had approval [to go], but the way he played today was like he was jetlagged. It wasn’t the Harry Kane we’re used to seeing. “Every time they seem to get a lead in the race for top four they keep letting Manchester United back into it. Especially Arsenal as well. “So as much as we keep looking at fixtures and what the results are gonna be, these teams can lose any game any week.” ",negative

And Tuttosport have added to the speculation on Thursday, claiming many clubs have ‘lined up’ for the ‘complete player’. The report states that an offer of€25m would be sufficient to persuade the Torino to part with Bremer, but the Serie A side must decide whether to ‘monetise as much as possible’ or accept a player as part of the defender’s sale. It’s said that chairman Urbano Cairo would prefer to sell the star to England for ‘cash’. Fortunately, it’s claimed Spurs, Liverpool and Man City are ‘ready to open talks’ for Bremer’s transfer and ‘these three clubs must be held in high regard because compared to the Italians they have larger budgets’. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher claims the Premier League title race is now ’50-50′. “I think everyone connected with Liverpool Football Club will believe they will go on and win the title,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “It is 50-50 if you like because of the situation with the game at the Etihad. “But I feel this is the first time Liverpool can win the league at any time this season. I said City before a ball was kicked. I thought it was well gone after Liverpool drew 2-2 at Chelsea.There’s still a point in it. But I think the momentum Liverpool have, the game they have coming up next, they could go top of the league. “You can see the reaction from the supporters and the players now.

He gets a hat-trick on Saturday and everybody’s going mad, but put the ball in the box and Ronaldo will score goals. It’s simple. “The header didn’t shock me one iota. He’s the best header of the ball in the world. He hangs in the air, but you’ve got to put the ball in the box. “He’s not going to do two footovers, beat two players and then smash the ball in the top corner – those days are gone.

No, absolutely not. I’d be shocked if he was still there. “I don’t think the manager who’s coming in is going to be as soft. I don’t think it’s going to work with him. If you want to win the Premier League, that isn’t happening. “I thought Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was weak, I think Ralf Rangnick is weak with the way it’s happened.

Elsewhere, Patrick Vieira has compared Chelsea youngster Conor Gallagher to Frank Lampard and Ray Parlour. The Palace loanee has been involved in nine goals from his 16 Premier League games this season: “Conor has this passion for the game when he is on the field like a Ray Parlour, but I would say he has maybe the quality finishing of a Frank Lampard,” Vieira said. “It is a manager’s dream to have a player like Conor because when he is on the field, he will give everything. “He is focused, concentrated and will always give his best. This is something that for me is really important.” Vieira believes the midfielder’s desire to improve is behind his goal return. “I think it is his determination to progress. Every time he is putting his feet on the field, he wants to improve and to challenge himself,” the Palace manager added. “We know his quality and we know he can be box-to-box.

Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com. Excuses365 I guess this shouldn’t be a surprise anymore that Football365 is biased towards promoting Rashford. The propaganda to show Rashford in positive light whatever his abject performances by Football365 is disgusting! For over a year charity boy has been abysmal so much so that even the likes of Ashley Young & Marouane Fellaini would seem world beaters compared to Rashford. Caragher was the first pundit to call out breakfast man which was after a few days followed by Roy Keane, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes & Paul Parker! Yet Football365 find that Rashford is playing well? Football365 seems that it can’t take any criticism of an MBE mediocre player who can write 3 books in less than a year despite playing for 1 of the top clubs in the world. I had a piece written on Rashford yesterday with the title “£200,000 per week” only for the title to be replaced by “some absolute b*llocks about Rashford”. Football365 willing to reframe how the readers would perceive the article! Is that what you are all about at Football365?! If you’re so adamant that a mediocre player with no will to make any effort for a team which pays him £200,000 per week to perform shouldn’t be criticized when he plays poorly then you should rename from Football365 to Excuses365! Thankfully unlike propaganda & politics, performances on the pitch do not lie & more & more people are finding out what an mediocre player Rashford is despite his huge PR spin & institutions like Football365 trying to divert from the reality! Cheers Ashwin – Man Utd fan READ MORE: Top ten outsiders §who will decide Premier League title race  Man United are sh*t so play *some* of the kids I don’t think I’m making too controversial a statement when I say Manchester United are currently sh*t, our season is over and we’re not getting Champions League football. My question for Mr Ragnick then is “why give the likes of Pogba another game?” There’s plenty of players in the squad that I, along with many other supporters, don’t want to see at the club next season; it’s quicker to list the ones that I’d like to keep. However, in Pogba, Lingard, Cavani and Mata, there’s four senior players that are invariably in the team or on the bench (when fit) that we know are not going to play a part beyond the summer. Why bother picking them again? There’s nothing to lose, so why not give some of the youngsters a chance in their stead? Shoretire, Hannibal etc. They might actually try a bit and the clinically fed up Old Trafford crowd will get behind them. I’m not going full PFM and saying “just play all the kids”, but the four players I listed can be consigned to the past. Why even have them on the bench anymore? Maybe give Mata and Lingard a run out on the last home game because they’ve generally been good servants to the club and deserve a round of applause, but other than that? What’s there to lose, because I genuinely believe there’s no team the other nineteen would rather face right now, and that’s pretty humiliating. Lewis, Busby Way  Gerrard the Merciless Personally, I would add one more paragraph to the Losers column from this weekend:Steven Gerrard & Graham Scott I am neither Spurs nor Villa fan but in the first 15 minutes of their match I became angry about how little concern Villa players showed for their counterparts health. There were 3 fouls by Cash, Mings and Ings that for me for borderline yellow/red while only one of them was punished with a yellow. Matt Doherty was injured in the process, while Kulusevski and Reguilon were very fortunate they could continue. The worst part is that this was definitely a deliberate tactic from the manager, not one-offs from the players. A tactic that worked for that matter as Spurs were totally overrun in the first half after these “tackles”. Graham Scott was complicit as he did nothing to calm the players down and instead let this continue, only showing the yellow after the last foul. Jan, Prague  Liverpool robbed of the title Today’s “discussion” regarding VAR and Liverpool reminded me of a letter I’ve been planning to send for a few weeks. So here it is… When Liverpool lost the league by a point in 2019, I had no gripes. City has been fantastic, and Liverpool played their part in the most competitive battle ever. I was frustrated at Stones’ millimetre clearance off the line but the technology gave the correct decision. This season I don’t feel the same, but can’t decide if my viewpoint is somewhat myopic, and tainted by my love of Liverpool. I’m therefore looking for your help. From my perspective Liverpool have been on the receiving end of a few incredibly bad decisions at critical points in games. I’m not talking about the odd dodgy decision, I’m taking decisions that are beyond debate and impacted the result (eg the non-sending-off of Sanchez for the foul on Diaz doesn’t count as Liverpool still won). The ones I see that may ultimately cost Liverpool the title give an eight point swing in City’s favour, they are: 1) Cresswell foul on Henderson, should have been a sending off. 2) Kane and non-penalty against Spurs 3) City penalty against Wolves 4) Everton (non)penalty against City So, the questions are: do City fans have similar gripes from their games? Can you point to game defining moments in favour of Liverpool? Or has bad refereeing and VAR potentially robbed Liverpool of the title? Remember, they have to be clear mistakes beyond debate, and have to be game changing. Thank you for your help. Rob  More diving? OK – I realise that this is the ( insert your own very large number here) email about VAR – but please give me a minute! Does anyone else think that there is actually MORE diving going on now? It seems to me that players have cottoned on to the fact that referees seem to have stopped booking them for simulation (can anyone remember the last player to be carded for it in a televised game?) so they take a chance and tumble to the ground with an agonising scream and no little dexterity( current ” best “exponents IMO are Richarlison and Sterling) See I told you I only wanted a minute! Phil( can we drop the phrase ” he went to ground quite easily” please) Liasides Just enjoying Liverpool R reckons we Liverpool fans should be embarrassed at our measly haul of a champions league and a premier league, (league cup, club World Cup and supercup don’t count and obviously nobody smiled when we lifted those), but as a 30 year old Red I’m watching the greatest team of my life and I’m enjoying it an awful lot. It’s easy to say now we’ve finally got the league title monkey off our backs but winning the league didn’t actually impact my life at all. If I’m being honest neither did the champions league, or anything else. Turns out that as much as I love the Hendo Shuffle, and as much as I’d enjoy seeing it again this season, I’m mostly just happy with some exciting football, delivered by players and a manager that I am proud to associate with my club. Only football fans seem to feel the need to spend as much time denigrating other teams achievements, as they do celebrating their own. Life’s too short, R. Have some fun, enjoy your own team and remember that the shiny pots won by millionaires don’t affect you in the slightest.

The Gunners have been without a full-time captain since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was stripped of the captaincy back in December. Alexandre Lacazette has had the armband but he has dropped out of the team in recent weeks. 16 Conclusions: Patched-up and knackered West Ham 1-2 Arsenal set-pieces Odegaard has been their captain for Arsenal’s last four games in the Premier League. They have three wins in a row and these victories have come against Chelsea, Man Utd and West Ham. The Norwegian international joined the Gunners permanently last summer. He has grabbed six goals and five assists this term. Redknapp thinks it was a good decision from Arteta to give the armband to Odegaard: “By bringing him into the team, they might have stumbled across a problem that’s caused Arsenal for a few years, the captaincy,” Redknapp said (quotes via The Mirror). “Xhaka was captain for a while, didn’t really work, [then] Aubameyang, then they give it to Lacazette. It was almost that no one wanted to be. “But giving it to Odegaard, it feels right for me. He may not be the most vocal but when you watch him play, he organises people, he plays the right pass. He’s a lovely player to watch. “You can see from Mikel Arteta’s point of view, he’s almost his manager on the pitch. It might be one where, he’s there for the future, he’s a fantastic player, good type of guy as well. It’s a masterstroke from Arteta.” Elsewhere,Arteta has praised his side for ‘winning ugly’ against West Ham: “You have to find a way to win and today we won ugly. We have to recognise that is the way we had done it. “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win – forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves. He was man of the match today. He is always there when we need him.” ",positive

But Defoe reckons Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Tottenham manager Conte will see them finish ahead of the Gunners. Defoe said on Sky Sports: “I still feel that with this manager, with players like Harry Kane and Son, get them back to their best, I still feel that Tottenham will finish in that top four. “Conte is a big factor.

He said: “Why it’s so big for both of these clubs, whoever gets fourth, it’s just a totally different proposition for players to come and play in the Champions League. “If it’s Arsenal, that can be the next step that they make. It would be huge for Mikel Arteta, for his credibility, to beat Antonio Conte. “It could either way this one and that’s why it’s going to be so interesting. That north London derby is going to be one of the biggest in years.” Meanwhile, Brentford midfielder Christian Eriksen has been linked with Tottenham, Newcastle United and Manchester United in recent weeks but Redknapp would like to see him stay at Brentford. “It just feels like a really good fit. It was a no brainer from Brentford’s point of view to bring him in, nothing to lose,” Redknapp added. “He just makes the game look so effortless. He looks better than ever and he’s playing against top players. Every game he plays, he’s just been at such a high level. He’s enjoying every single second of it. “London is a massive pull for him.

Gossip: Dozen out, 10 in for Ten Hag’s Man Utd; City eye Mbappe And Redknapp thinks the additions of Tottenham striker Harry Kane and West Ham midfielder Declan Rice could help to change things quickly at Man Utd. “Ten Hag will need to have a look at the players he wants to keep,” Redknapp toldSky Sports. “As bad as things are at the moment, things can change quickly with one or two good signings. “Who do you get? It’s not easy but the ideal one is Declan Rice, and West Ham fans won’t thank me for this. “You want good, honest pros who can really play, people like Rice. That’s the market they’ve got to be looking for, that can work hard in training and play the right way. “Could you go and get Harry Kane from Tottenham this summer? I’m not saying he’s going to leave but that’s the sort of player you are going to need, players that will come in and set the right culture.” And Redknapp thinks Ten Hag will benefit from having “a spy” in the camp in the form of Rangnick, who will feed back to him before he starts his new role at Man Utd. Redknapp added: “Football managers all have egos; they all believe they can turn this around. You look at the fanbase, the size of the club, the history. “How could you say no to Manchester United? A few years ago, this would have been the dream job for him. “Of course it is going to be difficult. He is going to have to work really hard, he is going to have to look at the players and, in the nicest possible way, he has got a spy there already looking at the club, how it is run, the way the players conduct themselves day in, day out. “He will have a real insight when he goes in there, which will be extremely helpful for him. “Ralf Rangnick has come out and said they might need 10 new players – who knows what will happen?

Man Utd were lacklustre in their draw against the Foxes, lacking a cutting edge with Cristiano Ronaldo sidelined due to illness, and only the video assistant referee’s intervention prevented a Foxes win.

There’s no real belief that he can. “Ten Hag’s done a great job at Ajax where you should really win the league, you’ve got the best players. “So, it’s not going to be easy, and as much as it’s the manager getting them right, it’s also that personnel. “I always think you look at certain clubs and you go ‘I’d love to be in that Liverpool dressing room working with those players. I’d love to be working at City with the players there.’ “I look at that United dressing room and I think that looks fractured. I think there’s a few poisonous characters there that could cause problems. “I wouldn’t want to be in there. I don’t think that’s a dressing room that’s pulling together.” “It won’t be as easy as appointing a talented manager… there needs to be something significant that shifts here” 👀@GNev2 and Jamie Redknapp on Man Utd’s problems ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/kugV5n6Xp9 — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) April 2, 2022 When asked about the Red Devils’ chances of finishing in the top four, Man Utd boss Ralf Rangnick said:“For us, it’s my job and all of our jobs to finish this season on the highest and best possible note. Saying that does not necessarily mean finishing fourth. “Dropping another two points hasn’t made the situation better at all. For us it’s about preparing for the next game again. “It doesn’t help at all to look at the table every weekend and speculate and anticipate what might happen, how many points we might need. Right now we are not the favourites for sure for number four. “But the season is not over, we still have another eight games to play and then it’s time to draw the right conclusions and take the right decisions for next season.”  ",positive

Chelsea midfielder Gallagher is under contract until 2025. He is on loan at Crystal Palace until the summer. Ranking the Chelsea bidders by chance of f***ing the club up He has been in terrific form for the Eagles. The 22-year-old has played 30 across all competitions and has contributed to 13 goals. Gallagher earned his first call-up to the England senior squad earlier this campaign and started as the Three Lions beat Switzerland on Saturday. And Redknapp has been very impressed, saying that he has become a “complete” midfielder. “I have to be totally honest, I really like him but I didn’t see him becoming the player he has,” he said on Sky Sports (via Football London). “I watched him a lot in the Chelsea youth team and he was a good technical player, what’s made the difference for him is confidence and scoring goals. “When you see yourself in headlines, scoring goals live on Sky against Everton, they are the moments where everyone talks about you. People will go out in the garden and try and replicate those moments.He’s nicking in with goals, scruffy goals, getting his numbers up, that’s what gets you noticed. “I think as a footballer you notice that. When you’re playing okay, getting 7/10 that’s fine. It’s when you start scoring goals, that’s what gets you on the back pages, that’s when people start to talk about you in a different light as a midfield player. He’s become a complete one.” Meanwhile,Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger would like to speak to the new Man Utd manager before he decides his future, according to Sport Bildjournalist Christian Falk. The Germany international is out of contract at the end of the season and discussions with the Blues have made little progress. There has been interest from Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and PSG with reports in December claiming thatMan Utd have entered the race for the 29-year-old. Falk insists that Rudiger ‘would like to talk’ to the new Red Devils manager before he makes any decision about his future.

There have been a number of reports over the last week indicating that the Dutchman is now the overwhelming favourite to be appointed the new permanent manager at Old Trafford. Mauricio Pochettino, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique have all reportedly been part of the process but it now looks likely that Ten Hag is their man. Ronaldo phone incident offers telling visual metaphor There were claims yesterday that RB Leipzig had made a late effort to get Ten Hag to move there instead in the summer but they were quickly dismissed by one journalist as “nonsense”. One thing holding a deal up was a ‘huge list of demands’ withVoetbal International journalist Freek Jansen insisting on Saturday that a deal was far from done. However, Football Insider now claim that Man Utd are ‘set to trigger’ Ten Hag’s release clause at Ajax ‘after deciding to make him their new manager’. A source has told the website that Ten Hag is ‘expected to accept their offer to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick’ before the Premier League club finish ‘finalising negotiations with Ajax’. The Man Utd hierarchy are suggesting ‘behind the scenes’ that ‘an announcement will be made as early as next week’ to make Ten Hag’s appointment official. Ajax have not stood in United’s way so far and they have little power to keep Ten Hag in the Netherlands with the Dutch club inserting just a£1.7m release clause in his contract. Man Utd interim boss Rangnick was very coy when asked about the reports over Ten Hag replacing him as manager in the summer. Speaking on Friday, the German said: “I think this is the press conference for tomorrow’s game and I don’t intend to speak about any possible new managers here. “From what I know, all the managers with whom the club have so far spoken are top managers, top coaches. If this includes Erik ten Hag, then it’s also true with him. That’s all I can say at this stage.” When pressed on his successor, Rangnick added:“I know which coaches they have spoken to so far and that’s why I can say all of the coaches that have spoken to are top coaches.”  ",positive

It was revealed earlier this month that United are ‘in the running’ to sign the France international. The former PSG star signed for RB Leipzig in 2019. He has played 131 times for the Bundesliga outfit. One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Nkunku has been in sensational form for Leipzig this season. He has grabbed 17 goals and 13 assists from his 31 league appearances. But! Football Club (via Sport Witness) are reporting that Man Utd, Juventus and PSG are ‘in the picture’ to sign the 24-year-old. It is suggested that ‘big offers are expected in the coming weeks’. The report adds that the asking price for Nkunku will not be less than€100m. Elsewhere,Paul Merson would be shocked if incoming manager Erik ten Hag wants Cristiano Ronaldo at Man Utd next season. Ronaldo has been criticised by some this season for his negative influence on the team but his goalscoring abilities are undeniable. The Portugal international has scored 23 goals in all competitions this season and five goals in the last three matches for Man Utd. However, Merson doubts that Ten Hag will want Ronaldo to stay when he takes over and he predicts Paris Saint-Germain could pick the 37-year-old up in the summer. Merson told Sportskeeda: “He’ll want to play in the Champions League – he’s played in it all his career. “I’d be surprised if Erik ten Hag wants him there to be honest – he’s trying to build his team, and Ronaldo is 37 years old. “PSG could go for him and make him their short-term replacement for Kylian Mbappe. PSG only want one thing – the Champions League. “Ronaldo is a proven asset in the competition – he’s scored goals, he sells shirts, he’s done it all. “Ligue 1 is an easy league, and Ronaldo will be able to focus on the Champions League at PSG. With Lionel Messi already at the club, we may well see two of the greatest players of all time playing for the same team.” ",positive

Fabrizio Romano had a similar line in the wee small hours, with full agreement on a three-year contract with the option of an additional 12 months now reached, and only the final sign-off from Ajax – a formality – was now required. The Telegraph also mentions that Ralf Rangnick has no intention of walking away before the end of the season, which no one really suggested he might, but you would understand completely if the German was tempted.  MAN UTD’S £200M WAR CHEST What will Ten Hag find when he arrives at Old Trafford, other than the burnt-out remains of a once-great football club? To begin the rebuild, the Daily Mirror says the new manager will be given £200million to spend on new players, after Rangnick suggested the Red Devils might need as many as ‘six, eight, ten’ recruits. The story doesn’t pinpoint any specifics beyond that, other than to suggest that Darwin Nunes and Ruben Neves may be targets.  Rangnick’s ten-man shortlist on Man Utd’s £20m budget  NKUNKU WAITS ON UNITED’S FATE Christopher Nkunku has been linked with United, especially following the appointment of Rangnick, who worked with the versatile attacking player at RB Leipzig. Fichajes suggests the Red Devils are indeed keen on the 24-year-old, but reports elsewhere say any United move would hinge on them finishing in the top four. Which, unbelievably, is still possible, but the chances of these Red Devils putting a string of wins together in their final five matches appear extremely remote. Arsenal appear more likely to secure a Champions League spot, especially in the wake of their win at Chelsea, while Inter Milan are also credited with an interest.  POGBA COULD STAY IN PREM It was reported yesterday that it appears increasingly likely that Paul Pogba will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season. News which was greeted by a flood of transit offers from United fans. Where next for Paul and his poorly calf? Sky Sports says Real Madrid and Juventus are still interested, which is what Mino Raiola needs us all to believe. But the prospect of staying in the Premier League is yet to be ruled out. Which begs the question: which club here would take the Frenchman on the kind of salary Raiola is fishing for? VILLA IN FOR MARSEILLE MIDFIELDER Other reports this week have suggested that Ten Hag’s transfer war chest could be far weenier than the £200million suggested earlier. One of the players who might fit into a budget even a tenth of that size is Boubacar Kamara. The Marseille midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season and looks set to spark a scramble for his signature. Aston Villa, though, are also sniffing around Kamara, with RMC Sport among the outlets to have spotted Steven Gerrard, Christian Purslow and Johan Lange in attendance at OM’s clash with Nantes last night. Gerrard has clocked up the mileage in recent weeks as he searches for a central midfielder, with the trip to watch Kamara following scouting missions to view Atletico’s Geoffrey Kondogbia and PSV’s Ibrahim Sangare.

Man City are doomed and Luis Diaz impact is ‘unheard of’ According to Foot Mercato (via Sport Witness), Arsenal are one of many clubs looking at the possibility of signing Nkunku. As well as the aforementioned Premier League trio, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and his former club Paris Saint-Germain are also interested. Leipzig desire ‘over €70m’ to depart with the French attacker, who is under contract at the Red Bull Arena until 2024. Arsenal will likely need to secure Champions League football for next season if they are to prise Nkunku away from the German outfit. Their top-four pursuit took a hit on Monday night after they were comfortably beaten 3-0 by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Another Gunners target, Cody Gakpo, recently discussed the north London side, saying that he ‘likes Arsenal a lot’.

Nkunku has been consistently linked with a move to the Premier League, however, it could take a€75million bid to prise him away from Leipzig. Earlier this month it was reported that Rangnick is ‘pushing’ to sign the French attacker – who was the German’s first signing as Leipzig boss in 2019. And German outlet Bild (via the Express), says United are still ‘very hot’ on signing Nkunku in the summer transfer window. It is noted that any bid the Red Devils make is likely to be rivalled by the player’s former club, Paris Saint-Germain. Nkunku is under contract at the Red Bull Arena until 2024. Meanwhile,Cristiano Ronaldo will remain at Man Utd next season after placing his faith in the club’s hierarchy, according to Spanish publication AS. The Portugal star scored a wonderful hat-trick as the Red Devils beat Tottenham 3-2 in the Premier League six days ago but drew a blank as Ralf Rangnick’s side crashed out of the Champions League to Atletico Madrid earlier this week. Ronaldo has scored 18 goals in 32 appearances this term but, aside from the hat-trick against Spurs, has struggled to hit top form in recent months. There have been many rumours that Ronaldo will attempt to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season if Man Utd fail to qualify for the Champions League. The Red Devils are currently fifth in the Premier League, one point behind fourth-placed Arsenal but the Gunners have two games in hand on Rangnick’s men. Despite the possibility that they could miss out on Champions League qualification, ASclaims thatRonaldo ‘has decided to continue at Old Trafford and trusts in the arrival of a guaranteed coach’.

That’s according to the Daily Star, who claim Rangnick is pushing for the United hierarchy to move for the RB Leipzig forward this summer. Nkunku scored seven Champions League goals this season as Leipzig dropped out in the group stage and has 25 goals and 13 assists in all competitions. The 24-year-old – who can play across the front line and as a No.10 – was Rangnick’s first signing as Leipzig manager in 2019 and the German boss is keen to reunite with the forward at Old Trafford. The report claims United sent scouts to watch Nkunku score the winner in Leipzig’s 1-0 win away at Bochum at the end of February and it’s claimed the player would be eager to move to the Premier League and United in particular. Leipzig could be tempted by a £62m offer.  JORGINHO TO FOLLOW ROMAN Jorginho is apparently a big fan of Roman Abramovich, or at least a bit upset by his departure from Chelsea. Calciomercato (via ESPN) claim the Italian midfielder ‘will push for a move from Chelsea if they are taken over by a new owner’. There’s not really an ‘if’ – it’s happening. The 30-year-old has been linked with a return to Serie A pretty much ever since he arrived at Stamford Bridge from Napoli for £50m in 2018. And now the report claims he’s a target of Juventus, with Max Allegri’s side ‘confident they can convince’ Jorginho to move to the Allianz Stadium. The midfielder finished third in the Ballon d’Or last season having played a huge role in Chelsea’s Champions League triumph and Italy’s European Championship win. He’s made 34 appearances for Thomas Tuchel’s side this season, but has just one year remaining on his current contract and the Blues appear to be angling for options to replace him, with continued links with Declan Rice and Aurelien Tchouameni.  ONANA, HAMMERS ARE IN West Ham are looking to steal a march on their rivals for Amadou Onana, and will make a bid before his ‘price rockets’. David Moyes watched the Belgian play for Lille in last month’s Champions League clash at Chelsea and has ‘cash to spend’ on the 20-year-old. Whether that’s as a replacement or addition to Declan Rice remains to be seen. Onana was brought into the French side this season after signing from Hamburg for £6million in the summer. The Sun claims Moyes is looking to make a bid for the midfielder – who Lille want at least £20m for – before other, potentially more attractive suitors, come calling.  ",positive

Nkunku has attracted interest from across Europe since moving to the Bundesliga from Paris Saint-Germain in 2019, with the 24-year-old scoring 19 goals and assisting a further 13 in 31 Leipzig games this season. His Champions League hat-trick in defeat to Manchester City in September led to speculation suggesting Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal were among the clubs monitoring Nkunku’s development. Man Utd moaners can’t have it both ways. Shut up or f**k off But it has taken the personal intervention of Rangnick for Manchester United to be included in the conversation. Old Trafford scouts had not been considering the forward as a possible signing but ESPN say they ‘have been told to increase their focus’ on his suitability ahead of the summer. The report adds that the recruitment team were only told to keep tabs on Nkunku after Rangnick ‘urged’ Manchester United to consider him, having ‘reviewed the club’s list of potential signings’ upon his arrival. It is not immediately clear how much a move would cost but two years remain on the player’s Leipzig contract and it was previously reported by German newspaper Bild that they would hold out for a record sale of at least £50.1m. Manchester United are also continuing to make changes behind the scenes, with another appointment expected to be made in due course. While Richard Arnold has finally replaced Ed Woodward as chief executive,John Murtough was promoted to football director and Darren Fletcher becametechnical director last year. As part of those widespread changes, The Athletic report that ‘a deputy football director’ will be sourced to work with Murtough in a role compared to that used to great effect by Liverpool and Brighton, who have found success with Michael Edwards and Julian Ward, and Dan Ashworth and David Weir respectively. It is hoped that this will continue to ‘modernise’ Manchester United’s operations off the pitch, as well as reducing the ‘workload’ on Murtough. The interview process is already said to be underway and while ‘an exact timescale’ for a decision has not been made, Manchester United are hoping for a prompt appointment in time for a crucial summer transfer window, before which a final call is expected on their next permanent manager.

The prolific striker moved his competition goal return to 13 in just seven matches as Madrid overwhelmed the Blues in Wednesday’s quarter-final first-leg. Premier League is only ‘best’ if ‘best’ means ‘richest’ Benzema took his season’s tally to 37 goals in 36 matches for Real, handing his side a major chance of making the semi-finals in their bid to land a 14th Champions League title. The 34-year-old stalked the beleaguered Andreas Christensen like a heavyweight prize fighter closing off the ring to a frenzied and frazzled foe. Kai Havertz dragged Chelsea back into the contest from nowhere before half-time, but the luckless Edouard Mendy gifted Benzema his hat-trick goal with an undersold pass. Chelsea will now need a performance to trump perhaps all others from Thomas Tuchel’s highly-decorated reign to overturn this deficit in Madrid’s intimidating Bernabeu Stadium. The Blues, who dazzled Europe by toppling Manchester City 1-0 to swipe the Champions League trophy in May last year, will head out for the return leg on Tuesday, where a generational showing for this talented squad could well be required to keep their title defence alive. Madrid meanwhile will head home in total control of this tie, with former Chelsea manager and figurehead Carlo Ancelotti particularly buoyed. The urbane Italian coach almost did not make it to his old Stamford Bridge stomping ground due to Covid, but returned a negative test in time to link up with his players on the morning of the match. April showers left the 60-year-old’s coiffured locks requiring a towelling-off, before he donned a beanie hat to ward off the weather. Benzema’s three-minute, one-two punch left Chelsea flailing on the canvas. The France striker must have thought the Blues were out for the count after delivering two thumping headers. First he nodded home by racing onto Vinicius’ cross, then the Real talisman showed the other side of his aerial prowess, hanging in the air to dispatch Modric’s delivery. A dazed and confused Chelsea found themselves staggering around the Stamford Bridge pitch. None more so than the hapless Christensen, who wound up continually exposed by Chelsea’s first-half system. The Denmark defender could not decide whether to tuck in tight on the inside-right, or pull out to the right-back area. James’ advanced right-sided role left Christensen with too much ground to cover, but the Dane should still have avoided the comprehensive work-over he received for his troubles. Vinicius and Benzema doubled up on Christensen, with Ancelotti clearly identifying the Denmark centre-back as the weak link in Tuchel’s system on the night. Benzema should have completed his hat-trick before half-time too, only to drive a low shot wide of the goal. That let-off seemed to clear Chelsea’s punch-drunk haze and in a flash the Blues were on the scoreboard and back from the dead. Jorginho’s sumptuous lofted ball bisected the Real defence, allowing Havertz to steal in at the far post and nod home. Hakim Ziyech and Mateo Kovacic replaced Christensen and N’Golo Kante at half-time, with Tuchel well aware the shape had to change. The Blues went to a flat-back four, but had not even settled when disaster struck. Mendy underhit a pass to Toni Rudiger when out of his area and Benzema pounced, rolling the ball home to complete his devastating treble. Proactive boss Tuchel emptied the bench in a bid to claw another foothold, but £98million striker Romelu Lukaku could in no way follow Benzema’s lead. Where the Real marksman had proved unerring, instead Lukaku could only nod wide from a glorious chance. ",positive

Timo Werner struck the woodwork three times but he was still able to net a brace. Mason Mount also grabbed two goals. Marcos Alonso and Kai Havertz added to their advantage as Chelsea ran riot. Where Lukaku ranks among the 14 Chelsea strikers since Drogba Chelsea’s fourth win in their last five Premier League matches inched the Blues ever closer to a third-place finish, with London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham starting to lag behind in the table. Boss Thomas Tuchel revealed a sleepless Wednesday night binging on chocolate in re-watching Chelsea’s 3-1 Champions League quarter-final loss to Real Madrid. Chelsea held summit talks on Thursday in a bid to hit back after leaking seven goals in two matches, given the Blues’ 4-1 home reverse to Brentford last Saturday. Tuchel admitted he did most of the speaking in a tough-love talking-to for his players, and on this evidence that mix of meeting-room candour and late-night candy has paid immediate dividends. Chelsea’s German coach insisted the Blues’ Champions League chances were all but over after that first-leg loss to Real. The Blues will at least now head to the Bernabeu Stadium on Tuesday night buoyed up by a victory as bullish as it was bullying on the south coast. Southampton slumped to their fifth defeat in six matches in all competitions, with their last win the 3-1 FA Cup victory over West Ham on March 2. Saints’ third-heaviest loss under Hasenhuttl, after the much-documented 9-0 humiliations at the hands of Leicester and Manchester United, crystallised a wretched run of form. Chelsea were so dominant so early in this clash as to be playing keep-ball with little more than half an hour on the clock. Werner struck the left post on a quick break to open the afternoon, before inexplicably heading against the bar from point-blank range. The pacy forward had the goal at his mercy after Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s fine cross took Fraser Forster out of the equation, but somehow managed to scoop the ball upwards and onto the crossbar. Alonso’s drilled finish through traffic after Mount’s cross alleviated any Chelsea nerves however. Deadlock duly dismissed, the Blues ran Saints ragged. Not content with teeing up the opener, Mount quickly fired home himself – requiring just one touch to steady himself and another to hit the corner of the goal from 20 yards. Southampton’s day plumbed further depths when the usually ultra-reliable captain James Ward-Prowse unwittingly provided an assist for Werner. Ward-Prowse’s back-header gifted Werner a clear run on goal and this time the Germany star kept his cool, rounded Forster and slotted home. The Blues were not finished either, with Werner reverting to type to complete that unwanted treble by striking the right post – allowing Havertz to tap into the unguarded net. Chelsea took that 4-0 lead into the break, whereupon Havertz was replaced by Christian Pulisic. Werner tapped into an empty net to open the second half, profiting after N’Golo Kante’s cute chip was only parried by Forster. Mount then quickly swept in after a six-yard box scramble to put the Blues 6-0 up comfortably inside the hour. Chelsea coasted out the rest of the contest, providing the perfect riposte and offering perhaps just a glimmer of hope for next week’s trip to Madrid. ",positive

He said: “I encourage them to celebrate every victory. Because you can tell how difficult it is in this game to win football matches. “Our supporters are the same, every time we win we should celebrate because when you lose or draw you know the faces are always (sad).” After the match against West Ham, Arteta insisted that he was relieved to win “ugly” as they won their third Premier League match on the bounce. “In England you say ‘win ugly’ and from my point of view we won ugly,” Arteta said. “It was a massive win in very difficult circumstances because we caused ourselves problems, especially with our decision-making. “But the team showed huge character, not giving up but to continue doing the right things. The way they fought and the way they understood how they had to manage the game in certain moments, it was phenomenal. “I am extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and to show the character they showed.” On the pressure of staying above Tottenham, Arteta added: “When you have to pass the ball from A to B under pressure or no pressure, this is an excuse. “We were just sloppy at times and not precise and that led to a game we didn’t want to play in many moments. “We recognise that and sometimes it happens.

In the 6-0 drubbing of Southampton, Lukaku was not included in the squad, although Tuchel put this down to injury as opposed to a rupture in his relationship with the club’s record signing. The 2500-minuters: Every Premier League club’s weariest souls Tuchel believes Lukaku needs to take a leaf out of Timo Werner‘s book in order to fight his way back into the team, with the German striker having done just that after two impressive performances against Southampton and Real Madrid. “What Timo has done is exactly what (Lukaku) needs to do,” he said prior to Chelsea’s FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Sunday. “Wait, be patient, work hard and put the team first, be ready to help the team, because as a striker you can help within seconds. “Now (Werner) has made it difficult to leave him out. I’m impressed, he was very, very good in the last two games. These were two games when he was much better than in any other game and he showed what he is capable of. “Everybody thinks we as managers do the line-up, and of course we do.But in the end, the players take care that you don’t leave them out, they do it in training or in games, and of course in games it’s the opportunity for everybody.”  Ahead of the Palace game, Tuchel has expressed his hope that Chelsea have learnt valuable lessons from their last two outings at Wembley: last season’s FA Cup final defeat to Leicester and this season’s Carabao Cup final defeat to Liverpool. “We were playing for a lot,” he said. “We were playing for the top four, we had the same game against Leicester straight away after in the league and we needed to win, because we came from a loss against Arsenal. “Maybe we needed this experience also to play the next final better in Wembley, which we did, but unfortunately we lost on penalties against Liverpool. “Now it’s a semi-final. We do things step by step, but it’s a big semi-final coming up and hopefully we can show the same development and the same hunger and determination that we showed in the last matches.”   ",negative

This is the ‘best’ XI, if you’re interested. GK: David de Gea (Man Utd) It will be a hard truth to accept for Manchester United fans that their star of the last decade, a man who’s won four Matt Busby Player of the Year awards, is now the worst Big Six goalkeeper. But then your goalkeeper being your best player for the last decade is already a pretty bitter pill to swallow.  RB: Kyle Walker (Man City) Liverpool and Chelsea obviously have brilliant right-backs, but Walker will be mightily disappointed to be bottom of a pile featuring Emerson Royal, Cedric Soares, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Diogo Dalot.  CB: Harry Maguire (Man Utd) Everything is his fault even though most things aren’t. Probably not good enough to be the captain of The Greatest Football Club, but then United definitely aren’t really that and it was also their decision to make him captain.  CB: Victor Lindelof (Man Utd) The key last summer – or at least one of the keys – for United, was finding a partner for Maguire; Lindelof, Bailly and whoever else were not fit for purpose. They still aren’t.  LB: Luke Shaw (Man Utd) Shawberto Carlos at the end of an excellent international tournament after his best season for Manchester United, the left-back has somewhat reverted to his Old Trafford norm this term. Am I the only one who thinks Luke Shaw will be fine under Ten Hag and be starting left back? — Alice Abrahams (@AliceTalksFooty) April 7, 2022   CM: Harry Winks (Tottenham) Winks said in mid-February that he feared his Tottenham career was “dead and buried” before Antonio Conte arrived and started him in seven of his first ten games in charge.He’s started just one of the nine games since he made those comments and we a) find that very funny, and b) feel quite sorry for him.  CM: James Milner (Liverpool) He’s played as though he’s both 36 and 18 for the last decade, but is now actually 36 and plays purely as though he’s 36.  CM: Alex Oxlade Chamberlain (Liverpool) The truth is he was just about good enough to play for Liverpool when he joined in 2017 and now just isn’t. He had a big chance to stake his claim in midfield with the departure of Georginio Wijnaldum and has failed with a bit of a whimper.  LW: Timo Werner (Chelsea) Three goals in two games, including one in the Bernabeu, means the lad’s on a hot streak. ‘Give him enough chances and he will score’ is an oft-used Werner-ism – and is true, as it is for the vast majority of humanity.  ST: Marcus Rashford (Man Utd) A saint off the pitch and absolutely rubbish on it. Guys, it’s OK to separate the two. It’s also OK to wish him well more than most because of what he does off the pitch. If you’re not rooting for Rashford, we’re not rooting for you.  RW: Nicolas Pepe (Arsenal) For a player you bought for a club-record fee two-and-a-half seasons ago to play just 133 minutes of Premier League football since October really is quite something.

Chelsea prevailed 3-2 in Madrid but exited the competition 5-4 on aggregate after extra-time. MAILBOX: Chelsea star James is England’s future, not Liverpool right-back TAA Werner struck midway through the second half to put Chelsea into a 3-0 lead, with the Blues shaking off Marcos Alonso’s disallowed goal in style. Germany forward Werner’s strike put Chelsea 4-3 ahead on aggregate, after Madrid had claimed a dominant 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge in the first leg. Just when the Blues looked to close out a remarkable comeback victory however, Luka Modric conjured a majestic pass for Rodrygo’s volley. Karim Benzema thumped in a header in extra-time and Chelsea’s quest for a miracle in Madrid proved in vain, leaving the Blues to relinquish their Champions League title. “When I celebrated I thought ‘this is it’,” Werner told Chelsea’s official club website. “We could have scored before that to make it 3-0 but the officials didn’t give it to us. It is a point you can talk about but when I scored I thought ‘we are through with this’. “We nearly gave no chances to Madrid but in the end we have to say the goals they scored were very good. “To come back after a 3-1 defeat in the home game was very good for us, we had everything that we needed at 3-0 up, we had the chance to go through. “There was one moment in regular time when we were not like we were the whole game and Madrid have the quality to score against you and they showed it for the 3-1. “I think it was a brilliant goal, a brilliant cross from Modric, hard to defend.” Mason Mount and Toni Rudiger both netted before Alonso saw a fine drive chalked off for handball after a VAR check. Ruben Loftus-Cheek excelled in a hybrid role of wing-back and midfield, with Reece James equally impressive at right centre-back. Blues boss Thomas Tuchel was left to pay tribute to his players for pushing their bid for an unlikely comeback to the absolute limit. “Madrid didn’t create a lot at Stamford Bridge but they took every half-chance and converted it,” said Tuchel. “You have to reduce your amount of mistakes and we couldn’t do it over two legs. “But across both legs, and for sure in Madrid, we deserved to go through. “No regrets though: these are the kinds of defeats you can take with pride. “The players lived up to a plan. We were never shy of making the point that this is the most important, how we live up to a tactic and how lively we play in a structure. “This is where the credit goes to the players, they were very disciplined on the ball and very active. “I’m very happy, this is the way to go forward. “If we have this kind of effort we are a special team, and if not we can lose against anybody.” ",positive

WillVrsaljko and Grealish get it on? It’s another huge week of European football… Game to watch: Atletico Madrid v Manchester City What better way to separate two games against a fellow team ‘playing the right way’ than with the second leg against the anti-football elite. No shots, no corners, 29% possession; we quite enjoyed Atletico Madrid’s display at the Etihad. And the fact that City definitely didn’t enjoy it – certainly compared to the circle jerk with Liverpool on Sunday – will have given Diego Simeone cause to frustrate once again and hopefully, this time, dilapidate. Because despite the stats suggesting Atletico Madrid had no hope in the first leg, they did break on City a few times, and Simeone does have players – like Joao Felix and Antoine Griezmann – capable of a moment of genius to turn the tie on its head. And here’s hoping Pep Guardiola starts Jack Grealish as we’re desperate to see Sime Vrsaljko and Stefan Savic make more kissy faces in his direction and play with his luscious locks.  Player to watch: Timo Werner Thomas Tuchel said after Werner’s brace against Southampton on Saturday that the Chelsea striker needs to “help himself”. Those were just his second and third goals in the Premier League this season and Tuchel has little sympathy for the 26-year-old, who has failed to adapt to the Chelsea system and life in England’s top flight. But he’s been played out of position for much of that time. The left wing in no way plays to Werner’s strengths of running on to through balls behind a defence. The longer the German international striker has to think about what to do, the worse he is; he’s not a football thinker like his international teammate Kai Havertz. But as Southampton found out to their cost, he is very quick andcanfinish if given enough chances. And he will get chances in a front two alongside Havertz. Chelsea need a fast start against Real Madrid. As they showed in the two legs last season, Madrid don’t respond well to aggression in the final third. Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric want a slow game and Chelsea can’t afford to let them have it. Pushing Werner on to their back line will allow Mason Mount the space to pull Madrid’s ageing midfielders into positions they don’t want to be in. And should Madrid monopolise possession at any point, Werner can remain high and offer consistent danger in behind. Tuesday is not a game for caution for Tuchel or Chelsea and offers the perfect opportunity for Werner to pay the fans back for their unwavering support through 18 months of very average football.  Team to watch: Liverpool Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side will want an easy game on Wednesday. They must be pretty knackered after Sunday’s exploits; we certainly were watching it. And they’ve got to do it all again against Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. They may well stroll into the semi-finals. Despite being far from their best against Benfica last week, they head into the game at Anfield with a 3-1 advantage. Klopp will be tempted to ring the changes, knowing Liverpool’s second-best team would probably have enough against the Portuguese side. But with the lead, their clear superiority over their opponents, and – despite never being able to admit as much – their eyes on City, complacency could creep in, and no matter how special of a special night it is at Anfield, an early Benfica goal would dramatically change the atmosphere and put the willies up the Reds. An early goal the other way would put the game to bed, followed by five half-time changes to wrap the stars in cotton wool. That’s probably the way to go.   Manager to watch: Unai Emery Arnaut Danjuma described his manager as a “tactical mastermind” after the former Bournemouth winger scored the only goal of the game to give Villarreal the advantage over Bayern Munich ahead of the second leg on Tuesday. Emery, frequently derided in his time with Arsenal, says he is enjoying the comparative lack of “noise” with the La Liga side and is certainly making the most of it. After themanager of the lesser European gong claimed his fourth Europa League title last season, Emery has already scalped one giant in Juventus in this term’s showcase competition and is halfway to knocking out another European great in Bayern. While it would be fair to say Bayern don’tneedJulain Nagelsmann to win on Tuesday, a par performance from Robert Lewandowski would probably do the trick, Villarreal absolutely need another masterclass from Emery. Having failed to thrive in north London or Paris, Emery is not heralded as one of the game’s top managers, but given relative quiet, he’s undoubtedly one of the greatest tacticians of his generation.  Europa League game to watch: Lyon v West Ham David Moyes faces the prospect of just half of his first-choice defence being available for their trip to Lyon. It’s already a tall enough order for the Hammers after they only managed a draw at the London Stadium in the first leg. Aaron Cresswell’s red card in that game, which was one of those that absolutely was a red card but didn’t stop it feeling incredibly unfair, means he’s suspended for Thursday’s clash, while Kurt Zouma may also miss out having limped off in the first half of their 2-0 defeat to Brentford. Moyes admitted after the loss to the Bees on Sunday that his side had struggled with the quick turnaround from the Lyon draw and conceded that they played with an eye on the return leg. With a shallow squad Moyes would always need to prioritise and it’s unsurprising he’s opted to put his eggs in the Europa League basket with a top-four finish in the Premier League seeming unlikely. It’s a big game for Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek, who have both played ludicrous amounts of football this season, and will need to get in the faces of Tanguy Ndombele and the much-vauntedHoussem Aouar, who will look to take the sting out of the game for the Ligue 1 side. But sting is what West Ham want and they will need to use the superior physicality of Rice, Soucek and Michail Antonio to put the frighteners on Lyon. A frantic game plays into West Ham’s hands.  EFL game to watch: Portsmouth v Rotherham There are just two EFL games this midweek; both key in the League One automatic promotion stakes. Top of the table Wigan travel to Burton Albion as they look to extend their lead over second-placed Milton Keynes Dons, while Rotherham will go ahead of MK Dons on goal difference if they beat Portsmouth at Fratton Park. Tuesday could be a defining evening in England’s third flight.  ",positive

As was Timo Werner on Saturday. Winners Timo WernerAn unwanted hat-trick and a welcome double. Werner contrived to hit both posts and the bar. He also managed to score twice in Chelsea’s 6-0 rout of Southampton, which trebled his tally of league goals for the season. As they have all come against Southampton, he seems a specialist in this fixture, if all too few others. But if Saturday showcased one of his weaknesses, with his profligacy, it also illustrated his strengths: the pace to exploit high defensive lines and the persistence to get in scoring positions. Perhaps it is too late for him to alter the direction of his Chelsea career, to become the prolific scorer he was for RB Leipzig. Yet he suffered when Romelu Lukaku was starting and, with Kai Havertz now the pivotal figure in the forward line, Thomas Tuchel reunited last season’s Champions League final starters, with Mason Mount and Werner completing the attacking trio. They proved a devastating combination. It gives him reasons to pick them together again, whether with Werner as the striker or Havertz as a false nine.  Fabian Delph Delph’s last three starts at Goodison Park came in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Everton have an unfortunate habit of signing injury-prone players and he can seem a case in point. And yet, if it is easy to call him an example of what is wrong at Goodison, he instead provided much of what was right on Saturday. Everton were callow in defeat to Burnley. A fit-again Delph brought an immediate sense of authority: streetwise and tough, he helped make them look readier for the fight. Ben Godfrey looked a better centre-back with Delph ahead of him. Everton, who had to used defender Mason Holgate as an ersatz anchorman at Burnley, instead had two defensive midfielders, with Allan used in more of an advanced role, and proved harder to break down. Manchester United were beaten in part because of a former Manchester City player. As Delph had also impressed on his previous outing at Goodison, against Tottenham in November, Everton’s chances of survival depend in part on keeping him fit. Which, given his past injury problems, may be a cause for concern.  Tottenham’s new front threeThe 2022 charts are dominated by Tottenham. Heung-Min Son’s hat-trick at Aston Villa made him the division’s top scorer in the calendar year, just ahead of Harry Kane. Yet a potent trio have been completed by the arrival of Dejan Kulusevski. In Spurs’ last nine games, they have scored 28 goals. The Swede has scored three and assisted six of those. If it still makes him less prolific than his sidekicks, he has dovetailed well with them, doubling up as winger and penalty-box player, looking a marked upgrade on Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn and offering an endorsement of managing director of football Fabio Paratici. Even if his recruitment policy consists of raiding his old club Juventus, Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur show the wisdom of that policy. Kulusevski has both reduced the reliance on Kane to score while freeing him up to create. It is remarkable Spurs have nine goals in two games without Kane getting any of them. Son’s golden run, with six goals in three games, has not merely given Spurs a firm grip on fourth place: he has ensured the Golden Boot is not a coronation for Mohamed Salah, as it long looked, but a competition where the South Korean has the momentum.  Enock MwepuAfter a stunning goal at Anfield came a match-winning assist and goal, a crisp, classy volley, at the Emirates Stadium. Mwepu has been a bit-part player at times this season, but maybe the Zambian is shaping up as Brighton’s resident big-game player. Certainly he ended their slide, displaying an ability to get into the final third and the quality to pose problems there, showing the blend of the physical and the technical to suggest he has a high ceiling. The sense is that Albion may have a midfield makeover in the summer, potentially with Yves Bissouma leaving. Like Moises Caicedo, who made an auspicious Premier League debut in victory over Arsenal, Mwepu is a sign Brighton have got their future planning right.  Leeds, finally keeping a clean sheet Leeds had conceded 53 goals since their last clean sheets. The vast majority, of course, were under Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch had begun to improve their defensive record. But a shutout at Watford was a reward for more conventional tactics, for abandoning man-marking and populating the area in front of the back four – which was often vacated as markers were dragged everywhere – with defensive midfielders.  Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel JesusSome of Pep Guardiola’s surprise selections against Liverpool have backfired in the past: Aymeric Laporte has played left-back and Ilkay Gundogan on the right wing at Anfield, neither with conspicuous success. A manager who jokes he overthinks decisions confounded many a prediction by picking Gabriel Jesus on Sunday, The least prolific of his forwards duly scored in style, set up a glorious chance for Raheem Sterling and played terrifically well. Albeit not as well as De Bruyne, simply because no one else on the Etihad Stadium pitch did. Liverpool have been remarkably frugal in 2022 but De Bruyne specialised in defence-splitting passes, opening them up at will. Mohamed Salah is very likely to win the individual awards for the season, and deservedly so, but when De Bruyne plays like this, he feels the best player in the division. Read 16 Conclusions on a phenomenal game.  Sadio ManeA 30th birthday to remember; should Liverpool overhaul Manchester City by the narrowest of margins, his equaliser will assume a still greater importance. But after a brilliant performance by Luis Diaz on the left wing against Benfica, this was a reminder the man who has occupied the position for most of the last five years is arguably still more devastating. And, after Senegal triumphed at Egypt’s expense in the Africa Cup of Nations final and then in World Cup qualifying, Mohamed Salah’s wonderful pass to him felt particularly generous.  Bruno Guimaraes A January signing secured Newcastle victory and, in all probability, another season in the Premier League on Friday. Yet well-taken as Chris Wood’s penalty was, and while he won it himself, he was not the game’s classiest player. Guimaraes was. Eddie Howe took a gradual approach to integrating his biggest buy, leaving the Brazilian on the bench when Jonjo Shelvey, Joelinton and Joe Willock formed an effective trio. But Guimaraes scored a glorious goal at Southampton and, even in defeat at Everton, looked a player of far greater pedigree. He was the best player on the pitch against Wolves. Newcastle’s five January arrivals can be divided into two categories: the pragmatic recruits who did a short-term task, in Dan Burn, Matt Targett and Wood, and those with the ability to play for teams far higher up the league, in Kieran Trippier and Guimaraes. And given the difference in their ages, the midfielder is likely to be in the team for far longer than any of his sidekicks in the new regime’s first batch of signings.  Brentford, staying upIt is getting to the point where Thomas Frank’s team could be mathematically safe. To have 36 points, 12 more than Burnley, feels a still greater feat when Norwich and Watford, who finished above them in the Championship last season, look set for a swift return to the Championship.  Losers Arsenal, having a horrible week Mikel Arteta’s reign has veered between highs and lows, between terrific and terrible form, so it would be an exaggeration to say this has been the worst week of his time in charge. But it has been awful nonetheless, Arsenal’s own two defeats compounded by two huge Tottenham wins that brought a sizeable swing in goal difference towards their neighbours. The Gunners were awful against Crystal Palace on Monday and not much better against Brighton. As Albion had a solitary point (against Norwich, too) from their previous seven games, arguably losing to Graham Potter’s team was the worse result. The damage was not limited to the shift in the standings, as Arsenal went from favourites to outsiders for fourth place: the loss of the injured Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey on Monday means they now look short-staffed. They need two Granit Xhakas: when he started at left-back on Saturday, they missed him in midfield. And when Gabriel Martinelli spent the second half as an ersatz left-back, it underlined that a January spent slimming the squad and a policy of only having about 12 players they could trust were risky. Arsenal could do with Ainsley Maitland-Niles now.   Manchester United (as usual)Even Burnley had beaten Everton. As Everton had lost 17 of their previous 22 league games, virtually everyone defeated them; indeed, on many occasions, Everton beat themselves. But then along came United. If their bid – and that feels an overly generous way of describing it – for a Champions League spot ended at Goodison Park, it did so in entirely predictable manner: with a team that was less than the sum of its expensive parts, with a goal that involved Harry Maguire, albeit unfortunately, without any great semblance of a plan and with precious little of Ralf Rangnick’s beloved gegenpressing. It ended with Juan Mata on a Premier League pitch for the first time in 11 months: it underlines United’s capacity to waste money that they extended his contract and then did not use him until the 64th minute of their 31st league game. Most teams who lose do care and do try, but it was harder to make that argument about United. Meanwhile, David de Gea, in describing defeat at Goodison Park as a “disgrace”, is heading for the double as both the player and the pundit of their sorry season.   Sean DycheSometimes words can come back to bite you, especially when they seem to be delivered from a position of smugness. “I said to the lads that this lot don’t know how to win a game,” said Dyche on Wednesday and if the contents of his half-time team talk galvanised his side to beat Everton, he repeated them with relish in public. If they were an attempt to influence the rest of Everton’s season, it backfired: Frank Lampard’s side beat Manchester United and Burnley, who might have envisaged ending the weekend out of the relegation zone, instead lost to Norwich, the worst team in the league. Burnley only have four victories this season. In three games against Norwich and Watford, they have not even scored. Perhaps they don’t know how to win a game.  Watford, struggling at home The last time Watford avoided defeat at Vicarage Road, the opposing manager was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Since that 4-1 win, the Hornets have lost nine in a row at home. And if that partly reflects a fixture list that has included Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal, it is notable that 2022 defeats include Norwich, Brighton, Crystal Palace and now Leeds. In theory, Watford had winnable home games in the run-in – with Brentford, Burnley, Everton and Leicester set to visit Vicarage Road – but that kind of record prompts the question if they are capable of winning any of them.  Southampton, getting their annual thrashingAt least it wasn’t 9-0. Although, but for some fine saves from Fraser Forster, Timo Werner’s capacity to hit the woodwork or Chelsea easing off in the final half-hour, it might have been. Part of the curiosities of Ralph Hasenhuttl’s reign is that Southampton can both beat the top teams and get destroyed by them. When the wheels come off, they do in spectacular style. Maybe it reflects the high-risk nature of high pressing and high defensive lines: lacking the required intensity, far too open, Southampton were easy to play against on Saturday. Errors contributed, too: Mohammed Salisu was glaringly culpable for the fourth goal, just as James Ward-Prowse had been for the third. At least the 9-0s both had the mitigating factor of an early red card. This time, Southampton were hammered with a full complement of players.  Aston Villa, against the top teams Steven Gerrard has not been quiet about Aston Villa’s ambitions. To be one of the better teams in the division, it helps to beat them. Instead, Villa have a solitary win against top-eight opponents this season and that, 1-0 at Old Trafford, came under Dean Smith. They have four points against Manchester United but are pointless against the top six. That they had 19 shots, eight of them on target and many in the first half, against Tottenham, showed they could compete in some respects, but they lost 4-0. But for Hugo Lloris’ brilliance, Villa may well have led at the break. Under Steven Gerrard, they have competed against some of their superiors. But a return of no points out of 33 against the top six is terrible.  Wolves’ slow startersWolves were beaten by a second-half goal at St James’ Park but the seeds of their undoing were sowed before then. They had no touches in the Newcastle box in the first half and, as the statistic shows, no great intent in a poor, pointless opening period. Nor was it a one-off: they had been oddly positive from the start, scoring two before the break against Aston Villa and Leeds and three before Watford. Until then, however, they had a mere 10 first-half goals all season. They only have 67 in four seasons in the Premier League. Sometimes, under both Nuno Espirito Santo and Bruno Lage, they have seemed capable of starting slowly, easing their way into a game and then adding more attacking incision later. At others, especially last season, it seemed a self-defeating dullness that sets the tone for mediocrity. On Friday, that initial impotence allowed Newcastle to assume the initiative.  West Ham, losing to Brentford and losing defenders If a derby defeat felt definitive proof they will not get a top-four finish, the loss of the injured Kurt Zouma meant a defence already without the injured Angelo Ogbonna and the suspended Aaron Cresswell could be without a third key man for the Europa League quarter-final with Lyon.

587,https://www.football365.com/news/booing-harry-maguire-england-games-reality-show-john-nicholson,Why do fans treat England games like a reality show?,"Harry Maguire being booed is stupid. Just stupid. What are they trying to achieve? Sometimes I think some England fans are under the impression that an England game is some sort of crass reality show and they can vote someone in or out. How else to explain the booing of Harry Maguire? What good is that going to do? How will that make England any better? When it comes to playing for England, Maguire has served his country very well indeed. Booing him was idiotic. This ‘tradition’ of booing our own players is relatively new. I think it dates back to Ashley Cole being booed for, I think, being greedy over his move to Chelsea. I don’t remember any pre-match booing of a player before that. So it fits quite well into the period of reality show reality. Frank Lampard was booed for the crime of being Frank Lampard, David Bentley got it for perceived lack of commitment. Raheem Sterling got it for various reasons, all of which were related to being black. Even lovely Owen Hargreaves was booed by some pathetic people for the crime against all things holy; he was not playing in England and was born in Canada. It was said at the time that he was booed for not being good enough, which given later performances was just wrong. If we booed every England player who has had a run of bad form, we’d never stop bloody booing. Rating the players: England 3-0 Ivory Coast Gareth Southgate’s reaction to those who booed Maguire was righteously indignant and, as ever, 100% spot on. Perhaps the most significant thing he said was “I don’t think that some of the other players wouldn’t be looking at that thinking: ‘That could be me one day’. That’s been one of the problems with playing for England.” Ah yes, the heavy shirt. Just when you thought Southgate’s astute managerial skills, a World Cup semi-final and Euro final had dissolved this age-old problem, there are people who want it to come back. Or are too stupid and blinkered to realise. And is it any surprise when idiots are booing one of their own players? Is venting your idiocy really more important than how England performs? Is this what your cocaine habit makes you do? Is it because he plays for Manchester United and everything United is writ large in capital letters so even the dullards and stupids notice? Is it a critique of his form? Because if it is, that is ridiculous. Southgate picks his squad based on a mixture of current club form and past form for England. Play consistently well for your country and he’s not going to drop you for playing poorly for your club. That just makes sense. You can’t pick a different set of players for each game depending on form. That’s ludicrous, not least because measuring form is a nebulous concept in the first place. Is this all part of ‘the clamour’? That nebulous desire to play or not play a specific person which those who follow the loudest voice can’t resist contributing to? After all, why think for yourself when you can have someone else think for you? But really, this has nothing to do with anything rational. It never has been. It can’t be analysed as though it has any heft at all. It’s just people who think they’ve paid their money and that gives them the right to abuse a player. All of football orbits Planet Money – players are paid so much, cost so much, tickets are expensive and even the food at Wembley is overpriced cack. This has turned the fan relationship with players into a transactional one. Footballers have been commodified to such an extent that some of the more hypnotised or slack-jawed fans, people who don’t seem to know what they’re doing, seem to believe that Maguire and anyone else they don’t like, can be returned to the store for a full refund.

588,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ronaldo-phone-incident-offers-a-telling-visual-metaphor-for-uniteds-season,Ronaldo phone incident offers telling visual metaphor,"Ronaldo knocking a phone from a child’s hand at Goodison Park provided a visual metaphor for both his and Manchester United’s seasons. Sometimes, the visual metaphor is just too obvious to ignore. The reaction of Cristiano Ronaldo to being filmed as he left the Goodison Park pitch following Manchester United’s 1-0 loss at Everton painted a picture of frustration and unhappiness with which the club’s supporters have been familiar for a very long time, while also creating another media scramble that encapsulates the extent to which United have become something of a soap opera. Ronaldo was probably right to be frustrated. United had put in a limp performance against Everton, a team whose relegation had been surprisingly considered confirmed following defeat in their previous match at Burnley. But this point of view seemed to disregard that United themselves have slid back into a funk in recent weeks, at the precise point when they should have been making that final push for a Champions League place. The match may not have been a particularly edifying spectacle, but Everton had enough about them to take their slice of luck when it presented itself in the form of a huge deflection off Harry Maguire, a player who has made being in the wrong place at the wrong time something of an art form. Everton worked hard to ease their own fears of ending a 68-year run in the top flight with a relegation that they could ill-afford in many respects. The incident that caused the headlines was tailor-made for a tabloid-feeding frenzy. As he left the pitch, Ronaldo was reported to have knocked the phone from the hand of a 14-year old boy who had been recording him as he headed for the tunnel, causing pain to the inside of his thumb, as well as apparent bruising on his hand and breaking his phone. Ronaldo was quick to issue an apology via Instagram in which he said, ‘I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.’ Leaving aside whether an Everton supporter would want to accept an invitation to Old Trafford, the story snowballed from there, first with the news that the police were investigating a complaint over his behaviour, and then with outspoken criticism from the boy concerned’s mother and the revelation that the boy is autistic and has dyspraxia, so struggles with certain fine motor-skills, such as holding a pen or fastening buttons and zips. Of course, Ronaldo could have had no way of knowing this in the heat of the moment, but it’s clear that this wasn’t a strong look for a player who guards his personal ‘brand’ extremely closely.  It should go without saying that this was a stupid thing for Ronaldo to do, even if that frustration may be understandable. Indeed, considering the amount of time that players spend being analysed under an electron microscope or having phones shoved in their faces, it’s somewhat surprising that this sort of reaction doesn’t happen considerably more often, and at the end of a match, tensions and frustrations will often be running extremely high. This isn’t a mitigation for what happened, but it does at least offer an explanation. It’s not the first time that a low point has been accompanied by a clanging visual metaphor for Manchester United, either. When they were relegated at the end of the 1973/74 season, their last home game against Manchester City was punctuated by Denis Law backheeling City a goal against the team he’d served with distinction for 11 years, refusing to celebrate it, and being substituted shortly afterwards. It’s a myth that this goal relegated Manchester United – results elsewhere rendered it an irrelevance – but that moment has come to symbolise the decline of the club in the years after their 1968 European Cup win in a way that has stood the test of time for almost half a century. No-one would suggest that United are in anything like the state that they were on that day, but the petulant, extremely well-paid player with a chequered reputation acting this way at the end of a loss to a team struggling against relegation does offer a glimpse of the all-engulfing unhappiness that has seemed to envelop Old Trafford in recent years. The signature of Ronaldo at the end of the summer 2021 transfer window was supposed to offer United fans a break in those clouds and use his experience to propel the team back towards more sunlit uplands. Using Instagram to apologise for this incident – and yes, there are historical allegations that many believe he should also apologise for, too – is presumably not the sort of social media interaction that the club would have been hoping for from what now looks increasingly like a failed return. Seven months on from his return, Old Trafford doesn’t seem to be a happier place for him being there. With a tricky-looking run of fixtures to close their season, United are now sliding from contention from a Champions League place for next season, and at this point qualifying for the Europa League seems far from guaranteed either. Elsewhere, the fan share scheme promised to supporters in the wake of the European Super League protests looks increasingly like little more than fine words, spoken to quieten rising criticism at a time when season ticket renewals were due. Perhaps the arrival of a new manager in the summer will finally blow some of these cobwebs away, but it has felt for a long time as though the issues that Manchester United face start at the very top of their hierarchy, and that the shuffling of managers and the signing of expensive trinkets like Ronaldo have been little more than a mask for years of water-treading that can only truly be ended by the departure of those who’ve been running the club as a commercial rather than footballing organisation for almost two decades. Ronaldo’s reaction to losing to Everton certainly wasn’t excusable, but it did seem to encapsulate how a lot of people have been feeling about Manchester United for quite a long time. ",positive

The force is appealing for witnesses after footage on social media emerged which appeared to show the Portuguese smashing a phone out of a Toffees fan’s hand and onto the ground as he limped off towards the tunnel following United’s 1-0 loss at Goodison Park. Man Utd striker Ronaldo later issued an apology for his “outburst” via social media and invited the supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford “as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship”. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: “We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison. “As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. “Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. “Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police Contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022.”  A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano)  The 37-year-old Ronaldo later took to his Instagram account to apologise. He said: “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. “Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” Manchester United confirmed they were aware of the matter. A club spokesperson said in a statement: “We are aware of an alleged incident after today’s game at Everton and the club will co-operate with any police inquiries.” Anthony Gordon’s deflected shot handed Everton a priceless victory in their bid to avoid relegation while at the same time denting United’s hopes of a top-four finish.

The signings of Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane in the summer transfer window was meant to take the Red Devils to the next level but they have gone backwards this season. Man Utd are almost certainly going to miss out on qualification for next season’s Champions League with fourth-placed Arsenal five points clear of them with two games in hand. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford Ronaldo has been criticised by some this season for his negative influence on the team but his goalscoring abilities are undeniable. The Portugal international has scored 23 goals in all competitions this season and five goals in the last three matches for Man Utd. However, Merson doubts that Ten Hag will want Ronaldo to stay when he takes over and he predicts Paris Saint-Germain could pick the 37-year-old up in the summer. Merson told Sportskeeda: “He’ll want to play in the Champions League – he’s played in it all his career. “I’d be surprised if Erik ten Hag wants him there to be honest – he’s trying to build his team, and Ronaldo is 37 years old. “PSG could go for him and make him their short-term replacement for Kylian Mbappe. PSG only want one thing – the Champions League. “Ronaldo is a proven asset in the competition – he’s scored goals, he sells shirts, he’s done it all. “Ligue 1 is an easy league, and Ronaldo will be able to focus on the Champions League at PSG. With Lionel Messi already at the club, we may well see two of the greatest players of all time playing for the same team.” And interim boss Rangnick was pleased to see Ronaldo score another goal as Man Utd drew 1-1 with Chelsea on Thursday night. “We were fortunate in the first half,”Rangnick commented on the match. “We needed some great saves from David (De Gea) again and some last-ditch tackles. “I thought in the second half we were better. We had more moments when we could get hold of the ball, although we conceded the goal then after 60 minutes. “I think we showed a good reaction to that goal, scored a brilliant goal ourselves with an amazing assist by Nemanja (Matic) and a great finish by Cristiano. “I think in the last 20 minutes, it was an open game. They could have scored. We were fortunate when Reece James hit the post. “But we also had our moments. With Cristiano, we could have scored another one or two goals, but I think overall we have to admit we were fortunate to get that point. “But the reaction that we showed in the second half was good. “There was no reason to blame anyone with regard to attitude, but you could still see that we are, especially when a team like Chelsea is in possession of the ball, still far away from controlling the game.” ",positive
591,https://www.football365.com/news/football-fundamentally-boring-other-questions-mailbox,Is football fundamentally boring? Plus other questions…,"We have your mails on all subjects but mostly the idea that nobody actually watches live football. Send your responses to theeditor@football365.com Why nobody watches football on TV I don’t get the point John Nicholson is trying to make when he reveals that the Premier League isn’t being watched by tens of millions of people. Of course it isn’t. Nothing is. The days of the entire country being captivated by something on TV are long gone, but if a select few football games can still pull in two or three million live viewers, that’s on a par with The Apprentice, Peaky Blinders, Masterchef and the biggest soap operas. None of which I’d ever watch, but I’m certainly aware of their existence and that they’re among the most popular things on TV. And obviously it’s only going to be the most important games between the three or four clubs with the biggest following that draw those numbers. When a pundit crows about the greatness of the Premier League, he isn’t talking about Burnley vs Norwich. Probably almost everyone interested in a match like that could fit in the stadium, while in the streets outside the local kids are wearing Man Utd and Liverpool shirts. Also, football is a fundamentally boring sport. You have to be pretty into it to sit through a whole 90 minutes, especially if you don’t care about the teams involved, so games only really appeal to hardcore fans. I didn’t watch the Liverpool game yesterday but I read that it was a ‘classic’ between ‘two of the greatest sides in Premier League history’, so it must have been super exciting. But the stats say that that those two great teams managed a total of nine shots on target. They passed the ball more than 1,000 times between them but could only hit the target once every 10 minutes. Wow. Perhaps highlights shows are the way forward.Martin, BRFC  What’s the matter, John? Christmas must be fun in John Nicholson’s house. The festivities are all around, people laughing, opening presents and eating too much. Meanwhile, John sits, waiting and just as the celebrations reach their peak he shouts… “This is all marketing isn’t…. you know Santa isn’t even bloody real don’t you” (don’t worry kids he his.) You could argue, Yesterday was the pinnacle of modern football, two great teams ‘going for it’. Two managers so confident in their own teams ability they dared to attack with so much at stake. We had an absolute masterclass from De Bruyne, pressing that made some of the best in the world panic, the greatest tackle in football history (not because of its technical merit, but Van Dijk taking the ball off Stirling had me in hysterics) all in all, everyone seems to agree, a great game with two of the best teams in Europe. Then along comes John, letting us know ‘nobody watched it anyway’. The basic premise of John argument is of course flawed, to suggest Premier League football isn’t popular is silly, because bizarrely he seems to take what is a minority interest (in terms of Population) and try to fit it in the context of the whole nation. But that’s not the point, it’s the general miserable tone of John’s article, after what was by and large a great football match. An article on De Bruyne’s excellence? Nah. On the fantastic evolution of Modern full backs? Jog on. The tactical difference between Jurgen and Pep? Don’t be so silly. John has written this article before (many times from Memory – along with other articles on how the Premier League is basically rubbish and you should go watch John Smith play for the Dog and Duck 2nd XI instead) it’s repetitive and boring. The truth is, even if it wasn’t watched by 7.9 billion people, those of us that watched it really enjoyed it…. except John of course.Graham (all said with peace and love)  Liverpool need heavy metal v Man City Well the Man City v Liverpool game was as engaging and good a watch as most people expected it to be. Can’t say I enjoyed the first half too much, as just like at Anfield earlier this season, Man City were all over us and could have been out of sight by half-time. This seems to be what happens in our performances against City recently, we start slowly and Man City come out the blocks fast and swarm us. In many ways, we used to do better against City earlier in Klopp’s reign when we played the more ‘heavy metal’ style of football and turned the game into a chaotic end to end game. This is borne out in the facts that we haven’t beaten them as often as we did then. Maybe we need to tweak our style in games against them, starting from next weekend. As we showed, despite their excellent defensive record, Man City will concede goals under little pressure, does seem a fallibility of theirs in their otherwise quality football machine.  The title race isn’t over, but we do need Man City to drop points and we need to be perfect. Can’t entirely see that happening, but you never know. Man City can have an off day, like against Spurs/ Crystal Palace recently. Onto next weekend now, and this time there has to be a winner. Just hope we start the game more on the front foot, as we can’t afford to keep giving them head starts in games by playing so timidly.Kevin  Fanmail for R I’m going to go ahead and assume that Rs mail about Liverpool was written in the Sarcasm font.Ste  …Am I correct in summarising “R”s take this morning as: The only reason Liverpool are in this title race, have achieved one less point than City in total over four seasons and are revered as one of the finest sides in PL history… is because Offside Rules are being applied correctly? I’m sure Klopp will be embarrassed should Liverpool succeed any further off the back of this unjust advantage.JMG (Thiago’s fouls yesterday would be a better stick to beat us with but City’s vast history of tactical fouls plus a recent and inexplicable handball non-decision renders that point moot too).  …R, you obviously want someone to bite (as no one can be that unintentionally clueless) so I will. Close to a billion spent? Or circa £480m and a net spend of around £115m. So many favourable decisions with VAR? Maybe look at all decisions not just those that have you triggered. We were told we would suffer when VAR came in, now it’s helping us?! Make up your mind. Since you like being a pedant, if Liverpool have only won the league once you’ll find Blackburn haven’t won it at all. They won a previous incarnation called the Premiership (ironically what you still think it’s called). As for your criticism of Klopp, whether you’re a red or not, if you can’t see he has done and is doing a fantastic job I just don’t think you understand football. Anyway you carry on with your bitter tribalism and don’t let the facts get in the way of your hatred. I’m off to watch a side that really isn’t that special compete for major trophies.Mark  …Sorry, but yes I will bite on the mailbox’s regular letter full of falsehoods about LFC to garner a reaction, this time from ‘- R’. ‘Close to a billion spent’ – or in fact £479.56million as stated in the Planet Football article promoted by F365 at the end of last week. I think – R you mistook City’s spending for Liverpool’s. As for the VAR assertions, that Sterling offside happens every week in the Premier League, literally nothing controversial in it at all. And all this season long VAR help we’ve had? Care to reference any of the specific incidents? I mean I can remember Creswell and Kane getting away scot free with knee and shin high studs first tackles that got nowhere near the ball v us, and a stonewall pen in the same Spurs game being ignored. And don’t get me started on that City handball at Goodison Park. Ironically the one thing Klopp didn’t do was ‘reshape’ the whole team, we literally kept the same shape/formation in the period you refer to, and if you think Fabinho and Henderson are average midfielders I hate to think what your opinion of most other Premier League midfielders are. And actually Klopp does have rather a lot on Tuchel, namely three league titles in Europe’s top four leagues.Rob  Oops. Too late Just a quick plea to my fellow Liverpool fans – do not take the bait set by ‘R’ in the morning mailbox. Just leave it be. They’re not worth it. As an aside – would I prefer to be two points ahead, yes, of course. Better than being 4 behind though. These two teams have played out 180 minutes of football so far this season with nothing to separate them.

Ferguson and Wenger were committed to playing nice looking football but weren’t afraid of a defensive shut down. Then came Mourinho and a win at all costs mentality that spread to anyone coming up against him. It was horrible. These two firmly believe that football is for the people and that it should be a spectacle. You have to salute that. The respect between the two of them should also be applauded.

592,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-identify-real-sociedad-mikel-merino-jude-bellingham-alternative,Liverpool eye up Real Sociedad star as Bellingham alternative,"Liverpool have identified Real Sociedad midfielder Mikel Merino as an alternative option to Jude Bellingham, according to reports. The Reds are keen to bolster their midfield department ahead of next season after failing to land a replacement for Gini Wijnaldum in the summer. Bellingham, the 18-year-old Borussia Dortmund and England star, is at the top of their shortlist but senior figures at Anfield have accepted that prising him away from theWestfalenstadionwill be difficult. Nah, you’re alright: Seven more players who snubbed England The starlet would demand an enormous fee, while Dortmund may not even be inclined to sell him if Erling Haaland walks away in the same window. As a result, Liverpool have been forced to consider cheaper alternatives, and according to Fichajes, one man to have caught their eye is Merino. The 25-year-old has been integral to Real Sociedad’s electric start to the season, with the Basque giants flying high in second. He has missed only nine minutes of action so far, and looks a different player to the one that left Newcastle United in 2018. Merino’s buy-out clause is set at £51.4m, though he could leave for less if Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards is successful in his negotiations.  Glen Johnson, however, feels Liverpool would be better served splashing the cash on Bellingham – and maybe even Haaland as well. “I’d love to see Haaland and Bellingham atLiverpool,” he toldWilliam Hill. “They are two young guys who are built for the Premier League and for a club like Liverpool. “They could develop over the years under a manager like Jurgen Klopp and I could see them becoming massive names in football for a long, long time. “There’ll be competition from other clubs across Europe for sure, but I think it’d be appealing to come to Anfield, challenge for trophies and work under a top class manager like Klopp.” On Klopp’s future, he added: “I don’t think he’ll be tempted at the moment at all, as the club have been focusing on building up since the owners came in, and it was always a long-term plan to compete for every trophy and they’ll see Jurgen as a big part of that. “I think any other job for him would be a step backwards.

Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool UEFA has subsequently ordered Atletico to close a section of the Wanda Metropolitano stadium containing a minimum of 5,000 seats for this week’s return game with Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders. The LaLiga club must also display a banner containing the wording ‘#NoToRacism’, in addition to the UEFA logo. The decision of UEFA’s appeals body read: “To order the partial closure of the Club Atletico de Madrid stadium during the next UEFA competition match in which Club Atletico de Madrid would play as the host club, for the discriminatory behaviour of its supporters. “Club Atletico de Madrid shall inform prior to the match, the sector(s) to be closed, which shall at least comprehend 5,000 seats.” City travel to the Spanish capital with a slender lead thanks to Kevin De Bruyne’s 70th-minute goal.

However, Polish journalistSebastian Staszewski reckons Barca will have to wait until the end of 2022/23 to get their man.

After months of speculation, Erik ten Hag was recently announced as the new Manchester United manager and Berbatov thinks he’s walking into a tough job. “He’s got a massive job on his hands and we’re looking at a rebuild, and probably the biggest rebuild in European football,” Berbatov told Betfair. After suffering back-to-back defeats, Man United are now sixth in the table and six points away from a Champions League spot. Erik ten Hag currently has Ajax at the top of theEredivisie and Berbatov thinks Man United need to be patient with him next season. “I hope that the club will give Ten Hag the time he needs, we can not judge him on next season, that will be too harsh and we cannot expect a miracle when the team has been in a poor position for so long now. “It will be a miracle if things happen straight away next season. For me, United have to win the Premier League again, that is what will be considered a success for Ten Hag. That is the standard that United have to chase.” Several players are out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season, including the likes of Paul Pogba,Nemanja Matic,Edinson Cavani and Jesse Lingard. With the way this season has unfolded for Man United, Berbatov doesn’t think that anybody has a guaranteed place in the squad next season. “Most of the players at United should be worried about a potential rebuild, this season hasn’t gone well and everybody will be asking questions about their future. “It’s a difficult process, and he has to make the smart choices, we have already witnessed in the past that when you buy a player for the sake of buying a player it doesn’t work out. You have to be smart in the transfer window. “New players will come in and if that is to be the case then Ten Hag needs to know exactly which players he needs to bring in to play his way.” ",positive

Ronaldo let his frustrations get the better of him on Saturday as he was pictured slapping a phone out the hand of a young Everton fan in a 1-0 loss at Goodison Park, with the Merseyside Police investigating the incident. The result leaves Man Utd six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham and it now looks increasingly likely that they will miss out on Champions League football next season. Why Manchester United now have top-four hope again… Ronaldo has scored 18 goals in 33 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils this season but has been criticised at times for his overall performances. And Berbatov thinks Man Utd need to be scoring more goals as a team and he’s happy with what Ronaldo has offered this season. “I can agree we’re not scoring enough goals to win the games,” Berbatov told the Debate on MUTV (via the Daily Mirror). “I can clearly remember, when winning 1-0, 1-0, 1-0 down the road was enough to get three points. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen at the moment and, because of that, we’re suffering and losing points where we should win points. “I think it’s a bit short of options. Ronaldo still can score goals and I’m pleased with everything he’s doing so far. Anthony Elanga is emerging on the scene and he’s a great talent. I hope Marcus Rashford can find his footing and get into the form we know he has. He can score goals and terrorise defences.” And the former Bulgaria international rated United’s chances of securing Champions League football next season,Berbatov added: “It’s been a difficult season, that’s for sure. That loss against Everton didn’t help at all. The chance is still there, for sure, but Spurs are leading the chase for the top four. “Until the end of the season, as we’ve witnessed before in the past, you never know. So I still hope United will pull together and qualify for the top four. I want to watch United in the Champions League, where they belong, and I still think they have a chance to do that.” ",positive

Ronaldo is United’s leading goalscorer this season, notching 15 in 31 games following his dramatic return to the club from Juventus last summer. Man Utd must show a Tuch of class after latest manager twist But the Portugese superstar has been criticised for his attitude and effect on his teammates, leading to speculation he could leave after just one season. Ronaldo wasn’t even in the stands as United were thrashed 4-1 by Manchester City in the derby on Sunday, with reports suggesting the striker flew home to Portugal having been ruled out through injury. The Red Devils face Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday and Ralf Rangnick believes the 37-year-old should be fit enough to play. And Ronaldo’s former team-mate Berbatov believes that the Portuguese should always be named in Rangnick’s starting XI if he is healthy. “If he’s fit, I would play him for sure,” Berbatov toldMirror Football.“Let’s put aside the fact that he’s 37, age sometimes, it’s honestly just a number. “He brings goals, he knows how to move on the pitch. He wants to win. In my opinion – if he’s not fit, then obviously don’t risk him – if he’s fit and the manager decides to drop him to the bench, go and speak with him first, explain your decision and why you’ve done it. Listen to what he’s going to say. “In football, there are players and players. Ronaldo is an icon in football and he deserves for you to go there like a manager in your office and say: ‘Listen Cris, I’ve decided this and this and you need to take a rest. “Always be honest with the players, this is very important.” Berbatov adds that Ronaldo’s absence in United’s heavy defeat to their local rivals proves that he is not the problem in the team. “He didn’t play last time against City and you saw the score,” he explained. “So in my opinion, I think it’s wrong to say Ronaldo is in the way of the team playing good football. “I think he’s one of the reasons that United can score goals, yes he’s 37 and his speed is not what it used to be, but he still brings goals and attention. “In attention I mean to defenders so that other players can go around the free zones on the pitch. “People saying that United could be better without Ronaldo is wrong in my opinion.

Whilst the managerial situation at Old Trafford continues to dominate the headlines, United will also have to delve into the transfer market to improve their playing squad after a disappointing season so far. Gossip: Strong Prem interest in Liverpool, Chelsea centre-backs Former United forward Berbatov has named two European superstars he would like the club to sign to improve their forward options, however, he did admit it would probably be impossible. Speaking to the Daily Express, the Bulgarian said: “I will say, for a striker, and this is pretty much impossible to happen, but if I were a manager in an alternative world, I would try to sign [Erling] Haaland or [Kylian] Mbappe. “One of those two players for the striker position, you know, because I like to watch them.” Midfield has been a problem position for United this season and Berbatov has named Mbappe’s Paris Saint-Germain teammate Marco Verratti as a potential summer transfer target. “In the midfield, I would probably go for Verratti as well. “I like Marco Verratti. I just think he’s unbelievable on the ball with everything he’s doing.” Whilst the aforementioned trio are unlikely signing’s, one player that has been consistently linked with a move to Old Trafford is Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger, who is out of contract in the summer. “And at centre-back, obviously, I have a bit of difficulty here, but they do need to send a centre-back, United. “They have five players for that position, and still things are not going quite well. [I will say] Rudiger because I’m concentrated on him. “But he, based on his performances, is a good fit, honestly. He’s aggressive. He’s good on the ball, so he can be a good choice.” The ongoing crisis as Stamford Bridge could lead to Rudiger’s departure, but Berbatov did admit he could see the German wanting to move to a team that is ready to win titles immediately. “In the case of Rudiger or any player who is good enough to play in big football [games], I can see, in the case of Rudiger, him going where he can win something. “I cannot imagine him going places where he cannot win anything. And I’m saying this because United haven’t won the Premier League for what? Eight, nine years already? “So if he goes someplace else, he’s going to be looking for a team that is going to win titles, cups, medals; in the case of United, that’s hard to do now.” ",positive

The Englishman underwent shoulder surgery last summer as he had to wait until October to make his first appearance of the 2021/22 season. Rashford has been used sparingly this campaign as his form has dipped. He has not started in the Premier League since Man Utd’s 1-1 draw against Southampton on February 12. Marcus Rashford and Manchester United are better together Last time out, he started on the bench as United lost 4-1 to Man City. Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes were favoured up front over Rashford. It was reported earlier this week that the forward was ‘considering his future’ at United. The likes of Real Madrid and Arsenal have been linked with him. Ralf Rangnick is set to be replaced this summer. Man Utd will appoint a new permanent manager before next season. Berbatov thinks Rashford should wait to see how he fares working with Rangnick’s replacement: “It’s understandable that Rashford wants to start games and, if he’s still not being picked by the end of the season, I’d expect him to be considering his future at the club,” Berbatov told Betfair (via the Daily Star). “But he needs to remember that there will be another manager in charge next season and players who haven’t had a look-in under (Ralf) Rangnick will get another chance. “So it’s a bit too soon for Rashford to be thinking about leaving for another club.” Berbatov went onto reflect on the time he wanted to leave Man Utd in 2012: “It’s disappointing when you are left out. I experienced it and it wasn’t pleasant. You ask yourself, ‘am I good enough? What do I need to do to get into the starting 11?’ “As a player, you must ask the gaffer why you’re being left out. Sometimes you get a helpful answer but sometimes you come away from those conversations even more confused. “Some managers simply don’t know what to say. It can be a tough conversation. Managers are human too. “This is one of the problems of squad rotation – it’s always going to leave some players unhappy. You can play well, then be left out the next time, and that’s difficult for the player to understand. “Near the end of my time at United, I went to Sir Alex Ferguson and told him straight, that I wasn’t playing enough and wanted to leave. “He didn’t like what he heard. He liked me as a player and a human being, but he needed to give all the strikers a chance. “It was difficult to leave United. I needed to go, because I loved football and I needed to be playing.” ",positive

The Portugal international rejoined the Red Devils in the summer from Juventus in a deal that captured the imagination of supporters. Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane also arrived at Old Trafford with many expecting Man Utd to finally challenge for the Premier League title once again. Gossip: Man Utd quoted £100m for striker, third Leipzig star eyed However, that has not materialised with Ralf Rangnick’s side clinging on to fourth place after the German replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the interim boss at the end of November. Ronaldo has scored 15 goals in 30 appearances this campaign but it’s a far cry from the numbers he has been used to putting up over the last decade or so. There have been rumours that the Man Utd striker is unhappy with their position in the league and could look to leave the club if they fail to qualify for the Champions League. But Berbatov thinks Ronaldo has come in for some unfair criticism this season with fans and critics forgetting a number of factors impacting his performances. Berbatov told Betfair: “When teams have a bad result the star players always end up with the blame, and at the minute with Manchester United, that’s Cristiano Ronaldo. “At the moment he’s got just one goal in ten games and that seems problematic for everybody, but not for me. “There are eleven players on the pitch and the blame should be shared. Ronaldo is an icon in the world of football and people need to remember that he’s 37. “So, from time to time he is allowed to have a couple of bad games. But I don’t think that is the problem here. “Overall, as a team when they have a good game they have to follow that up. “I think Ronaldo is doing enough for United, obviously people will look for more because of the standards that he sets. Cristiano Ronaldo talking about his son. pic.twitter.com/QfJ8fFViz1 — Frank Khalid (@FrankKhalidUK) March 1, 2022 “There will always be people questioning him when he has a bad match, and they are taking advantage of that now. People need to consider his age, how he plays, his position and how the team plays. “People need to be realistic with him and they need to know that it’s totally different when you’re 37 to being 27. “He is going to have moments when he needs his teammates to produce more for him, that’s normal in football. Ronaldo is a total professional and he will speak to the manager and he will want to produce more. “Everybody in the United team needs to produce more, the standards should be a lot higher than they are. “Ronaldo is also a realistic guy, he will know that his performances aren’t where he wants them to be, even though he’s older and his game is totally different, he sets very high standards. I don’t think that needs explaining to him. “Everything that he has achieved in football isn’t because of luck, he knows what he is doing, and he will know that he will need to produce more at the moment and trust me, that will drive him forward. “People need to get off his back and let him get on with it.”  ",negative
600,https://www.football365.com/news/process-newcastle-urged-to-keep-hold-of-asm-amid-wolves-links,‘Process’ – Newcastle urged to keep hold of ASM amid Wolves links,"Paul Robinson has urged Newcastle to keep hold of Allan Saint-Maximin after reports suggested the Magpies are open to selling the Frenchman. Saint-Maximin has been terrific for the Geordies since joining from Nice in August 2019. Paul Ince belongs atop our Championship winners and losers The 25-year-old has made 27 Premier League appearances this term and has provided eight goal contributions. He is under contract at St James’ Park until 2026 after signing a contract extension in October 2020. Despite this, he has been linked with a transfer away from Newcastle in the summer transfer window, with Wolves reportedly interested. Former Tottenham goalkeeper Robinson believes Saint-Maximin is ‘part of the process’ at the Premier League club and has urged the Geordies not to sell the tricky winger. “I’d be surprised if they sold him,”he toldFootball Insider. “Yes, they have huge resources and huge financial power but they are not going to be able to attract the biggest names in football until they move up the Premier League table and compete for trophies. It is a process and he has to be part of that process for me. “I understand that they want to sign better players than Saint-Maximin but that has to come in time. “It is a process and I have no doubt that Saint-Maximin should be part of that process. They would be naive to sell him right now in my eyes.” Meanwhile,Newcastle‘s ‘number one forward target’ this summer is reportedly Hugo Ekitike and they are in ‘pole position’ to sign him from Stade Reims. The Magpies were heavily linked with the Frenchman during the winter transfer window. Ekitike has been a regular for Reims in Ligue 1 this season. He has missed several games due to injury but he has still played 24 times across all competitions. Football Insiderare now reporting that Newcastle remain interested in Ekitike as he is their ‘number one forward target’. They state that the Magpies are in ‘pole position’ to sign the young attacker. It is stated that Ekitike would cost around £25m this summer. ",positive
601,https://www.football365.com/news/championship-winners-losers-forest-fly,Championship winners and losers as Forest fly,"Nottingham Forest look bound for the Premier League with Keinan Davis but Nigel Pearson is done… Winners Keinan Davis Keinan Davis joined Nottingham Forest in January at something of a career crossroads. His successes with parent club Aston Villa were few and far between. Despite playing 87 times for the Villains, the youth academy graduate’s role had rarely been as anything other than a substitute. Various loan moves had been touted over the years but before this winter, the forward had made it to 23 years and 10 months old without having played for another club. Enter stage left, Steve Cooper and his band of merry men on the lookout for another soldier to add to the promotion-chasing ranks. With Lyle Taylor shipped out to Birmingham and Lewis Grabban sidelined, there was pressure on Davis to perform as the main man up top for the first time in his career. Anyone who doubted he was up to the job has been made to eat a huge slice of humble pie, and it is tasty for everybody at Forest. When the City Ground erupted after just five minutes thanks to Davis’ fifth goal of the campaign – a typically calm finish on the end of an explosive run – they never looked like doing anything other than winning. Davis has been a big winner since moving to the City Ground temporarily, and everyone will be a winner in the summer if this move is allowed to become more permanent. At this rate, that will be as a Premier League striker with a Premier League club. Nobody looks like being able to stop this train any time soon.  Danny McNamara It’s no secret that Millwall wing-back Danny McNamara is a talent. Mahlon Romeo has spent the season on loan at Portsmouth thanks in no small part to the 23-year-old’s emergence in the first team after a successful spell north of the border with St Johnstone last season. The measure of an outstanding full-back is not primarily goals, but when you’re as frigid in front of goal as this Lions side can be, knowing where the back of the net is does not harm your chances of receiving plaudits. A first ever EFL and Millwall goal gave Gary Rowett’s side the lead by being in the right place at the right time before repeating the feat later in the afternoon from closer range with his head. The brightest and certainly most unexpected spark of a stunning afternoon at the New Den, McNamara played a big part in keeping Millwall’s small chances of promotion alive.  Joel Piroe A great debut season in English (and Welsh) football just keeps getting better. Piroe is one of the outstanding goal scorers in the division and at just 22 years old, is almost certainly only going to get better. The scorer of 20 goals for the Swans this season, Saturday afternoon was ridiculously the first time he has scored more than once in the same game. That it took just 16 minutes went some way to explaining the confidence of Russell Martin’s team in the best week at the Liberty Stadium since taking the helm late last summer. That has put talk of a successful second season in motion, but the likelihood is that they will have to do it without the input of their star forward, who is surely destined for a fast track to the top flight this summer, and for a pretty penny more than the £1million or so Swansea got the Dutchman for nine months ago.  Coventry, breaking the F365 curse Of course, the day we released a glowing article stating that Coventry City’s promotion hopes were all but over, they go and complete the double over runaway league leaders Fulham, with Callum O’Hare putting in a tangible starring performance defying the bemoaning of the goal involvement of Coventry’s midfielders this season. Author’s note: we can be persuaded to write pieces on your club or their upcoming opponents in order to see results go your way a la Coventry and almost every other club we’ve covered in the past couple of months.  Lewis Baker If Stoke have any sense about them – and much of their recent history suggests they don’t – they will build their team around star midfielder Lewis Baker. Having spent almost two decades on the books of Chelsea and endured countless loan spells to rack up his frequent flyer miles in temporary switches from Stamford Bridge, Baker has wasted no time in making the Potteries a far more comfortable and loving home. Not that he needed to as he has credit in the bank, but putting in a starring role and scoring against local rivals West Brom is never a bad way to endear yourself to the Stoke support. That is exactly what Baker did, and it should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the 26-year-old’s career these past few months. Far too many Stoke midfielders have been injury-prone, ineffective or just generally in a malaise too often for Michael O’Neill’s side to count upon; Baker is the complete opposite and then some. There are a few unknowns about Stoke next season, but one certainty should be Baker being the star of the show every week.  Steve Morison Morison suffered the ultimate Manager of the Month curse this time last week, losing 4-0 at home to bitter rivals Swansea in the first game of April having been crowned king of the second-tier coaches for March. But a host of line-up and tactical changes made for a tough outing at a resurgent Reading brought about a well-earned victory that so easily could have been thrown for nought after trailing early doors. Results like this say a lot more about Morison’s capabilities than that derby humiliation.  Shota Arveladze This was game one of a six-match trial to prove – if not to the Hull decision-makers then certainly the Tigers supporters – that he is the right man for the job next season. The 1-0 victory at Middlesbrough was far from perfect, but it’s a tick on the list. That will do nicely for starters.  Jonson Clarke-Harris Peterborough striker Clarke-Harris scored five Championship goals this season up to the start of March. His equaliser against Bristol City made it six in six. Recency bias of form should earn him a Championship reprieve as Peterborough tumble back to League One; he has done just about enough to be the latest striker to tumble off the London Road production line.  Losers Nigel Pearson Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson is no stranger to odd responses in press conferences – think ostrich – but his comments after Bristol City’s shambolic draw to Peterborough United left a bittersweet taste in the mouth. Pearson’s commitment, or lack thereof to the Robins cause, has been no secret for some time now. His side’s commitment to throwing away leads has been similarly clear – they have led on 33 occasions this season, level with Fulham, yet sit 18 places and 41 points below the league leading Cottagers. Pearson’s shtick was semi-acceptable to begin with, but he has been at Ashton Gate long enough to shoulder more responsibility than his lackadaisical approach to questioning warranted on Saturday. It has been blatantly clear for the best part of the season that Pearson is not the right man to take the club forward, and his appointment and reign have been a shambles for the most part throughout. “We’ve got five games left. That goes for me as well. So if I’m not here, whoever comes in has got the same problem – and that is getting players to play,” Pearson said in the wake of another poor afternoon for his side, in which the team rock bottom of the division and with 10 men mustered a point. Much as he might like to dissuade otherwise, Pearson is part of the problem. The next man in must bring solutions that Pearson has never looked like providing; indeed, he has added to them tenfold.  The bottom three What could have been a bad day for Reading proved instead to only be a minor inconvenience. What could have been a good day for any variation of the bottom three instead turned out to be a wasteful disaster. With Reading snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, a good opportunity to put pressure on the Royals existed. Instead, Barnsley, Derby and Peterborough took just a point between them from fixtures against Millwall, Swansea and Bristol City. Reading could likely fail to win any of their remaining games and still stay up; the chasing pack’s race is almost certainly run.  Middlesbrough, seriously this time We faced some light criticism for daring to put Middlesbrough in the losers list after quite literally losing at home to Fulham. Play-off chasers should always lose to league leaders, didn’t you know. This time, there can be few arguments. Far be it from us to be succinct, but Boro were better than Hull in most metrics, except the one that mattered. For anyone counting, that is now four games in all competitions at the Riverside in which Chris Wilder’s side have failed to score. They are losing form and momentum at the worst time.  Paul Ince In midweek, Ince topped the winners column by virtue of all but sealing Reading’s status in the Championship. Job very much done. But even in doing that, Ince had done little either this season or in his previous bodies of work to suggest he was the right man for the job beyond this summer. That was proven even more so in providing what must have been a calamitous half time team talk to see his side lose at home to Cardiff from a 1-0 advantage. Reports have surfaced however that Ince will be asked to take charge of the club from next season, which brings us on nicely to…  Reading’s hierarchy Stop doing stupid things, stupid.  QPR’s goalkeeper situation QPR signed Kieran Westwood less than a month ago with each of their first four-choice goalkeepers out injured. In the warm up for the clash with Preston, Westwood pulled up and had to be replaced by sixth choice Murphy Mahoney. The youngster performed admirably in debut defeat, but the situation sums up QPR’s spectacular fall from grace over the last three months superbly.  West Brom showing their mid-table credentials In the last month, West Brom have beaten the top two, Bournemouth and Fulham. In that same time period, they have drawn with Bristol City and lost to both Birmingham and Stoke. Next season, they must find consistency more than anything else if they are to return to the Premier League.  Filip Uremovic On just his second start for Sheffield United since his surprise signing for the Blades, Uremovic was a rock at the back once more in making it two clean sheets out of two. But still, he missed an absolute sitter to win it and we have virtual inches to fill so in you go, Filip. ",positive
602,https://www.football365.com/news/kovacic-backs-real-madrid-mate-thrive-three-four-more-years-chelsea,"Kovacic backs Madrid mate to thrive for ‘three, four more years’","Mateo Kovacic has backed “amazing” Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric to still be plying his trade at the top level into his 40s as he tries to prevent his close friend from ending Chelsea’s Champions League dreams this week. The Croatia team-mates will line up on opposite sides when the Blues travel to the Bernabeu for the second leg of their quarter-final clash on Tuesday night. MEDIAWATCH: How odds-on title favourites ‘blew it’ v Liverpool… Real hold a 3-1 lead after an impressive showing in west London last week left holders Chelsea on the verge of elimination. Modric, 36, played the whole game and remains a vital part of Carlo Ancelotti’s plans as the LaLiga giants go in search of an unrivalled 14th European Cup. Kovacic has admired Modric for years having played alongside him at Madrid and for Croatia, where the two became friends. Asked how it felt to come up against the former Tottenham man, Kovacic replied: “It was nice and also difficult because we were losing and it is never nice when you are losing a game and you have a hard time. “But it was nice to see him and to play against him. I always preferred to have him on my team but in this moment we are against each other and we are ready to show our best tomorrow and to try to go through. “It’s difficult to stop him because he’s an amazing player. Obviously, he is Croatian and I admired him when I was a child and he played for my favourite club which was in Dinamo Zagreb. “Now, when we become good friends I admire him even more – a great person, great player and I’m looking forward to to play against him tomorrow again.” Kovacic, nine years Modric’s junior, believes his compatriot could still be playing amongst the game’s elite for years to come. “He was always as good as he is now, for me as far as I know in the last five, six or seven years he’s on the same way level, which is amazing,” added Kovacic. “Why is that good? It is because he loves football so much. He lives it every day. He’s a professional and if he keeps going like this, I see him still playing three, four more years on such a high level.” Stopping Modric will go some way to giving Chelsea a slim hope of overturning the deficit in Spain – something Kovacic says the players have to believe is a possibility. “Of course we have our chances and we are motivated to show our best,” he said. “We didn’t have our best game and the result is not good in the last game but there is hope and we are motivated to try our best so it will be a quality game and we are looking forward.” ",positive
603,https://www.football365.com/news/championship-winners-loser-mark-warburton?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Championship winners and loser Mark Warburton,"Mark Warburton will surely not be at QPR for long now…Nottingham Forest are among those in a better position. Winners Brennan JohnsonMany a hot Championship talent have seen their form dip and attitude tumble after likely Premier League moves break down in mid-season. So despite the fact that Brennan Johnson was linked once more in January with a move to the top flight of English football, it has been a revelation to see the tricky winger go from strength to strength this side of Christmas. This time last year, the Wales international was playing in League One. Now, he is on the verge of the Premier League with or without Nottingham Forest – though the former is looking incredibly likely – and could play a starring role at the World Cup just before this Christmas. In assisting the opener and scoring two beside the seaside, Johnson played a commanding role in getting Forest into pole position for breaking into the play-off places. On a fantastic day in Blackpool for the visitors, Johnson looked at home in front of goal yet again for his 13th and 14th goals of the season, his eighth and ninth since Christmas. The lad is special, as is his team.  Josh LaurentThis Reading team isn’t special, but they might just have enough about them to stay up. If Johnson has been getting better and better through the campaign, Reading midfielder Josh Laurent has spent the bulk of it injured and returning to form upon coming back into the team. He might have just arrived in time, and he was on the scene when the Royals needed him to be against relegation rivals Barnsley on Saturday afternoon. Laurent was in the right place at the right time with less than 10 minutes on the clock. His timely equaliser keeps Reading and Barnsley as they were, with Paul Ince’s side five points above the Tykes and equally so above the relegation zone. As predicted by Benjamin Bloom.  Middlesbrough’s goal differenceIn such a tight race for those four coveted play-off spots, Middlesbrough made literal great strides to making one of them their own, picking up not just three points on their trip to Peterborough, but aiding their goal difference a substantial amount too. Four different goalscorers provided four moments of joy for a fantastic travelling contingent who travelled down the east side of the country for a match which could have ramifications for Boro’s hopeful journey north to the Premier League. Before kick-off, Chris Wilder’s side had a worse goal difference than Huddersfield, Blackburn and Sheffield United. Now Middlesbrough are better than each of that trio of promotion challengers. If it proves to be worth an extra half a point come the end of May, they may well look back on a fruitful trip to London Road as a key component.  Swansea celebrationsA first ever league double completed by either Cardiff or Swansea over the other in over 100 years of the fixture, Swansea made it worth the wait by decimating their south Wales rivals with ease, precision and mick-takingly superiority on Cardiff’s own turf. If it was odd to see such a classic fixture played at 3pm on a Saturday, it was understandable with nothing tangible – only pride – to play for. Swansea made the short journey home with that in their pockets, as well as a Cardiff player or three. Michael Obafemi was the star of the show. A slow start to his career with the Jack Army has been jacked up by a scintillating run of form; this was his third brace in six outings. It took him until February to reach two goals for the season. For Swansea, much of the discourse of this season has been looking towards building for 2022/23. Days like Saturday though are just the ticket for what football is really about: living in the moment and making memories. Whatever success Russell Martin brings to the Liberty Stadium or otherwise in the future, he will always have this.  Harry ToffoloThere is a gulf in quality between Yorkshire opponents Hull City and Huddersfield Town, but the latter had to squeeze over the line against the Tigers who looked capable of nary laying a scratch on the Terriers, never mind a mauling. In times of such struggle, and remembering that the visitors had gone three games without a win, the source of success often stems from the most unexpected places. Toffolo has been a regular provider of goals this season, but this was just the second time the left-back got himself on the scoresheet, his winner doing enough to lift Huddersfield five points above seventh place. For Toffolo, his move to the Terriers is vindicated. Brought to the club by Danny Cowley after their success together at Lincoln, the defender is playing the best football of his career under Carlos Corberan. He isn’t the only member of this Huddersfield team doing that.  Fulham and Bournemouth doing enoughNeither of their victories were standout performances, but three points added to the tallies of both of these teams mean promotion back to the Premier League is looking like a foregone conclusion for each.  Ravel MorrisonA first goal for Jamaica in the international break was coupled with a fourth goal for Derby County which could yet play a part in keeping the Rams in the Championship. The only one of the four teams embroiled in this relegation scrap to win at the weekend, Morrison’s instinctive finish keeps Derby six points behind Reading in that all important 21st place. A good week to cap what has been a great month for the former Manchester United starlet; Morrison might just have found a home at Pride Park.  Aleksandar Mitrovic36th and 37th league goals of the season scored to despatch of West London rivals QPR and all but confirm promotion back to the Premier League. A ridiculous season from a ridiculous player in an absurdly ridiculous team.  Elijah Adebayo It wasn’t a perfect weekend for Elijah Adebayo and Luton Town in drawing 2-2 with Millwall, but they still control their own destiny. Adebayo’s strike was his 20th Championship goal for the Hatters and they are yet to taste defeat when the former Walsall man is on the scoresheet. A few more between now and the end of the season should see Nathan Jones’ side into the play-off battle.  Losers Mark WarburtonWhen a team loses a game, it is often said you want the next game to come quickly to turn it around. When a team is in a bad run of form, a rest in the form of an international break can be the best-case scenario to regroup. What you then don’t want is to return against the table-topping, record-breaking league leaders to see any chance of a restarted momentum go to waste minutes after starting your first game in a fortnight. Unfortunately for QPR, that is exactly what they got against near-neighbours Fulham in a capital clash for which Mark Warburton’s side’s understandable inferiorities were punished by a certain Serbian striker. Mitrovic had endured a dry streak by his lofty standards – not scoring in two games before the break – but it is Warburton’s extensive poor run of form which now has QPR on the verge of looking for a new manager. A fifth defeat in six games has seen what looked like a sure thing of a play-off place look increasingly unlikely with better and more sustainable teams taking those top six spots. Warburton’s potential dismissal will seem harsh – missing out on a play-off spot very few expected them to compete for beyond Christmas – but his commitment to a system which hasn’t worked well since the festivities means a fresh start might be best for all concerned at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium in the summer.   John Egan There has been no doubting John Egan’s ability as a Premier League-level centre-back since his key role in the middle of Sheffield United’s promotion-winning back three of 2018/19, but his own goal at Stoke City could play a big part in costing the Blades’ an immediate return to the top flight. Paul Heckingbottom’s side went into the international break having won just two of their previous six games in the most inconsistent part of his reign to date. A place in the top six is still in Sheffield United’s hands, and it would take a brave person to rule them out, but they can ill afford slip-ups of this ilk against sides with little to play for. Tuesday’s game against QPR cannot come quick enough for Egan and his teammates to make amends.  Peterborough losing ground On a weekend when Barnsley and Reading picked up a point apiece against each other while Derby gathered a potentially crucial win, Peterborough tripped over their own laces and faceplanted multiple times. Going down 4-0 at home to Middlesbrough showcased the obvious difference in quality between the two sides. In truth, few pinpointed this as a game to take anything from. There are easier fixtures ahead in the final weeks of the campaign, but there are ways and means of going down. Peterborough are almost certainly doing it with a whimper. They are rock bottom and on this evidence, unlikely to get back off it.  Blackburn’s non-momentum For now, they are still somehow hanging on to a place in the play-offs. If the season ended after 40 games, Blackburn would have limped into the top six. It seems less likely with every passing non-victory that Tony Mowbray’s team will finish the right side of the dotted line. Opponents Coventry getting a last-minute leveller should come as no surprise given the Sky Blues’ propensity for such joyous drama, but both these teams are looking destined for being just not quite good enough. Having failed to score in a division high 11 Championship games this calendar year, Blackburn scored at least two for the second time in three games. It has been a stubborn defence which has kept their play-off hopes alive but late lapses cost them dearly on a rare day when the attackers got their end of the bargain right.  Cardiff’s commiserations In the grand scheme of things, whoever won and lost the south Wales derby was landing on the right and wrong side of pride and bragging rights. But just as happy as Swansea were to win the battle and now likely too, the war of finishing higher in midtable than their rivals, losing 4-0 at home is approaching unforgivable in such circumstances. Make no mistake, this will hurt everyone connected to the Bluebirds. Having scored just once in their last seven games in this fixture, this was the worst performance of the lot, and one that will take a lot of making up. If it takes a lifetime to build a reputation and a second to destroy it, Cardiff have thrown away much of the goodwill created under Steve Morison in 90 gut-wrenching minutes.  West Brom When West Brom defeated Fulham in the middle of March, it felt as if they might just have the sneakiest chance of making the top six. A draw at Bristol City before defeat to near neighbours Birmingham exemplified exactly why they won’t. It is time to prepare for that all important final season of parachute payments. ",positive

But Liverpool are Liverpool. If this isn’t a Premier League fixture for the first time this millennium next season, then Liverpool will at the very least have to grow accustomed to many of their hosts. Djed Spence was not at his usual best in a defence modified into a back four due to injury, but he greeted the occasion and opponent with enthusiasm instead of apprehension and had some bright moments. Middlesbrough will be fielding many an enquiry this summer. Joe Worrall was tremendous, making one perfect tackle on Diogo Jota when the Portuguese was played through in the first half, then breathing that air of confidence throughout. There are considerably worse centre-halves in the division above the 25-year-old. James Garner, albeit on limited evidence, was able to suggest he might currently be Manchester United’s best midfielder. Garner has done enough this season at Forest to deserve a pre-season chance at United. Has done very well against various PL teams in the cup. — James (@writtenoff_mufc) March 20, 2022  Keinan Davis tirelessly and selflessly engaged two imposing defenders alone, the Aston Villa loanee sacrificing his attacking talents for the benefit of the team. Brennan Johnson was the best forward for either side, the crossing architect of two fine chances and the archetypal hard-working modern attacker. The man tying it all together will have his time in the top flight sun soon enough, too. Steve Cooper has dragged Nottingham Forest to the back of a quite ludicrous Championship play-off queue but none of those ahead instil true confidence. Whether or not promotion beckons, his is a stock that should only keep rising. Yet it was Liverpool, away from home and with a vastly different team to that which secured a remarkably similar result four days ago, who completed this year’s set of FA Cup semi-finalists. Their shot at history continues unabated.  Arsenal worried them on Wednesday, induced a genuine sense of vague anxiety in a group of players that typically seem above such nonsense. Nottingham Forest pressed in a comparably ferocious manner, their intensity unsettling the Liverpool rhythm and matched by that of the supporters. The hosts were a perennial danger on the counter-attack, Davis occupying a space on the halfway line and rarely venturing more than a couple of yards from the impeccable Ibrahima Konate. Their battle had no real loser; both were excellent. Joe Gomez versus Johnson on Liverpool’s right was equally engaging, before the latter decided to twist and take on Kostas Tsimikas on the other side and fare even better. It was an exceptional watch, albeit relatively lacking in chances. Jack Colback’s mistake handed one to Roberto Firmino, whose attempted lob was saved superbly by Ethan Horvath. Worrall cleared one effort off the line. Jurgen Klopp bowed to the narrative and made a quadruple substitution, reflecting his respect for the Championship resistance. Then Forest had their moment. Johnson broke down the right, eventually gathering a ball played just behind him on the counter. He raced clear with support in the centre, putting the ball across forPhilip Zinckernagel, unmarked and ten or so yards out. The Dane tried to steer it beyond Alisson but managed only to knock it clear of the far post. Two minutes and 10 seconds later, Liverpool led. The lurking Diogo Jota converted a wondrous Tsimikas cross and it seemed as though they had done it again. The Reds opened the scoring in midweek against Arsenal almost immediately after the Gunners created and wasted their best chance in a promising display. Klopp and his players seem to have developed a way of lulling teams into a false sense of security before striking at the opportune moment. That, of course, implies a degree of intention and deliberation, as if Liverpool plan to endure an hour of even, energy-sapping football that is pierced by the concession of a huge chance – but never a goal – before they themselves score. Good as they are, it is mere coincidence. But there is a sense that they can do no wrong. ‘That was the one,’ Forest fans and neutrals alike fearfully declared at thePhilip Zinckernagel miss. Yet even after Jota scored, Forest crammed a penalty claim, a presentable Ryan Yates header and what would have been an incredible Cafu equaliser into those final 10 minutes. Liverpool stood firm, rocked but not toppled, bruised but not beaten. They will see many of these faces again soon enough and more regularly. It remains the case that they could be armed with an extra three trophies by then. ",positive

Benzema and Ronaldo played 342 times together for Los Blancos during the Portuguese’s nine-year stint in the Spanish capital. Ronaldo phone incident offers telling visual metaphor They helped Real Madrid win four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Spanish cups and four Spanish Super Cups. Benzema has been able to show his true goalscoring potential since Ronaldo’s departure in 2018. He has been terrific since the start of 2020/21, in particular, netting 67 times since then. The forward pair were prolific during their time at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Ronaldo scoring 450 goals in 438 appearances and winning four Ballon d’Or awards. However, former Real Madrid, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Italy striker Cassano believes the Man Utd forward should thank Benzema for aiding his success. Speaking to Bobo TV (via Metro), Cassano said: “Cristiano Ronaldo has to pray in the morning and say, ‘Thank you, Benzema, that you played with me.’ “Ronaldo scores and will always score, but he’s a different player; Benzema is a goalscoring centre forward. But he’s also Zidane, he’s a nine, ten and a nine-and-a-half.” Elsewhere,Man Utd are ready to trigger Erik ten Hag’s release clause at Ajax and announce his arrival next week, according to reports. There have been a number of reports over the last week indicating that the Dutchman is now the overwhelming favourite to be appointed the new permanent manager at Old Trafford. Football Insiderclaim thatthe Red Devils are ‘set to trigger’ Ten Hag’s release clause at Ajax ‘after deciding to make him their new manager’. A source has told the website that Ten Hag is ‘expected to accept their offer to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick’ before the Premier League club finish ‘finalising negotiations with Ajax’. The Man Utd hierarchy are suggesting ‘behind the scenes’ that ‘an announcement will be made as early as next week’ to make Ten Hag’s appointment official. ",positive

Nottingham Crown Court heard the ex-England, Arsenal, Chelsea and Derby left-back was led around the house in just a pair of shorts as intruders demanded jewellery in January 2020. Kurtis Dilks, 34, is accused of being part of a four-strong gang who smashed their way into Cole’s home with a sledgehammer. Jurors were told Cole and his partner Sharon Canu both had their hands bound by black cable ties, and the court was shown CCTV of the intruders leading the three-time Premier League winner up and down the stairs. Watches, mobile phones, cash, a Gucci bag, headphones and a BMW smart key were all stolen during the break-in, the court was told. Southampton dominate worst XI of weekend but Arsenal feature Dilks is standing trial accused of robbing Cole and Ms Canu, as well as allegedly raiding the home of former Tottenham and Derby midfielder Tom Huddlestone with co-defendants Ashley Cumberpatch and Andrew MacDonald. Opening the case against Dilks, prosecutor Michael Brady QC said: “During the evening of Tuesday January 21 2020, Ms Canu was at home with their two young children. “Mr Cole returned home at about 9.30pm when they settled down upstairs to watch a film. “Within a few minutes Mr Cole and Ms Canu heard a noise from outside the front of the house and placed the TV on mute to hear what it was. “Mr Cole described the noise as vibrating up the walls into the bedroom and was sufficiently concerned that he checked the view of household security cameras on the app he had on his mobile telephone. “The robbers were clearly not deterred by his presence.” Mr Brady said Cole told his partner to call the police, which she did after hiding in a wardrobe. The prosecutor continued: “The next thing Ms Canu knew was when one of the robbers opened the wardrobe door and took the phone from her while she was talking to the police. “Ms Canu… followed the intruder and was directed wordlessly by the man who had taken her phone to the bedroom where Mr Cole was. “She then saw Mr Cole on his knees with his hands tied behind his back.” Mr Brady said Ms Canu became increasingly concerned after she spotted one of the intruders with a “huge hammer” as Mr Cole was taken from the bedroom by the robbers. “It was in fact a sledgehammer that had been used to smash the bi-fold downstairs doors through which entry had been gained to the house,” Mr Brady said. He continued: “Mr Cole noticed that one of the men, who came straight towards him, spoke with an Irish accent, and almost immediately began to man-handle him. “The man demanded jewellery and ‘kettles’, which is slang for watches, and wanted to know where the safe was. “When Mr Cole told him that he didn’t have anything the man grabbed the back of his neck and squeezed it. “Mr Cole’s head was pushed further forward, and he was told to put his hands behind his back at which point he became aware of Ms Canu at the bedroom door.”  Mr Brady told jurors Ms Canu’s hands were then bound together by black cable ties. He said: “Ms Canu rather bravely initially refused to have her hands bound. “That bravery understandably evaporated to a certain extent when she was threatened with a knife. “The man said, ‘Do you want that?’ – meaning the knife.” Mr Brady said the robbers were making demands for jewellery from Cole and where the safes were. The Crown’s QC continued: “By this stage Mr Cole’s hands were also bound behind his back with similar cable ties. “Mr Cole was then picked up by his arms. He saw how distressed his family was. “Mr Cole mentioned that one of the attackers, a stocky more aggressive man who also spoke with an Irish accent, kept saying ‘let’s cut his fingers’. “At the time he was armed with a pair of pliers. “Despite the efforts of the stocky robber to attack him with pliers, the robber who Mr Cole described as the ‘boss man’, the one who had first approached him in his bedroom and grabbed his neck, prevented the attack from going ahead.” Mr Brady said the robbers then demanded bleach and cleaning products, before one “sprayed Mr Cole’s hands with Febreze”. The court heard the robbers fled after one shouted “police”. Mr Brady said Dilks’ DNA was found on a black-handled knife and a black cable tie which were discovered during a search of Cole’s home. Dilks, of Whitegate Vale, Clifton, Nottingham, faces three charges of conspiracy to commit burglary, four charges of converting criminal property, three charges of conspiracy to commit robbery and two counts of robbery. Cumberpatch, his partner Kelly Duong, MacDonald, Matthew Johnson, Adrian Eddishaw, Darren Stokes, Christopher Yorke, Gordon Thornhill, Tevfik Guccuk, and Sercan Evsin are also on trial for their alleged part in the series of “ruthlessly executed” burglaries.

The Belgium international has been one of the best players in the Premier League since returning in 2015 from Wolfsburg, who he joined in 2014 from Chelsea after playing just three league games for the Stamford Bridge outfit. De Bruyne has been in good form again this season with 14 goals and five assists in all competitions as Man City still fight for glory on three fronts. Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool The 30-year-old is rarely linked with a move away from Man City with the Belgium international happy at the club and the Citizens at the peak of their powers. But now Spanish publication Nacional claims that Real Madrid president Perez ‘met with’ De Bruyne and his agent in a ‘secret meeting in Manchester’ that will ‘shake’ the Premier League. Perez is determined to give a deal for De Bruyne a good go and, although the meeting ‘did not have the expected result’, he is ‘determined to try again’. The Man City playmaker is ‘facing one of the last opportunities of his life to start a new adventure’ and playing in La Liga ‘has always seduced him enormously’. Nacional admit that Real Madrid will find it ‘very difficult to get him out of the Etihad Stadium’ but the Los Blancos recruitment team are still hopeful they can ‘convince him’. Man City will ‘only study proposals close to or greater than’€100m and a deal in the summer transfer window ‘would be one of the great surprises of the market’. Meanwhile,Kyle Walker felt Man City had moved a small step closer to retaining their Premier League title after Sunday’s pulsating 2-2 draw with Liverpool. Walker said after the match: “Of course we want to win every game, especially when people come to our own patch, but it’s very important not to lose the game. “We can’t lose a game (like this) and then be trailing them because good teams like them don’t drop too many points. You take a point, you move on and they’ve still got to catch us. I feel that it’s a step in the right direction. “It’s in our hands, we’re still top of the Premier League.

Tottenham have come alive in recent weeks under Antonio Conte and continued their recent good form with a 4-0 victory on the road at Aston Villa on Saturday. Spurs have seven of their last nine matches in the Premier League and have scored 28 goals in those games to catapult themselves into fourth place in the table. Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool Fourth would provide Spurs with Champions League football next season and Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski have been particularly brilliant in recent weeks. However, Merson claimed in his Sky Sports column last week that Spurs are a “one-man team” and that without Kane they wouldn’t be where they are in the league. Merson wrote: “Spurs are the favourites for top four now. When Harry Kane’s playing like he is, I don’t think too many teams are going to beat them. I saw him go to the Etihad and rip Manchester City apart. I saw him rip West Ham apart, I saw him rip Newcastle apart. “But you take Kane out of the team, top four ain’t happening for Spurs. It’s as simple as that. When he doesn’t turn up at Burnley away, they get beaten. Tottenham are a one-man team and that’s not being disrespectful. “You could have a Ferrari, but without an engine in the car it ain’t working. He’s the all-round package, and that’s why he’s the best centre-forward in the world, and I’ve said it for a long, long time.” When Morrison and Jeff Stelling questioned his comments on Sky Sports News’ Soccer Saturday show, Merson said: “Son and Kulusevski play when Kane plays. “If Kane doesn’t turn up the other two aren’t playing believe me.If Son’s making runs then who’s finding him?” Morrison hit back: “If Son don’t make the runs then how is Kane going to find him? Who has to make that run behind?” Debate on the Sky Sports panel if Spurs are a ‘one man team’ 👀 pic.twitter.com/2LIB7aIWBb — The Spurs Web ⚪️ (@thespursweb) April 9, 2022 To which Merson replied: “If Harry Kane doesn’t turn up then Tottenham are winning no game. “He turns up against Manchester City, nine out of ten they win the game, he turns up against West Ham and Newcastle and win the game. “He doesn’t show up against Burnley and what happens? They lose. “I’m not being disrespectful to the other players because you need the team. If you’ve got a Ferrari car you need an engine and he’s the engine.” Morrison disagreed again but Merson said: “If Harry Kane gets injured, god forbid he doesn’t, then who gets fourth? Morrison added: “They’re still in it. Arsenal probably would be favourites but it’s not a one-man team. “I’m saying if he drops into the pockets with his passing who’s going to make the run in there if it’s not Son or Kulusevski.”  ",positive

READ MORE: Southampton dominate worst XI of weekend but Arsenal feature That leaves them three points ahead of Arsenal, with a better goal difference, going into their final seven fixtures of the season and, despite the Gunners having a game in hand, Spurs are favourites to finish in the top four. Tottenham have won four games in a row and six of their last seven in the league, but it was only eight matches ago that boss Antonio Conte suggested he could walk away as the job was too big for him. Lloris says Spurs have to remember where they came from and cannot rest on their laurels. “I believe there’s very good potential (for this team)”, he said. “And with confidence you can grow ever faster. “But again, in football, from one game to another, everything can turn very quickly. That’s why we need to be cautious. “We know where we come from and we cannot forget that. That’s very important, especially in this season. We need to continue our work, our way. “It’s the competition that everyone wants to be involved in. But also we’re in the Premier League and the ticket to the Champions League is very tough, probably more difficult than in other leagues. “But that’s the game. There’s still a long way to go. Even if we came back and we’re in the race, there’s still seven games to play.” Although Spurs’ 4-0 scoreline at Villa suggests an easy evening, it was anything but and only an inspired display from Lloris in the first half kept the rampant hosts at bay. Despite hitting form and winning six of their last seven games, Lloris knows the remaining fixtures are not a foregone conclusion. “It’s difficult to control everything for 90 minutes because this is the Premier League, with a lot of talented players, with a lot of competitive teams and top managers,” he said. “Every time you face a new opponent it’s a new challenge, with a new system, different skills. That’s why we all enjoy the Premier League. “But with one game a week, we try to prepare as good as we can and I think we can be satisfied because we get rewarded for the work we do every week. “But again, we have to stay focused on our main target and be focused on ourselves, not the others.

The remaining contenders to buy Chelsea must submit final offers for the Stamford Bridge club on April 14. New York merchant bank the Raine Group will then hope to present a preferred bidder to Downing Street in the week of April 18. Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool The Government must approve the eventual buyer, with the issuing of a new Treasury licence for the sale the final hurdle for Chelsea’s would-be new owners. And sources close to the Government have revealed Downing Street’s satisfaction in principle with all remaining parties in the battle to buy the Blues from Roman Abramovich. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family and Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, in partnership with US magnate Mark Walter and British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, have both pushed hard in their bids for the Blues. Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastien Coe have teamed up on another bid, while Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca is also in the running. The Ricketts family’s bid has drawn criticism among Chelsea supporters, with an online petition launched against their candidacy. A small protest was also staged at Stamford Bridge ahead of Brentford’s 4-1 win over Chelsea on Saturday, April 2. Coming next! 🔵#UCL pic.twitter.com/gT3Lja1ShY — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 11, 2022 Chelsea supporters have objected to controversies around the family including patriarch Joe Ricketts’ Islamophobic statements in leaked emails from 2019. Siblings Tom and Laura Ricketts are thought to be considered suitable bid leaders however, owing to their Cubs stewardship and efforts towards community relations and diversity and inclusion in Chicago. The bid also boasts major financial backing from two of America’s richest men in Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert. The Cubs owners’ public pledges to keep Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, reject any European Super League and to include supporters in decision-making processes are thought to have calmed any unease in Downing Street. Broughton and Coe’s consortium’s bid for Chelsea would find favour in Government, given the duo’s clear establishment links and track record in sporting administration. Boston Celtics chief Pagliuca’s track record in the NBA is not thought to generate any concerns in Downing Street either. Both the Broughton and Pagliuca consortium offers would likely require divesting of other football club shares, but Government chiefs are understood to expect Raine Group to have already accounted for such detail in whittling down their shortlist. Josh Harris and David Blitzer would have to offload their shareholding in Crystal Palace if they are named in the Broughton bid as expected, while Pagliuca would need to reduce his 55 per cent share in Italian club Atalanta. The Boehly-Goldstein bid appears to have precious few sticking points from a Government perspective. The heads of the four consortiums met with Chelsea’s board executives last week, aiming to gather as much information as possible amid the fine-tuning of their bids. Russian-Israeli billionaire Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special Government licence to continue operating, though under strict terms. Abramovich cannot profit from Chelsea’s sale, but had already vowed to write off the club’s £1.5billion debt.  ",positive

Liverpool and Everton 2021/22: Liverpool (2) lead Everton (18) by 50 points 2020/21: Liverpool (3) beat Everton (10) by 10 points 2019/20: Liverpool (1) beat Everton (12) by 50 points 2018/19: Liverpool (2) beat Everton (8) by 43 points 2017/18: Liverpool (4) beat Everton (8) by 26 points 2016/17: Liverpool (4) beat Everton (7) by 15 points 2015/16: Liverpool (8) beat Everton (11) by 13 points 2014/15: Liverpool (6) beat Everton (11) by 15 points 2013/14: Liverpool (2) beat Everton (5) by 14 points 2012/13: Everton (6) beat Liverpool (7) by 2 points Head-to-head: 8 Liverpool wins, 1 Everton win, 11 draws Average points difference: Liverpool by 23.4 Average position difference: Liverpool by 5.7 A few striking things here. One is that Liverpool are (let’s be realistic, almost definitely) going to beat Everton by 50+ points for the second time in three years. Another is that this rivalry might not even be a Premier League thing next season. And third is a rejoinder to the idea that ‘the formbook goes out the window’ in these matches. On Merseyside, it is simply replaced by a derby-specific formbook in which Liverpool nearly always win the games at Anfield while Everton nearly always battle gamely to a point at Goodison. But perhaps the most absurd thing in the context of these numbers is that the one Everton win – last season, at Anfield – was only 14 months ago and at that time not really much of a surprise. It truly was a very, very weird season. Everyone likes to asterisk 2019/20 – mainly just to wind up Liverpool fans in fairness – but 2020/21 is the freakish outlier. Klopp’s Liverpool finished behind Solskjaer’s United, for goodness’ sake.  Manchester City and Manchester United 2021/22: City (1) lead United (6) by 26 points 2020/21: City (1) beat United (2) by 12 points 2019/20: City (2) beat United (3) by 15 points 2018/19: City (1) beat United (6) by 32 points 2017/18: City (1) beat United (2) by 19 points 2016/17: City (3) beat United (6) by 9 points 2015/16: City (4) beat United (5) on GD 2014/15: City (2) beat United (4) by 9 points 2013/14: City (1) beat United (7) by 22 points 2012/13: United (1) beat City (2) by 11 points Head-to-head: 10 City wins, 7 United wins, 3 draws Average points difference: City by 13.3 Average position difference: City by 2.4 Despite a couple of high-profile embarrassments, United have at least managed to keep the derby games themselves halfway competitive overall and scored a couple of unlikely Etihad triumphs along the way. Generally, though, the 10-year trend here is for United to appear deceptively close to their noisy neighbours on the table right up until you glance across at the points column where, with the notable exception of 2016 where nobody is looking below ‘1. Leicester’ anyway, a rather different story emerges. That is the only time in the last nine seasons that United have got within nine points of City, and this season has every chance of being the second with a gap of over 30 points. Tottenham and Arsenal 2021/22: Arsenal (4) lead Spurs (5) by 2 points 2020/21: Spurs (7) beat Arsenal (8) by 1 point 2019/20: Spurs (6) beat Arsenal (8) by 3 points 2018/19: Spurs (4) beat Arsenal (5) by 1 point 2017/18: Spurs (3) beat Arsenal (6) by 14 points 2016/17: Spurs (2) beat Arsenal (5) by 11 points 2015/16: Arsenal (2) beat Spurs (3) by 1 point 2014/15: Arsenal (3) beat Spurs (5) by 11 points 2013/14: Arsenal (4) beat Spurs (6) by 10 points 2012/13: Arsenal (4) beat Spurs (5) by 1 point Head-to-head: 6 Spurs wins, 7 Arsenal wins, 6 draws, 1 TBC Average points difference: Spurs by 0.5 Average position difference: Spurs by 0.3 Now that’s the stuff, isn’t it? Two teams who have been fully committed to banter for so long that they have effectively become identical. They are the Spider-Man meme in football club form. If Spurs win the rearranged NLD in a few weeks, even the head-to-head will be dead level. If they don’t then Arsenal will probably make it five ‘wins’ apiece over the last decade on the league table, although there are definitely more twists and turns to come there from this pair of absolute jokers. Five times in the last nine seasons – and every chance that’s six in 10 when this one’s done – they’ve ended up within one game of each other points-wise in the final table, and this looks likely either way to be the fifth time in 10 they end up in adjacent finishing positions in the table. For the last decade there has never once been more than two other sides between them in the final reckoning and over very nearly 10 full seasons – 375 matches each – they are separated by a grand total of five league points. And, while City continuing to outperform United seems likely and Liverpool’s ongoing divergence from Everton almost certain, there seems absolutely no reason to think these two won’t be stumbling over the finish line with barely a crisp packet between them for many more years to come. The derby that beats all others specifically because both teams are good enough to matter without being actually good. Heroes the pair of them. ",positive
615,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-quartet-among-premier-leagues-10-busiest-players,Liverpool quartet among Premier League’s 10 busiest players,"Mo Salah’s month-long goal drought is one of the big talking points in the game ahead of yet another crucial game for Liverpool against Manchester United. Weariness surely must be a factor given the epic contribution he’s made for club and country over the last year. He’s entitled to be mentally as well as physically knacked, given everything he’s been through, but where does his workload sit compared to other Premier League stars? Pretty high, it turns out. This is a top 10 of the busiest Premier League boys this season by minutes played. Some caveats. These are totals for all competitions and include international games as well. It’s outfield players only – Edouard Mendy, Alisson, Kasper Schmeichel and Ederson have all racked up 4000+ minutes as well – and because we’ve taken all the stats from the heronerds at Transfermarkt the season’s tally includes July and thus bits and pieces of Copa America and Euros. By definition the bits of those competitions played in July were a pretty big deal, and so we’ve decided that’s fair enough and also that we can’t be bothered to do the sums ourselves to get rid of those games. 10)Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – 3909 minutes We are vastly annoyed that nine rather than 10 Premier League-based players have got past 4000 minutes. Especially as ninth place is almost two full matches past that mark. Maybe we could have got away with including Ederson because the last two weekends have shown a) his outfield skills and b) that other keepers don’t have them. Anyway, Bernardo Silva. Having a good season. Good for him. Like all but two members of the list, he’s got 50 matches under his belt since July.  9) Harry Kane (Tottenham) – 4153 minutes Missed Spurs’ first league game and was a late sub in their second but has barely missed a minute since having also racked up minutes in the Carabao, Europa Conference and FA Cup while also playing lots of games and scoring approximately 843 goals for England. After a stunning run was absolutely rotten against Brighton at the weekend, raising questions about the wisdom of Antonio Conte telling him Spurs had “seven cup finals” to finish the season.  8) Sadio Mane (Liverpool) – 4257 minutes The star of Liverpool’s win over Manchester City at the weekend on his 55th appearance of the season, although his 85 minutes against City were his only FA Cup minutes of the season apart from six against Norwich in round five. He also didn’t feature in the Carabao until the final, but can only hardly be accused of shirking. His hefty workload includes twin penalty shoot-out successes with Senegal at Egypt and Mo Salah’s expense in first AFCON and then World Cup qualification.  7) Joao Cancelo (Man City) – 4314 minutes Yeah, it’s a lot of minutes but lazy Joao hasn’t even bothered to play 50 games yet. He’s played a mere 49, but 44 of those in City colours. He’s missed only two Premier League games this season and played 90 minutes in all but one of the other 29. He managed only 78 minutes in the 2-0 home defeat against Crystal Palace.  6) Declan Rice (West Ham) – 4407 minutes Absolutely crucial player for club and country these days and could yet end this exhausting but hugely rewarding year with a Europa League winner’s medal and Champions League spot without having to make a £100m move to somewhere or other. Might still do that anyway, of course.  5) Luis Diaz (Porto/Liverpool) – 4454 minutes Even Liverpool’s January signing has racked up an epic amount of minutes thanks to our cut-off including a bit of Copa America and a whacking great number of World Cup qualifiers for Colombia along with 28 games for Porto – including two against Liverpool – and 16 games in all competitions for his new club. Nobody in European football can touch his total appearances, with an absurd 59 games of football for club(s) and country since July.  4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea) – 4500 minutes It’s no longer news to point it out, but it remains one of the more astonishing redemptions in modern football. Rudiger went from such a peripheral and insignificant figure at Chelsea that they were even prepared to countenance doing business with Spurs to get rid of him to becoming the all-action leader and heartbeat of their defence. Can’t imagine Chelsea without him now, which is awkward because we’re all going to have to when his contract expires at the end of the season. Real Madrid had decided against signing him, but might now reconsider after his display against them in the epic Champions League quarter-final second leg at the Bernabeu. 3) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – 4530 minutes There is a school of thought that he isn’t quite as good since his injury problems. This may well be true, which really says a lot less about the player he is now than it does about how absurdly good he was when he first rocked up at Anfield. Has played 90 minutes of all but two Premier League games this season, sitting out against Newcastle and Spurs with the ‘rona. Liverpool’s cruise to the Champions League semi-finals has meant that’s the competition where he’s been able to have a small amount of rest, sitting out the final two group games and the second leg of the quarter-final against Benfica.  2) Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) – 4575 minutes It’s now over a month since Salah’s last goal for Liverpool, during which time he’s also suffered laser-affected World Cup qualification penalty heartbreak to pile on his AFCON penalty heartbreak. He wouldn’t be human if he isn’t a bit knackered and affected by it all, and the evidence of the slight drop in level from the absurd standard he’s set for most of the season is undeniable. The Mailbox is currently fighting over when and whether he should be dropped/rested as Liverpool continue their exhausting yet sensational pursuit of history.  1) Tomas Soucek (West Ham) – 4636 minutes But not even Salah can compete with Soucek for workload this season. The Czech midfielder has missed just four West Ham games all season, which would be striking in a normal West Ham season and never mind one that’s included a run to the semi-finals of the Europa League. Hasn’t missed a minute of Premier League action since mid-January, and you do wonder whether that might have to change as the Hammers’ priority shifts ever more towards European glory.  ",positive
616,https://www.football365.com/news/no-hiding-loftus-cheeks-talent-as-sub-proves-chelsea-match-winner,No hiding Loftus-Cheek’s talent as sub proves Chelsea match-winner,"A “way overdue” first Chelsea goal for three years in a match in which he was the clear point of difference between the two sides marks perhaps the most significant individual moment yet in the ongoing and rather wonderful Ruben Loftus-Cheek renaissance. From key member of England’s World Cup semi-finalists four years ago, it has been a tough road for the midfielder who has found himself in turn out of favour, injured or out of loan and always striving to rediscover the levels everyone – not least himself – knew he was capable of reaching. He has, in the post-match words of his manager, “hidden his talent” for much of his career, but here a driving forward-thinking midfield performance from the bench grabbed hold of a game that Chelsea had – perhaps inevitably – and that – also unsurprisingly – Crystal Palace were successfully keeping tight and cagey. In hindsight, Palace will wonder whether they should have done more to put Chelsea under even greater pressure in that first 45 minutes but it’s hard to argue with a strategy based on dragging Chelsea as far as possible into a tight game to test the physical and mental wounds of those 180 minutes in Madrid. It’s a gameplan that was working well in the first half and only started to change when an injury to Mateo Kovacic forced Thomas Tuchel into an early change and the introduction of Loftus-Cheek. It was a key moment in the match. Tellingly, Loftus-Cheek’s presence on the bench rather than in the starting XI was because of his exertions at Southampton and Madrid rather than any comment on his quality. All else being equal he would surely have started, and it was a different game after his introduction. With Mason Mount continuing his own recent good form post-haircut by coolly netting the nerve-settling second, Chelsea’s progress to a third consecutively FA Cup final was largely down to two of their own. They lost both those cup finals and to avoid an unwanted hat-trick will have to do what they couldn’t quite manage in what was surely the closest League Cup final ever played and get the better of a Liverpool side absolutely flying right now. Whatever happens between now and that game, Liverpool will surely begin favourites. But Chelsea pushed them as close as you can push a side without beating them in the minor final and will almost certainly have the advantage of hitting that final as the fresher side. Their grip on third was already vice-like but has strengthened without them playing a Premier League game this weekend thanks to Spurs and Arsenal contriving to make a complete Spurs and Arsenal of things against Brighton and Southampton respectively. Chelsea can afford to rest and rotate through the remainder of their league campaign. Liverpool, fighting both City and a brutal fixture list for the title as well as being in the Champions League semi-finals will have no such luxury. Clearly, given the choice, you’d choose Liverpool’s situation and be there fighting for everything. But there’s no denying that Chelsea’s position has its upsides too when looking at this specific final. The irony of that position is that Loftus-Cheek, having fought so hard to get back into the Chelsea team may now find he’s been too successful. He started this game on the bench. In this form, Tuchel will certainly want him in his starting XI against Liverpool, which might mean more bench time over the weeks ahead. There may be frustration at that potential scenario, but it should be minor given the transformation of a career that appeared in danger of drifting away. It could now end with a key role in the latest piece of silverware for Chelsea and potentially a return to Gareth Southgate’s thinking no matter how stacked England’s midfield options may be. There was no hiding Loftus-Cheek’s talent or importance in this Wembley win. ",positive
617,https://www.football365.com/news/gossip-haaland-future-to-be-confirmed-in-the-next-two-weeks,Gossip: Haaland future to be confirmed in the next two weeks…,"We might not have to endure a summer-long transfer saga over Erling Haaland, while Mikel Arteta hasn’t finished clearing out the Arsenal deadwood just yet and Liverpool want but almost certainly won’t get a Barcelona youngster… HAALAND DECISION CLOSE Good news and bad news on Erling Haaland from the Mail, and which it is really depends on where you find yourself in the football world. For most normal, sensible people, the good news is that his move to Manchester City or wherever this summer is unlikely to drag on and bore you to tears all summer. If you are a football website looking for some lovely delicious clicks, the bad news is that his move to Manchester City or wherever this summer is unlikely to drag on and bore everyone to tears all summer. Dortmund chief Sebastian Kehl has said very Germanly and quite intimidatingly: “There is release clause, there is a deadline.” The plan on all sides is to get everything sorted in the next couple of weeks. All for that, frankly. Manchester City do not yet have a deal but are, according to the Mail, increasingly confident of landing their man ahead of your Real Madrids, your Barcelonas and the PSGs of this world. The release clause, at a reported £63m, is clearly not an issue for City and they will cheerfully make Haaland the highest-paid footballer in the land which will also net a hefty windfall for his agent, Mino Raiola, and his dad, former City player Alf-Inge. Bayern Munich, meanwhile, have ruled themselves out of the Haaland race despite their divine right to lay claim to any and all players who excel at Dortmund. Too rich for their blood, says Oliver Kahn (I’m paraphrasing). In semi-related news, they’re in talks to extend Robert Lewandowski’s contract. DIRTY DOZEN Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal clearout appears to have cut the squad quite close to the bone already but the purge is set to continue this summer with up to TWELVE (12) more players leaving the Emirates. Now some – arguably all – might not be particularly missed and/or are out on loan and/or already ex-Gunners to all intents, and presumably it’s going to be balanced out at least a little bit by incomings in a busy summer, but still. Anyway here are the 12 for the chop, according to football.london. Deep breath, and: Bernd Leno, Mohamed Eleny, Alexandre Lacazette, Eddie Nketiah, Alex Runarrson, Hector Bellerin, William Saliba, Pablo Mari, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Lucas Torreira, Matteo Guendouzi and Reiss Nelson. Now we’ll stick our necks out here: not all those 12 will leave. But it’s pretty clear it’s going to be a busy old summer at the Emirates and one they really, really, really need to get right. One potential arrival according to reports this morning could be Lille winger Edon Zhegrova, but Leipzig midfielder Christopher Nkunku is off to Inter instead of Arsenal, it says here. GAVI AND STASIS Barcelona’s current inaction in tying down 17-year-old superstar Gavi to a new deal has put several clubs on alert, with Sport claiming Liverpool are leading the way from Bayern Munich and PSG in a race to do business at his current release clause of 50 million euro. Talks with Barcelona are expected to get going soon, though, and while there is a suggestion that any new deal for Gavi might be lower than previously anticipated, there is still an expectation that a new contract will be reacht to keep him at Barca “barring a major surprise”. Sounds like an agent plant, this one, designed more to kick Barca into life than anything else. ",positive
618,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-leicester-cornered-defeat-newcastle,Leicester cornered once again in defeat at Newcastle,"Leicester find themselves in the slightly odd if not uncommon end-of-season scenario where, with league results now chiefly meaningless, the most irritating moment of their afternoon at Newcastle was not their hosts’ last-gasp winner. The nature of the first goal Leicester conceded will be far more vexing for Brendan Rodgers because that, rather than a dramatic breakaway winner scored thanks to some brilliance from Joe Willock on the left and a lung-busting run forward from Bruno Guimaraes to be in the right place at the right time as the clock ticked past 94 minutes, has graver implications for the remaining matches that do matter. Leicester are in mid-table and are going to remain there. They are also in the Europa Conference semi-finals. There is no doubt about which matches matter most for Leicester over the next six weeks. But they do, irritatingly, still even after this game have eight more league obligations to tick off. There are pros and cons to this situation. On a most basic level, watching and supporting a football team can often be enormously stressful. The possible joy of that stress is what makes it all worthwhile but at the same time it’s nice on a Sunny April Sunday to just be able to watch your team play knowing there is no vast significance to attach to either success or failure. Nice if you win, sure, but it won’t ruin your weekend quite as much as those big games can when you still have something to play for at one end or the other. Newcastle were still just about in that position, and the scenes after that late, late Bruno winner told you that nobody here was yet taking survival for granted. With 37 points, they really can relax now. None of the bottom three are getting to 37, and Everton probably aren’t either given some of their remaining games are being played away from Goodison. All eyes on the summer and whether Eddie Howe’s use of the phrase “new contract for Sean Longstaff” really is code for “Announce Mbappe”. For Leicester, though, an annoying game even before that late goal that mattered far more to Newcastle than it did to them. Because they started really quite well despite the understandable eight changes from Thursday night’s fine comeback in Eindhoven. There was even an early reminder of one of the benefits of Premier League games as elite training sessions; you are that bit freer to try new things. The corner routine that led to the opening goal really was lovely, and it required so many moving parts to all get to the right place at the right team. Against a team that defends corners deep as Newcastle do, it was brutally effective. Three Leicester plays made runs to the six-yard line, dragging defenders with them to leave the penalty spot area unguarded. Ayoze Perez made a run to the near post, and the delivery from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was spot on for him to flick the ball into the path of Ademola Lookman, arriving late into that newly vacated space 12 yards from goal. The choreography even included a Plan B/safety net in the run from Nampalys Mendy towards where Lookman had been on the edge of the box. If the flick went wrong, it may have either broken to him for his own strike at goal, while he was also in position to cut out any possible Newcastle counter. A thing of beauty, brilliantly conceived and spectacularly executed. There were eight Leicester players involved even though only three touched the ball and who knows how many coaches and time on the training ground. Which all only adds to the annoyance of how very, very, stupidly and contrastingly straightforward it was for Newcastle to equalise from a corner of their own 11 minutes later as Bruno capitalised on a Kasper Schmeichel error to stab the ball through the keeper’s legs from close range. More than anything else, the constant concession of goals from set-pieces has derailed Leicester’s league season and left them now focused so utterly on Europe. And with Jose Mourinho’s Roma lying in wait in those semi-finals, you can be certain the miserable old sod has been watching and will be all too happy to exploit that weakness. It may only have been an equaliser in a game that didn’t really matter to Leicester, but it was further evidence of an ongoing problem. It’s done for their domestic season, and could still do likewise in Europe. ",positive
619,https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-city-liverpool-again-repeat-fixture,Man City v Liverpool again? It’s not the first repeat fixture…,"This afternoon Manchester City and Liverpool meet for round two after last week’s 2-2 top-of-the-table Premier League clash. That was a huge game, but it didn’t decisively end either the Quad or the Treble. This one, in the FA Cup, will by definition bring one of those to an end. And the third as yet unconfirmed instalment a month from now would be the Champions League final. Also quite a big game. Three big games, is what we’re saying here. “But what about other teams who’ve played each other a whole bunch of times in quick succession?” we hear you ask. “Are there any interesting such tales in the annals of football history?” Let’s find out. 1998/99: Tottenham and Wimbledon Let’s start with a classic rivalry. We’ve all got our favourite memories of Spurs v Wimbledon, I’m sure. But when the two teams met on the opening day of the season in August 1998 – in itself just a few short summer months on from Jurgen Klinsmann netting four in a relegation-dodging 6-2 win for Spurs at Selhurst Park – nobody could have known that this would turn out to be the first instalment of a six-chapter entry into this great old rivalry. Wimbledon ran out 3-1 winners that day thanks to Robbie Earle and an Efan Ekoku double. But that was as good as it got for the Dons against Spurs, who definitely had the better of the FIVE games the two sides played against each other in the space of a month in early 1999. The first three were played back to back in the space of 12 January days and all ended in draws. Goalless affairs in the league and League Cup semi-final first leg were sandwiched by a 1-1 draw in the FA Cup fourth round. But when January ticked over to February, Spurs took control. They won the FA Cup replay 3-0 at the Lane, officially thanks to Andy Sinton’s early goal followed by a double for Allan Nielsen after the break but we suspect in fact because Wimbledon simply forfeited and didn’t turn up out of sheer boredom. It’s a result that sticks out just too much compared to the others. Spurs then won the second leg of the League Cup semi-final 1-0 (more plausible) and would go on to win the final against Leicester in a cup run now perhaps most topically significant for cutting off at source what was in hindsight the first and perhaps closest ever attempt at the Quadruple. This six-game mini-season stands out specifically in comparison to what’s to follow because we are dealing here with two mid-table sides and it was an all-domestic affair, and for the sheer dizziness of playing five of the matches in such close proximity. We also enjoy the fact that three members of Wimbledon’s back five – Neil Sullivan, Ben Thatcher and Chris Perry joined Spurs soon after in what is either some kind of weird Stockholm Syndrome thing or simply the laziest scouting in football history.  2010/11: Real Madrid and Barcelona Take your pick from a few seasons here, frankly. In less than two years, from April 16 2011 to March 2 2013 there were 16 Clasicos. Although 2011/12 and 2012/13 both featured more Clasicos in all – six apiece (two-legged Spanish Super Cup and Copa Del Rey clashes plus a pair of LaLiga games) – 2010/11 with its mere five gets the nod for containing four in the space of 18 giddy days in April and May 2011 and having Champions League semi-final games in it which I think we can all agree trump Spanish Super Cup games, no offence. At the height of Pep v Jose and Messi v Ronaldo that run started with a 1-1 LaLiga draw in which the two superstars each netted from the spot in a result that helped keep their noses in front in a title race they would go on to win. Real Madrid exacted some measure of revenge four days later with a 1-0 win after extra time in the Copa Del Rey final (ending a bizarre 18-year Real drought in that competition) at the Mestalla thanks to a goal from obviously That Man Again. A week later it was into Champions League semi-final action as That Other Man Again scored twice at the Bernabeu to give Barca a decisive 2-0 first-leg lead they preserved thanks to a 1-1 second-leg draw in which, bizarrely, neither of Those Men Again managed to score. For good measure, the other Clasico that season, which took place all the way back in November and is thus irrelevant, ended in a 5-0 win for Barcelona. A fun stat about the 12 Clasicos that took place across the next two seasons is that not one of them contained a clean sheet for anyone, a run that extended until November 2015 and a 4-0 Barcelona win at the Bernabeu. Things had calmed down since those crazy days of Clasicos every week, though, so that extra two years accounted for only five rather than 15 more Clasicos. A much more sensible number of Clasicos. You can’t have Christmas every week.  2004/05: Liverpool and ChelseaBefore there was Manchester City there was Chelsea. For much of the noughties, it seemed like approximately 74% of all Champions League games were between Liverpool and Chelsea. Liverpool’s memorable 2005 Champions League win against Milan was set up by a 1-0 aggregate win in a cat’s arse tight semi-final against Chelsea in which the only goal came in the early minutes of the second leg at Anfield and very possibly didn’t even cross the line as William Gallas tried, officially in vain, to clear Luis Garcia’s shot. The two also met in the Carling Cup final, won 3-2 after extra-time by Chelsea to give Jose Mourinho his first but not last trophy in English football. The pair then met each other again in each of the following four Champions League seasons, which is far too many games. It even included two games in the group stage after Liverpool, as champions, got into the 2005/6 competition from fifth place in the league as officially a non-English team. Including Community Shields, the two teams met 24 times in five seasons from 2004/05 to 2008/09.  Alex Keble: Liverpool hold the advantage…especially if Firmino plays 2003/04: Chelsea and Arsenal And before there was Liverpool there was Arsenal. The two London rivals met five times in the 2003/04 season, four of those across three competitions between February and April. This was back when Arsenal were still kind of a big deal and going through a whole league season unbeaten. They beat Chelsea 2-1 home and away as part of that, with another 2-1 win in the FA Cup the week before the second of those league victories. Revenge would come for Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals soon after, though. The first leg at Stamford Bridge ended 1-1 before a late Wayne Bridge goal stunned Highbury to send Chelsea to the last four with a 3-2 aggregate victory. The two teams produced a more low-key repeat in the 2017/18 campaign when the Community Shield made up one of five games between the two, including a run of three games – one in the League and a two-legged League Cup semi-final – between January 3 and 24. 2010/11: Chelsea and Manchester United Chelsea do this a lot, it turns out. They also played United five times in the 2012/13 season thanks to an 5-4 Capital One Cup win and an FA Cup tie that went to a replay. We’ll go with 2010/11, though, for a classic run of four games in two months. Chelsea kicked it off with a 2-1 Premier League win in March, but it was all United from there on thanks to a 2-1 league win of their own as they ultimately took the title from nine points from the Blues, after also winning both legs of their Champions League quarter-final three years on from their memorable meeting in the final itself.  2001/02: Chelsea and Tottenham Last one, and it’s Chelsea again. We’re only tacking this on here – we’d already reached five which let’s face it is plenty for this kind of throwaway feature – because of the silliness of the results in their four games against Spurs in January and March 2002. It starts off normally enough in their League Cup semi-final first leg. Chelsea win it 2-1. Very, very standard result that for Chelsea v Spurs at Stamford Bridge. It was then, it would be now, and at literally any time in between. The other three, though. Let’s just rattle through them. Spurs 5-1 Chelsea in the second leg of that semi-final. Then Spurs 0-4 Chelsea in the FA Cup six weeks later, and then Chelsea 4-0 Spurs in the league three days later. This season deserves a mention as well, because they’ve met four times and despite being separated by only one place in the league Chelsea have won all four by an aggregate score of 8-0. ",positive

We’re a bit shocked, to be honest… Sean Dyche’s Burnley departure marks a serious shifting of the Premier League sands. He’d been at Turf Moor just a few months short of a decade, which in Premier League manager years is basically a lifetime. When he took Burnley to the Premier League for the second time in 2016, Jurgen Klopp had been Liverpool manager for less than a year and Pep Guardiola was about to begin his Manchester City reign. It would be a further two-and-a-half years before the next top-flight club would appoint their current manager – Southampton with Ralph Hasenhuttl. Yet now, with eight games to go of a likely doomed relegation battle, Burnley have pulled the trigger. It feels a distinctly Watford move for a club that has always proved so resistant to that kind of short-termism. (As an aside, Dyche’s propensity for managerial longevity is highlighted by the fact that before taking over at Burnley he managed to remain in post for an entire season at Watford, which is essentially witchcraft.) But that near-decade-long reign can’t cloud judgement too much or be justification in and of itself for Dyche to continue. Burnley have won only four matches in the Premier League all season and are likely going down. These are not big ticks against Dyche’s name. Still, though, None of this really makes sense. Not the timing of it and certainly not given the ragtag bunch of current club employees cobbled together to take charge of the West Ham game. First the timing. It feels bizarre for two reasons. It’s too late, surely. And not just too late in the season; it’s also too late in the week. Why now, on Good Friday, two days before a game? If the powers-that-be at Burnley feel change had to happen, then they certainly can’t think they can afford to write off any one of the eight games they have left to try and reel in Everton. Sunday’s opponents West Ham are clearly much better at football than Burnley, but they also go into this game on the back of a Thursday night European away game that was glorious but inevitably both physically and mentally draining. As much as anything, West Ham’s win in Lyon confirmed that the league will play second fiddle for them over the coming weeks. This was certainly a chance for Burnley.  Even if we accept the shaky premise that getting rid of Dyche was the right thing to do, what made it right on Good Friday but not on Monday morning straight after that defeat to Norwich? Dyche is also the third manager this season to lose his job straight after defeat to Norwich. No manager in 2022 has survived losing a Premier League game to Norwich and that’s fair enough, I guess. Perhaps there are two lessons here. Don’t lose to Norwich and don’t make fun of Frank Lampard’s Everton. And then there’s the point in the season. There are just eight games to go, seven at most for an actual new manager after Burnley confirmedUnder-23s coach Mike Jackson would take charge on Sunday, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee. This is the bit that really makes no sense. A squad absolutely steeped in Dycheball will be led by current employees for the first of eight make-or-break games. The new manager – if there even is one – will have absolutely no time to make his own mark on that squad in what is already a deeply unlikely bid to avoid relegation. Unless something dramatic has occurred behind the scenes in the last few days, what do Burnley hope to gain from this decision? A new-manager bounce looks unlikely and it’s hard to conclude that Burnley’s survival chances have improved any for this decision. Even if the plan was to move on from Dyche in the summer, there appears little upside to moving now without a proper plan in place. Even if Burnley were pushing the emergency Big Sam button, we could just about understand the timing of it all. Absent even that, we’re baffled. For all the stability of Dyche’s lengthy reign, this is a club in something of a mess and not as well equipped as you might expect to cope with relegation. There are certainly more doubts about their bouncebackability than for the yo-yos of Norwich and Watford. More may become clear in time, but it’s hard to make a snap assessment that concludes anything other than, given the timing issues and his immediate replacements, Burnley have f***ed this.

621,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-west-ham-lyon-europa-league,Hammers make their mark in an extraordinary European week,"European football has had duller midweeks. After an astonishing quartet of Champions League quarter-final second legs – in which the dullest game on offer was a 3-3 draw – came a Thursday night of absolute nonsense. Leicester had already done their bit in the Conference before West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt and the Europa League proper took centre stage. For West Ham, a quite dizzyingly perfect evening that frankly defies description. Lyon, after an enterprising first 15 minutes, were abysmal but that owed much to the Hammers’ lack of panic in those early moments and gradual but irrevocable seizing of control. In the end, 3-0 did not flatter the visitors who have spent this whole Europa League campaign looking far more seasoned than the European novices they are. They have arguably been the tournament’s standout side from day one and only Frankfurt’s own antics stop this being the tournament’s standout performance. Some commentators were wondering whether missing out on a trip to Barcelona would take the edge off this success. That is to miss the point of what West Ham should be – and are – thinking about here. This is not about a day out against the mighty Barcelona. This is about a chance to do something extraordinary. Something that, with all due respect to Eintracht Frankfurt, just got a whole lot likelier thanks to a pair of astonishing away performances. On the back of this result, West Ham have a truly spectacular chance to win the Europa League. Think what that means. A first trophy for 42 years, for one thing. A second European title, taking them level with Arsenal. A place in next season’s Champions League; if you’re looking for a spurious ‘downer’ on a night as memorable as this one for West Ham then maybe it’s that the current rules mean that elevation to the top table would not come at the expense of the Premier League’s fourth-place finishers which is quite likely to be Spurs. West Ham themselves were firmly in that race until the last few weeks, and in truth it is really the rigours of Thursday-Sunday football that has knocked them out of it as much as anything else. Especially as neither Spurs post-Christmas nor Arsenal at all faced the same burden. In the first half of the season, David Moyes and his team did remarkably well to balance the twin demands of European and domestic football, especially given last season’s league form already represented overachievement and the squad’s general lack of experience at juggling the demands of multiple competitions. Now, though, there is no balance to strike. It’s not just that winning the Europa League constitutes a more glorious, romantic and thrilling passage to Champions League qualification than finishing fourth; it’s that any sober judgement must now constitute it represents by far the most likely way of getting there. Eintracht Frankfurt – by coincidence the team West Ham met in their last European semi-final back in 1976 – are not to be underestimated or written off, but there is no point pretending it is as daunting a prospect as facing even this fallen Barcelona. Get through that and it’s a final against either RB Leipzig or Rangers. It truly is an outstanding opportunity. And this was an outstanding performance. All over the pitch, the Hammers were excellent. Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice were perhaps the standouts as they so often are, but the bargain of bargains Craig Dawson would not be far behind, nor the Czech pair of Tomas Soucek and Vladimir Coufal (players whose previous European experience is perhaps more significant than we realise) and nor would Michail Antonio whose hold-up play was exemplary. This joyous 3-0 romp was also built on the foundations of last week’s hard-earned 1-1 draw on a night when West Ham played the whole second half a man short after Aaron Cresswell’s harsh sending off. They could have lost this tie then. They didn’t, and have now reaped the benefits in spectacular style. It also marks an astonishing night for the Premier League. Two fine away performances from Leicester and the Hammers raise the very real prospect of eight different English clubs reaching European finals in the space of four seasons. That in itself is a feat very nearly as astonishing as tonight’s results in Barcelona and Lyon. ",positive
622,https://www.football365.com/news/leicester-eye-another-magical-storyline-after-psv-comeback,Leicester eye another magical storyline after PSV comeback,"For the first 75 minutes, this looked like being Leicester’s 2021/22 season in microcosm. For the remaining 15 minutes, it was a return to the Leicester miracles of the last six years. It has been a deeply frustrating season at the King Power. After successive Champions League near-misses they have slipped into mid-table. They have suffered hugely debilitating injury problems. They have far too often been their own worst enemies. But this come-from-behind victory at PSV puts them in a European semi-final and gives them every chance of adding yet another chapter to the Foxes’ absurd recent history. And across the 180 minutes – and certainly these 90 – they fully deserved it. They were so close to crashing out, though, thanks to a goal that could only have been more Leicester 2021/22 if someone had twanged a hammy in the process. Youri Tielemans is an excellent player but his slack error that led to the PSV opener is the sort of thing that is just starting to show worrying signs of entering “yet another uncharacteristic error” territory. He did the same thing in the second half and was lucky to get away with it. He could have scuppered the comeback before it began. But in an adventurous second half, boosted by the half-time introductions of Patson Daka and Ademola Lookman, Leicester created a string of chances before finally taking two of them. And fine, well-worked goals they were too. A third substitute, Ayoze Perez, also made a huge difference to the threat of Leicester’s frequent attacks and it was his cutback that James Maddison fired into the roof of the net. It was a tough blow for a PSV side who had gone fully on the defensive and it always felt like a one-brings-two situation. The second goal was even better worked even if it needed right-back Ricardo Pereira to apply the finishing touch after a fine save from Yvon Mvogo to deny Daka. Leicester closed the game out nervelessly from there, and this was a game – and those last 20-odd minutes especially – that reminded you just how good Brendan Rodgers’ side can be when things fall in their favour rather than against them. The biggest thing to fall Leicester’s way, of course, is the very existence of this competition. In previous years, their chaotic and unconvincing group-stage performance in the Europa League would have ended their continental involvement before Christmas. But while this may ‘only’ be the Europa Conference, this was a worthy addition to what is already a vintage midweek of European knockout action. Even in the third-tier competition, this was a reminder that two-legged European football remains an intoxicating brew in the latter stages. This was also a good night for the decision to abolish away goals. I’m still not quite sure where I sit on it. It made for some absurd drama, and it’s capacity to turn defeat into victory with a single goal was certainly a powerful weapon. But I’ve always felt it was also too powerful. Too artificial. There isn’t anything inherently superior about an away goal and it all felt a bit of a contrivance of the sort better left to other, lesser sports. So compelling, though. In the end, after giving it more thought than necessary, the splintered-arse fence-sitting position I settled on was this: it was a silly rule that made no real sporting sense and they were wrong to introduce it, but having done so they were also wrong to get rid of it. Logical? Absolutely not, but then neither was the rule. This felt like exactly the sort of situation it was scrapped for, though. Leicester were demonstrably a better side than PSV but the scoreline didn’t say that. Whether Rodgers would have done so is a different matter, but the equaliser would, in previous years, have been enough to be a winner and could have prompted Leicester to sit back. Instead, having gained the momentum in the tie they roared on for a winner that they merited and got. It was an altogether more satisfactory way for the tie to finish as Leicester celebrated an outright winner. They have an excellent chance on this evidence to turn a first European semi-final into a first European trophy. They should certainly be in ‘fear nobody’ territory in any case. With their attacking players looking so good here tonight and Jamie Vardy closing on a return they can bother anyone. With Wesley Fofana back and as magnificent as he was here, they can shut out anyone if those infuriating individual mistakes can be eradicated. Fofana is crucial in more ways than one, actually. He was so good here that it was impossible not to wonder how different Leicester’s league season might have looked had he not missed so much of it. He is going to be an elite centre-back, and arguably already is. That stuttering mid-table league position is a kind of blessing now, though. There are a possible three games left that matter in Leicester’s season, three games that can put it in club legend alongside 2015/16 and 2020/21. Leicester can and should soft-pedal their way home in the league now. History beckons in UEFA’s newest competition. ",positive
623,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-current-premier-league-mood-rankings-spurs-liverpool,Ranking the current mood at all 20 Premier League clubs,"Spurs were 20th in the last Premier League mood rankings; they are not there anymore. And the Quad is still on but Liverpool sit 3rd. In a way, Spurs’ split-personality leaps up and down this table reflects the truest essence of Spursiness. And also our clear inability to make an instant snap judgement on a player. Dejan Kulusevski, we are very, very sorry… You can revel in the full majesty of our wrongness in the last instalment here… 1. Tottenham (20)When dropping them from third to 20th last time out we admonished ourselves ‘for putting them as high as third a month ago’. We’re not making that mistake again. They go straight to number one because right now they are giddy and frankly unbearable. The last update was written in that period when Spurs’ new signings looked underwhelming – we foolishly said they had been ‘absolutely diddled’ on Dejan Kulusevski based on his ponderous early substitute appearances, a jerk of the knee which has now ruled us out for the season – and they were losing meekly at home to your Wolveses and Southamptons. We noted that their third-place rating in January was based on ‘a decent unbeaten run, favourites to finish fourth, and the at least theoretical prospect of significant improvement to the first team before the month was out’. Turned out that February was a mirage and Spurs are now on another even better run, are definitely favourites to finish fourth, may have made the single most impactful improvement to a starting XI in the history of January Transfer Windows and have seemingly transformed overnight into a peak Conteball outfit. Seven games ago after a defeat to Burnley that seemed to tip Conte over the edge, Spurs had a negative goal difference. It now stands at +19. After the Burnley match, Spurs had 31 goals from 24 games. They’ve scored 25 since then. Yet undoubtedly the most fun part of all this is the sure and certain knowledge they will be 14th when we do it again in six weeks’ time. It is the history of the etc and so on.  2. Brentford (13) ‘Just need to be ever so slightly careful that a generally encouraging first season in the Premier League doesn’t have a needlessly choppy end.’ Done and done. Four wins in five, including back-to-back dismantlings of Chelsea and West Ham mean Brentford have in fact done far more than avoid a difficult end to the season; they’ve ensured an optimistic one. Christian Eriksen has made an obvious and tangible difference – the one defeat in that five-game run was the solitary game he missed – while Ivan Toney has as many Premier League goals this season as Harry Kane.  3. Liverpool (3) Ten Premier League wins in a row ended with a 2-2 draw at Manchester City that at least keeps the title race going. Liverpool do have the tougher run-in, but with one foot firmly in the Champions League semi-finals and the #Quad dream still entirely alive, the mood at Liverpool – who are of course the clear and obvious Neutral’s Choice in the opinion of those who are not – is understandably buoyant. The odds may suggest that a Manchester City Treble remains far more likely than a Liverpool Quadruple, but the vibes say different and here we are concerned only with vibes.  4. Manchester City (1) The grip on the title is significantly looser and the Champions League quarter-final lead over Atletico Madrid slender, but the 2-2 draw against Liverpool – while frustrating – should end up working in their favour more than that of their title rivals. They definitely have the easier run-in on paper, but as any pundit worth his PFM salt will tell you, this game isn’t played on paper. That would be madness. It is played on grass and that is that. Clearly things are not anywhere near crisis point but we can’t shake the notion that City currently look far more likely to chuck in a random 0-0 draw against a no-mark than Liverpool are.  5. Newcastle (4) Defeats at Chelsea and especially Spurs served as a reminder that Newcastle still have a long way to travel to get where they want to be, but any lingering fears of relegation were squashed by a timely win over Wolves and the mood remains understandably upbeat for those Newcastle fans able to apply barcode-striped blinkers to avoid paying any attention to what is happening at Chelsea. Leopards will never eat Newcastle’s face. ""I think it's right what the government have done, yeah."" 🇷🇺 ""It's just sour grapes, that's all it is."" 🇸🇦 This Newcastle fan agrees with sanctions against Roman Abramovich, but has no concerns over Newcastle's Saudi ownership 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/1MNXogkFHB — FootballJOE (@FootballJOE) March 13, 2022   6. West Ham (2) A drop-off as it all threatens to end in an exhausted whimper but still, what a season. A European quarter-final (at least) is a huge achievement, as was continuing last campaign’s league overachievement for so long despite the strains of Thursday-Sunday action that better-resourced local rivals Arsenal and Spurs didn’t have to contend with in the run-in. Or at all in Arsenal’s case.  7. Crystal Palace (11) An absolute testament to the power of vibes. Accrued their Premier League points last season at 1.16 per game and this season so far at 1.19 per game but the whole mood of the place is so much brighter. And you know what? Fair enough. Palace have gone from a humdrum mid-table side to a very exciting and fun mid-table side and that is absolutely worth something. Tangibly, it’s worth an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea which definitely isn’t nothing. The floor remains the same, but the ceiling is certainly higher now. And the spanking they gave Arsenal really was fun.  8. Brighton (6) A horror run was partially halted by a classically Brighton goalless draw against Norwich before a law-of-averages win at Arsenal really lifted the mood. They were probably already safe but it was still a much-needed win, not least to avoid the prospect of bad vibes spilling into next season because they still have five of the top eight to play in their seven remaining games.  9. Chelsea (2) A lot has happened since these last rankings. On the field they have endured the most painful Champions League exit imaginable: a piss-poor home performance that appeared to leave them doomed followed up with two-legged football’s cruellest trick, the heroic but ultimately futile away win. For five gloriously improbable minutes, Chelsea were 3-0 up at the Bernabeu and going through. Then came some genuine wizardry from Luka Modric and it all went wrong again. It is the most agonising exit possible from the position they were in after the first leg, but there will be plenty of pride to go with the endless ‘what ifs’ offered up by 180 absurd minutes. But whatever the on-field drama we can’t ignore the elephant sat in the corner. The news circus has moved on for now, but at some point it will roll back around to what is actually going to happen to Chelsea this summer and beyond. It could still be seismic and means that a team pretty much guaranteed to finish third whose last two games have been a 6-0 league win and a glorious (albeit futile) victory at the Bernabeu, and who have a cracking chance of winning the FA Cup have to sit in mid-table here. Even basement dwellers Norwich don’t face an existential threat to their very being and those things tend to be a bit of a downer.   10. Leicester (16) Premier League form has turned around at the precise point it ceased to matter with four wins and a draw at Old Trafford in their last six games, but the season now hinges on Thursday night’s Europa Conference clash with PSV. If that goes wrong – and it’s currently goalless after the first leg at the King Power – then the last month and a bit of the campaign potentially becomes an exhausting box-ticking exercise as the Foxes cram nine chiefly pointless matches into 36 days. Beat PSV and the vibes are better but the fixture congestion even more pronounced, albeit with something real to aim for. Shut up, the Europa Conference is real.  11. Wolves (10) They are going to finish eighth. That is very, very decent and absolutely everyone involved should be happy enough with that result. But it’s hard to get too excited about it either way if we’re honest with ourselves. A couple of quite silly defeats – most notably the Leeds debacle – have cost them a chance to shoot for something slightly higher than eighth, and that has to rankle a tiny bit no matter how much overall season objectives have been comfortably met.  12. Aston Villa (7) Steven Gerrard now has a worse win percentage as Villa boss than Frank Lampard does at Everton, and you have to say that’s quite funny. West Ham, Arsenal, Wolves, Spurs – four of the top eight – is a nasty little run of fixtures but you’d expect to pick up a point or three somewhere along the way. Especially on the back of three straight wins with nine goals scored and none conceded immediately prior to that. Showed enough in the first half against Spurs that the inevitable step down in standard that now follows could see a swift return to winning ways, but they do also still have to play Manchester City and Liverpool. Indeed, while the remainder of Aston Villa’s season is of little consequence to them – could be ninth, could be 14th but it’s all mid-table at the end of the day – they might have a big hand in the interesting bits at the top and the bottom. As well as the two title-chasers they also still have a game left at home to Norwich and two against Burnley.  13. Southampton (8) Very possibly our favourite Premier League club. For a mid-table perennial they are capable of the most absurd highs and catastrophic lows. Their very best is top-six standard; their worst pure relegation fodder. We lurch constantly from thinking Ralph Hasenhuttl should be at a bigger club to wondering how he’s still in a job after another twatting. In January and February, they picked up 11 points from a five-game run that included Tottenham and both Manchester clubs. Since then, one point from a five-game run that included Newcastle, Watford and Leeds. And the real bad news for Saints fans is that, despite 4-0 and 6-0 thrashings in that current forlorn run we still await this year’s mandatory 9-0 defeat. In unrelated news, they also still have to play Liverpool.   14. Everton (12) Surely below even Manchester United after the Burnley game but that was 90 minutes to stir the soul and certainly merits swapping the two clubs around and then some. Still think Lampard is a bad Tory fraud, but he’s now quite likely to achieve the bare minimum in this first half-season at Everton and for that we will give him the most grudging respect if we absolutely must. We are incredibly annoyed that his win percentage is better than Gerrard’s. Everton fans are still entitled to think that scrambling clear of a relegation fight they had no business being in merits relief rather than celebration and the mood could not exactly be described as buoyant.  15. Leeds (14) To be honest, I was struggling to put into words the curious case of Leeds, where results have certainly improved since Marcelo Bielsa left but the vibes have not. Luckily, Ian King has done it for me. It’s a fascinating battle between the head and the heart and, in a curious way, it’s quite joyous and life-affirming to see the heart apparently win out. Whether that’s despite or because Leeds fans are still a bit miserable is up for you to judge.  16. Arsenal (9)Certainly went far higher than ninth in the interim period between our arbitrary updating of these arbitrary rankings. Now far lower after what had appeared to be admirably stoic calm in swerving the January bedlam now seems to have been a monumental gamble that has backfired. The lines are fine in elite football, and even more so in the ethereal world of vibes. A team with Arsenal’s resources that had no European distractions and got knocked out of the FA Cup in round three have no business looking spent in April. A clear advantage in the top-four race is now a tangible deficit after grim successive defeats to Palace and Brighton, and they still have to play Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham and Tottenham in their eight remaining games.  17. Norwich (15) Going down with more of a fight than they managed two years ago and, most importantly, appear in precisely the right place to launch next year’s inevitable promotion push. There appears to be some acceptance that this is how life is now for Norwich. There are worse ways to be, I suppose.  18. Watford (17) Still going down, still chucking in the odd really striking result – almost all away from home as well – amid some absolute churning shod. They have, for instance, lost five of their last seven games and conceded 16 goals in those defeats. The other two games have produced a win at Southampton and goalless draw at Manchester United. Talking of Manchester United, they were also the last team to emerge from Vicarage Road without the three points. The Hornets have lost nine straight league games at home since spanking United 4-1. It’s almost like they’re a team deliberately designed to anger and confuse. And so are Watford wahaaaaay.  19. Burnley (18)We enjoyed Sean Dyche’s “They don’t know how to win” jab at Everton immensely, but in hindsight it was a premature take in the heat of the moment that always had the potential to bite him upon the bum. However bad Everton have been, Burnley had still recorded only their fifth league win of the season. They’re hardly relentless winning machines themselves. Sure enough, a win for Everton against Manchester United and defeat for Burnley at Norwich later, and the whole momentum of the relegation fight has shifted. Not for the first time in these rankings, we see the truth of how hope rather than despair is the cruellest emotion. Burnley fans had been expecting relegation for a while now, but were then shown a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel once again only for it to be extinguished by f***ing Norwich. That’s got to hurt.  20. Manchester United (16) Fans are apparently planning a protest ahead of the Norwich game, which still appears to be going ahead despite United being handed a timely boost in their top-four hopes.

624,https://www.football365.com/news/gossip-pogba-deal-sparks-manchester-united-mutiny,Gossip: Pogba deal sparks Manchester United mutiny,"The back pages are mainly concerned with Chelsea’s effort in Madrid, but there’s still some transfer gossip there. It’s got Paul Pogba in, if that helps… POG OFF Whisper it but the front pages are arguably more interesting than the back ones today, but hidden among the coverage of Chelsea’s heroic failure in Madrid there are still some odds and sods of the hot, hot transfer chat you lot just can’t get enough of. Look, there’s even some Paul Pogba stuff in the Mirror. You always like that. If it wasn’t so damned early in the morning we could probably even conjure up a clever bit of bait-and-switch business about the often-ineffective, opinion-dividing star with his famous hair and tie it in to those front pages. We’re not doing that, but just imagine we did. That would have been some good stuff right there, eh? Anyway, according to the Mirror’s “senior United source” there is going to be a mutiny in the squad if he doesn’t find another club to muck about this summer and instead signs the half-a-mill-a-week contract on the table to become United’s highest-paid player. There will be “fury” apparently, because “he plays so infrequently and has no qualms about criticising the club”. According to the source who is definitely a real person who said these exact words unprompted: “Some of the players think it’s out of order he could be getting twice as much as they are when he hardly starts a game and talks about leaving all the time.” That new deal includes a basic wage of £400k, with add-ons tipping it over the half-million mark and above your Ronaldos (£450k) and De Geas (£375k). Good luck, Erik Ten Hag anyway.  NO BALE OUT Wales boss Robert Page has confirmed Gareth Bale will sign on… somewhere if Wales qualify for the World Cup. His Real Madrid deal runs out in the summer and it’s fair to say he won’t be getting a new one, but with Wales tantalisingly close to qualification for the winter World Cup, Bale will still be playing club football for someone if only to keep himself in nick for November and December. That’s The Sun’s angle anyway, and they might be losing their touch here, to be honest, because a) the more interesting reading of Page’s quotes is arguably that Bale really could quit football at 32 if Wales don’t qualify for Qatar and b) they can’t even be bothered with a bit of wild speculation about where he might end up in the summer. You’d imagine the Madrid “parasite” still wouldn’t be short of offers and as long as he can find somewhere with a training ground close to a golf course you’d like to think something could be worked out. Banter flags aside, it’d be a shame to lose him entirely to the world’s worst sport, really.  BUZZ AROUND BEES STAR Christian Eriksen’s return to elite football with Brentford was already one of the most uncomplicatedly good-news stories in sport before he proved he still has what it takes to play at this level and now attention turns inevitably if grubbily to what happens next. He only signed a six-month deal at Brentford, who have won all four of the games he’s started in the Premier League and only six of the other 28 and, while Thomas Frank says an extension is “realistic” there is inevitably plenty of other interest given the way Eriksen’s comeback has gone. 90min have done the job of going through all the current interested parties and state that Eriksen’s wage demands are nothing like the six-figure contracts he was on at Spurs and Inter. The Dane apparently is well up for staying in England and Spurs are, inevitably, touted as an option although the “manner of his departure” could be a barrier to that reunion. Our opinion is, it wouldn’t be, but we’ll see. If not Brentford or Spurs then it could be – deep breath – Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Everton, Newcastle, West Ham or Fulham once their promotion is confirmed. So almost half the league, then.

625,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-aston-villa-steven-gerrard-wrong-trajectory-together,Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together,"Aston Villa ended their losing run at Leicester City, but the appointment of Steven Gerrard is starting to feel like it suits neither party. A goalless draw at Leicester was never going to set many hearts a-flutter, but Steven Gerrard could be forgiven for wiping his brow come the end of 90 pretty uninteresting minutes. This was a result that ended a run of four consecutive defeats, and with Aston Villa still not mathematically certain of avoiding relegation, ending that run was essential. There are no need for panic stations at Villa Park just yet. They are eight points above third-bottom Everton with six games to play and have a game in hand over most of the teams below them; it’s likely that even the 37 points that they have already claimed will be enough to keep them up. But focusing on their survival is to miss the point about Aston Villa’s season. This season wasn’t meant to be like this. This was meant to be the year that Villa pushed on towards a return to European football, on the 40th anniversary of the club’s greatest achievement. And despite spending considerable amounts of money over the last couple of years and changing their manager in November – when they were 16th and two points above the bottom three – there can be little question that they have stalled. All of this throws a spanner in the works of the career trajectory of Steven Gerrard. His appointment into the Aston Villa job following his success in Scotland with Rangers was seen as a stepping stone to an inevitable return to Anfield. Not only is this somewhat insulting to Aston Villa – who, let us not forget, are former European champions and founder members of the Football League: a grand club in their own right – but it also placed Villa supporters in a somewhat invidious position. Even if Gerrard out-performed expectations, speculation would only rise that this accession would be accelerated. There would be a growing perception, if successful, that he’d become ‘Liverpool’s Next Manager’ rather than ‘Aston Villa’s Manager’, and if unsuccessful…well, it would all be a question of how unsuccessful he might be. Gerrard arrived at Villa Park untested as a manager anywhere but the SPFL; no-one really knew how this particular managerial appointment might work out. Gerrard did land on his feet at Villa Park, with four wins from his first six games in charge, but since then Aston Villa have won just four out of 15 league matches, with three of those wins coming in two thrilling weeks at the end of February, when they won three straight games, scoring nine and conceding none. This bolt of lightning hinted at the promise within this squad of players, but Villa didn’t kick on from this run and find themselves pretty much back where they were when he was appointed, albeit with a bigger buffer against relegation.  Villa’s squad has plenty of talent, and one name that stands out is that of Emi Buendia. The Argentine signed from Norwich City in June 2021 for what was reported as a club record £38m. He has made 29 appearances in the Premier League for Villa this season, but ten of these have come from the bench, and he’s scored just two goals. He seems to be somewhat sidelined by Phillipe Coutinho and, although Coutinho hit the ground running at Villa Park, he has come to underwhelm in more games than is comfortable. Gerrard played with Coutinho at Liverpool, and while this may have had benefits in terms of the manager understanding this particular player, it also raises the question of whether he may be showing too much loyalty to a former team-mate. Even overlooking the slim possibility of them getting dragged back into a relegation scrap, Aston Villa still have something to play for this season. Momentum can be vital for the psychology of a team, and finishing the season on as close to a high as possible – and it should be taken into account at this point that their last four games see them play both Liverpool and Manchester City – can instil a sense of forward momentum to see them through to the start of next season on the front foot. Keeping the players mentally away from the beach is a skill that Gerrard may need to demonstrate over the coming weeks. Having managed to keep Rangers unbeaten all season after they won the Scottish Premiership on March 7, there are some grounds for optimism that he may be able to keep the players’ minds from wandering too far. But it doesn’t exactly feel as though Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard is working out particularly well for either party. Villa are one place better off than they were when they sacked Dean Smith, and Gerrard’s eight wins from 21 Premier League matches is hardly the return they were expecting from a manager who, just months earlier, had managed the achievement – yes, even in Scotland – of going an entire league season unbeaten. Gerrard, meanwhile, might wonder whether his ultimate Liverpool ambitions might have been better served by going somewhere other than the shark-infested waters of the middle of the Premier League, where it’s easy for hard-earned reputations to turn to dust. It doesn’t look likely that Steven Gerrard will be the Liverpool manager to follow Jurgen Klopp and, while such an ambition may have been a little lofty in the first place, this is clearly not where Gerrard himself wanted to be by this juncture of his tenure at Villa Park. None of this is to say that he should just be sacked at the end of the season; not every reaction to unwelcome results on the pitch has to involve a jerking of the knee. Change is possible. Phillipe Coutinho’s loan spell with the club is coming to an end, and it seems unlikely that the club will be pressing too hard to make the move permanent, especially as they’re only paying 25% of his gargantuan wages while he remains on loan from Barcelona. Newcastle may be interested, because of course they are. But change at Villa Park is also necessary, because Aston Villa’s current league position is doing neither the club nor its manager much good.

626,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-liverpool-chelsea-16-conclusions-league-cup-final-klopp-tuchel-kepa,16 Conclusions on Liverpool beating Chelsea in the League Cup final,"Liverpool and Chelsea produced a quite brilliant League Cup final before Kepa Arrizabalaga stepped in and notched up the entertainment factor. 1) Whoever chooses to pore over the refereeing decisions in forensic detail and debate the complexities of VAR for more than a cursory moment after watching those 120 minutesplus penalties is obviously welcome to. Naby Keita could have been sent off; it was peculiar but crucially not unprecedented to rule out Joel Matip’s goal; the justification for disallowing Romelu Lukaku’s became less clear with each replay; offsides should be flagged sooner. Yet if any of that is the focus of analysis for longer than a fleeting second, if time is wasted discussing shirt sleeves and misinterpreting the game’s laws instead of revelling in the entertainment and gorging on the quality, there must bean acceptance that we are part of the problem. Don’t fall into the usual trap. This final was naturally brilliant enough not to have to manufacture any reaction other than giddy enjoyment at the sport being played at its highest possible level and loftiest emotional plane.  2) It turns out that Carabao does six flavours: the mysterious Original, the dubious sugar free Original, Green Apple, Mixed Berry, Orange Blast and Narrative. Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted for a penalty shootout in this competition’s final three years ago. He was more than willing to close the loop by making a triumphant entrance in the 119th minute at Wembley against Liverpool. On both occasions he wanted his chance to become the hero; in both instances he lived long enough to become, if not the villain, then the subject of ridicule. Kepa saved one of Manchester City’s penalties in the 2019 final. That is often forgotten. The Spaniard kept out Leroy Sane to bring Chelsea level, only for David Luiz to immediately squander that psychological advantage. He made no such positive impact in 2022, only really getting close to Ibrahima Konate’s spot kick before squaring his own into the exosphere. After 21 perfect penalties, Kepa was the first to err, transforming his story from sympathy at being harshly overlooked to a sort of Willy Caballero-centric schadenfreude. The situation in 2019 was a key factor in Kepa’s eventual demotion from Chelsea starter to back-up. Many speculated that it could be the end of his Stamford Bridge career but he carved out a compelling niche as useful understudy. This feels entirely more critical to his long-term hopes at the club. There is no coming back from this one.  3) Thomas Tuchel will be similarly chastised for his decision to remove the sensational Edouard Mendy and introduce Kepa for the impending 12-yard drama. The only certainty from that point was outcome bias: it would be either a masterful or disastrous decision, dependent entirely on whether Chelsea won or lost. There would be no room for nuance or middle ground. Kepa is better at saving penalties than Mendy. That is provable not only through anecdotal evidence but the numbers themselves. Chelsea had won their last three shootouts, each with Kepa in goal. The previous two occurred in this year’s League Cup en route to the final; the other was in last August’s Super Cup, when he replaced Mendy after 119 minutes. Tuchel would have been stupid to ignore those signs on the basis of vibes.  4) But football is stupid. Footballisvibes. Mendy had played so phenomenally well until that point that keeping him on and feeding that sense of invincibility must have been a serious consideration. Tuchel’s initial call to pick Mendy from the start was spectacularly justified. The vindicating moment was not as instantaneous as Jurgen Klopp’s in a similar position as Liverpool took until the half-hour mark to manage their first shot on target. It was followed immediately by a second. Mendy pawed Keita’s long-range effort into the path of the lurking Sadio Mane, with the Chelsea keeper conjuring a follow-up save that 2005 Jerzy Dudek would consider farfetched. That's the most accurate depiction of *that* goalkeeping drill I've ever seen in an actual game. — Football365 (@F365) February 27, 2022  Mendy was not content with that. He rushed out quickly to foil Mane early in the second half, atoned for his own poor kick by saving from Luis Diaz, dragged Chelsea through and kept out Virgil van Dijk as extra-time beckoned, inspiring a determined team defensive performance. The plan to bring on Kepa was clearly premeditated but it would have been made without that sort of display in mind. Mendy looked and surely felt unbeatable; facing him from 12 yards after failing to beat him from any distance might have unsettled at least one Liverpool player, which is all Chelsea ended up needing. Tuchel might look back and think he should have lived in the moment.  5) That furore will overshadow the winners, much as it did when Manchester City kept their own quadruple hopes alive in late February 2019. The Champions League hurdle was their solitary failure then; talk will inevitably turn to whether Liverpool can go one better now. They remain second favourites for the Premier League and one of the leaders in busy fields for the Champions League and FA Cup. Not until March and April are safely navigated should a four-trophy haul even be seriously spoken of at Anfield. But there is an undeniable sense of a team gathering momentum and harnessing that thirst for victory that was lost last year. A first domestic cup in England for Klopp edges his collection to near-completion, which ain’t half bad when you consider his first press conference as manager including a “pretty sure” promise to win one trophy in four years. Five in seven is decent. Most importantly, he doesn’t look even close to finishing.  6)For all their philosophical, educational and national similarities as counter-pressing German coaches from the schools of Ralf and Mainz, Klopp and Tuchel bore one key difference in their starting line-ups. The latter allowed his goalkeeping situation to fester to the extent that Kepa reportedly felt ‘owed’ a start in place of Mendy, if stories from earlier this week were to be believed. The former favoured complete clarity over his choice, stating in no uncertain terms soon after the semi-final victory over Arsenal that Caiomhin Kelleher would start at Wembley. The Irishman was the hero in a quarter-final penalty shootout against Leicester, played against Chelsea in the Premier League last month and had only lost two games for Liverpool before: at home to Brighton last February and in that League Cup mauling by Aston Villa in December 2019. He had earned his chance in this meritocracy. These selection decisions are always judged in hindsight, particularly in the case of rotating goalkeepers for cup competitions. If they play well, it is genius man and squad management. But any mistake immediately renders it an unnecessary risk with silverware at stake. Fortunately for Kelleher and Klopp, those nerves were settled quickly. He produced a fine one-handed save from Christian Pulisic after six minutes, aided by supreme positioning. Many of Chelsea’s other chances rendered the Irishman effectively moot, a background prop in Chelsea’s profligate play, but his anticipation forced Kai Havertz into shooting wide from a delayed offside, while Pulisic was kept out again in the first half. Mason Mount, minutes after a quickly-taken effort left Kelleher rooted but hit the post, was then thwarted well in the second, before an excellent stoppage-time block from Romelu Lukaku’s deft flick. The clinching penalty was an added bonus as Klopp trusted heart over head and was rewarded with a glorious game from the 23-year-old.  7) Klopp certainly walks the walk in that regard, giving players a chance to repay his ultimate faith on the grandest stages. Luis Diaz’s fourth start since signing was a cup final in which he thrilled and thrived. Harvey Elliott went from matchday squad exclusion to dispatching one of the better penalties. James Milner had a shot within two minutes of coming on – and scored the first spot kick – because he understood the assignment of a wonderful match. Milner improved on his proud record of being the only player to feature in every Liverpool final under Klopp. Jordan Henderson missed the 2016 Europa League final and Divock Origi never came on against Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League. All three were on the pitch in the League Cup final defeat on penalties to Manchester City in 2016. Few would have said then that they would be cogs in a trophy-winning machine six years later. But Klopp knows how to recognise loyalty when it matters most. I'm no Klopp but at this point i'd have put Origi on and let nature take its course — James Yorke (@jair1970) February 27, 2022   8)The loss of Thiago, injured in the build-up, frames Liverpool’s subsequent performance even more favourably. Those intricate pre-match preparations were always liable to falter when built upon the Spaniard’s frail brilliance. Keita was called in on short notice but left his mark on little more than Trevoh Chalobah’s thigh: the Guinean had one shot, created no chances, completed no dribbles and made no tackles after coming in cold and proving to be the ultimate bystander. Thiago’s absence meant that mouth-watering midfield meeting with Mateo Kovacic was snatched away. It would have been a technical masterpiece, although the Croatian maximised the opportunity to impress alone. He was involved in the early Pulisic chance, snapped into every second ball with unerring effectiveness and was the architect of three fine moves: one with an inch-perfect slide-rule ball; another with a great tackle on Mane and instant pass upfield; and finally clipping over the Liverpool defence for one of those 427 offside goals. His passing is phenomenal and the defensive work is underrated, but perhaps most impressive of Kovacic’s many attributes is his press resistance. As Liverpool started to assert themselves more after a shaky start to the first half, the Chelsea midfielder found himself in the centre circle with two forwards bearing down on him. Kovacic slipped yet still retained possession, forcing it back to Marcos Alonso on the ground. No player was fouled more often; Liverpool knew full well who makes Chelsea tick.  9) The most striking thing about Luis Diaz is how seamlessly he has slotted in at Liverpool. So many of these crucial first-team players experienced a bedding-in period under Klopp: Fabinho and Andy Robertson barely featured at first, while Keita and Takumi Minamino are among those yet to have that moment of enlightenment. Luis Diaz, however, feels like a perfect fit before he has even completed his first month on Merseyside. His understanding with the other components of the front three is already strong, but so too is that grasp of how Liverpool’s defenders tend to work. Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold both have excellent passing ranges that rely on the wide forwards being able to bring 50-yard balls out of the air to instantly face up against a defender. Twice in the first half, Luis Diaz dragged such passes from Van Dijk out of the sky, first with his toe in a move that resulted in a free-kick from a promising position, and second with his chest as part of the attack that produced Mendy’s double save. Luis Diaz was more than a match for the occasion, as well as this team.  10) A consequence of that was a difficult afternoon in parts for Chalobah, who struggled to contain Luis Diaz before Mane switched to the left to try his hand. The Chelsea defender understandably exuded nerves and while he never comfortably established himself, did really well to recover and find his footing. Chalobah ended with three tackles and seven interceptions – both the most of any player – when he could have quite easily succumbed to the pressure that came with Liverpool specifically targeting his side. That penalty at 10-9 summed up Chalobah’s character because for his second Chelsea start since Boxing Day, that was an admirable display.  11) Havertz was Chelsea’s best outfield player, the fulcrum through which pretty much everything flowed in normal time. There is a greater fluidity when he starts as the centre-forward as the attackers can dovetail and defenders need to have the utmost concentration to figure out who or where to mark. Havertz’s movement must be a nightmare to deal with; Van Dijk and Matip would prefer to face Lukaku, even on one of the Belgian’s better days. Havertz set up Pulisic to test Kelleher, laid on that monumental chance for Mount and linked up so well with both throughout. He dropped deep, drifted wide and played whichever role Chelsea required in the moment. The only riddle involved in using him in that position from the start is that he can lack a personal goal threat: Havertz officially had no shots, although two goals were ruled out for offside and another opportunity, when he stepped just beyond Van Dijk, was dinked wide of the post when put through. He improves Chelsea’s overall attack while not quite being potent enough to guarantee his own spot. It’s quite the conundrum for Tuchel, albeit the German should be generally pleased with Havertz’s output in the final.   12) Lukaku had 18 touches in 47 substitutes minutes. Good lad. He actually did look really sharp – even if being ruled offside for his goal because he was pointing to where he wanted Chalobah to pass is proof of some sort of cosmic curse.  13) Mount will perhaps be most grateful for Kepa’s headline-grabbery, such was the costliness of his profligacy. The timing of his runs were impeccable but he seemed to delay the volleyed finish in the first half a fraction too long, then took his next chance in the second quickly when he had more time to get the ball out from under his feet. Those were the instances that cost Chelsea, as well as Pulisic’s early miss in the first half and inability to get to Havertz’s drill across goal just after half-time. The Blues would ordinarily expect to convert at least one of those chances. It encapsulates their issues that Mount has no goals since December 16 yet is their leading Premier League scorer. He is a useful and potentially excellent player but even on Sunday his work off the ball was lacklustre.  14) That wastefulness from Mount and Pulisic was held by some as a key difference between Chelsea and Liverpool: had those chances fallen to Salah or Mane, the stalemate would have been broken. Yet the former missed when put through, his dinked effort spinning wide of the line before Thiago Silva cleared, while the latter was repelled by compatriot Mendy. Mane’s headed miss from Alexander-Arnold’s inswinging cross from deep was pretty egregious, too. Even with the right-back at his creative-but-defensively-suspect apex, Liverpool found no breakthrough That did briefly change in the 67th minute when Matip finished a free-kick routine from a couple of yards, only for Van Dijk to be penalised for blocking Reece James from an offside position. It was notable just how high-quality and well-worked the opportunities for both sides were, with that goalmouth scramble in the first minute of second-half stoppage-time the only exception. Liverpool and Chelsea both restricted each other to massive chances and precious few snapshots. Ten points separate them in the Premier League but they are closer than many might think.  15) The standard of those penalties was preposterous but the sight of Fabinho’s Panenka did lead to some regret that Luis Diaz had been substituted; a no-look penalty in a major tournament final shootout would have been quite something.  16) There will be rumination about the renewed vigour and worth of the League Cup, whose previous managerial runner-up prior to Sunday was Ryan Mason. It has a curious existence – never higher than fourth priority for the elite until the semi-finals at best, yet still out of reach to the rest – but it absolutely does have a place. The idea of scrapping it will never fade, much as the talk about the FA Cup’s magic will linger long after humanity has been destroyed. English football needs the League Cup, though. It simultaneously matters and absolutely does not. The winners can celebrate it as a major honour and tangible proof of success. The losers can deride it as a meaningless Mickey Mouse Cup. It suits everyone, allowing for goalkeepers to be substituted for tactical reasons in a way no other tournament would – save for Louis van Gaal dicking around in a World Cup – while affording both a marker and a springboard for the champion. It had been 612 days since Liverpool last won a trophy; Chelsea’s wait was just over a fortnight. In whatever form the silverware comes, it is a difficult craving to kick but even tougher to satisfy. The Reds have 22 games left to feed that beast – and as unfeasible as it sounds, their form over their last 22 games is 17 wins, four draws and one defeat. This trophy undoubtedly increases Klopp’s legacy at Anfield and while adding three more this season remains incredibly unlikely, it could be the precursor to even more glory. ",positive
627,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-modric-majesty-impossible-ignore-real-madrid-croatia-newcastle,Modric majesty is finally almost impossible to ignore,"Luka Modric has been doubted at almost every step of his magnificent career, but only now is the midfielder being properly appreciated. Every club has them. They can be tiresome and often exaggerated, but sometimes, stories of failed bids for players in years gone by can tell a lot about attitudes. That is certainly the case with the tale of trophy-laden superstar midfielder Luka Modric and Newcastle United, circa 2008. In his most recent autobiography, My Life In Football, Kevin Keegan details his hellish second spell in charge at St James’ Park. He was lured back by the promise of picking up where he’d left off in the 1990s, when he oversaw the most famous group of ‘nearly men’ in modern English football, all the while creating one of the most scintillating teams, backed by a region that treated him and his players like Gods. But the reality this time around, under new owner Mike Ashley, was an elaborate con; Keegan was being used and abused by a regime he would later make proven liars of in court. Months after Modric had helped Croatia stun England by extinguishing their hopes of qualifying for the European Championships, on a pitch at Wembley which Keegan compared to one from the 1970s but claimed the midfielder glided across as if it were a bowling green, he was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League. At 22, he was looking to leave Dinamo Zagreb and take the next step. His price tag was £16m, a drop in the ocean now but a hefty sum 14 years ago. Tottenham were leading the charge. The player’s agent, a self-confessed Keegan fan, instigated the conversation to see if Newcastle would be interested. It was at that meeting where everything went wrong: an Ashley associate and board member, Tony Jimenez, disregarded Modric’s physicality and ability to make the step up in England. It was a tired excuse for the lack of ambition that became Ashley’s staple, but also a wildly ridiculous opinion to hold even then. Modric would go on to Spurs and become a key component in their first-ever Champions League qualification. “He [Modric's agent] hopped on a train to Newcastle and all we had to do was sell the club to him. Mr Jimenez said I’ve watched him, I don’t think he is big enough or strong enough to play in the Premier League. That was the end of that, he killed it stone-dead."" – Keegan (2008) https://t.co/ppGpVRgfkU — Mark (@markbradley1986) April 13, 2022  But Newcastle’s stupidity wasn’t isolated. Outside of north London, Modric was hardly heralded as one of the world’s best, even as he approached what would be called his peak years. There were links to Chelsea and a move to Real Madrid in 2012, when he joined the biggest club on the planet, but as part of Jose Mourinho’s era of evolution. He was seen as a smart but not spectacular signing, certainly not worthy of the sort of fanfare given out to others made under president Florentino Perez, father of the ‘Galactico’ project who created events out of new arrivals and pushed their marketability. After his first season, Modric was inexplicably voted the worst signing any team had made in La Liga. It was a far cry from five years later, when he would be the man to break Lionel Messi and then teammate Cristiano Ronaldo’s Ballon d’Or duopoly. By then, even though his performance levels and role at Real Madrid or with Croatia hadn’t really changed, the appreciation of his role had. Players like Andrea Pirlo and Xavi Hernandez, deep-lying playmakers who controlled the tempo of games, have been given more credence in the past decade or so. But in their cases, both had to wait until they were in their 30s to achieve the acclaim they truly deserved. Modric can be added to the list now. There aren’t many better players to watch, but only in a pure sense; he’s not fast, explosive, flamboyant or exhilarating. Quite the opposite. The way he sees the game and plays it at his own pace, regardless of the context of the match he is playing in, makes him stand out. He proved as much in the World Cup semi final against England where he was the difference maker, and just this week in the Champions League against Chelsea. Timo Werner had scored the goal that was set to put the Blues through to the semi finals. Real and the Santiago Bernabéu were shellshocked, having been 3-1 up from the first leg and coasting. The game was frantic and there was a nervous energy in the air, with all the momentum against the hosts. But Modric, now 36, never changes his approach. N’Golo Kante lost the ball uncharacteristically and it fell to the Croatian with very few obvious options. What happened next was not amazing because of the technique – which is not to be underestimated yet is almost to be expected – but the poise and the intelligence to see the pass with everything he can see working in fast-forward. With a swoop of the outside of his right boot, he bent the ball perfectly onto the toe of the advancing Rodrygo, who scored to take the game into extra-time and reignite the hosts’ hopes. Karim Benzema, another player who, like Modric, has had to wait until his twilight years for fair and just recognition, scored his fourth goal of the tie and 38th of the season to send Los Blancos through and one step closer to a 14th European title. At least it wasn’t too late; Modric will soon retire and his legacy will be written. He deserves the sort of adulation he received on Tuesday night because, unbeknownst to some, he’s been doing that sort of thing for his entire career.  ",positive

They have the League Cup done, and now a Champions League final to go with the FA Cup showpiece. This particular hurdle, though, proved far tougher than anyone could have expected or the final scoreline suggested. With a 2-0 first-leg lead safely in their pockets from Anfield, all Liverpool needed to do in Villarreal – which is, and you won’t hear this in the so-called mainstream media, quite a small place – was avoid disaster. For 45 minutes, they flirted dangerously with just that. Now it does need saying that in those first 45 minutes Unai Emery’s happy-go-lucky ragtag bunch of Premier League rejects were absolutely magnificent. Etienne Capoue, who would end the evening collecting the most ‘head’s gone’ second yellow of all time for a pointless lunge at Curtis Jones, was the best player on the pitch by a frankly absurd margin. He got the assists for both goals, the second scored by another familiar face in Francis Coquelin, and there were heroes in yellow all over the pitch. We’ll state with some confidence now that no current Spurs players will give Liverpool as much gip on Saturday night as Juan Foyth and Giovani Lo Celso did here. The biggest compliment one can pay Villarreal’s first-half performance is this: it made Liverpool feel what pretty much everyone else feels playing against Liverpool. Just a relentless, unending examination where no pass is unpressured or straightforward and no respite is offered. Villarreal could hardly have offered a more different display in those first 45 minutes than the passive side with no answer or apparently plan in the first leg. Yet at three-quarters distance they had got themselves level in the tie and if momentum is a thing then they held all of it.  But for all that Villarreal excellence, and for all that they played with the abandon and courage that was their only possible route out of the almost impossible position they found themselves in, this was all about Liverpool. Most prosaically, a half where Liverpool were really, properly poor. Without caveat or mitigation, they played badly. Yet while there can be no excuse for being quite as ponderously, distractedly crap as they were in that first half, there is plenty for why they weren’t Full Liverpool. A probably inevitable by-produce of trying to achieve what Liverpool are currently trying to achieve is accepting the necessity of certain nights being made more difficult than you would ideally like. When you’re trying to win every competition then, unless you happen to find yourself in a Bayern or PSG position where the league is a formality, you have to take a different approach. Liverpool can’t really afford to drop any Premier League points from here on out, so resting players or dialing down the effort in those games is fraught with risk. Just about the only time you can even potentially do it is in cup competition second legs where you have a handy advantage already. This wasn’t even a new thing in this run. Liverpool have been dominant enough and good enough in the two previous rounds that they haven’t really had to get out of second gear in the home legs against either Inter or Benfica. The results on the night in those games weren’t great, but they served Liverpool’s greater needs. Get the job done, expend as little energy as possible, move on to the next job. That’s what the plan was again here, but Liverpool took it too far and Villarreal far exceeded expectations in that captivating first half. And yet even here there lies justification for Liverpool’s approach. They could hardly have played worse in that opening 45 minutes nor Villarreal better. And yet still Liverpool were able to turn things around without ever really having to hit top gear. The second half was a completely different story to the first, with Villarreal perhaps having committed the cardinal sin of scoring too early; their gameplan simply didn’t seem to have a contingency for wiping out the two-goal deficit as fast as they did. Villarreal came out for the second half with none of the energy of the first, while Liverpool had none of the negative passivity that characterised their opening 45. Liverpool didn’t so much roar back from 2-0 down on the night to win 3-2 as saunter. However much they were helped out by some extremely generous goalkeeping for the actual goals, Liverpool never really seemed in any serious danger from the moment the second half got under way. Villarreal were held at arm’s length and even without clown school netminding you still fancy Liverpool would have got at least one goal somewhere in that second half to get the job done. And that’s what Liverpool are doing right now. They are getting the job done. It isn’t always as thrilling to watch as they are at their absurd best – although their absurd worst in the opening half was quite entertaining in its own way – but right now all that matter is doing enough without leaving yourself too exhausted to do it all again in a few days’ time. They did it tonight, they will probably continue to do so. But there will almost certainly be more scares like this in seemingly unexpected places along the way. ",positive

Then build something better once the ‘elite’ have gone. Look at the Premier League table. The Big Six are the top six. Order is restored. Everything is as it should be. The top three have collectively lost two fewer games than the side in fourth. Since the Premier League arrived, drunk and with money falling out of its pockets, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City or Manchester United have won 28 of 30 league titles and 26 of 30 FA Cups. This is the status quo. All hail the elite. So why the objection to the European Super League? All it does is put the elite in one place. They’re already the elite. We just make them play each other, ad infinitum, and the rest of us can get on with our lives. Is that so bad? If the Big Six were in the ESL West Ham would be fighting it out with Wolves for the league title, except they probably wouldn’t be because everyone would have more of a chance to win more games and the order of the division would be quite different. The league would be less like a pyramid with a sharp point and more like an orange. It would be super competitive, more like the Championship, where anyone really can beat anyone else. Why is that not better than what we’ve got now? And we know that those six club owners want an ESL. Of course they do. It makes business sense to them. They will make more profit and that is all that matters. They know that plenty of the fanbase would be happy enough to be playing some big European teams every week and even those who aren’t would get used to it. Football fans can get used to anything, will put up with anything, will pay for anything. Football fans are mugs. Look at what they already tolerate.  We already know that many fans of clubs are easy to buy off. If they weren’t we wouldn’t be where we are. Fans have welcomed murderous regimes as owners into their clubs, they have welcomed anyone with money, no matter how steeped in sin they are. And you’re telling me that selling them an ESL will be a hard sell? Yer jokin’ aren’t ya? This mob will swallow anything to win a few games of football. In the last 30 years the Premier League has, like the broader economics of society, transformed happiness from being an existential quality into a transactional one: we buy feeling good. In football this is best illustrated by transfer culture which is basically more shopping than football. Only it never makes anyone happy, or not for long. Nor does paying ever more for tickets on the basis you’re watching elite entertainment. But even so, it is the only reality many know and the European Super League is the biggest football shopping mall on earth, what’s more it is only for the elite and we bloody love the elite. We even love just saying the word, elite. Inside you’ll find all the big designer brands who are reassuringly expensive. Yes you pay top dollar but, hey, you want the elite, you pay elite money, right? It makes you feel good. This is where the elite love to be, alongside their other beautiful elite friends, looking elite good, smelling elite great, away from the povs and reminders of their own moral vacuity. This is the direction society has gone in, so why would football be any different? These owners are not stupid. They know where the path to ever bigger money is on the map and they will take it. There is no point in fighting it. OK so we won’t see Spurs be sh*te at home to Brighton, we’ll see them be shite at home to Inter Milan instead. It’s all the same really. The European Super League notion accepts that we live in a greedy, selfish world dominated by a small number of people who have almost all the money. The whole thing is set up to fellate that elite and to glory in that fact. And let’s face it, that is the reality we accept every day of the week in our non-football life, don’t we? We are not fomenting revolution against our landed and monied overlords who have pushed so many into poverty, are we? If we were really against the elite bossing us, we’d be in the streets, we’d be in Downing Street, dragging people out by their feet and putting them on a meat hook, we’d be on the roof of the public school with Malcolm McDowell mowing the bastards down. But, no, we’re happy enough with being bossed by born-to-rule half wits with posh accents and their lackeys and we hate the gobby jumped-up working class, even though they might have a better, more egalitarian outlook. We don’t want that. We want to be told what to do, then be able to moan about it, then vote for it again. We love the elite, that’s why we say the word elite so much. Maybe it makes us feel elite to do so. So why wouldn’t we support the ESL? It fits in perfectly with how we live life already, with what we tolerate, with what we vote for, with what we celebrate and promulgate. There’s the top dogs and there’s the rest. The rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate, God made them, high or lowly and ordered their estate. That’s the nature of modern life and if it doesn’t look bright and beautiful to you, you’re just not drinking enough of the elite kool-aid. There are the elite clubs at the top and then the rest of us living off the fumes from their p*ss. We’ve been told it is the natural order of things for so long that it has become the natural order of things. After all, we keep electing elite people who keep kicking us in the face in the hope that this time it’ll be someone we hate who gets kicked in the face, not us, even though those we think we hate have been sold to us as hate figures by the elite as a deliberate part of a divide and rule policy. The prevailing culture suggests that hanging onto quaint concepts such as club history and club culture and civic pride are for the slow witted and the old fashioned. Get with the programme. This is the world we voted for, this is the world we made happen with our choices, so stop resisting the inevitable. We could’ve made a different world but we didn’t. We’ve doffed our caps and tugged our forelocks for so long now that we know no other way. The elite gets what they want, that’s how it works, so shut up and let the elite clubs have what they want. We’re not going to protest, not really, we never do. We make excuses, we lie to ourselves, we tell each other how loyal we are, how badly done to we are, but then we carry on as normal, shovelling money and power into the hands of the same elite, the same clubs and the wheel keeps turning. No-one ‘saved the Premier League’ as the Chelsea fan’s banner had it, we just got confused about our role in this psychodrama. So don’t just wait for it to happen, let’s call for the start of the ESL now, not to do so is against modernity, is against elitism, is against the very nature of life in 2022. What are we holding out for? We should be embracing this brave new world, telling them to get on with it and quickly, not hanging on to the old one out of nostalgia or out of belief in some sort of alternative narrative which imagines the elite will stop being the elite. Because maybe, just maybe, when we have put the elite clubs behind the velvet rope in the VIP lounge, we can get on making something much, much better without them. ",positive

Scuffles broke out late in the match and in the tunnel as Atletico’s frustrations at their failure to prise open City’s defence boiled over. Man City ‘cool heads’? They lost it against Atletico… UEFA could appoint an ethics and disciplinary inspector to fully investigate what happened, and will await and assess reports on the trouble from the referee and match delegate. City, protecting a 1-0 lead from last week’s first leg, withstood a barrage of pressure, intense provocation from a fired-up Atletico and a hostile atmosphere to reach the semi-finals after a hard-fought goalless draw. The first major flashpoint came late in the game as a melee erupted after Felipe kicked City’s Phil Foden, whose head he had also bloodied in a poor earlier challenge. Amongst the trouble Atletico defender Stefan Savic pulled unused City substitute Jack Grealish’s hair after the pair had exchanged words. Felipe was sent off for his involvement. Everybody needs a teammate who has your back like Oleksandr Zinchenko 😤#UCL pic.twitter.com/kbtFseC2d2 — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 13, 2022 The problems continued after the teams left the field with players needing to be separated in the tunnel. TV footage showed objects being thrown and police reportedly became involved to restore order. There were also suggestions City manager Pep Guardiola had liquid thrown at him as he headed towards the tunnel. Guardiola later said he had “nothing to say” in relation to the trouble but did add that “everyone saw the action”. Guardiola preferred to focus on his side’s rearguard action in the face of ferocious pressure. City did hit the post through Ilkay Gundogan in the first half but spent most of the second period in a rearguard action as Atletico, criticised for their defensive attitude in the first leg, finally upped the tempo. “We defended everything but they had the chances,” said Guardiola. “They did everything. They know this competition and this stadium with their people. Always it is difficult. “That is why it is a big compliment to the players because we have to live these kind of situations. We cannot expect every time, especially in the Champions League with the champions from Spain, we are going to make everything marvellous. “You have to suffer. In part we suffered because we forgot to play but in part we suffered because the opponent was really good.  “When this happens you try to take the ball but you are not able. With the people and chances they had we had no chances to score a goal.” Victory in the bruising tie could also have come at a cost. As well as Foden needing to play with a bandaged head, Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker were both taken off after knocks. City, who are chasing a treble this season, are back in action against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday. “We are in big trouble,” Guardiola said on BT Sport. “We cannot forget we played three days ago a tough game against Liverpool. We came here, we have a lot of injuries. “I don’t know what will happen in the next weeks but today we are going to celebrate.” Action by UEFA would come just days after Atletico were hit with a partial stadium closure for the second leg against City for the “discriminatory behaviour” of their fans during the game in Manchester last week. That punishment was suspended just hours before the match on Wednesday following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ",positive

The Gunners will be in the market for a new striker this summer. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang departed the club in February to join Barcelona. Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette may also leave as both are out of contract this summer. Earlier this week, the latter admitted that he was missing Champions League football. Have Arsenal turned this into a race for two CL places? Morata previously had an unsuccessful spell at Chelsea. He is now contracted to Atletico Madrid but he has been on loan at Juventus since 2020. The 29-year-old has netted eleven goals from his 42 appearances for the Serie A giants this season. Mundo Deportivo (via Sport Witness) are reporting that Morata is one of the attackers Arsenal are looking at. It is also suggested that Atletico Madrid would ‘prefer’ their player to join the Gunners. It is being reported though that Arsenal have ‘encountered a problem’ in their attempts to bring in Morata. This is as the player had a ‘really hard time’ at Chelsea. It’s even said that his spell at the Blues was ‘little short of a nightmare’. Morata is therefore cautious about returning to the Premier League, so this is a ‘barrier’ Arsenal and Atletico will have to move past. Elsewhere,Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has admitted he has been unfair on striker Eddie Nketiah this season. The 22-year-old is out-of-contract at the Emirates this summer and looks set to depart for more regular game time. Arsenal are likely to bring in a new first-choice centre-forward this summer after allowing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to leave in January and Nketiah and Lacazette set to follow soon. Where Nketiah will be next season remains to be seen, although a number of Premier League clubs have reportedly shown interest in the forward. Speaking after the win over Chelsea, Arsenal boss Arteta admitted he should have played the forward more this season. Speaking to the BBC, the Spaniard said: “What Eddie has done tonight is because of what he has done for the last 10 months and no-one has noticed.” “I said to him I haven’t been fair. I should have been playing him more. We have other issues as well and that has not been easy. But he deserved completely what happened to him tonight.” “When you look at him in training and how humble and hungry he is, good things happen to good people. If I’m happy for anyone it is especially him because I know what he has been through,” Arteta told Sky Sports. “The same with [Mohamed] Elneny and Rob Holding. That is why we won the game today. I love the spirit of these players. When you lose matches you get criticised but for these players it is worth it. They are really growing.” ",positive

City won their Champions League quarter-final tie 1-0 on aggregate as Atletico were unable to find a goal at the Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday evening. Manchester City were battered and bruised but came through it In the first-leg, Atletico were heavily criticised for their tactics after failing to have a shot on goal in the whole game. However, it was City, who are widely recognised as one of the best footballing teams in the world, who put in a solid defensive display to progress through to the semi-finals. Now, Atletico president Cezero has slammed City for their approach to the game, labelling their style as ‘prehistoric’. Speaking to Marca (via the Daily Express), Cezero said: “It was a match that, with a bit of luck, would have taken us to the semi-finals. We were not lucky enough to score a goal and reach extra time. “We are a team that has a lot of status so that someone can offend us, and in the end, it has been shown that everyone has their prehistory. “We played a good game, attacking and City yesterday played prehistory, defending and put a wall in front of their goal so they wouldn’t score. Everybody has seen it. City was a completely defensive team. “In the second half they shot on goal once. Yesterday it was shown that each one has their prehistory.” The game was also marred by a number of ugly scenes towards the end of the tie, as players from both sides clashed on the pitch, and then in the tunnel following the final whistle. Atletico’s players have been criticised for their behaviour but former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher believes it has been ‘over the top’. Writing in the Daily Telegraph (quotes via Metro), Carragher said: “If there is one manager in the world I would love to see in the Premier League, it is Diego Simeone. “Simeone was always going to provide City with a physical and emotional challenge they rarely face in England. “The reaction to Atletico’s performance was more over the top than anything they actually did. They were predictably aggressive and did as much as possible to prevent a free-flowing game. “But there were no career-threatening two footed challenges, or incidents that qualify as cheating. “Simeone is box office. Win or lose, he guarantees a post-match debate. The criticism shadowing him and his team today reeks of hypocrisy. Why would anyone wish to sanitise every football game? “Simeone has fashioned a side in his image; warrior-like, edgy, determined to maximise discomfort. No team can play against Atletico without feeling they are going to have to earn their victory. “There are plenty of Premier League clubs who could learn from that.” ",positive

634,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-norwich-citys-yo-yo-status-is-partly-structural-but-theyve-also-made-errors,"Norwich City’s yo-yo status is partly structural, but they’ve also made errors","Norwich City are the first side to be relegated from the Premier League – a result of bad decisions, not learning and a lack of decisiveness. The benefit of hindsight confirms that it was the most temporary of breaks in the cloud. On January 21, Norwich City won 3-0 at Watford. It was their second successive win, following a 2-1 victory against Everton six days earlier, and it lifted them to 17th place in the Premier League table. But less than a week later, Newcastle won 1-0 at Leeds and Norwich were back in the bottom three. They’ve been there ever since, slowly sliding from view. There is a bitter irony to the fact that their relegation should have been confirmed at this particular venue. Last summer, Aston Villa came for Emi Buendia, who’d been the motor behind Norwich’s return to the Premier League last season. Then, following a start to this campaign which felt ominous from the get-go, Dean Smith took over at Carrow Road having been sacked himself by Aston Villa. Add the extra narrative that Smith is Birmingham born and bred as well as a supporter of the club, and perhaps it was inevitable that the numbers would stop adding up for Norwich at Villa Park. These numbers haven’t added up since the summer. Three teams have to fall from the Premier League at the end of each season, and it hasn’t really been possible to see how Norwich wouldn’t be one of them since they kicked off against Liverpool last August. Indeed, even the reaction in some quarters that we should ‘disregard’ their first four fixtures because they were against Liverpool, Manchester City, Leicester and Arsenal carried an air of fatalism about it that has lingered ever since. Fulham and Norwich are opposites trapped in a dangerous cycle They lost those first four fixtures, and then they lost the next two. Then they picked up two goalless draws, and then they conceded seven at Chelsea. Within that run, we can see the roots of their hopelessness. Teams simply didn’t need to be very good to beat them. The Arsenal team that beat them on September 11 was not very good. The two other games they lost in that initial six-game run came against Watford and Everton, neither of whom are very good. Daniel Farke paid for the poor start with his job on the morning after Bonfire Night. Replacing him with Smith seemed fairly sensible in some respects. His dismissal from Villa during the November International Open Season on Managers Break felt a little hasty. Farke was sacked after Norwich’s first league win of the season, while they also won their next game, their first under Smith. They were already so far adrift that eight points from four games didn’t lift them out of the relegation places, but it did at least put them back in touch with the other clubs at the bottom. But this was, ultimately, all a little too much like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic to make much difference. Any new manager bounce was fizzling out within a month of Smith’s arrival and, having spent £70m on new players the previous summer, the club remained inert throughout the January window. They’ve won one league match since, a 2-0 win against a Burnley team who were at the time engaged in the death throes of Sean Dyche’s nine years there.  Norwich have won five Premier League matches all season, and 60% of the managers who have lost to them have lost their jobs the next day. The axe fell on Dyche, following on from Rafa Benitez and Claudio Ranieri in January. That the other two managers to have lost to them this season, Thomas Frank and Ralph Hasenhuttl, are among those who have kept their jobs for the whole of it may also say something about the differences in culture between Norwich, Burnley, Everton and Watford, compared to Brentford and Southampton. It would be an over-simplification to suggest that Norwich’s relegation wasn’t anybody’s ‘fault’. Pre-season was chaotic, and that wasn’t entirely unavoidable, while that £70m worth of recruitment last summer has largely turned out to be money that might as well have been thrown onto a bonfire. The failure to spend money in January may have come about in part as a result of the cancellation of a shirt sponsorship deal with a gambling company following supporter pressure– another sign of an unhappy house. The decision to sack Farke after losing at home to Leeds, eight days prior to them winning their first league match of the season, but then only after that first win, was another self-inflicted wound. Not learning from previous experiences, bad and ill-thought out decisions, and a lack of decisive decision-making at the highest level, then. As a newly-promoted team, Norwich City already faced an uphill battle to survive in the Premier League, as well as a growing feeling outside the club that they seemed ‘happy’ to bounce between these two divisions, no matter how predictable it all became. This irked many associated with the club, but the regrettable fact is that little we’ve seen from them this seasondisproves this notion. Norwich’s relegation should allow them to reset but with a poor culture, lack of identity, low morale, awful agent-led recruitment, squad gaps to plug and a fractured fanbase it’s going to be tough this time. #ncfc — Nick Mashiter (@nickmashiter) April 30, 2022  Two minutes into stoppage-time at Villa Park, Buendia’s reverse pass and touch teed up Danny Ings to score Villa’s second goal of the afternoon and end Norwich’s stay in the Premier League in all bar name. Norwich had sold Buendia to Villa at the start of last summer’s transfer window. Norwich will still have an advantage over those around them back in the Championship thanks to parachute payments. But having all that money is one thing; spending it wisely is something else altogether. Very specific circumstances have meant that match-going Norwich supporters have had a very strange couple of years. Last season there was no-one in the grounds to witness their league title on account of pandemic restrictions. The season prior to that, when the Premier League was suspended in March 2020, Norwich City were bottom of the Premier League. They’d been in the relegation places since October, when they fell to 19th place after losing 5-1 at home to… Aston Villa. In terms of the match-going experience, Norwich fans have been in the relegation places for three games shy of two seasons. Part of this is structural. Premier League clubs get a minimum of £100m from their television contract, while Championship clubs without parachute payments get around £8m. Is it, therefore, any wonder that there is a strata of clubs who now bounce between these two divisions, unable to find a natural home in either? But this only works as a partial defence in the case of Norwich City. Bad decisions have been made at Carrow Road; bad recruiting choices, indecisive behaviour behind the scenes, and occasionally a lack of the very high standards that the modern day Premier League demands. Perhaps this time around they will learn from their mistakes – they can’t afford not to with relegation now signed, sealed and delivered. ",positive
635,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-patched-up-west-ham-arsenal-set-pieces,16 Conclusions: Patched-up and knackered West Ham 1-2 Arsenal set-pieces,"West Ham are deflating after two successive 2-1 home defeats, but Arsenal did just enough to keep the pot boiling for a fourth-place finish. 1) For West Ham United, this season has been as much a question of identity as anything else. Other teams have taken it less than seriously and it might well be argued that they are paying a steep price for committing themselves, but their run to the semi-finals of the Europa League has given West Ham United something to coalesce round this season, and after their fractious move to The London Stadium, this has mattered. But Arsenal at home after their defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in their Europa League semi-final first leg was always going to be a true test. With such a defeat as the Eintracht result, those aches and pains from what has already been a punishing season start to feel all the more pronounced; when you’re running on fumes, it’s best to be going downhill. West Ham had won just one of their previous five, but they remained just three points behind Manchester United for a place in next season’s Europa League, and with Wolves nipping at their heels – three points behind them but with a game in hand, despite their surprise turning over by Brighton – they needed to regain some momentum.  2) With Europe not a consideration, Arsenal arrived at The London Stadium as rested as they could realistically hope to be at this point of the season and fresh off the back of scoring seven goals in their previous two games against Chelsea and Manchester United. Coupled with Spurs’ no-shows in front of goal against Brighton and Brentford, they were back on the front foot in the increasingly undignified race for fourth place, but for all that, Spurs’ 3-1 win against Leicester earlier in the afternoon had served as a reminder that, for all the fatalism coming from up the road, that race isn’t quite over yet.  3) It therefore came as something of a surprise that the first 35 minutes of this match saw West Ham the better team, although it should be added that it was a particularly soporific start from both teams, clumsy and careless, with stray passes aplenty and anguished groans from the crowd as both teams struggled to come to terms with taking control of the game. Where West Ham’s carelessness could perhaps be explained by tiredness or an unfamiliar-looking starting line-up, Arsenal had really no such excuse.  4) But the cost of having that unfamiliar defence did end up costing West Ham, seven minutes from half-time. Eddie Nketiah has been enjoying something of a renaissance in 2022, and he was given ample space to drive in a low shot after 37 minutes which Lukasz Fabianski did well to palm away. It proved to be very temporary respite. From the resulting corner, Rob Holding arrived completely unmarked to thump a header in as the West Ham defence stood idling. This was Holding’s first Premier League goal, and the third of a senior career which has began on loan from Bolton Wanderers at Bury in April 2015.  5) The goal seemed to shake West Ham awake. Aaron Ramsdale’s save from Declan Rice should be lauded as one of the saves of the season, scooping a flicked header out from under the crossbar with lightning reactions and the strength in his hand to force the ball up and over the crossbar, but it might even end up debatable whether this was the save of the day, considering Jordan Pickford’s heroics for Everton against Chelsea earlier on.  6) But it still required a touch of luck to bring West Ham back into the game, right on half-time. Arsenal had looked creaky again since they took the lead, and their sloppiness ended up costing them when Jarrod Bowen (by far their greatest goal threat, with Michail Antonio on the substitutes’ bench) shot past Ramsdale to bring West Ham level. The replay showed the ball had nicked quite substantially off Gabriel’s backside to wrong-foot the goalkeeper, but it was no less than West Ham deserved for keeping the fight going after having fallen behind.  7) Ten minutes into the second half came the moment that would end up determining the destination of the points. Bukayo Saka tried to beat Fabanski at his near post, only for the goalkeeper to beat the ball behind, and from the resulting corner another Arsenal centre-back, this time Gabriel, jumped to head home Martinelli’s cross after Saka’s corner was cleared. West Ham’s Makeshift Defence 0-2 Arsenal’s Centre-backs, both goals from corners. It felt like the costs of being so defensively stretched were playing out in front of us. In open play, a soft defensive underbelly can be masked by packing the midfield and dropping deep, but set-pieces expose that weakness more clearly. There was no challenge of significance to the scorer of either Arsenal goal.  8) West Ham had to weather a storm in the immediate aftermath of the second Arsenal goal, but they did so reasonably effectively and did start to reassert themselves as the second half reached its midway point. Both teams played most of the match in fits and starts, and by the time that we got to the last 20 minutes, everything was starting to go somewhat stale again.    9) Michail Antonio was finally introduced with 20 minutes to play. The decision to play Manuel Lanzini had not been remotely successful; it feels as though he is too similar a player to Said Benrahma for them to both be accommodated on the pitch at the same time, and Lanzini had been missing in action for both of the corners from which Arsenal scored. In truth, both Lanzini and Benrahma looked out of sorts on this particular occasion and Benrahma was also replaced ten minutes later by Andriy Yarmolenko.  10) Arsenal could still threaten on the break, although by the last 20 minutes West Ham were starting to control possession again. But opportunities to kill the game off did still fall for Arsenal. With 17 minutes to play, when Eddie Nketiah got clear and, from a bit of an angle, curled the ball round Fabianski’s out-stretched hand but also a couple of inches wide of the left-hand post too. Six minutes later it happened again: Nketiah, again.  11) But as things turned out, Arsenal didn’t need to worry about what these two missed opportunities – and it is worth pointing out that neither of them were easy – might end up costing them. Antonio never fully settled into the game after coming on, and although West Ham had plenty of the ball throughout the last ten minutes, they didn’t create anything much with it and seldom looked like threatening the Arsenal goal. The match didn’t so much build towards a climax as slowly deflate, with Arsenal seemingly happy to hold onto what they had and West Ham just looking a little too tired to unpick them.  12) There was, at least, time for some undignified pushing and shoving at the end, as Arsenal sought to game their way through stoppage-time. As the clock ticked past 90 minutes Nketiah prevented West Ham from taking a free-kick, earning himself both a yellow card and a sustained lecture from a furious-looking Declan Rice, who had to be restrained by his own team-mates. Rice presumably came through it all feeling as though he’d got his point across, but his inability to wind his neck in did probably cost West Ham a quarter of the four minutes of stoppage-time that had been signalled from the sidelines.  13) This time last year, West Ham United were approaching the end of a run three defeats in four Premier League matches which ultimately torpedoed their chances of qualifying for this season’s Champions League. They finished two points short of Chelsea. One win from those three lost matches against Newcastle, Chelsea and Everton would have seen them climb into fourth place. Two would have seen them finish above Liverpool in third. West Ham have now lost three of their last four Premier League matches at exactly the same time of the season again, and history has repeated itself, with a decent chance of making fourth place having tailed off. Last season, perhaps there was an element of inexperience. This time around, there seems to be an even more obvious culprit: tiredness. This was West Ham’s 52nd competitive game of the season in all competitions. It was Arsenal’s 41st. Small wonder the home side looked increasingly tired as the game progressed; it’s notable that, for all the possession West Ham enjoyed throughout the second half, they only had two shots on goal, neither of which were on target. A combination of that and being just too soft on set-pieces was ultimately enough to see Arsenal back to north London with all three points.  14) And now West Ham have to do it all again, this time back in the Europa League. Their home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their semi-final was not a calamity, but they have left themselves a lot to do in the return match in Germany. And this remains a very, very important match. Not only has this competition given the club a rallying point, but West Ham have not won a major trophy now in 43 years and it represents their last chance of finally nabbing a Champions League place for next season. West Ham now need one last push to have a chance of making the final. The concern is that they do not, even if for reasons that are really beyond their control, look ready for it.  15) This is the point of the season when the style of football matters considerably less than getting points on the board, and Mikel Arteta is fully entitled to not give a damn if his team didn’t rip up any trees in grinding out this win. They remain a young team and their heads aren’t always the coolest, but this is as good a chance as they’ve had of making the Champions League for the first time since 2016, and grinding out results is an artform, one that Arsenal have been missing at crucial points in the season for several years. He’ll be very pleased with how straightforward his defence found it to keep West Ham out, and that they took their set-piece chances efficiently.  16) And the race for fourth place remains as narrow as ever. Arsenal may well lead Spurs by five points by the time the two teams come to play each other at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on May 12, with Spurs facing a daunting-looking trip to Anfield in their next match. If that is the case, a win in the North London Derby would put the matter beyond any doubt at all. Arsenal remain in control of their own destiny for now, and the only question left is this: do they have the nerve to finish the job? On the evidence of this win, they’re plenty capable. ",positive
636,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-uefa-champions-league-festival-of-football-plans-are-another-affront-to-fans,Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters,"UEFA are considering scrapping the semi-finals of the Champions League for a five-day festival. As ever, supporters have not been consulted. Such has been the way in which UEFA has already conducted itself over their reimagining of the Champions League, it was starting to feel as though the European Super League might not have been such a bad idea at all. Their current plan of a Swiss-style league system, with four more teams in this stage of the competition and scores of extra matches, was bad enough. But they compounded this by pushing on with their plans to hand two of these extra spaces to clubs with the highest coefficients who had not qualified automatically. Now they’re moving on to the latter stages of the tournament, and their plans for this seem to be just as half-baked. There is reportedly growing support for straight, single-legged knockout matches in the semi-finals, with both games and the final taking place in one host city. The supposed intention is that it would resemble a festival of football in one concentrated area to be held over a five-day period at the end of every season. That’s right – another ‘festival of football’, to go alongside the World Cup, the European Championships, the Women’s World Cup, the Women’s European Championships, the Nations League, the Club World Cup and a whole host of other tournaments which have to be squeezed into a calendar which isn’t getting any bigger. Then again, let’s not completely discount the possibility of FIFA or UEFA trying to slow the orbit of the Earth around the sun to make space for The Over-65’s World Cup, The Europa League’s Got Talent, or whatever else they can cram in there). I don't like two-legged cup matches at all, but this all reads like prepping the Champions League's final stages for being played outside of Europe, to me. https://t.co/ksXO6ZB3Ml — Ian King (@twoht) April 28, 2022  It speaks volumes for the extent to which the game’s administrators are not trusted, that the reflex reaction to such a piece of news is to think, ‘Okay, but what’s really  their plan here?’. After all, the people behind such innovations may be awful, but they’re not stupid, and few past assumptions of ulterior motives on the part of the game’s governing bodies have turned out to be without merit. The obvious conclusion to reach is that the number of cities that could host such a – *sigh* – ‘festival of football’ are limited. There’s only a handful in the whole of Europe would could likely cope with the demand of having the supporters of four different clubs descending on it for an entire week; reports suggest UEFA would only consider host cities that can accommodate 100,000 visitors over a five-day period. Of course, in UEFA’s collective head, this – *sigh, again* – ‘festival of football’ will be a week-long party inhabited by healthy-looking, flag-waving consumers, but it’s not difficult to paint a slightly darker picture of it all: of hooligan groups from the four contestants figuring out how to convert a ‘festival of football’ into a ‘festival of hooliganism’. Imagine, if you will, a final four of Chelsea. Atletico Madrid, Roma and PSG, and what sort of policing that might require. Even if hooliganism wasn’t to materialise at something like this, other problems might. Does anybody seriously think that only 25,000 supporters from each of, say, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich would make such a journey, even if their chances of getting tickets were next to non-existent? It’s been suggested, for example, that 30,000 Liverpool supporters – 10,000 of them ticketless – travelled to Istanbul for the 2005 Champions League final, and that was back in the days when football’s march towards globalisation was in its relative infancy. How many more might be tempted by a week-long beano in the sun at a time of year when summer is just starting to present itself?  The small number of cities that would be able to stage such an event also requires further attention, as it raises the possibility of UEFA deciding that it has ‘outgrown’ Europe and would make more money by playing it all in New York or Doha. This may or may not be far-fetched, but in the current football climate, levels of trust towards governing bodies are so low that the instinct on the part of many is to assume any plan like this can only be considered the thin end of just another wedge. Even some of us who would rather see the back of two-legged cup ties would rather keep them than allow that particular door to creep a little further open. What has always been the most staggering thing about those who administrate football has been their almost breathtaking arrogance – the assumption that they know best and what the fans want is secondary to what just about everybody who already makes a handsome return from working in the game wants. Everybody involved in the organisation of the professional game knows full well just how much it means to people, and how many people it means so much to. Yet rules are constantly changed, tournaments are ripped up, and the very texture of the game is redrawn without even an attempt at consultation or consideration being made towards fans: those who will not only be expected to give their vainglorious projects and revamps context through attendance, but will also be relied upon to pay a considerable amount of money to do so. And UEFA seem to have taken the protest against the formation of the European Super League as being some sort of mandate for them to do whatever the hell they like to the Champions League.  Increasingly, it feels as though their objection to that project was no more than unhappiness that they weren’t running it. But there are no good guys to be found here. At least with an actual European Super League the rest of the game might have been able to cast them out and get on with trying to make football a sport again. But no-one should ever mistake UEFA for an organisation that gives a tuppenny damn about the best interests of fans. It is inconceivable that broadcasters would be treated with such contempt. When the Premier League was formed, it was borne of a discussion involving a TV executive (one of the small consolations was that this particular executive, Greg Dyke of ITV, ended up getting nothing from the division’s evolution). The obvious refrain to criticism of this sort of manoeuvre is to reply that the broadcasters are throwing in a lot of money so they should get a say, but even this is misleading. Those who pay are ultimately those who consume the product, whether through streaming service or pay-TV subscriptions, or advertising. Even when the broadcasters are stumping up cash and everybody looking on is getting blinded by the size of the numbers being thrown around, that money will obviously be recouped by the broadcasters from the same fans whose interests aren’t taken into account in the slightest. And there is no reason whatsoever to suggest this will be changing any time in the future, Champions League ‘festival of football’ or not. ",negative
637,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-west-ham-declan-rice-priced-out-move,Could Declan Rice be priced out of a move away from West Ham United?,"This summer might be the right time for Declan Rice to try pastures fresh, but West Ham don’t have to sell and he’ll be expensive. After six senior years and more than 160 appearances for West Ham United, it’s probably time for Declan Rice to move on. Rice was just 17 when he made his first appearance in the West Ham squad towards the end of the 2016/17 season, making his full debut at the start of the following campaign. He ended that first season as runner-up in West Ham’s Player of the Year award and has gone from strength to strength since, making his England debut in March 2019 and playing in all of their games at Euro 2020. Not a bad CV, for a player released by the Chelsea academy at 14 after having been in Chelsea system for the previous eight years, but it’s clear that Rice is reaching the limits of what he can achieve at West Ham. That his growth as a player should have coincided with West Ham’s best spell in decades is unlikely to be coincidental. Having converted from a central defender into an accomplished defensive midfielder, Rice is the unflappable rock at the heart of David Moyes’ team, a distillation of the athleticism, mentality and intelligence required to make it at the elite level of the professional game. But in the highly stratified world of 21st century football, there are limits to what Rice can achieve without heading to one of the biggest clubs. West Ham’s interest in silverware this season isn’t quite over yet; they play Eintracht Frankfurt in the semi-finals of the Europa League, and winning this competition represents an incredible opportunity for the club to bag itself a place in next year’s Champions League. This possibility – the winners of this tie will play Rangers or RB Leipzig in the final in Seville, and the winners of that get into next year’s Champions League – may even be the best chance that David Moyes has of keeping Rice at The London Stadium for another year. But in the Premier League, and this is despite having been afforded plenty of opportunities this season by the comedy stylings of Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, West Ham have been unable to take much headway in the race for fourth place. Last season, a dip towards the end of the season dropped them from fourth in the table after they’d spent several months scrambling to get there in the first place. This time around, they started explosively with eight goals in their first two games, but have slipped from the Champions League places and have lost every other Premier League game they’ve played since the end of February. Fourth place has almost definitely disappeared over the horizon, and the bigger risk is that they could miss out on European football altogether for next season. Seventh is their current position, and this would be enough to guarantee them a place in the Europa Conference League next season, but they’re only three points ahead of a Wolves team that is plenty capable of overhauling that gap over the final few matches. The worry is that West Ham could get distracted by Europe and end up missing out on both that Champions League place and a Europa Conference League place.  But were Rice to leave The London Stadium in the pursuit of greater glories elsewhere, where would he go? The reflex answer to this question has long been Chelsea, but the events of the last couple of months have thrown that up in the air somewhat. Although a decision is due imminently, there is still no confirmation of who the new Chelsea owners will be by the end of the season or whether they would be prepared to spend a significantly huge amount of money on one player when Chelsea may need more if they’re going to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool in both the Premier League and Champions League next season. And there’s little doubt that, if Rice is to leave West Ham in the summer, it won’t be for buttons. Understandably, David Moyes doesn’t want to lose his lynchpin, and when asked about the price of Rice, he replied, “One hundred [million] was cheap last summer; one hundred and fifty just now would be the minimum, but he is not for sale.” Of course, it should be taken into account that, for a transfer of that magnitude, Moyes would almost certainly not have the final say on what he would be sold for, and it’s not difficult to imagine David Gold, David Sullivan and Karren Brady with dollar signs in their eyes and their tongues lolling at the prospect of such offers landing on their desks. Huge numbers are thrown around with little thought to what they actually mean. After all, it’s a straightforward train of thought; if Jack Grealish’s fair-to-middling season with Manchester City is acceptable for a £100m signing, then surely Rice is worth £150m, right? Well, that’s debatable. After all, the ultimate value of any player is ‘what someone is prepared to sell them for and what someone is prepared to pay for them’. But even when the biggest clubs are so wealthy that the normal rules of money no longer apply, it is worth recalling that £150m would be £1.4m more than Chelsea made in Premier League TV and prize money for the 2020/21 season. And that’s before taking into account wages on a lengthy contract. As Moyes also pointed out, Rice’s obvious value as a player means that “there are only certain clubs that could even consider it”. It’s one of the paradoxes of modern football. The wage demands and transfer fees of such a player are now so astronomical that they have a highly limiting effect on who could actually afford him. Manchester City could, but it has been reported that they’re not particularly interested; Erling Haaland’s transfer fee might be a steal for what they’re getting, but his wage costs will be astronomical. Newcastle could, but it seems unlikely that Rice would want to leave a club without a promise of Champions League football. This, for all their hubris about how many players they’re going to sign in the summer, might rule out Manchester United too. Might Liverpool be tempted to break the bank for him? Would PSG or Real Madrid be interested? Would Rice want to go somewhere that dysfunctional? All of these questions remain open. There seems little doubt that Rice himself wants to move on. It’s been reported that he’s already turned down three new contract offers from West Ham. And with his contract running until the summer of 2024, there’s still time for West Ham to pocket a substantial fee, should they sell him this summer. However uncertain it might seem at present, Rice might make an ideal marquee signing for Chelsea, who are already losing Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger this summer, and for whom a replacement for the injury-prone N’Golo Kante may also soon become critical. Perhaps Declan Rice’s decision could be challenged by West Ham getting into the Champions League next season, but it seems that his mind is likely made up. Now all he needs is a club prepared to make an offer that West Ham cannot refuse. ",positive
638,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-forest-and-steve-cooper-prove-the-benefits-of-doing-the-simple-things-well,Nottingham Forest and Steve Cooper prove the benefits of doing the simple things well,"Forest are within sight of the Championship’s promotion places; going up would be one of the division’s most extraordinary ever turnarounds. At the top of the EFL Championship, a messy scrap has been breaking out over the last few weeks. Fulham are already promoted but not yet champions, while Bournemouth’s previously comfortable position in second place has been slowly eroded by a succession of dropped points, with Nottingham Forest and Huddersfield Town in hot pursuit. Bournemouth are three points ahead of Forest and Huddersfield. Huddersfield only have two games remaining, but Bournemouth and Forest have three left, and that third game is against each other on Tuesday May 3. The two teams are on the same goal difference, and Bournemouth have only scored two more than Forest. There are no realistic permutations by which this match isn’t critical. The Championship has effectively got itself a second play-off final. In this battle, there is a favourite and an underdog. In terms of those final matches, Huddersfield need Forest to beat Bournemouth and, realistically, for both teams to lose their other two fixtures. Their chance of automatic promotion seems slight, but the race between Bournemouth and Forest seems likely to go to the wire. Bournemouth hold the whip hand. They are away to Blackburn and at home against Millwall in their remaining fixtures, while Forest are at home against Swansea and away to Hull. But crucially, when the two teams play each other, Bournemouth will have home advantage, and they may even go into that match needing just a point to guarantee promotion. Having been in the Premier League has also given Bournemouth an advantage over Forest. While there, Bournemouth were the most-reliant club of all on TV money, and that same money now gives them a built-in advantage over most other clubs in the Championship. Bournemouth are in their second season back following relegation and have therefore been the beneficiaries of parachute payments amounting to around £80m over those two years. Nottingham Forest, by contrast, will have received around £8-9m per season in the Championship. This is a vast gulf in financial resources, especially after two seasons during which fans weren’t allowed in and clubs were starved of match-day revenues. But no newly hired coach has had a more transformative effect on a football club anywhere in England (or perhaps even Europe) this season than Steve Cooper has had on Nottingham Forest. Such has been their improvement that their dismal start to the season under Chris Hughton already feels like a memory from a different age. Forest lost six of their first seven games, plummeting to the foot of the table and making Hughton’s position untenable by the middle of September. His sacking was one of the least surprising of the season. Following their 17th-placed finish last season, it looked as though falling back to League One for the first time in 14 years was a near-certainty.  Cooper’s appointment was an outbreak of common sense at a club that long ago became specialists in the culture of failure. They were paying players too much to do too little, while the managerial door at The City Ground had become a revolving one. Since returning to the Championship from League One in 2008, Forest had burned through 14 managers, seemingly trying every possible permutation short of hiring a medium in the hopes of contacting Brian Clough and Peter Taylor from beyond the grave in order to restore something approaching their former glories. But Cooper’s appointment has been different to his many predecessors. The perception has taken hold that he understands the challenges and complexities of a club like Forest, who have been considerably mismanaged since they were last in the Premier League 23 years ago and who also carry a burden of expectation based on their illustrious past. In short, he ‘gets’ Forest. A lot of his success has been founded on simple principles of fostering dressing room unity, good coaching and meticulous attention to detail. He seems to have the right balance of being approachable without losing the respect of those that he’s overseeing. Such strategies are so straightforward that they sound obvious; it’s easy to wonder why more managers don’t just get on with doing the same. The answer to this may be that having these ideas in the first place is nowhere near as important as having the character to be able to live the values and pull the rest of the club in the same direction. Every manager who’s arrived at The City Ground over the last 29 years has found a Clough-shaped shadow hanging over the club. Cooper has as good a chance as any has had over those intervening years of breaking free from it. And the results have been startling. Since Cooper’s appointment Forest have lost just five league matches, while their FA Cup run took in wins against both Arsenal and Leicester City before theypushed one of the best teams in Europe harder than many Premier League clubs this season before getting beaten in the quarter-finals by Liverpool. Building a positive attitude within the playing squad has been reflected in their play. Forest have come as far as they have because they have played without any apparent fear, taking games to their opponents when they might have been expected to be more cautious. Such a quality could be invaluable at a time like this, even if they do end up getting nudged into the play-offs. Things aren’t quite perfect at The City Ground, of course. Like many other Championship clubs, Forest are bulked out with loan signings, six in total (the same as Bournemouth), which is a less-than-ideal way of building a team. There remains a question mark over club owner Evangelos Marinakis (a man who has a ‘Controversy’ section on his Wikipedia page, although it should be added that he has been acquitted of all charges against him), though Marinakis remains a considerable upgrade on his predecessor, Fawaz Al-Hasawi. And there also remains the possibility – seen countless times before – that the raising of the hope of an automatic promotion place could lead to disappointment levels that could crush a subsequent play-off bid. With the season entering its final stages, the race for promotion to the Premier League remains too close to call. Bournemouth’s strengths are obvious, but Nottingham Forest have already been on an extraordinary journey, to the foot of the Championship and then to the brink of automatic promotion, via a trip to the FA Cup quarter-finals. The odds at the top of the table remain in favour of Bournemouth snatching that second automatic promotion place, but with Steve Cooper having been able to put a smile back on the face of Forest, it does rather feel as though anything might possible there.

639,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-liverpool-sponsorship-cryptocurrency,Liverpool need to maximise sponsorship deals…but at what cost?,"Liverpool are assessing their options over their shirt sponsorship, but should they even be considering a cryptocurrency company? If elite-level club football is effectively an arms race between an ever-diminishing number of superclubs, then some of those superclubs are at something of a disadvantage compared to the others. There are now two forms of superclub; one type is the ‘traditional’ huge club that has always won trophies (or at least set that as their minimum level of expectation). They used to have a huge advantage over everybody else through their enormous support, especially when the globalisation of the biggest national leagues started to accelerate during the 1990s. The other type has long existed, but has flourished as the gap between the game’s haves and have-nots has grown: the club funded by the munificence of a wealthy owner. What has changed over time has been the amount of money required for any one individual to keep that challenge going. In the mid-1990s, being a multi-millionaire was enough to allow for spending that could challenge near the top. Jack Walker made a fortune from steel, and the money that he put into Blackburn Rovers was enough to snatch the Premier League title in 1995, even if the £25m spent on new players in the previous three years sounds almost laughably quaint a quarter of a century on. Within a decade, the parameters had been reset. Football’s hyper-inflation had led to a situation in which the only realistic way to break the hegemony of that time – which was then held by Manchester United and Arsenal – was to be a billionaire, and preferably one of the wealthiest on the planet. Roman Abramovich’s arrival at Chelsea in the summer of 2003 priced the butchers, bakers and candlestick-makers out of the market forever. Only the sort of money that comes as a result of hoovering up a large proportion of a country’s natural resources provides the funding to allow a club to get close to the top of the table. But Chelsea were just another stop on the road to another destination, and the purchase of Manchester City by the Abu Dhabi United group in 2008 upped that ante substantially again. The reaction of the traditional giants in England to these fundamentally structural changes has been surprisingly similar, taking in sales to venture capitalists from America and lengthy periods of apparent stasis. Manchester United seem to have conceded, their owners of the apparent belief that nothing really matters, so long as the stock price is okay, the stock-holders are happy, and the dividend payments continue. Arsenal built a grand new stadium which was intended to propel them to near the top of the money league, only to find that Manchester City had changed the rules not long after the paint stopped drying at The Emirates Stadium, leading to a period of near-stasis that has lasted until those Emirates seats faded to pink. Elsewhere in Europe, PSG joined the ranks of the state-owned, while the behaviour of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid over and since the European Super League proposals landed a year ago has come to resemble something approaching a mid-life crisis. The third team to make up the triumvirate of traditional English powerhouses is Liverpool, and to some they have bucked the less welcome trends set by Arsenal and Manchester United in recent years, although they did have to wait three decades for a league title before getting to where they are now. Like the other two, they have also changed hands from the traditional ‘custodians’ of the club to rapacious American turbo-capitalists, but the sale of the club to George Gillett and Tom Hicks in 2007 fast-forwarded Liverpool through the process of what happens when ownership goes wrong. They were close to insolvency when they were sold to FSG in October 2010, but FSG have been effective owners of the club, with Champions League and Premier League wins deflecting the club from the unrest and feeling of distrust that has hung over The Emirates Stadium and Old Trafford for such a long time. The appointment of Jurgen Klopp and intelligent strategic thinking in the transfer market got Liverpool back amongst the serious silverware, but staying at the top is far from guaranteed when rivals have the bottomless pockets of the investment funds of entire nations and you need to keep up. Necessary spending doesn’t just come on players. In recent years, for example, Liverpool have extended the capacity of Anfield to 54,000 and there are plans to increase it further. But all of this is expensive, especially when the wage expectations of the best players continue to out-strip what clubs could reasonably be expected to raise through what we might call ‘organic’ means.  It therefore comes as little surprise that Liverpool need to absolutely maximise such deals as shirt sponsorship. After all, the club has worked very hard to position itself near the top global fanbase lists, and what is the point in doing that if it can’t be leveraged for the financial benefit of the club? Shirt sponsorship is perhaps the most visible sponsorship that a football club with Liverpool’s reach can agree. For the last 12 years Liverpool’s shirts have been adorned with the logo of the banking and financial services company Standard Chartered, but now that sponsorship deal is coming to an end, and it would appear that all options are on the table when it comes to finding a replacement… including cryptocurrency. An unnamed exchange firm and a blockchain platform are already believed to have entered talks with the club, but there can be little doubt that agreeing such a contract would be controversial. Cryptocurrency is a famously volatile market, to a point at which it is reasonable to consider dabbling in it a ‘speculative investment’, and each passing day seems to feature a latest victim who’d been persuaded that they could fly straight to the moon, only to find that decentralised markets can be shark-infested pools. Even at a time when it seems like every other organisation in the world is trying to scramble upon this particular bandwagon – often with little apparent idea of what they’re dipping their toes into – this seems like a risk. At a time when there is serious talk of banning gambling companies from advertising on football shirts, it seem surprising that this form of gambling would be permitted, but it may just be that crypto hasn’t yet been able to sink its hooks into the game in England to an extent that most would even notice. But Liverpool’s owners might wish to remind themselves that the club that they own is based in an avowedly socialist city; there are no guarantees that signing such a contract wouldn’t be met with considerable disquiet from supporters. If these companies are offering an amount of money that is wildly more than they would get from anybody else, you could understand the rationale for riding out any complaints, but are there any even any guarantees that cryptocurrency companies would offer vastly more than anybody else? And even if that is the case, what is the valuation that the Liverpool owners put upon the flak that they would receive for signing up with such a company? A couple of million pounds a year, for example, would only cover the wages of one of their players for a few weeks. Would it even be worth all the hassle? And financially speaking, what would be the cut-off point at which it no longer becomes attractive? FSG aren’t idiots. In the slipstream of last year’s abortive clambering aboard the European Super League bandwagon they came in for fierce criticism from fans which led to a toe-curling apology from owner John Henry. But as F365’s Matt Stead said at the time, ‘it is all so disingenuous when you know he will jump into bed with the next opportunity to make money; he is a businessman and that is what they do’. Liverpool have already dipped their toe into the world of NFTs earlier this year. The club made £1.125m in revenue, but this has to be weighed against the fact that 95% of the ‘LFC Heroes Club’ collection went unsold, which doesn’t exactly sound like a success. But a sponsorship-level partnership with a crypto firm is some way beyond even that, and the club’s reputation would suffer serious damage should they sign up with a sponsor who subsequently ends up in hot water. No-one denies that keeping up with the state-funded clubs is going to be difficult to impossible for everyone else, but there should be other ways of levelling that particular playing field which don’t require clubs to throw themselves into the cesspit that is deregulated finance. Alarm bells are already ringing at the extent to which football’s insatiable appetite for money to throw onto the game’s bonfire of costs is corrupting the game, with no apparent oversight of the deals that clubs are agreeing or the potential costs further down the line. But this unregulated marketplace remains a bearpit in which those who are scammed are routinely cast aside in an endless quest for new marks, trashing the environment as it goes. The sooner that both gambling and cryptocurrency sponsorships and NFT sales are banished from football once and for all, the better. ",positive

It is understood that Pochettino and the French club just need to come to an agreement on compensation with it potentially costing PSG€15m to sack the former Spurs boss. It is understood that PSG want to make Zinedine Zidane their new boss as he would be their ‘ideal replacement’ but it is claimed that the former Real Madrid head coach would rather wait for the French national team job.

The report adds that Levy is ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’ after sacking the Argentine in November 2019. Tottenham have taken a small dip in form over the last couple of games after losing to Brighton a week ago before being held to a goalless draw at Brentford at the weekend. But Conte has reminded everyone about the “big trouble” Spurs were in a few months ago with the club still in the race to finish fourth. “I think also for this reason today, with five games to play we are talking about Tottenham are in the race for the Champions League [places],” Conte said. “The people have not to forget in November the big trouble that Tottenham was. Now to stay with five games to go the possibility to stay in this race means the players improved a lot and we are doing a great job. “But we have to know in this last month maybe if we gave 120 per cent maybe it’s not enough, we have to try to increase and go 150 per cent to try to reach this target.” ",positive

PSG are currently 15 points clear of second-placed Marseille in Ligue 1 with only ten matches remaining until the end of the campaign.

A report earlier in the week also insisted that Ten Hag was Man Utd’s ‘prime choice’ to become their new manager in the summer. And now Football Insider claim that Pochettino ‘would jump at the chance to rejoin Tottenham this summer if Antonio Conte is lured away’. There have been rumours over the past couple of months that Conte is unhappy at Spurs after overestimating the standard of his squad. Football Insider adds that Pochettino is ‘expected to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season’ and that the 50-year-old would ‘loveto make a romantic return’ to Tottenham. Pochettino ‘retains a great affection for the club’ and ‘also remained in regular contact with Daniel Levy’ despite his sacking back in 2019. On the potential departure of Conte, Football Insider continues: ‘Those who know Conte well are in no doubt he could quit as manager if he does not get the backing in this summer’s market that he is seeking. ‘PSG are among the clubs eager to lure the former Chelsea, Juventus, Inter Milan and Italy boss to the continent.’ Meanwhile,Tottenham boss Conte believes Dejan Kulusevski will explode into a top player for the north London club. “We are talking about an important prospect,” he said. “He is very young, only 21 years old and despite his young age, he has good experience with the national team. “To play with Juventus for one year and a half, you understand what it means to live with pressure. Probably he could ‘crack’ in the future. “Also because I can see the intensity, the will and the desire to play. As everyday in training session he is a type of player in his mind to become a top player in his career. “While I am his manager, I try to help him to improve and believe.

But less seems to be said of whether it might be damaging for those who work at those clubs, or perhaps even the clubs themselves. Because if there’s one thing that can be said for many of these super-clubs, it’s that so many of them seem to be so unhappy for so much of the time. The appointment of Mauricio Pochettino at PSG at the start of last year was the best of appointments and the worst of appointments. Despite a failure to win any silverware with Spurs, his talents were widely acknowledged, while Pochettino got to work with some of the world’s best players, and at a club with an unlimited budget for shiny new ones. PSG have won Ligue Un at a canter this season but they tripped up again in the Champions League, and that’s where they set the bar for success now. Supporters boycotted their title celebrations. With three games of their league season left to play, they are 14 points clear at the top of the table. Meanwhile in Germany, the one-sidedness of club football is even more severe than in France. Bayern Munich have just won their tenth Bundesliga title in a row, a remarkable achievement in a country that can hardly be said to be wanting for big and storied football clubs. But again, that bar is set so high as to be almost unmanageable, as can be seen from the 450 death threats that head coach Julian Nagelsmann received after his team was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Villarreal. Bayern Munich are currently 12 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Both of these stories are particularly troubling because of the scale of the anger. In the case of PSG, the nature of their capitulation to Real Madrid in the Champions League inevitably caused anger among supporters (it was, let’s face it, embarrassing), but the fact that it’s still hanging in the air more than six weeks later surely can’t be healthy for anyone concerned. For there to be talk of Pochettino leaving after they’ve just won the league title seems ridiculous. When PSG are talked of as being ‘unmanageable’, we usually mean their expensively assembled cadre of mega-players, but when fan protests are thrown onto this bonfire as well, it looks more like the entire club. The concern is similar yet different for Bayern Munich. They should have beaten Villarreal, but the scale of such vituperation against Nagelsmann after this defeat is startling. 450 is a lot of people prepared to send death threats. Pochettino leaving PSG come the end of the season now seems inevitable, and this period will likely be considered a blot on his career, despite having won two trophies in a year and a half. Where he goes from here is just about anybody’s guess; Spurs still feels like it was an ideal fit for both parties, despite the way in which it ended before. Perhaps he could return, end this faintly absurd relationship they have with Antonio Conte in which every bad result seems to prompt him to threaten to leave the club, and Spurs can just run on vibes.  Julian Nagelsmann, meanwhile, is just 34 years old. He is at the stage in life where most players would be about to embark upon what they would hope to be a long managerial career. Nagelsmann has already been coaching to some degree for 12 years, and has been managing for six. He has shown no inclination towards leaving Bayern, but where do either party go if the modern management meat-grinder spits him up and chews him out by the time he’s, say, 37 or 38? Bayern Munich’s longest-ever serving coach was Udo Lattek, at eight years and 295 days, and it took him two spells at the club to achieve that. Do those 450 who sent those death threats have a better solution than Julian Nagelsmann for Bayern Munich? If they feel strongly enough about it to send a death threat, perhaps they should run for the club’s board. After all, Bayern are 82% fan owned. This unhappiness seems to be almost everywhere. In England, a bomb threat was made to the Manchester United defender Harry Maguire. In Scotland, fans protested the idea of a Rangers vs Celtic ‘friendly’ in Australia to a point at which the idea was abandoned. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus still seem to be trying to push through a European Super League, whether anyone else wants one or not. And if we strip away what people are so angry about and whether they’re right or wrong, it surely can’t be doing anyone much good that so many people feel this way. Furthermore, as that bar continues to rise, as expectations continue to grow, the number of Champions League trophies that can be given out at the end of each season remains exactly the same. Perhaps it really is as simple as that it’s all become too easy and that this feeds boredom, and consequently anger. There have been plenty of times throughout the history of PSG when the club would have given anything to be anywhere near the top of Ligue Un, while it’s not difficult to see how it might be difficult for Bayern Munich supporters to get anything like as excited about their tenth consecutive Bundesliga title as they did over their first. In England, there remains just enough plurality to give an illusion of competition, but even that now seems restricted to two – at a push, three – clubs. Manchester City and Liverpool have each other to keep themselves competitive, and that seems to be paying dividends in the Champions League. But Liverpool’s success has been despite a huge degree of inequality, and Manchester City have the bottomless pockets of Abu Dhabi to fall back upon. There are few guarantees that Liverpool will be able to keep up with City indefinitely. Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann will never struggle for work; they are elite-level coaches and it shouldn’t be necessary to worry about their future prospects. But we should worry about a football culture that is simultaneously narrowing the horizons of what it means to be successful while making it prohibitively expensive to try to achieve it. The blunt instrument of the accumulation of trophy players hasn’t been enough to deliver a Champions League trophy for PSG, and winning the Bundesliga repeatedly doesn’t seem to have done much for Bayern Munich in this competition either. They’ve won it once in the last nine years. But perhaps the point is that once in nine years should be enough for one club in a pan-continental tournament. If football needs a reset, perhaps that should be the first aim – to lower expectations, to make football feel more competitive again, and to make silverware feel like something that has to really be earned than something that just falls into your lap every May. To return some rarity value. It’s true to say that this level of anger is at least as much a reflection of an increasingly angry world as it is of football in splendid isolation, but that doesn’t mean that the game itself shouldn’t work harder to try and mitigate it. Because setting these increasingly unmeetable expectations for clearly talented coaches such as Mauricio Pochettino and Julian Nagelsmann and then becoming incandescent when they can’t achieve them doesn’t seem to be doing anybody any good.

Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive
644,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-old-firm-celtic-rangers-anger-friendly-australia,Celtic and Rangers unite in anger at Old Firm ‘friendly’ jaunt,"Celtic and Rangers have a rivalry that goes back to 1888 but they’ve never played abroad. Now they’re going to, and the fans aren’t happy. The origins of the phrase ‘The Old Firm’ in relation to Celtic and Rangers aren’t absolutely clear, but it’s unlikely that it was intended as a compliment. Some have claimed that this nickname emerged because both clubs were amongst the founder members of the Scottish Football League in 1890, but its first recorded usage is generally credited to a cartoon which appeared in the popular Scottish Referee sports periodical ahead of the 1904 Scottish Cup final between the clubs, depicting a pipe-smoking human sandwich board, bearing the message ‘Patronise The Old Firm’, in reference to increasingly regular and lucrative meetings between the two clubs. 118 years on, the battle lines of this particular rivalry have been redrawn (the foremost issue dividing Scotland at the end of the 19th century was amateurism vs professionalism, which is the reason for that famous 1904 cartoon) but it remains as intense as ever, and it takes something to make the supporters of both clubs bristle at the same time. But somehow they’ve managed it with the breathless announcement of the first match between the two teams overseas. Celtic and Rangers have been invited to make up a four-team mini-tournament in Australia in November also featuringSydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers, and both seem to have accepted the offer. Both clubs stand to make a decent pot of money from their trip, but money isn’t really the point for the supporters. The commoditisation of the rivalry has stuck in the craw of many, with the prevailing view being that there can be nothing ‘friendly’ about Celtic playing Rangers. Many Celtic fans refuse to acknowledge that the Old Firm even exists anymore, following the Rangers liquidation of 2012, and this has even been argued in the past by the club itself, although this was undermined a little when it emerged that the trademarks over ‘Old Firm’ and ‘The Old Firm’, which had been jointly held by Celtic and Rangers since the turn of the century, had been renewed just a few days before the club sent its tweet. Rangers supporters are none too happy either. A poll on the Follow Follow forum showed 95% of just over 2,000 voters against the idea. The reasons given by fans on the forum are varying (many of which can’t be repeated on here, such is their nature), but also include simply not wanting to be associated with each other, and the perception that, as the Celtic manager Ange Postecoglu is Australian and coached their international team at the World Cup, they are being invited along to a party in honour of someone perceived to be an enemy. But for all the partisan reasons from both sides, the objection of many could probably be best summed up in the words of one disgruntled Rangers supporter: ‘Rangers would sell the sugar out of our tea these days for a quick buck.’ The timing of the tournament is certainly odd. The match between Celtic and Rangers is scheduled for November 20 and this is the day before the World Cup finals are due to start in Qatar. Both clubs will have players who are going to these finals – Scotland themselves may yet do, should they get past Ukraine and then the winners of the match between Wales and Austria – so it’s hardly like these two clubs will be sending a full-strength squad to the other side of the world. So why are they doing it? The answer is obvious: money. Celtic and Rangers are both enormous clubs with global fanbases, but they play in the SPFL and that stifles their growth in a world in which television contract money trumps matchday revenues. The SPFL’s current television deal is worth £30m per year, which places it between the Danish Superliga and the Romanian Liga 1 in the league table of annual television rights.  There is much to admire about the way in which Scotland distributes its television money. The difference between finishing bottom of the top and second tiers is £500,000 in Scotland as opposed to £93million, as it is in England. But even with only 12 teams, £30m doesn’t stretch very far, and Celtic and Rangers earn either £5m or £4m per season in SPFL prize money, depending on whether they finish first or second in the table, and a little extra from overseas sales, but the big prize is in European football, which has the knock-on effect of making their domestic league title race important for reasons beyond mere bragging rights. A place in the Champions League group stages is the ultimate financial prize, being worth a minimum of £13.4m for qualifying, with each win being worth £2.4m and each draw worth £804,000. As such, it might be argued that the big matches of the season are the Champions League, played at the very start of the season. Celtic lost to Midtjylland of Denmark in the Second Qualifying round and Rangers lost to Malmo in the Third Qualifying Round this season but Rangers remain in the Europa League afterbeating Borussia Dortmund in a play-off for a place in the last 16. Celtic, meanwhile, were eliminated by Bodo/Glimt in the Europa Conference League play-off. Both teams have made more from their European trips than from their domestic television contract, but nowhere near the tens of millions of pounds that come with Champions League entry, unless Rangers can continue to progress in the Europa League. Such financial constraints demand a certain amount of inventiveness in the transfer market. It’s certainly a different financial plane to being in the Premier League in England, and the desire to make more of it in order to improve is understandable. But this does seem like a tone deaf decision from both clubs. Neither sets of supporters want a ‘friendly’ match against the other, even if it’s packaged as part of a mini-tournament. Celtic and Rangers already play each other four times a season in the league and meetings in the cups are not uncommon. And with their best players away on World Cup duty, it doesn’t exactly even feel as though Australian supporters would be getting a particularly good deal. And then, of course, there’s the fact that they are flying to the other side of the world for three friendly matches when they could be actually taking advantage of a break after a punishing schedule over the previous two-and-a-half years. Clubs complain about fixture congestion all the time. These fixtures are exactly why so many give clubs such little shrift when they start doing so. They’re football with their context stripped, played for the sake of money alone. There were protest banners at Celtic Park during their match against St Mirren. Live on Sky Sports, Rangers supporters were very loudly telling the directors of their club where they could ‘shove’ their ‘f**king friendly’. Whether you wish to call it the Old Firm Derby or the Glasgow Derby, the rivalry between Rangers and Celtic is not a theme park, and it is fundamentally disrespectful to the supporters of both clubs to treat it as such. It needs to stay in Glasgow. ",positive
645,https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-finally-made-it-up-women-football-wsl,Manchester United finally put women front and central,"Manchester United and women’s football has not always been the happiest of marriages. The Red Devils famously disbanded their women’s team in 2005 – the very same month that the 2005 Women’s European Championships had kicked off in Manchester – in order to focus on their youth set-up. What they envisioned their youth team doing when they became adults is as yet unknown. Grow out of it because it’s just a phase? The team reformed in 2018, and on the surface everything appeared fine. United secured promotion at the first time of asking and slotted in seamlessly to life in the WSL. But manager Casey Stoney quit in May 2021, with complaints over training facilities contributing to her decision to step down, suggesting the club were still not committing to the women’s team as forcefully as they could be. And yet despite previous false starts and under-investment, United put on a spectacle to savour for the women’s team’s first Old Trafford outing in front of fans against Everton on Sunday; from the stadium decor to the 2021/22 WSL season record crowd, it was impressive. The club got everything right and the team turned in a performance befitting of the occasion. A lack of advertising has been a common criticism thrown at women’s teams ahead of potentially high-profile matches in big venues, but with pictures of female United players decking the Old Trafford exterior during the week’s build-up to the fixture, this game was almost impossible to miss. Even the choice of fixture was shrewd. The first time both Tottenham and West Ham hosted WSL matches in their men’s teams’ stadiums, they lost, putting a dampener on the occasion. Spurs used the lure of the north London derby when they played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time in 2019. Attendance-wise it proved successful, attracting a crowd of 38,262 – a figure which remains a WSL record. But Arsenal unsurprisingly ran out 2-0 winners, meaning the day largely belonged to the Gunners despite it being on Spurs’ turf. Although partly aided by the fact the fixture fell during the men’s international break, Manchester United picking their clash with struggling Everton for their Old Trafford debut in front of fans was a smart move. While a blockbuster clash against rivals Manchester City may have attracted more supporters, this would come with a greater risk of defeat and post-match deflation. The 3-1 comeback victory over Everton – with childhood Manchester United fans Alessia Russo and Katie Zelem netting at the Stretford End – added to the euphoric, party atmosphere at Old Trafford. Despite the illustrious setting, supporters still enjoyed the traditional women’s football treatment at full-time, with players staying behind for pictures and autographs. “There will be people here that have never experienced women’s football,” manager Marc Skinner said at full time. “My daughter loves Ella Toone. We’ve never told her to love anyone. She loves Ella Toone and she sings the songs about Ella Toone and that’s because they can see them, they can feel them, they can touch them. When we can feel close to something, we feel part of it. “Women’s football has always been a little bit more unique, where you feel like you can touch it a little bit more. Men’s football has obviously been built for so long that it’s hard to touch it.” Persuading a percentage of the 20,000 supporters who attended the Old Trafford showpiece to get down to a fixture in Leigh is the next step for Manchester United. The manner in which they went about things for the Everton clash has given them the best possible chance of turning the first-timers into repeat attenders.

Los Blancos are extremely keen on signing the France international – who is out of contract at the end of the season. Gossip: Man Utd eye ex-Spurs star; Arsenal prepare £50m striker package Despite his contract situation, Real Madrid reportedly lodged a€220m bid to sign Mbappe last summer, with the Parisiens failing to respond to the offer. It appears to be a two-horse race to land the forward with Madrid and PSG battling it out. His current employers reportedly offered Mbappe a€100m bonus if he renews his contract in the French capital. The player has remained coy on his future, insisting that he has not made a decision yet. Speaking recently, he said:“My final decision? Nothing has changed, so I have nothing to say about it.” MESSI, NEYMAR & MBAPPE WIN THEIR FIRST TROPHY TOGETHER FOR PSG 🏆🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/IwVkqhcszx — ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) April 23, 2022 Madrid have always been confident of landing Mbappe when his contract runs out, especially after the Spaniards knocked PSG out of this season’s Champions League. The French club’s director Leonardo reckons that Real have been “too sure” that the 23-year-old will represent the La Liga giants next season. He said (quotes via Football Espana): “In Madrid they have been sure that he will end up at Real Madrid… Maybe they are too sure of it? [laughs].” Leonardo continued: “Mbappe? The discussion have always been there. There were discussions in Doha. “Kylian talks, he talks with us. What he says is the truth. He still hasn’t decided. I think that the possibility of him staying exists. The possibility of him going exists too, but I think that he is still reflecting, he is seeing that things change.” Mbappe has scored 165 goals and provided 83 assists in 213 games for PSG. Liverpool and Manchester City have also been linked with Mbappe; however, Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland appears to be City-bound.  ",positive

Following spells at Chelsea and Man Utd, Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs towards the end of 2019. Tottenham ended up finishing sixth in the Premier League at the end of the 2019/20 campaign. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down During Mourinho’s first full season in charge, Tottenham exited the FA Cup and Europa League prematurely. The 59-year-old guided them to the final of the Carabao Cup. He did not lead his team out at Wembley though as he was sacked a few days before the final. Mourinho left after 17 months in charge. Spurs were seventh in the Premier League when he departed. Four days later, he was appointed by Roma. They have fared pretty well this season as they fit fifth in Serie A. I Giallorossi also face Leicester City in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. The first leg takes place on Thursday night at the King Power Stadium. Prior to this clash, Mourinho suggested that Spurs chairman Levy is “quite a unique person”: “I’m not afraid to win. I think Roma as a city, Roma as a club, my players, the people who work in the club, for the work we all did to improve, I think we deserve to be in the final,” Mourinho said (quotes via The Mirror). “Unfortunately football doesn’t always give what you deserve and we have to beat a very good team. Am I afraid of winning the semi-final and being sacked – no. “I have to admit in my long career, with so many things that happen, that one (the Tottenham sack) is quite unique. But I think also Mr Levy is quite a unique person in football.” Elsewhere, Paris St Germain boss Pochettino has claimed that both he and Kylian Mbappe will “100 per cent” be at the club next season. Asked in a press conference what the likelihood of him and Mbappe being at the club next term was, he replied: “100 per cent in both cases.” Pochettino, who was overlooked for the Manchester United job, later added: “That is how I feel today. That is what I can say to you today. I can’t say anything else. That is how I feel right now. “This is football and we never know what might happen. But I have to answer the question based on how I feel today. And that is what I have done.” ",positive
648,https://www.football365.com/news/merseyside-derby-mailbox-liverpool-2-0-everton-richarlison-anthony-gordon-lampard,"‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox…","The Mailbox has zero sympathy for Everton and their plight after their tactics in the derby. Also: Arsenal are enjoying being relevant again. Get your views into theeditor@football365.com… Ta-ra, Toffees For all the fawning over Everton’s ‘great’ tactics and ‘what else could they do’, I was glad to see Liverpool pick up the pace and win. Funnily enough, when Everton decided to actually play football they made a decent fist of it – which makes you wonder why the players waited until 8 games and a half to go and try it. In several games earlier in the season it looked like several Everton players were deliberately trying to lose games with woeful backpasses designed to get their manager sacked. But in the end, just as with United, the players need to stand up and be counted. Rolling around the floor feigning injuries – the Richarlison fake after heading the ball was atrocious. Or the over the top theatrical catches and dropping to the ground by Pickford, who just loves all the attention, only to realise they needed the time to get one back once Liverpool scored. Who didn’t love Allison’s parody catch and drop near the end of the game. I thought Joe Hart was the poster child for ADHD goalkeepers, but Pickford takes the poisoned chalice. The problem with acting the Charlie early on is it makes you look twice as stupid when flailing around and failing to prevent a goal and losing later on. Everton clearly can play when they put their mind to it but too many players want to take the short cut to hopefully getting a draw and now it’s hard to put in a 90 minute performance encapsulating the best of what they did against Liverpool. Their fellow bottom of the table opponents who they are hoping to suck into the bottom three have continued to show a commitment over 90 minutes. None of Everton, Burnley or Leeds have an easy run in. But if they are to take any points they need to be focused and committed not just trying to wind up their opponents.Paul McDevitt  …I didn’t expect Everton to turn up and play attractive, expansive football. But you’d have to say, the way they played today, the Premier league would be best off without them. A nothing team spearheaded by possibly the least likeable player in the division in Richarlison. Back to the main concern though. Liverpool showed great patience, controlled the ball and got over the line in the end. 3 wins this week. Thoroughly enjoyable. Cheers,Marc  …That was the most satisfying win of the year. Everton, an absolute joke. Though they had me afraid on the break. Cherry on top of the sundae that was Origi’s goal was Alisson diving on the ball after catching it. Eat your Heart out!Nik (down the blues), Munich  …I haven’t watched much of Everton this season, but based on this evidence, I won’t be watching them next season. What a pathetic performance of total and utter gutter football. They aren’t the most likeable team on the best of days (Richarlison, Allan, Holgate, Pickford), but add Frank Lampard in and they’re just totally derisible. I’ve said all week prior to the game I’d didn’t want them to go down, not least because I’d see 6 guaranteed points a season gone, but that’s gone, and I can’t wait to see them drop, because make no shadow of a doubt, Burnley are twice the team Everton are right now, and probably have the better manager – Lampard has no right managing a premier league team. Someone needs to tell Frank Lampard 50% pass completion and kicking the shins out of your opposition gets you no points, and had every dive been appropriately carded, they’d have had fewer than 9 players at full time, and Richarlison wouldn’t have made half time. Good bye, good riddance, hope you never come back.KC (Pathetico Madrid performance)  …Prior to today, I wanted Everton to stay up. After that pathetic display of anti-football, they can go down and stay there for a couple of years for all I care. Tell Coventry we said hi.John, LFC, Washington DC  16 Conclusions: Liverpool 2-0 Everton  Gordon going down First of all-it wasn’t a penalty. It really really wasn’t. Their arms get tangled and Matip brushes Gordon away who if course goes down like a sack of spuds. Matip’s hand doesn’t go near Gordon’s back. See it being described as a “stonewall” penalty was laughable. The stonewall penalty Everton should have got was against Manchester City. A very very costly and egregious error that could cost both Merseyside clubs. As for Gordon-he’s a very very good player. But his diving antics are risible. He’s been having about with Richarlson too long.Derek, LFC, dublin.  Mayor Divock I was definitely a bit worried before the game that Everton were going to try and kick a few lumps out of us to level the playing field but it wasn’t as bad as I expected in the end. That said I’m astounded that Richarlison didn’t see red for that foot into Henderson’s knee for literally no reason. No real great surprise that VAR didn’t refer the decision since it was Man Utd super fan David Coote sat watching the monitor. One of the more clear examples of endangering another player needlessly and somehow it was only punished with a yellow. On the plus side Everton chose, instead of kicking us to try and gain an unfair advantage, to dive a lot to try and gain an unfair advantage. Most of their efforts were so laughable that even Attwell couldn’t pretend to be convinced by them. Credit to him for finally booking Gordon after he’d dived unsuccessfully four times. Liverpool were not at their best today but it’s been an insanely intense week already so I hardly blame them. At least we don’t have a champions league semi final to worry about in three days. Also when you have Divock Origi nothing seems impossible. I honestly think he is one of the most underrated strikers in English football. If he moves on this summer I suspect he’ll prove that he’s a top player. Highlight of the game was Alisson doing the pathetic time wasting drop to the ground that Pickford kept doing from the 20th minute to waste time. The crowd loved it, it was hilarious and stuck the knife in. The simple truth though is that if Everton can play like that against us then their entire team has been phoning it in all season. They should all be looking in the mirror and accepting they’ve all let the fans down this season. They could be in trouble by virtue of the fact that Burnley seem to be finding form but I’d still like to see them survive. The league would be slightly worse without Everton in it for me. The games that I always check for first are Man Utd and Everton and I suspect most Liverpool fans are the same; I want to play the rivals that matter most every season.Minty, LFC  Liverpool’s last chance? It looks like it’s coming down to the wire. I can live with missing out on the league, but by goal difference or a single point will hurt. Haaland is no Werner so this is probably the last chance anyone else has to win it for a few years.Aidan, Lfc (bit sh*t when you’re greatest rival is so f***ing good)  Carra on Liverpool comms Why does Sky allow Jamie Carragher to be commentator on Liverpool games? Its so shockingly biased it’s practically the same as Wrestling colour “commentators” who deliberately say outrageous things.Steve Limerick Ireland  What’s the point? Seriously is there any point in VAR in its current format in the premier League? After watching arsenal v United and Liverpool v Everton I just don’t get or understand how the decisions are being madeKen  Pep and Paddy My friend Paddy failed his first year exams in college, then he failed the repeats and so had to repeat the year. Then he failed his first year exams again. I met him that summer before his second round of repeats and asked him how he was getting on. He told me he was studying now for the first time properly because he realised if he failed again he would have to leave the course. I asked him why hadn’t he studied before, he said something interesting, “the first time I failed was because I went out every night and hadn’t read a thing, but then I was afraid to study because if I didn’t study and I failed that was one thing, but if I studied and I failed then that meant I was thick.” He passed his exams that year and went on the finish the course and become very successful in his career. After passing those exams he told me afterwards that he wasn’t afraid of failure anymore, if he failed again that meant he just had to work harder, not that he was stupid. I love this time of year, because like Paddy we get to watch Pep struggle with his fear of failure in the Champions league. It’s utterly fascinating. From dropping his best player against spurs to picking a radically different team to normal for last years final Pep is accused of over-thinking things in Europe. Yes he probably does over-think but for me the more interesting question is why? He is widely regarded as the greatest coach of his generation but the great big blot on his copybook is his failure to win the champions league since his Messi-inspired Barcelona days, back in 2011. Another friend tried to argue the other day that winning the premier league is harder than the champions league because it requires more consistent performance over a season. While this is true my counter argument is that the Champions league for whatever reason usually asks a team to go to a place they haven’t gone before, to a higher place. Like Liverpool vs Barcelona, Istanbul or Manu’s comeback against Bayern winning the champions league requires you to go to a place you haven’t gone before, to go beyond yourself, to achieve greatness. This is more than beating Norwich 5-0 or Chelsea 2-1. This is something more, and everyone knows it, including Pep. So for me this is the most interesting story of the year: how does Pep react in Europe. Between him and greatness stand potentially three teams that know how to go to that place of greatness in Europe to differing degrees, all time most successful team Real, a club that won the CL with Djimi Traore at full back and a Villarreal team and a manager that are punching several levels above their station. Pep’s City are the most technically gifted team I have ever seen, but can they win the champions league this year? I’m not sure. For me and the pivotal questions is can Pep go beyond himself, throw himself 100% into the moment to go to that other place where true greatness lives? Like my friend Paddy what will win out in Peps battle with himself will probably determine the outcome of both competitions. If one of the other three clubs lift this years Champions league and Pep tries to convince us(himself) that the premier league is what really matters with the chorus of his apologists behind him you’ll know he’s probably squelched himself again. I for one can’t wait, tub of popcorn at the ready for Tuesday night.David  No one likes us, we don’t care As an Arsenal fan I’m quietly loving all the hate we keep getting. Mailbox entries describing us as the ‘most obnoxious team in the league’, Ricard Keys moaning about Arteta spending a lot of time outside his technical area, Scholes moaning about Arteta whipping up the crowd before the VAR review, Rio ‘can we bring Peter Walton in’ Ferdinand almost in tears that a referees decision didn’t go in Man U’s favour. It is all music to Arsenal fans’ ears. A while ago someone mentioned that the worst thing as a club/manager was when Fergie was being complimentary towards you as it meant he no longer saw you as a threat. For years Arsenal were told we’re too soft, not streetwise, not able to rough it with the best. We’re hardly the second coming of Simeone’s Atletico or any of Mourinho’s teams, but now we have a manager who realises that a bit of aggression, gamesmanship and pressure on officials all helps and people are crying that we’re a nasty despicable team. Which one is it because you can’t have it both ways? I can admit that there were some 50/50’s that went Arsenal’s way but the worst decision of them all in the game was to allow Bruno to stay on the pitch for his studs up tackle on Tavares, the ball was so long gone that there was clearly only one thing in Bruno’s mind and that was to petulantly try to injure an Arsenal player in frustration at his and his team’s pitiful performance. The ref and VAR completely bottled that decision and we all know…..’if that was Xhaka’ remains very much in force when you see this sort of thing happen. Man U fans complaining about decisions not going their way unsurprisingly get little support from any fan of any other team in the league who I’m sure could list a catalogue of favourable Man U decisions against their team.Rich, AFC  Xhaka’s redemption arc After the way Xhaka came off the pitch in that game against Palace 3 years ago and lost the captaincy afterwards, I don’t think a single Arsenal fan thought he would remain a core part of our team. I know he has his flaws, like all the rash challenges and cards he receives, but this season I think he’s been brilliant. He’s held the line well in many games, his ball distribution is still up to scratch. He’s helped to lead the team and his fiery attitude has often pushed him and the team onwards while also being a double-edged sword. He really exemplifies the “duality of man”. After that belter against UTD I feel like we can finally say that the Xhaka redemption arc is complete. He’s endeared himself to the fans. I think his story is one of the most amazing in Arsenal’s modern history, it’s extremely rare for a player who was unhappy with the fans and widely derided by them to have risen from those ashes and become admired by those same fans. Enjoy your time in the sun Granit!Vish (AFC), Melbourne  Greedy Toni I rate Toni Rudiger and I think his performances for Chelsea this season, despite the fact he is becoming a free agent and having all the current turmoil surrounding the club, have been excellent. What I really dislike are the current rumours/gossip/leaked information advising Rudiger has been offered 200k a week in a new contract for Chelsea and he has knocked it back. Think about it 200k a week. How many of you would even see 200k over the period of a couple of years. I know I certainly won’t. Ok lets say what is being reported is correct. Time to go back to school and do some maths, 200k a week, that’s 800k a month, that’s 10 million 400 thousand a year. And let’s not forget any potential endorsements he has coming his way as well and apparently it’s still not enough money for him. Im sure he already has more money, houses and cars than he knows what to do with, yet 200k per week doesn’t cut it. You are a very good footballer, but you are also a very greedy man and welcome to leave and free up wages for others.Gary (happy to come out of retirement and play for 10% of that) Fremantle Western Australia  Why PSG fans have had enough In response to Zak – Worst supporters…ever! I actually applaud PSG’s fans for booing and refusing to celebrate, and I don’t think it’s entitled or obnoxious. Here’s why: PSG has become such a joke of a club for various reasons; Neymar jetting off to Brazil with friends for two months every season, most of the players not knowing how to speak or even wanting to learn French, childish divisions within the squad where non-Spanish speakers are ostracised by the rest. The list could go on, but above all there is absolutely no accountability within the playing group, and absolutely no authority from anywhere within the club hierarchy to discipline the players, which is exactly what’s needed. The world is aware of all of the above and rightly laughs at their misfortunes. For their fans however, enough is enough. I think PSG fans – like all of us football fans – just want to see a team playing for the shirt, and it is plain to see that most of their squad (there are a few exceptions to be fair) couldn’t give a sh*t. More power to the fans!Andy, LFC  …I too read about the boos and the ultras leaving PSG game early rather than celebrate the league win and also had the reaction of “why are they so spoilt and petulant” it was only in 2008 when they nearly got relegated before the Qatar money came in 2011 I think. So I did a quick Google and read a few articles on what the problem is and in fact the fans problem is they feel as though the soul is being taken from the club and that the culture of the club is no longer respected. Those upstairs are more interested in buying “superstar names” and using the city of Paris as one big marketing campaign rather than buying and building a cohesive functioning team. I just thought that was very interesting to read and I’d recommend others to have a read of it as well. Just shows that some fans do respect culture and history rather than billions of pounds and superstar names that frankly don’t care about them.Ryan, Liverpool  Worrying sign for women’s game During the Spurs v Chelsea ladies match today, when Chelsea equalised the spurs women Twitter account tweeted saying something like “Chelsea equalise through a lovely finish from Reiten” (I don’t have the exact wording as it was quickly deleted!) There were a few replies immediately criticising the account for praising an opponent in any way. So they deleted it and posted “Reiten brings Chelsea level” instead. This made me a bit sad. I am a Spurs fan and dislike Chelsea intently. But I’ve found the womens game a breath of fresh air – this is purely anecdotal but there seems to be less play acting, more respect, and the ball seems to be in play longer. There also seems to be more positivity in the support (it seems more about supporting your team rather than hating the other). So whilst a small thing, that tweet being deleted and reposted has made me worry this will all be eroded. As more and more fans of mens football (like me) start following the womens teams as well, what are we bringing with us? Tribalism? Anger? I think the womens teams deserve all the success and increase in profile they want. I just hope we can do it without ending up with more of the same.MG  Worst signingsLee’s email made me think of some of the worst signings ever (also doubling up as some of the worst downgrades in their position). Some of mine are: Junior firpo (Barca to Leeds) – May be an inability to settle in God’s Country but looks terrible in defence and replaced Alioski who was excellent last season and key to our side. Roque Junior (Milan to Leeds) – another rubbish Brazilian who either was unlucky, unhappy or just terrible. Somehow won a world cup winners medal. Tomas Brolin (Parma to Leeds) – out of shape and poor for most of the time (although he gets partial credit for a goal v man utd in a Christmas eve win which made my Christmas). Joe Cole (Chelsea to Liverpool) – apparently better than Messi in training. Even on a free it was a bad bit of business. Coutinho (Liverpool to barca) – they played too much for a player who occupied the same spaces as Messi and albeit very good was not worth £142 million. Classic Barca panic buy with no nod to team tactics or planning. Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell to Man city in 2012. Obviously bought to fill squad space rather than play regularly. Not an Everton fan but I feel so bad for rodwell and his career stalling so much afterwards. Ravel Morrison – to anyone. The fact that so many managers have thought they could be the ones to help him is both idealistic and a bit crazy at the same. Seemingly had a poor attitude which only he could have worked on but didn’t.Tom, Leeds fan in Wallsend.  …I see the topic of “Worst Transfers Ever” has been raised again, i will always love when Fernando Torres to Chelsea is classed as a “Worst Transfer Ever”, he was key to us lifting the Champions League and Europa League, he may not have won a Premier League title or dominated the game after his injuries but he was hardly a “Worst Ever” especially when you look back at other forwards we have spent big money on, when i think “Worst Ever” i think Alexis Sanchez to United, Jack Rodwell to Sunderland, Ricky Alvarez to Sunderland and Danny Drinkwater to ourselves. The Ricky Alvarez deal is just a mind blowing read, if i am right Sunderland paid £9.5m to Inter Milan for a player who then immediately left for free, yikes.The Admin @ At The Bridge Pod  ",positive
649,https://www.football365.com/news/brentford-0-0-tottenham-spurs-slip-up-again-against-unlucky-bees,Brentford 0-0 Tottenham: Spurs slip up again against unlucky Bees,"Tottenham’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered another blow as they only managed a disappointing 0-0 draw at Brentford. After Arsenal moved into the Premier League’s top four by beating Manchester United in the lunchtime kick-off, Spurs fluffed their lines with a sub-par performance in west London. Erik ten Hag by the numbers: games, trophies, signings They looked devoid of all attacking creativity and for the second successive game they failed to have a shot on target. It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out. Their top-four hopes remain in their own hands, however, as they still have Arsenal to play at home in a game that is looking like being decisive in the race. The narrative before the match was about Christian Eriksen coming up against his former club for the first time since leaving in January 2020 and then suffering a cardiac arrest at last summer’s European Championship. And the Denmark international was instrumental to a strong Brentford start as he directed play. Bryan Mbeumo had a shot deflected just wide as the Bees forced a number of early corners. It was from one of those that they came within inches of breaking the deadlock in the 19th minute as Toney sent a header from Eriksen’s delivery crashing into the crossbar. Spurs, who were blunted by Brighton last week, again look bereft of any sort of creative flair as Brentford contained them by packing the midfield. Things looked up briefly early in the second half as Kane got involved for the first time by seeing his shot on the turn blocked, while there was a moment of pinball as Kane, Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur all had efforts blocked in quick succession. But Brentford got a second wind and came back at Spurs, with Kane needing to clear off the line from Pontus Jansson’s header, with Hugo Lloris getting down well to keep out Eriksen’s low shot. Spurs threw bodies forward in search of the win at the end but rarely looked like getting through. They had a major escape at the death as Toney was denied by the woodwork again, heading another Eriksen delivery into the post. There was almost drama at the other end in injury time as Kane tried an acrobatic volley which went inches wide. But Spurs did not deserve the win as they lost ground in the race for the top four.

650,https://www.football365.com/news/conte-spurs-perspective-brentford-draw,Conte urges Spurs perspective after Brentford draw,"Tottenham boss Antonio Conte has told people not to forget where his side have come from after their Champions League qualification hopes were hit on Saturday. Spurs conceded ground to north London rivals Arsenal, whose victory over Manchester United moved them into the top four – a position Conte’s side could not regain as they limped to a 0-0 draw at Brentford. MAILBOX: Arsenal are the ‘most obnoxious team’ in the Premier League… For Conte’s side to be in the top four race at all is something of an achievement given how inconsistent they have been and the difficult position they were in when he arrived. The Italian was appointed in November following the dismal reign of Nuno Espirito Santo and found a team six points off the top four. “I think also for this reason today, with five games to play we are talking about Tottenham are in the race for the Champions League [places],” Conte said. “The people have not to forget in November the big trouble that Tottenham was. Now to stay with five games to go the possibility to stay in this race means the players improved a lot and we are doing a great job. “But we have to know in this last month maybe if we gave 120 per cent maybe it’s not enough, we have to try to increase and go 150 per cent to try to reach this target.” Spurs lacked any creative threat against the Bees as they made it a second successive game without a shot on target. Brentford contained them by packing the midfield and denying Spurs’ attacking players any space. Conte has rigidly stuck to his preferred 3-5-2 system and Frank admitted that made it easier to prepare. “In some ways it’s easier to prepare for but it’s not that easy to stop,” Frank said. “We’ve seenbefore in the last two games that Spurs were the highest-scoring team and scoring goals for fun. “But no doubt that when you know some clear patterns –personallyI’m like that myselfif we create that more becauseit alsogives structure to the players, but also if you prepare for some clear situations you try of course to stop it. “When it works like it did today for us then it’s fantastic. “But there’ll always be some crucial moments in agame where we have to make a definingblock or sprint back.” ",positive
651,https://www.football365.com/news/pochettino-centre-stand-off-between-man-utd-psg-manager,Pochettino at ‘the centre of a stand-off’ between Man Utd and PSG,"Mauricio Pochettino is in the middle of a ‘stand-off’ between Man Utd and Paris Saint-Germain ahead of the summer, according to reports. The former Tottenham boss and Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag are the two favourites to become the new permanent manager at Old Trafford. Ralf Rangnick, who joined Man Utd earlier in the season as interim boss, will step down at the end of the campaign to move into a consultancy role at the Premier League club. The Red Devils have failed to come close to winning the Premier League title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and the club’s hierarchy are determined to get their next appointment right. The most expensive player from each of the top 25 countries Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui have also been mentioned as potential choices, while Ten Hag has reportedly impressed in his first formal interview. Pochettino has been on United’s radar for a long time and the former Argentina international is being considered once again for the managerial role at Old Trafford. But ESPN claim that Pochettino ‘could be forced to wait until the end of the season to learn his fate asParis Saint-Germaincoach’, which risks his chances of landing the job at Man Utd. Following the French club’s exit from the Champions League it was understood that a parting of ways at the end of the season was likely, despite their march towards the Ligue 1 title. Apparently interest from the Red Devils has ‘complicated the Argentine’s situation’ with PSG looking for Man Utd to pay a ‘sizeable compensation fee for his services than allow him to move to Old Trafford for nothing if his contract in Paris is terminated first’. The Man Utd owners are ‘reluctant to spend a substantial sum on a compensation package’ with Pochettino now at ‘the centre of a stand-off’ between Man Utd and PSG. Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has denied rumours that he could become assistant manager at Old Trafford but he would be more than pleased to ‘crack the whip’ if asked to go back to United in the future. “Whoever has told you that, you need to go back to your source and say ‘listen man’. But if I did go in there – woo – the whip would be getting cracked!” Ferdinand said on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel. “Crack that whip. But no, no I’m not, man. I’m not going in there.” ",positive
652,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-man-utd-erik-ten-hag-liverpool-klopp-thiago,Of course these are Man Utd players. They just don’t believe,"The Mailbox features a defence of Man Utd’s under-performers. Also: plenty on Erik Ten Hag’s appointment; and Liverpool’s new tactical innovation. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Of course these United players care Just like every other United fan, I’ve been watching this season with an air of resignation. No belief in us improving or making progress. However I think a lot of those fans who slam the players as not caring are a little wrong. The players do care. But when you don’t believe in what your team can do, and the methods employed, it massively affects you. Have you ever worked for a boss who you thought was doing all the wrong things, with a company whose management you didn’t believe in? And it was being proven out by the results? How does that affect your morale? Your belief? And ultimately your effort? Massively. It might look like lack of effort, but it’s partly caused by lack of belief. Personally I think Rangnick had flopped. The team was much better under Ole last season. See the effort in the same set of players last season to keep coming back after half time? Why was that? Because they believed they could do it. Now that belief is gone. They haven’t bought into Rangnick and frankly I don’t think he improved them apart from tightening things up at the back. Our attacking output has been mega poor. Maybe he needed more time and different players, but the fact he was on a 6 month contract also affected things. The players knew he was gone in 6 months. Let’s see what Ten Hag can do with the players. I don’t buy that they don’t care. Of course United has huge issues top to bottom that need fixing, and whilst the Glazers are in charge we may never be at the top again simply because they have shown they care more about money. So who knows whether Ten Hag can actually succeed. However one way in which this appointment is a departure is we have brought in an up and coming manager who has won things, and has proven to punch above his weight. Maybe this is the Rangnick influence that we actually really needed more than on the pitch – changing how we approach everything behind the scenes. I’m sure I will be proven wrong, but I still can’t wait till next season to see how it goes. If it doesn’t start well, I’m going to be patient.Nishul Saperia (maybe the players who were leaving anyway cared a bit less…) Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man Utd, Merseyside derby, Eriksen  The size of Ten Hag’s task In goals: De Gea’s form has improved this year for sure but for 3 years, since the 2018 World Cup, he had been a total liability. His distribution is appalling (there is no way he would play for Pep or Klopp) and this will have to be an issue for a possession based manager like ten Haag. In every game you watch De Dea is responsible for at least one shocker of a kick out which puts Utd under immense pressure. Can Henderson do the job that’s needed? Maybe not. Work to be done here At the back: oh lordie! Full back positions are frighteningly bad. On the right one (Dalot) is shocking at the back and ok going forward while AWB is the reverse. Shaw is only consistent in being injured and Telles hasn’t been good enough in covering. So much work to do. Centre back: vast sums of money paid for Lindelof, Bailly , Maguire and Varane and not one of them is both reliable and up to CL qualification standard. Phil Jones remains in back up. What will ten Haag do with this? Midfield: Matic, Pogba, Mata and Lingard will all leave. McTominay and Fred are not good enough to compete with the very best, Bruno may recover, VDB hopefully can improve under his old coach but holy cow will this ever be the bare bones of a functioning midfield when Eric takes over? They could need 4x players in this area alone. Out wide: Mason Greenwood may never play for the club again, Tony Martial???, Rashford on the evidence of the last 2 years???, hopefully Elanga and Sancho benefit from the new boss having an actual style and philosophy, is there anyone else? Compare this lot to the options available at City, Pool, Chelsea, even Arsenal! Upfront: CR7 will surely leave and if he doesn’t is that even a good thing? Look at what’s happened in the dressing room/ at the club since he rejoined?! Cavani is going and that’s a good thing too – he is never available. There is nobody else. Charlie the young buck they bought from city a few years ago or some other youth player. These are the only options!!! And City or Pool will apparently land Haaland too. Wowzers Just where is this squad in comparison with the best, or even other top clubs in the division? It’s scary to consider as a Man Utd fan. The only good news is that 1) this clear out and rebuild is so desperately needed and 2) some of the players named above who are in the doldrums have previously looked world class at times (Shaw and Maguire at Euros, Rashford and Martial at their very best, bruno, sancho and so on). So there is some hope but first things first and ETH needs to cull the dressing room of all the distractions that haven’t wanted to be at the club for a number of years and create a whole new smell in that locker room. Then maybe the feel and taste on the pitch will be different. And lastly on the Glazers, sure they saddled the club with enormous debt and have had the wrong people manage the football side of it, but of course they want to compete at the top and have consistently invested in the playing squad to get us there. The failing is having a terrible structure in place to achieve it. I appreciate the enormity of this failing btw. The challenge for them is to get this right and continue to invest and just maybe we are seeing the sands shift here too. The zen master says ‘We’ll see’Mark  Optimism abounds I, like most man utd fans find it hard to trust the process. This was supposed to be what we went through under Solskjaer, we were promised; we would sign young talents and we would not sign superstars anymore, the coach will be supported in the market and man utd will return. We bought it, we believed and of course, they betrayed. Looking back, Ole did a worse job than I thought, doesn’t matter how good Maguire looked at Leicester, I don’t think it makes much sense to spend that much on a CB in the first phase of a rebuild just because there is a they believed (wrongly) that there was a precedent for it, and that is coming from someone who still rates Maguire. Wan bissaka and Telles are his biggest mess ups, you have to get better fullbacks. Did spending 50 million on Wan bissaka ever really make sense even if he was somehow as good defensively as they made him out to be? Sancho is good, but from Ole’s comments at the time, they bought him for the right wing, knowledge from his last two seasons at dortmund should inform you that he is more comfortable on the left, also, they paid 70 million for him and I have no qualms with it, but was there any hint of scouting in any of the purchases under Ole? Not even ‘good’ scouting, just scouting. James- Giggs recommended him. Wan bissaka- Had most tackles in the premier league the season before he was recruited. Fernandes- Portuguese sensation with insane goal contribution numbers. Telles- Plenty goals and assists for a fullback and was captain too, so hey, another leader. Sancho- Fans were practically begging for him and was the bundesliga’s best winger. Ronaldo- No explanation needed. Ighalo- Journeyman who did great for a half season at Watford. Maguire- Fans were prepared to kill to find out why he was not in the team of the season, very much popular with the media at the time. Varane- Explanation not necessary Heaton- Not necessary Donny- Ballon d’or nominee who they apparently thought was the same type of player as Bruno because they play the same position. Jones, Bailly and De gea also signed new contracts under him, throughly awful recruitment. The annoying thing is whenever he got a cohesive 11 on the pitch, United were more than capable of beating anyone under him and going on long runs. That said, the academy scouts at the club are not that bad, or so I think. But all this probably has more to do with the departed scouts and Woodward. As I seem to be an eternal optimist, I will always look towards the future believing it will be different, Woodward is gone, someone at that club seems to be thinking sensibly for the first time in a long time, appointing Rangnick was a very good decision, I said it then, and my stance does not change. Yes, I admit someone like Valverde with his lack of a particular style and more defensive setup may have done a better job firefighting and may have gotten top 4, but that will just be another in the long list of short term routes the club has taken, by appointing Rangnick, you have someone who creates a link between the interim and the final, someone who will be able to advice on Club structure, style, recruitment, transfer policy, and even on who the next manager should be. They followed up the strangely sensible decision to appoint Ralf with another, to appoint Ten Hag. It felt at one time as though they will take the very predictable route of PL experience, Pochettino or even Rodgers but they took what at the present time seems like a wise decision. Maybe Murtough is actually good at the job, his decision to appoint Rangnick lends to a belief that he is someone willing to learn actually how best to carry out his duties, if Mitchell comes, you can write him as someone who is willing to delegate duties and not try to take credit for everything because he will know very well that Rangnick and Mitchell are more household names and any success will therefore be associated with them and not him. Fletcher may just not be the useless technical director that believes he is The coach everyone seem to think he is. I choose to believe. Again. But this time cautiously, the coach is already a far better and more proven one than Ole, Woodward is gone and his replacement looks like another sensible person that wants to stick to what he can do, I don’t really care about the owners or the board because I am sure they will know as well that there is only so far they can go without on pitch success. The stadium is about to be repaired or rebuilt. The training ground will go before that. The new coach, it seems, has been allowed to choose his own staff which is a first since Ferguson. Rangnick just talks too much sense. Ten Hag has the highest win percentage of any manager in Eredivisie history, won Ajax their first league title since 2014, took them to their first semi final since 1996, beating in very supreme fashion, the Galacticos themselves. His two matches against Klopp were of particular interest to me, they lost both, but dominated much of both as well and with better quality up front, would have certainly won at least won of those matches. His record of improving every team he has coached and of returning Ajax to their perch as the best in the Netherlands appeals to me. The scouts who were in charge for the worst days of recruitment are gone. There is an actual movement towards the use of data and statistics at the club which was significant in the appointment of Ten Hag. Now, for the most important part, this summer window, will they go for obvious agent buys like Nunez, Rice, Phillips, Torres, or Milinkovic Savic? Or will they go down the right path, the liverpool path? We will have to wait and see. All things point towards an awakening of common sense at the club but is it just a mirage? For now, the important thing is that there is hope, and for people who have fallen as low as we have, hope is more than enough.Sa’ad  Ralph’s escape Lets start out by acknowledging how much of a disgrace Man Utd are, at all levels, from the Glazers all the way down to Harry Maguire. One man who seems to be sheltered from this criticism is Rangnick. The boss, the bloke in charge. We all know uniteds short comings. So as a manager its up to Ralph to either fix them, or put out a team that makes these short comings irrelevant or atleast far less relevant. So for example : United players arent fit/capable enough for an intense high press : Ok, set out a team to play on the counter (like Ole often did). Drill the teams on defensive solidity and quick counter attacks. We have the ingredients for this. Make it happen Ralph. Don’t enact a system that wont work OR one that wont be used by the incoming manager. United players lack desire : Ok, drop anyone not showing an interest. Pogba? Binned. Lingard? Binned. You dont wanna be here? Binned. Bring in the youth who, make no mistake, show just as much skill and desire as the mercenaries. Its not like you are dropping prime Messi here to set an example. You are dropping average (though expensive) players who have shown little skill, little desire and little end product for a number of years. A clearly underperforming player does not deserve to play. OR, you can play them in the biggest game of the year and watch them hobble off after 10 minutes, ready to make another wacky Tik Tok video. Ronaldo doesn’t fit the system : Ok, play him against the teams hes suitable to play against… drop him for the ones that require more pace/fitness/youth. Ronaldo has been obsolete in a number of games. Hes been world class in others. Figure it out. Which games suit his age/skills and which dont. Dont worry if HE wants to play or not. Do your job. Manage the situation. Harry Maguire : Drop him. Very very simple. Drop him. Hes terrible. Hes costing us points. Do your job as a manager and drop him. Grow a set of balls and do it. Bring in Bailly, Bring in Phil Jones, Bring in the tea lady, who cares… drop him. On reflection, it looks like the appointment of Rangnick was a complete waste of time. United shouldve just held on with Ole til the summer. However the clowns in charge decided to bring in a part time, maybe full time, maybe not manager, who would try a new system and then give up on the new system and then maybe realise that he shouldnt try anything as someone new was going to be in charge in a few months. None of it makes sense. There a huge amount of talent in that team. A better manager will get that talent working (with a few transfers thrown in of course). De Gea, Shaw, Varane, Fernandes, Pogba, Ronalda, Sancho, Cavani… thats the spine of a champions league winning team. All it needs is the right man to sort the useless bastards out.Shz  Seeds of doom Before writing in, I waited for the dust to settle and reflect on what passed on Tuesday. Similarly to Tim in a previous mailbox, I have been a United fan since the 70’s, seen a lot of downs and false dawns before the eventual rise under Fergie. This season has been like all of those years rolled into one, with the exception of the rise. There have been moments when I thought I could see progress and a discernable style of play , for those thoughts to be quickly washed away. The players are all capable but seem very week mentally. The is no toughness or determination in the side to dig in when things go wrong, they capitulate and leadership is lacking ( in a footballing sense, there is plenty of determination to make a few quid when the opportunity arises) To my eyes this is something that has come from the top down, has become a feature of the club and filtered through to the team. It became most evident at the end of last season when the club decided to throw in the towel and played a more or less reserve side against Leicester. At that point , there was still an opportunity to catch City, it may have been a false hope but you never give up, make the other team earn their prize. There seamed to be more importance put on stopping Liverpool’s top 4 challenge than our own league challenge and look how that’s worked out, a net 13-2 scoreline in games since and humiliation in abundance. This is not the united way, fight until the end and have some pride in your team. This was always the United way, even in the dark days on the early 80’s united rarely lost to Liverpool in the league and never by more than a goal, one time 3-1 down at Anfield with to 10 men, Robson and Strachan dragged them back to 3-3. The seeds of doom were sown by the mental attitude of the club last year vs Leicester, it will take a slash and burn approach to get things back on trackJD Different feel The hope/despair wheel turns on again. I do genuinely feel that this time, it could be different. Ten Hag is both a sensible and exciting appointment. He obviously understands the challenges involved, hence asking for control over transfers. The club obviously know that “sign whatever player the Twitter virgins ask for” scouting policy isn’t working as Bout and Lawlor are off. Clearly the deadwood (of which there is plenty) is being quietly (or publicly) shipped out. Pogba will leave (unambiguously a good thing, not least to be shot of his agent). The kits are as good as they’ve been since 2009 (look you cling to things like this when you lose to Liverpool twice by an aggregate of 9-0). And the youth team genuinely looks to be at its’ strongest for a generation. The wage bill will be slashed – all six out of contract players will leave, maybe Bailly, Jones, Martial, Ronaldo, Telles and Dalot could follow (there is no market for AWB). Garner, Hannibal and Williams, maybe Garnacho, Mengi and Laird could all get a look-in next season. We may even swap out De Gea (which in some ways would be a shame but we do need someone who can actually play football). Personally I’d prioritise rejuvenating Shaw, Maguire and Rashford and build around what’s left. Either way, whilst we could conceivably DO worse, I think we’re at rock bottom for morale. The only way is up.Jonny, MUFC  Next season’s headlines Everyone has their take on United and Ten Hag, I’m just gonna predict next year’s headlines: ERIK-tile disfunction! – Ten Hag’s men are joint 19th in the league in headers won – Nov 19th Erik Ten MAN Hag! – United finish second game in a row with 10 men as Hannibal sent off in 73rd min at the Ethiad after coming on as a sub in the 70th – Dec 4th Hannibal LECTURED – Ten Hag said he had a discussion with Mejbri after his recent elbow drop on Kyle Walker after coming on as a sub recently against their cross city rivals – Dec 6th Eric Ten HAGGLE – Eric has reportedly been searching for a low cost defender to bring depth to his defence after Maguire’s season ending injury last month, despite not conceding a goal in the 4 games since Maguire’s unfortunate collision with the goalpost – Jan 15thJamin, Montreal Reverse passes are the new black One of the many joys of watching this era Liverpool is Klopp’s ability to successfully implement under-the-radar tweaks in style that become significant. In the title winning season it was obvious early on that long diagonal balls from and between Robbo and Trent had been drilled all pre season. One goal in particular I’ll remember forever – 66 to 26 to Salah, bounce over the defender, headed in. Breathtaking. Call it route 1, call it anything I don’t care. This season it’s the reverse pass. In the beginning when it was just Bobby I thought oh well, some Brazilian flair there. Now it’s everywhere…Hendo, Fab, Thiago, Trent, Mo. The apogee may well be Mane’s no look, first time, around the corner ball straight to Salah from the other night. I defy any neutral to not watch that goal on repeat and not just smile. But what it really reinforces is what’s been said about Klopp/Pep versus a different school of manager (eg Mourinho) about the extent to which forward play should be drilled. The former believe these moves can and be should be drilled nonstop, the latter that anything mechanical breaks down under pressure and therefore better to rely on a piece of brilliance from a brilliant player. On the evidence of the number and quality of goals scored this season from reverse passes, I’m firmly with the former.Aussie Red  ",positive
653,https://www.football365.com/news/ten-hag-interview-man-utd-chiefs-complete-shock,Ten Hag interview left two Man Utd chiefs ‘in complete shock’,"Erik ten Hag eviscerated the Man Utd set-up over the course of two interviews for the manager’s position. Ten Hag is expected to be named the permanent successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in due course, replacing Ralf Rangnick after the interim head coach’s struggles to turn the club around. Man Utd are 7th in the Premier League and in danger of not even qualifying for European competition next season, giving Ten Hag plenty of ammunition in talks with the hierarchy. Ten Hag can fix Manchester United – but only if they let him The Dutchman is said to have used it to make scathing points about the club’s failed recruitment and haphazard scouting in particular. Ten Hag gave a ‘brutal assessment’ of Manchester United’s shortcomings in an initial interview last month with technical director Darren Fletcher and football director John Murtough. The pair visited the Ajax manager in Amsterdam and were given what The Sun exclusively describe as ‘a no-holds-barred dressing down’, after which they returned to Manchester ‘in complete shock’. In a second round of talks withchief executive Richard Arnold, Ten Hag then “ripped the United set-up apart,” according to an unnamed source, who added: “It was like United were being interviewed byTen Hagrather than the other way round.” Club officials are said to have needed ‘a few days to digest’ the criticism before deciding that instead of being ‘put out’, his ‘frank assessment and vision’ had ‘impressed’ them. It was reported earlier this week that Man Utd had reached a verbal agreement in principle to appoint Ten Hag this summer, with written contracts expected to be finalised and signed at some point after Sunday’s Dutch Cup final. Ajax and Ten Hag are understandably reluctant for the Eredivisie club’s season to be impacted too heavily by any announcement, considering they lead the league table by four points and can secure the first leg of what would be a third double of the 52-year-old’s five-year reign by beating bitter rivals PSV at the weekend. Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly already been told he can leave Old Trafford at the end of the season as he does not fit into Ten Hag’s plans for the future. Numerous other players could also go, with Paul Pogba, Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani and Lee Grant all in the final months of their current deals. ",negative

Tuchel’s future at Chelsea has been thrown into doubt following the government imposed sanctions on their owner Roman Abamovich. READ MORE: Sh*tshow v Sh*thouses: Another Manchester United fallout mailbox The German boss has impressed on and off the pitch since joining the Blues at the start of last year, winning the Champions League in his debut season and speaking well on Chelsea’s current predicament. The Guardian claim ‘the London club’s predicament has alerted the United hierarchy’ who are ‘monitoring his situation’. Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag were thought to be the frontrunners for the role but this latest report confirms Tuchel is on the shortlist. Meanwhile,Tuchel has vowed to meet his “responsibility” to Chelsea’s behind-the-scenes employees who continue to fret for their futures. “I have the feeling that it is our responsibility to focus on what we do well and that is football and doing everything to win matches,” said Tuchel. “We can’t influence the situation, we are not responsible for the situation. “But we have our responsibility, because we are in the spotlight and we have these games. “It’s a responsibility to our talent but also to every employee of Chelsea. There are a lot of people that I see on a daily basis who are worried and who have worked here for decades. “They are not so famous but they are worried for a pretty close future, they wonder if things will be alright. “So for all of them, it’s important to have the attitude right and also to focus on that and see the responsibility and what this means to these people. Even if it’s just for 90 minutes.” Next up for Chelsea is a trip to France to play Lille in the Champions League round of 16. Tuchel has insisted that Chelsea “will arrive and fight hard” in spite of the difficulties facing them: “We have to deal with it. There are things to talk about, like how to arrive at games. “Things that are normally taken care of, but now we have to stick together, give our opinions, and then we have to find solutions. There are subjects we don’t usually discuss but now we will. “We have a framework to go to Lille and play in Lille. There will be no excuses. It is already more difficult to arrange things in the best way possible for the FA Cup, but we will deal with it. “As long as we have shirts, as long as we are alive, we will arrive and fight hard for our success. “We owe it to the people who normally support us in an invisible way.” ",positive
655,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-man-utd-next-manager-luis-enrique-cheaper-ten-hag-pochettino,Money should never come into Luis Enrique decision,"Why would Man Utd – or any other club – refuse to pay big money to appoint the right manager? They’ll certainly cough up to sack the wrong one… Even for a club with the most muddled priorities in football, a club that seems to have made every mistake possible in recent years, the latest update on Manchester United’s manager search still prompts exasperation. Approaching the conclusion of a season which is already destined to end in failure, regardless of however they might sell an unlikely top-four finish, the focus is turning to the future and who might shape it from the Old Trafford dug-out. It looked to be a two-horse race, with Erik ten Hag seemingly pulling ahead of Mauricio Pochettino last week on the basis that United have interviewed the Ajax manager. Pochettino is set to be grilled too, while Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui are also still in the running. Enrique appears to be closing in on the frontrunners, with reports over the weekend suggesting the current Spain manager has ‘many admirers’ at Old Trafford. Why wouldn’t he? Future Man Utd manager (?) Luis Enrique: The ridiculous stats The 51-year-old has a stellar record from his spell in charge of Barcelona and he is credited with helping to rebuild the Spain national team with young talent. Lionel Messi credits him as one of the two best managers he has worked with (the other being Pep Guardiola), while Thiago Alcantara sees in Enrique a combination of the current City and Liverpool bosses. “Luis Enrique has the analytical positioning of Pep and the aggressiveness of Jurgen Klopp.” His credentials are clear. But United are said to be just as attracted to another of the Spaniard’s qualities: he’s cheap. For reasons unknown but not remotely surprising, that apparently matters to one of the world’s richest clubs looking to make the most important appointment in a decade. As the Daily Mail puts it, Enrique ‘would be attractive from a financial perspective, with United not having to pay top dollar to prise him away from the national team’. It’s true that hiring Enrique would not require a hefty compensation package with his Spain contract currently due to expire after the Qatar World Cup. In the middle of an international break news vacuum, a simple rehash of the terms of Enrique’s deal could be enough to grab the headlines. But Mike Keegan is well enough connected to theinsiders cited as the source of his story that we cannot simply dismiss cost as a major consideration in United’s thinking. It certainly tallies with what we all already know of the United hierarchy. Whereas most clubs would prioritise the best candidate for the huge job, the board at Old Trafford will doubtless want to know ‘how much?’ as urgently as what plans prospective candidates may have to restore United’s credibility.  This is the worst possible time for the Glazers to indulge in a spot of penny-pinching. Even without considering the financial aspect, few outsiders would trust those on the inside to make the right call. If compensation is a genuine factor, all hope really is lost. For any manager, attainable or otherwise, it is hardly as though United would have to write a heftier cheque than those they have written countless times before. It has always been one of football’s oddities, that clubs are willing to spend far, far less on managers than on the players they expect to be managed. Until the time comes to sack them, that is. United themselves paid £19.6million to sack Jose Mourinho. Only one manager in history has cost more to hire: Julian Nagelsmann, when Bayern Munich forked out £25million to recruit him from RB Leipzig. But when it comes to players, United have spent £25million on around 25 occasions. They paid twice that for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. But now they might baulk over the comparative peanuts it would take to get Ten Hag or Pochettino out of their current clubs? Reaching a verdict upon the best man for the nigh-on-impossible job is a decision riddled with nuances. Would Ten Hag’s Ajax methods wash with United’s pampered players? Should United be wary of Pochettino’s lack of silverware? Can the club afford to prolong their current drift to the end of the year to wait for Enrique? The Glazers, John Murtough and whoever else has a say in the matter have enough to consider and no room for error. In this instance, cost simply cannot be a factor.  ",positive

There have been widespread reports over the past couple of days that Ajax boss Ten Hag has now accepted an offer to become the new permanent boss at Old Trafford. He has reportedly beaten Mauricio Pochettino, Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui to the role with the Dutchman impressing the Man Utd hierarchy in the interview process. Ten Hag can fix Manchester United – but only if they let him Numerous managers have tried and failed to return Man Utd to the top of English football since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013. And Ferdinand believes Ten Hag is taking “a risk” by becoming the new Man Utd boss as it has the potential to taint his reputation. Speaking on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel, Ferdinand said: “I’ve got to take my hat off to him because this is a risk. Many managers have been spat out here and he has good stock in the game at the moment. “He’s valued and looked at as a very good coach and he’s coming in and he’s risking that. “We’ve seen many managers now with far more experience, who have won much more than Ten Hag, bigger reputations, who have come in and been chewed up by this football club and spat out. And the players are still the same. “So he has to find a way of getting in there and managing the characters, the personalities and the egos that are in there. And I know I sound like a broken record but the thing he has to do first is change the culture, bring the new culture and drive it. He has to do that, it’s a massive part of if he’s going to be successful.” But Ferdinand thinks that Ten Hag’s time in charge of Bayern Munich’s second string could stand him in good stead ahead of his arrival at Man Utd. Ferdinand added: “He has been at the background at a big club – Bayern Munich are a huge club, one of the biggest in the world. He was in the building at Bayern Munich when Pep was there. “He understands what it is like at a big club with huge demands – something what Man United will be like. “And most importantly he has been around big players, sat in the background and watched – seen how they are handled by Pep and his staff and seen how they react to certain situations. So he has the experience of being around big players.” ",positive

MAILBOX: Liverpool fans are the luckiest in the world, bad for city if Everton go down “I didn’t want to hear those details but I did,” he said. “It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. “We need to play a perfect game. We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. “We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season.” Liverpool completely dominated the midfield battle at Anfield last week with Thiago Alcantara, in his best form since joining the club at the start of last season, the man of the match. Emery accepts they cannot allow that to happen again. “They played a tremendous game at Liverpool,” he said of the Reds’ midfield. “Thiago was man of the match, Fabinho has been fantastic at Liverpool. “They are two players who can play really good football but they have the work-rate and intensity and they were at a world-class level at Liverpool (last week). “If the player of the match is again a Liverpool player we will be out for sure but if it is one of ours we can be there.” There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. “Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,” said the Villarreal boss. “I don’t know to what extent he will be fit for contention.

We’ve done an XI of Big Six stars in need of a step down, so of course we’ve lazily done the reverse. Here’s an XI of Premier League players ready to step up. GK: Jose Sa The best Premier League save percentage (83.1%) by a distance and only two goalkeepers – Illan Meslier (121) and David de Gea (112) – have made more saves than Sa’s 109 this season. He’snot bad with his feet either. If Erik ten Hag is ‘concerned’ by David de Gea…  RB: Tariq Lamptey Well, this is embarrassing. Chelsea sold Lamptey in January 2020 for £1m and he’s now worth easily 20 times that much. Arsenal were interested before the turn of the year and Manchester United, who will definitely be in the market for a right-back, are also thought to be keen on the little menace.  CB: Max Kilman Part of the fourth meanest defence in the Premier League, the 24-year-old – plucked from Non League Maidenhead in 2018 – has caught the eye of Chelsea through his displays in a breakout season for Wolves under Bruno Lage.  CB: Marc Guehi Well, this is even more embarrassing. Chelsea sold Guehi – who has since become a full England international – to Crystal Palace for £21m in the summer, have spent much of the time since scrabbling around for viable centre-back options (Malang Sarr, FFS) and now face losing three defenders for next to nothing. Reports suggest the Blues already want Guehi back. Sigh.  LB: Marc Cucurella A solid defender who’s comfortable in possession and a real danger in the final third, Cucurella’s been a brilliant signing for Brighton. Could easily slot into any Champions League side and not look overawed or out of place.  CM: Declan Rice With West Ham valuing him at £150m, Rice will likely be out of reach ofevery Premier League club but Manchester City, who reportedly aren’t interested. But the best box-to-box midfielder in the Premier League should really be playing Champions League football, and while Rice doesn’t seem like the sort to down tools or force through a move, he must be yearning for the opportunity to play in games like those we’ve been treated to in this season’s showcase competition. Best win the Europa League, Declan.  CM: Yves Bissouma Just like David Moyes with Rice, Graham Potter got a little tired of the questions surrounding Bissouma’s future in January. Pretty much every Big Six side has been linked with the Mali international – who frequents the top of the tackles and interception charts in the Premier League – at one time or another. Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs could all do with someone like him, but their need is dwarfed by that of Manchester United, who should be rolling out a McFred-stained carpet for the Brighton midfielder.  AM: Jarrod Bowen The winger looked like the most Liverpool of Liverpool signings before they plumped for Luis Diaz in January. A departure of one of the fab five (Firmino, perhaps?) could still see Jurgen Klopp’s side chase the West Ham star, but he seems to be the sort of player who will rise to the challenge at any club. He’s a real pain in the ass in the best possible way and 26 goal contributions in all competitions is a very decent return.  AM: Conor Gallagher Fortunately Chelsea didn’t further f*** themselves in the summer having only allowed Gallagher to leave the club on loan. It’s worked brilliantly for player, parent club and Crystal Palace, who have helped to develop the midfielder into someone who’s now well placed to be on the plane to Qatar this winter. That was unthinkable after his dire spell at West Brom the season before. He’s more than ready to be a serious part of Thomas Tuchel’s squad at Chelsea.  AM: Raphinha A Brazil international, almost certain to have earned a place in the national squad for the World Cup, will not be playing Championship football next season. And actually, whether Leeds go down or not, it’s unlikely he will remain in West Yorkshire. There were widespread claims in March that he had agreed terms with Barcelona, and if the Catalans don’t follow through, another European giant surely will – the guy can do special things with a football.  ST: Ivan Toney He’s scored 12 goals, laid on four assists, created 257 chances for Bryan Mbeumo to miss and continues to appear in videos slating the team he plays for. Toney clearly thinks he’s a bit big time and he probably is. It’s almost weird that he doesn’t already play for Arsenal.  ",positive

665,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-bournemouth-remain-in-pole-position-to-return-to-the-top-flight-but-its-tightening-solanke-mitrovic,"Bournemouth remain in pole but Forest, Huddersfield are lurking","Bournemouth scored a late goal to rescue a draw against Fulham; with Huddersfield and Forest breathing down their necks, every point matters. At this late stage of the season, the tiniest of margins can make a huge difference. The previous few games had been uncomfortable for Bournemouth. They’ve only spent a couple of weeks outside the Championship play-off places, but as a return to the Premier League after two seasons started to come into view, nerves set in. Prior to the arrival of Fulham at the Vitality Stadium they’d failed to win three of their previous four games, failing to score each time. Fulham are already bound for the Premier League, although they arrived on Dorset off the back of some shaky results and in need of a win to sew up the Championship title, too. But when Aleksandar Mitrovic scored his 41st goal of the season in as many Championship appearances – a record which hasn’t received anything like the comment it should have done; a goal a game over a whole season is almost unheard of – Bournemouth had to labour to get themselves back into the match. They were already fully aware of the continually shrinking gap to the teams below them. Nottingham Forest were winning at Peterborough United by a goal to nil, while Huddersfield Town had beaten Barnsley the night before. Both results kept them in contention for an unlikely automatic promotion place while relegating their opponents. But just as Fulham were getting ready to start their title-winning party, the champagne had to be quietly put back on ice. Harry Wilson was penalised for a foul on Adam Smith and, with Fulham coach Marco Silva having earned himself a red over his angry protests to the officials, Dominic Solanke stepped up. Eight minutes into stoppage time, he rescued Bournemouth what might just turn out to be their most valuable point of the season. Bournemouth haven’t been on some sort of alarming slump. Their 2-0 loss to Steve Bruce’s malfunctioning West Bromwich Albion a couple of weeks ago had been a surprisingly tepid performance. Goalless draws against Sheffield United and Middlesbrough were still halfway acceptable results when facing play-off hopefuls. But bit by bit, a completely commanding position has been chipped away at, to the point that their advantage over third-placed Huddersfield is now down to just two points. The Terriers do only have two games left, while Bournemouth and Forest, five points back, have four. And it still feels as though Bournemouth should have enough about them to get over the line, but there’s already one further twist in the tail: two of Forest’s remaining matches are against the top two.  There’s still a chance that Huddersfield or Forest could yet catch Bournemouth. The former can only look back ruefully on a four-day period during March when they were beaten in successive games by the Cherries and Millwall. Other than that, they’ve not been beaten in the Championship since the end of November. At that point, they were in 11th. Had they not spent so much of the first half of the season playing like a mid-table team, they may have been pushing Fulham for the league title by now. Forest, meanwhile, have only dropped 12 points from the 15 league games they’ve played in 2022 so far. Their disastrous start to the season under Chris Hughton, rendered largely forgotten by replacement Steve Cooper, may be coming back to bite them. It certainly seems difficult to believe Forest took just one point from their first seven league matches and were bottom in the middle of September. They have impressed both in the league and the FA Cup, where they knocked out Arsenal, Leicester and Huddersfield before succumbing to Liverpool in the quarter-finals. It’s been one hell of a turnaround, regardless of what happens next. Both of these clubs would fancy their chances in the play-offs, but the end of the normal league season can have a peculiar effect on the psychology of a team. A few weeks ago, supporters of either Huddersfield or Forest would likely have been happy enough to accept a place. At the end of February, for example, Bournemouth were two points ahead of Huddersfield but with four games in hand on them, while Forest were down in ninth. But when the possibility of automatic promotion starts to take hold, the disappointment of failing to achieve it can have a disastrous knock-on effect in the actual play-offs. At the start of November, Bournemouth were 18 points ahead of Nottingham Forest. Now it’s just 5… 👀#NFFC #AFCB pic.twitter.com/wHXjwgAtG6 — The Second Tier (@secondtierpod) April 23, 2022  Huddersfield, with just two games to play, have left it too late to catch Bournemouth. But Forest may still feel it is achievable, especially considering they still have play Bournemouth in one of their four remaining matches. They need to keep winning but have the momentum to do that. Neither club would want to miss out on automatic promotion by a hair’s breadth and then have to face the challenges of the play-offs. Even Scott Parker seems a little on edge; he claimed after the match that Mitrovic’s goal might not have fully crossed the line, even though the Championship has Goal Line Technology. There have been rumours that the GLT may have been faulty, but these are completely unconfirmed and wouldn’t make any difference now anyway. And regardless of any of this, as the home club, presumably ensuring that this technology is working properly is to some extent Bournemouth’s responsibility. So Solanke’s late, late equaliser was important. It extended Bournemouth’s lead over Huddersfield from one point to two, and the adrenaline rush of a late goal might be very beneficial to the psychology of the team at this vital stage. Forest are only one goal worse off than Bournemouth, which makes it likely that things would benefit them if it comes down to goal difference. As such, every point Bournemouth can rescue could make the difference between playing in the Premier League next season or not, and the scrap for the remaining promotion places is about to get tenser than ever.

Loftus-Cheek has performed well in recent weeks in a hybrid role mixing right wing-back and centre midfield. The 26-year-old suffered a torn Achilles in 2019 but he now seems to have recovered from this injury. One per Premier League club: Reasons why they should sign Pogba The one-time England man has even been tipped in some quarters to resurrect his international career ahead of this autumn’s World Cup. Blues boss Tuchel has been left impressed with Loftus-Cheek’s drive towards top form, but insisted that the Chelsea academy graduate can ill afford to be satisfied with his progress. “He needs to push himself to the limit; he needs to be physical,” said Tuchel. “Had a bit of a shy game against Arsenal, like everyone. A calm first-half against Crystal Palace and stepped up in the second-half physically and with ball recoveries and dribbles. “Suddenly the crowd was there too. This is what we demand from him. He is a calm person. He needs to discover this monster in him and unleash this on a regular basis because it is absolutely necessary. “It is not enough to be just on the pitch. Maybe if you regard his last years, it may seem good because he is a regular but this is not enough. We cannot let him think it is enough, he needs to constantly push himself. “We try every day and are quite successful given his development. He needs to understand how much potential he has and unleash this physical capacity on the daily. “In training he cannot let loose. He needs to be under pressure and play every game like a cup final.” Tuchel hopes England star Reece James will be able to feature in Thursday’s Premier League trip to Manchester United, having sat out Sunday’s 1-0 win over West Ham due to twinges in his hamstrings. James has impressed at both right centre-back and right wing-back this term, and Tuchel believes the 22-year-old’s next developmental step will be to add consistency to his availability. “I’m a bit more into that his very best position is wing-back, where he is perhaps even more decisive, even more useful, but it is more demanding,” said Tuchel. “The next step is to be a regular player for more than 50, 55, 60 matches, and from there we have to decide that those positions are filled with top quality with him.” ",positive
667,https://www.football365.com/news/jesus-arsenal-negotiations-done-dusted-talks-edu-manchester-city,Edu talks with Jesus ‘done and dusted’ as Arsenal close in,"Arsenal technical director Edu’s efforts to convince Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus and his representatives to sign for the club are ‘done and dusted’, according to reports. The Athletic journalist David Ornstein reported last week that Arsenal were interested in bringing the Brazilian to the Emirates Stadium in the summer transfer window. Despite the two clubs not being in contact over the deal, Ornstein has revealed that Edu and Jesus’ representatives have been talking for months and have already successfully concluded negotiations. One per Premier League club: Reasons why they should sign Pogba Speaking on The Athletic Football Podcast, Ornstein added more meat to the bones: “Well the situation all revolves around Manchester City’s pursuit of Erling Haaland because the likelihood is there’s going to be an opportunity for Gabriel Jesus to leave this summer if City get Haaland, which we expect them to do, or another striker if they don’t. “Then with Jesus coming towards the end of his contract, he’s approaching his final 12 months, he’s had limited game time at City of course and there haven’t been any suggestions that he’ll be signing a new deal. “Then that gives the opportunity for clubs to take him. Arsenal have been fans of him for a while, Mikel Arteta knows him well from working at City, Edu knows him well because he’s also a Brazilian and Edu is close to the representatives of Gabriel Jesus from the time Edu spent working at Corinthians and the Brazil national team. “I understand they have been talking for a number of months about this possibility, to the extent that that part of negotiations is, from what I hear, pretty much done and dusted. But there has been no contact, to my knowledge, so far between the clubs. “So that’s obviously a significant step that would need to be taken but the early indications are that this is a move that Gabriel Jesus would be open to. And he is the profile of striker that Mikel Arteta is looking to bring in. I think they want to bring in two forwards and the way he can drop deep from the striker position and also pull wide is something that appeals to them. So as things stand Arsenal are the favourites to sign Gabriel Jesus but nothing is done.” ",positive

He has grabbed 23 goals and four assists from his 41 appearances this term. Arsenal and Spurs are actually consistently over-achieving Arsenal are likely to sign a new striker this summer. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in February, while Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are out of contract in June. Abraham has been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United in recent weeks. Petit has praised Abraham as he has been “brilliant” for Roma this season: “Abraham reminds me of Emmanuel Adebayor, his physical presence in the penalty area,” Petit said (quotes via The Mirror). “Abraham’s reaction when he arrived at Roma has been brilliant because he’s scored 15 [league] goals and has so many assists, so he’s enjoying his football there. He went to Italy with the feeling of revenge for what happened at Chelsea. “He’s not stupid, he will see what’s going on with the strikers at Chelsea with Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, they’re struggling. So maybe he’s thinking, ‘it would have been worse for me if I had stayed at Chelsea’. He made the right decision and he’s having a great season with Roma. “I’m pretty sure he wants to come back to England and he would fit perfectly at Arsenal because he’s a different player to Alexandre Lacazette with a different style, different physique and he’s a goalscorer. “Even at Chelsea he was scoring goals, not as many as he wanted, but he’s 24 years old so he still has a lot to learn.” Petit went onto warn Arsenal against signing Crystal Palace standout Wilfried Zaha: “I love watching Zaha. He’s an electric player. He can be strange on the pitch sometimes, with his provocations. But I really liked his reactions against Arsenal, he controlled his reactions, he was smiling, he was very confident. It should be like that for every game. “Of course, he would fit in well at Arsenal. But my question would be, what do you do with Gabriel Martinelli? Martinelli has been very good since his injury and he’s following in the same footsteps of Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka. This is the next generation of Arsenal players and if you brought in Zaha then he’d play regular football and Martinelli would be on the bench. “So I’m not quite sure about that. Arsenal need competition in their squad, for sure, but when you see the prospect of young players, you have to be very careful with the players you bring into the club.” ",positive

Alli’s form has declined over the past few seasons. He became a bit-part player for Tottenham and this led to him joining Everton permanently in January. The Englishman has only started once in the Premier League for the Toffees following this move. Ranking the PL teams by goals scored in 2022, because Spurs Abraham meanwhile signed for Roma from Chelsea last summer. Jose Mourinho’s side paid £34m to sign him. The forward has been in superb form for the Italian side this season. He has netted 23 goals across all competitions. The ex-Chelsea star believes Alli could benefit from a move abroad as different leagues should not be “knocked down”: “I feel like people shouldn’t be afraid to move abroad or to move away,” said Abraham (via The Express). “They say ‘the Premier League is the best league in the world’. Of course, it has got top-quality. “But don’t knock down different leagues. These leagues aren’t easy. Coming to Serie A. I never thought it would be easy. But coming to experience life away is probably the best thing I have done. “It has given me the confidence to experience different cultures. People the way people engrave football in their skins, especially at Roma. The fans are so passionate. So, I recommend players shouldn’t be afraid to move out of their comfort zone. There is a bigger world out there than just England.” Elsewhere, Simon Jordan thinks Alli is wasting everyone’s time at Everton: “He’s been there for two months, he’s a complete and utter waste of time. “He was a waste of time at Tottenham for two years, he’s been a waste of time being signed for Everton. It was a waste of time signing.” Jordan added: “I hope I’m wrong, because the boy was talented. I don’t think he was ever at the level people built him up to and saying he was the best No. 10 in the world. “…He’s in a situation now where he’s been dropkicked out of Tottenham, the only reason Everton took him was because the actual fee itself was deferred and played into the long grass based upon performance. “So, based upon performance, Everton will get a rebate. The kid’s got to be embarrassed. Is there any level of professional pride? “You’ve been booted out of Tottenham, two or three managers didn’t want you… I think Frank Lampard should look at himself for signing players like Dele Alli because he needed help, not a compounding of the problem.” ",positive

And the striker confirmed Southgate has been in touch. Abraham added:“He sent me a message prior to the international break. “I think he watched my Lazio game, he was telling me loved the way I played, loved how passionate I was and I need to carry on that mentality and hunger. “It’s nice to know you’re being acknowledged even when playing away from England.” ",positive

First of all, it’s just being back playing football, then there’s always the small bits in between of what is the goal. I’m definitely looking forward to Saturday for sure.” When asked if he will celebrate if he scores against his former team, the Dane responded:“Probably not.” Eriksen also reflected on his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and insisted that he would not have made a return if it wasn’t wise for his health. He said: “I remember getting the throw-in, but obviously I don’t remember falling down. I then woke up with people around me, but I don’t really know what’s happened until I’m in the hospital. “For me, if there was a risk, I wouldn’t come back. It was that easy. They did all the testing, I went three months without doing anything, just getting the mind and the family [right], getting used to still being here. “Then the training started, bit by bit, building up slowly, but at the same time, getting control of what I can control and trying to test the heart. I have an ICD, so if anything did happen, I’m safe. “But in the end, there’s no risk of me going back to play so there’s no reason for me to stop our normal life because there’s not a doctor saying ‘you shouldn’t do it’, then it’s a completely different conversation with my family. But it was ‘good, we can do it, test it out’. All the tests were good and then there was no point of having the thought of not playing again.” ",positive

It’s also a biggie for Tactics Tom and Christian Eriksen. Game to watch – Arsenal v Man Utd The weekend kicks off with one of the most pivotal games as the Premier League’s shiniest sh*te competition approaches a calamitously-exciting ending. What are we to expect from United’s trip to Arsenal? F*** knows. The hosts were in pole position for the final Champions League spot, then they lost three on the spin to Palace, Southampton and Brighton. So obviously they then went to Chelsea, scored four and claimed all three points. United? Well, we can be a little more certain of what to anticipate from United. Nothing. That’s what they offered at Anfield on Tuesday night when a season of perpetual disappointment slumped to a new, horrifying low. One that prompted United to rush through the announcement of Erik ten Hag as the latest sucker to sit in the hot-seat from next season. Might that news and the knowledge that the new manager is watching provoke any kind of spark from Ralf Rangnick’s players? It really ought to. As much as United fans might want to dump the entire squad with the odd exception, many of these players will still be around when Ten Hag throws out the cones in pre-season. There must be some professional pride buried under all the apathy and self-interest to motivate some of these under-performers to make a rather more positive impression on the new gaffer in the final five games. And, somehow, United are still in contention for the top four. These sh*tehawks can still qualify for the Champions League. A United victory at the Emirates would leave them, Arsenal and Spurs all tied on 57 points, even if the Red Devils have played a game more. But since Arsenal and Spurs are yet to meet and there’s b*gger all chance that any of them will go the remainder of the season without dropping points, fourth is still very much up for grabs. In that respect, Saturday feels more must-win for United than Arsenal. But the Gunners are all about momentum, with the mood at the Emirates changing with the prevailing wind. To beat Chelsea then lose to this United would be very Arsenal, which is exactly the image they need to shake.  Player to watch – Christian Eriksen When Tottenham have digested the result from the Emirates on Saturday afternoon, their focus must turn to Brentford, whom they visit in the evening kick-off. Spurs have some bouncing back of their own to do this weekend after a hugely impressive run of form was brought to a shuddering halt by Brighton. The result, and the late nature of it, was bad enough but the performance offered a depressing reality check for any Spurs fans optimistic that Antonio Conte had shed them of their Spursiness. Brentford offer an intriguing challenge after the Bees’ own resurgence in recent weeks. Only a few weeks ago, Thomas Frank’s side looked in danger of being sucked into the relegation fight, but after five wins in six and victories this month over capital rivals Chelsea and West Ham and London-ish Watford, Brentford find themselves one point off the top half. Eriksen has been central to that revival after his own personal resurrection, with the Denmark star scoring once and offering a couple of assists in his last four games. Spurs know Eriksen well, of course, as does Conte after the pair worked together at Inter Milan. Indeed, reports suggest the manager is keen to be reunited with the playmaker this summer. But more immediately, Spurs need to find a way to deprive Eriksen of the space to pull Brentford’s strings. Which could see one of Conte’s favourites and the recipient of a new five-year contract, Oliver Skipp, return to the XI for the first time in three months. 🎙 “To meet him tomorrow for a game will be a pleasure for me” Antonio Conte on Christian Eriksen 💙 pic.twitter.com/1x4V0qRrz6 — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) April 21, 2022   Team to watch – Everton Normally, before a Premier League derby, we might spin a chasm between cross-city rivals with some old trope about form going out of the window. But who in good faith can make a genuine case for Everton at Anfield on Sunday? Manchester United fans trekked to Liverpool on Tuesday night with little genuine prospect of victory and next it’s the Toffees’ turn to cross Stanley Park on what appears to be little more than a fool’s errand. Anything other than an absolute pasting would probably be accepted by most Evertonians now. That might sound odd given what’s at stake for the Premier League’s fourth-from-bottom side. But Frank Lampard would willingly accept no improvement in their status in the coming week or so as long as things don’t get any worse. “We have to understand that the table might continue to look somewhat like it does for the next couple of weeks. And then we can look at the fixtures going on from that. But, for the players, they just have to focus game-by-game – because anything can happen in football. That’s why I’m not talking us down before Liverpool, because we have to go there with the belief and spirit to try and do something.” As Lampard will have learned from his three-month reign so far, the need for spirit or belief is never enough alone to generate either. Another injury-time goal against Leicester on Wednesday might help, though that was supposed to have been the case after Newcastle were beaten last month. A few days later, Lampard was questioning Everton’s “bollocks” after being turned over at Palace in the cup. But he’s right: for the sake of morale, Everton have to “try and do something”, which would at least better United’s Anfield effort. If Burnley buck up, they could plunge Lampard’s lads into the bottom three by the time they host Chelsea a week on Sunday. That prospect in the wake of a derby humiliation should be terrifying for the Toffees. Manager to watch – Thomas Tuchel Some managers have mastered their poker face; others find it impossible to keep it on the inside. Tuchel is firmly in the second camp, and we kinda love him for it. The Chelsea boss could not hide his disgust with Chelsea for the manner of their defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday. He attempted some piffle about the pitch at Stamford Bridge but seemed to realise straight away it wasn’t serving as the distraction he hoped. It was a chastening night for everyone at Chelsea. Tuchel’s frustrations were shared by the fans, who jeered record signing Romelu Lukaku after he was hooked again, and argued with captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who seemed more ready for some to-and-fro than the bloke who sparked it. Some frustration is understandable, especially in the limbo Chelsea exist in until the sale of the club is complete. And their home record is certainly a concern; losing to Arsenal made it three Stamford Bridge defeats on the bounce for the first time in 29 years. But the sense of crisis around Chelsea feels somewhat extreme when you consider that they remain snug in third place with an FA Cup final on the horizon. Still, Tuchel has some work to do to ensure that streak of home defeats doesn’t extend to four against a rather more buoyant West Ham on Sunday. Picking a stronger back three would be a start. Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised to see Chelsea cave in the absence of Thiago Silva and Antonio Rudiger, but Tuchel needs to find a way to cope without both, especially in the case of the German approaching free agency.  EFL game to watch –Huddersfield Town v Barnsley This Friday night Yorkshire derby has plenty on it for both sides. If the Terriers triumph, they are guaranteed a play-off place. If Barnsley lose, they will be relegated to League One. Find out why it’s a huge weekend, not only for Town and the Tykes, but also for Mitro, Millwall and Nathan Jones in Benjamin Bloom’s preview of the Championship match-ups.  European game to watch – Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund It’s a Big Weekend in Serie A, where it’s a Milan v Rome double header. Roma go to second-placed Inter on Saturday night, which precedes AC Milan’s trip to the capital to take on Lazio.But while Jose Mourinho is back at the San Siro, in Germany, it’s Der Klassiker time. The stakes are simple: if Bayern win, they seal an unprecedented 10th Bundesliga title on home soil against their closest rivals for the crown. It bodes well for the Bavarians that they’ve had much the better of recent Klassiker clashes. Bayern have won nine of the last 10 including all of the last six. But Erling Haaland has returned to goalscoring form just in time for Saturday and Bayern’s defence has shown vulnerabilities. The Saturday evening meeting also promises to be the final showdown between Haaland and Robert Lewandowski, with both hit-men set to embark upon new assignments this summer. ",positive

The Catalan giants had been in pursuit of Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland – who now looks likely to sign for Manchester City in the summer – and Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski but Spanish newspaper Marca insist it will be ‘very difficult’ for Barca to get either of those targets. Instead, they have ‘set their sights’ on Lukaku at Chelsea as their ‘Plan C’ with the Belgium international ‘not comfortable’ at Stamford Bridge. He was brought in from Inter Milan in the summer for £97.5m but has scored just 12 goals in 40 appearances for the Blues this term. Marca add that ‘everything indicates that he will leave’ Chelsea in the summer and there would be ‘several interested teams’. Barcelona director of footballMateu Alemany and sporting advisor Jordi Cruyff have ‘already met’ with Lukaku’s agent to explore a possible deal but there is a suggestion a transfer could be beyond the Catalans depending on the asking price. Barcelona will wait to find out the outcome of Chelsea’s takeover bids while president Joan Laporta continues to work out Barca’s summer transfer budget.  ARSENAL DESPERATE TO OFFLOAD PEPE Arsenal look set to make a huge loss on Nicolas Pepe this summer as they prepare for his exit, according to reports. The Gunners brought the Ivory Coast international to the Emirates Stadium back in 2019 for a huge £72m fee with the winger not living up to expectations. Pepe has scored 27 goals in 109 appearances since joining but he has only managed one Premier League goal in 17 appearances this season and now Arsenal are ready to sell up. The Daily Express claims that Arsenal ‘are now looking to finally part ways with the former Lille winger, and they are even offering him to Premier League rivals to get him off their books’. It is understood that the north London club is ready to sell him for £25m, which would be a £47m loss after just three years. Pepe has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal with emergence of youngsters like Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli with reports that West Ham are interested in him. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has seen‘no advancements’ from Pepe this season and he is ‘ready to sell’ with the 26-year-old entering the final two years of his contract at the end of the season.  NEWCASTLE FLASHING THE CASH Newcastle United have made a ‘huge’ offer to tempt Paulo Dybala to St James’ Park in the summer transfer window, according to reports. Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham have all been linked with a move for the Juventus striker, who is out of contract in Turin at the end of the season. Dybala has bagged 114 goals in 288 appearances – including 14 this season – for Juventus since joining from Palermo in 2015. Football Insider insist that Newcastle ‘have submitted a blockbuster offer’ for Dybala as they use ‘their Saudi backing to sensationally try and win the race for the playmaker’. A Magpies source has told the website that the Geordies ‘are willing to make him their highest-ever paid player to lure him to England’ in a deal worth more than £200,000 a week. As well as top Premier League sides, Dybala is ‘wanted by top Italian and Spanish clubs’ and Newcastle are described as ‘unlikely contenders given their season spent trying to avoid Premier League relegation’. It looks unlikely Dybala will renew at Juve with talks over a new contract recently breaking down.

In the end, he died as he lived: bullish to his final breath and shrouded in controversy. At a human level, the death of Mino Raiola at the age of 54 is obviously a tragedy, and a sobering reflection upon how fragile life can be. And that shouldn’t be forgotten as we pause to reflect upon his life. But he was also one of the most divisive figures in one of the most divisive part of football’s universe, and that cannot be ignored either. Even his actual passing had an air of hyperreality. His death was first reported in the Italian press early on Thursday morning, only to be contradicted by a tweet from Raiola’s official account which read: ‘Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in four months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate.’ Later the same day, Jose Fortes Rodriguez, a close colleague, told reporters that “he’s in a bad position, but he hasn’t died”. But on Saturday afternoon, his death was confirmed; this time the confirmation came from his official Twitter account and there have been no subsequent contradictions. Raiola inspired polarised opinions and this is hardly surprising. In one respect, he fitted a stereotype: overweight, usually wearing shades and jogging bottoms, seldom (if ever) seen in a suit, and more often than not with a mobile phone pressed to the side of his face. And he was famously abrasive, with a tendency to berate anybody who got in the way of him negotiating the best deal possible for his clients or those who criticised him. He certainly seemed plenty aware of this perception. When he decided to purchase a property in Miami, he spent €9m on the former home of Al Capone. But he also polarised opinion because he was amongst the most successful agents, at least in terms of making himself a lot of money. It’s always been the case that the transfer of an elite-level player can change the course of a club’s history, and the growing influence of agents as power-brokers within the game has had a strange effect on others. Raiola found his name being sung by fans of clubs desperate to sign his clients, but has also found himself being criticised live on television in post-match discussions. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the players with whom he was most closely associated and a player with a similarly abrasive way of dealing with the outside world, was a close personal friend. Those who criticise agents as ‘leeches taking money out of the game’ (or variants thereupon) are almost missing the point; in this day and age, agents are very much part of the game and its inner workings. Consider, for example, the influence of Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the club having won promotion to the Premier League and established themselves in the top half of the Premier League, with European football under their belt. We might not like the fact that agents hold this much influence, but it doesn’t make it any less true. But the career arc of Paul Pogba does ask questions of whether the influence of the agent is always beneficial to the player concerned. Pogba won four Serie A titles in a row by the time he was 23 with Juventus, but his £89m sale to Manchester United in 2016 has seen his career stall (at least at club level), and it remains likely that he will be leaving Old Trafford at the end of this season with just a Europa League and a Carabao Cup medal to show for the six prime years of his career, although who might now be representing him now is unknown. But the facts are stark. Manchester United didn’t get anything like what they were expecting from him and the player doesn’t seem to have had an especially happy time there, but Raiola was reported to have earned himself €27m from the deal.  Right to the very end, Raiola was understood to be working feverishly to complete the transfer of Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but his death comes with this contract not having been completed and there were even reports that Manchester City had visited him in hospital to get it over the line. What happens to that deal now – or to any of his clients – is a question for another day, but with the end of the season and the opening of another transfer window on the horizon, that other day will have to come sooner rather than later. There is a case for saying that agents are good for football. Players need representation when contracts are being signed, and few would question that they would be highly vulnerable to exploitation if that representation didn’t exist. And there’s a case for saying that redistributing football’s vast wealth to players is better than it staying in the hands of those who run clubs, even if the distribution of those wages isn’t particularly even. And even criticism of the Paul Pogba career arc should be tempered by the fact that Pogba never asked Raiola to stop representing him. If the player thinks the agent is doing a good job, that’s all that matters, right? Well… not quite. What the life and death of Mino Raiola exposes is the absurdity of modern football, a world in which an agent will have their name sung from the rafters if he brings a client to your club but is a game-sucking leech if he doesn’t; a world in which transfers are often treated as more important than matches, in which being abrasive and obnoxious is perfectly okay, so long as that person is throwing shade upon someone else that you disagree with; a world in which grotesque inequalities and the commoditisation of people – including children – are simply accepted as if there’s nothing that can be done about them, and in which millions of not-very-wealthy people pay substantial money in season ticket money and pay-TV subscriptions, only for a fair proportion of it to end up with already very wealthy people who often seem to love football while holding it in contempt. There’s every possibility that, wherever he is right now, Mino Raiola is having a good old laugh to himself over the absurdity of it all – including the reporting of both of his deaths – and he’d be absolutely right.

678,https://www.football365.com/news/rangnick-tries-nonsense-manchester-united-questions-false-reports-mediawatch,Rangnick tries not to answer nonsense Man Utd questions after ‘completely false’ reports,"Ralf Rangnick kept trying to tell journalists that their questions did not make sense. He will be glad to escape the English press. Right to VOTE This story is so big that The Sun have broken out the DOUBLE capitals. ‘Ralf Rangnick will NOT recommend Harry Maguire to be Man Utd captain under Erik ten Hag and says stars should VOTE’ Let’s read the full story by Neil Custis to see exactly what Ralf Rangnick says because this seems unnecessarily personal about Harry Maguire and he is usually quite careful about what he says. ‘Asked if he would recommendMaguireto incoming bossErik Ten Hag, Rangnick said: “I understand your question but again it doesn’t make sense because we don’t know what kind of players will be here, what the group will look like.”‘ Ah. So he specifically said the question about recommending Maguire ‘doesn’t make sense’ and the extrapolation from this as he will ‘NOT’ recommend the current captain (who he never mentions by name), not that it’s actually an irrelevance? Seems absolutely fair and definitely not designed to tap into anti-Harry Maguire sentiments among Manchester United fans. As for VOTE being in capitals…is The Sun now so anti-democracy that even the word ‘VOTE’ is worthy of astonishment?  An ELECTION?This incredulousness at the idea of a vote stretches to the Mail, because of course it does… ‘Ralf Rangnick fuels debate over whether Harry Maguire should remain as Man United captain under Erik ten Hag by insisting skippers should be ELECTED by team-mates…with out-of-sorts defender set to miss rest of season with injury’ ELECTED? What is this foreign madness?  Captain, my captainOver at the Manchester Evening News, we are told that ‘Erik ten Hag already has a candidate to replace Harry Maguire as Manchester United captain’. Does he? Or is this a right load of speculative bollocks? You guessed right. ‘Maguire has failed with the armband, meaning speculation is already mounting about who could sport it next season. Will Ten Hag allow Maguire to keep it in the hope that he can rebuild his career, or hand it to somebody else? Only time will tell.’ But doesn’t he ‘already have a candidate’? It turns out that the ‘candidate’ is David De Gea, based purely on the grounds that a) he has been quite good and b) he has been quite honest about Manchester United being shit this season. Mediawatch is not quite sure that those are the criteria for a captain but we’re happy to be corrected if indeed Ten Hag ‘already has a candidate’. ‘However, whilst he seems like the most suited candidate to replace Maguire as United skipper, Ten Hag’s style of play could impact his chances, with some United fans already believing that Dean Henderson could get the nod between the sticks next season, purely because of Ajax’s interest in him a few months ago and Ten Hag’s vision. It is a difficult one for Ten Hag to weigh up, but it is a decision he cannot afford to get wrong. ‘In the grand scheme of things, deciding on who sports the armband might seem irrelevant when considering what changes need to happen at Old Trafford this summer, but it is a decision that could go an awfully long way in instilling a winning mentality. Ten Hag cannot get it wrong.’ Anybody get the idea that it’s a decision he can’t get wrong? Which is odd because Mediawatch is pretty sure that Ten Hag will place the question of the Manchester United captaincy around 14th on his list of priorities. It’s really only in England that we are bizarrely obsessed with a piece of cloth on the arm of a man who points.  Oust of the redAs usual, the Mirror take it too far… ‘Ralf Rangnick explains how Harry Maguire could be ousted as Man Utd captain’ He really sodding doesn’t; he just explains the system he used in Germany. Please don’t make us feel sorry for Harry Maguire.   Stop making senseGoing back to that original quote from Ralf Rangnick when he says the question ‘doesn’t make sense’…it turns out that this is a theme. And the theme of The Sun – among others – pressing ahead with their narrative continues. The headline: ‘Ralf Rangnick admits Man Utd would be better off finishing EIGHTH and missing European football ahead of Ten Hag rebuild’ What he actually said: “It could be an advantage but that does not mean we will give away any of the remaining four games. For us it’s clear and our obligation. “This is our job, my job, the job of the players that we try to get the best possible results and then see at the end of the season in which position we will finish. “Now to speak about if that would be an advantage or not does not make sense because if I did that then this would be interpreted again.” Too late, Ralf. Too bloody late.  False narrativeIt’s little wonder that Ralf Rangnick is a little wary of the English press, having woken up on Sunday to the news that he ‘will present incoming bossErik ten Hagwith a shocking dossier of shame on every first teamManchester Unitedplayer’. Steve Bates – in a Sunday People exclusive – wrote that ‘Rangnick, 63, has told them he won’t hold back after believing he’s been let down and hung out to dry by a dressing room he’s privately branded “selfish, over-inflated, lacking quality and too powerful”. Senior sources inside United’s Carrington training ground say Rangnick has been staggered by the lack of professionalism amongst the first-team squad.’ In hindsight, alarm bells should have rung at the words ‘a brutal “no holes barred”rundown’. Pro tip: Don’t Google that at work. Rangnick’s response to that story on Wednesday: “This is completely false, completely untrue. The board has never asked me to prepare a dossier, neither for the board nor for Erik. “I also never said anything to nobody criticising the attitude of the players as being unprofessional or selfish. This is not true, I will always protect my players. I have never realised any issues of them being unprofessional or selfish.” Pretty unequivocal. So how are the Mirror reporting this story on their website – keeping in mind that the Bates story is run under the Mirror banner online because they are sister newspapers. ‘Ralf Rangnick has issued a strong defence of his Manchester United players after accusations of them being “selfish and unprofessional”. ‘The interim boss responded in the wake of criticism aimed at Man United’s underachieving stars after succumbing to a 3-1 defeat against Arsenal, just days after their 4-0 humbling at the hands of Liverpool. ‘Mirror Football exclusively revealed Rangnick hadput together a dossier of details about his squad to hand to Erik ten Hag, where members were apparently labelled “unprofessional and selfish”. But the German has launched an impassioned defence to shield his players, while admitting that results should be better.’ Ladies and gentlemen, we have a contender for an Olympic gold in gymnastics. Isn’t it odd how the quotes about the story being ‘completely false’ and ‘completely untrue’ are missing? Presumably a simple copy-and-paste error that will soon be rectified. ",positive
679,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-the-big-match-changed-football-broadcasting-brian-moore-jimmy-hill,The Big Match: the show that changed the face of football broadcasting,"In 1968, a new show called The Big Match changed the face of football broadcasting. Repeats of these shows offer a fascinating window into the past. Considering England is so fond of describing itself as the ‘home of football’, it is somewhat surprising that so little of it was available to television viewers for so long. A combination of the institutional conservatism of the game’s power bases and a fear on the part of club chairmen that showing matches anywhere other than in a stadium at three o’clock on a Saturday afternoon would have a ruinous effect on attendances, ensured that very little was ever seen. The first live televised football match came in October 1946, when the BBC sent their Outside Broadcast Unit to Underhill to cover an Athenian League match between Barnet and Wealdstone. They didn’t start broadcasting until 20 minutes had been played and they had to finish the broadcast with 10 minutes left because light levels had become so low – this was, of course, before floodlighting became commonplace – that they couldn’t continue. Throughout the 1950s, the experimentation continued. Floodlights started to be installed, with Southampton becoming the first Football League club to do so in 1950. An explosion in television ownership (or, more common due to their cost at the time, renting) for the 1953 coronation led to a live broadcast of that year’s FA Cup final being watched by an estimated audience of between 10 and 12 million. The following year, selected matches from the World Cup finals in Switzerland were broadcast live across Europe. But Britain didn’t seem to want more televised football. There had been a post-war boom in attendances that peaked in 1950, yet crowds started to fall away again and quickly clubs became extremely nervous of allowing television cameras in for fear that they might further reduce them. In September 1960 came a breakthrough, when agreement was reached between the Football League and ITV to broadcast live matches for the first time. But when the first match between Blackpool and Bolton turned out to be a poor game played in front of a low crowd and for a lower than expected television audience, the experiment was abandoned. #OnThisDay 1960: the first televised live Football League game, the second half of Blackpool vs Bolton Wanderers is shown on ABC and ATV. Intended as a season long scheme a much reduced attendance led other clubs to pull out and it remained the only live League game until 1983. pic.twitter.com/qMHgQorRKA — UK TV On This Day (@UKTVOnThisDay) September 10, 2021  There was more significant movement in 1962, when regular highlights arrived for the first time. ITV was a patchwork of regional companies then and, emboldened by Ipswich Town’s First Division title win, local broadcaster Anglia Television signed an agreement worth £1,000 for the rights to show 30 local matches over the course of the year, while in the north-east of England, Tyne-Tees Television reached a similar deal. Their weekly shows, called Match of the Week and Shoot! respectively, began broadcasting in 1962. The BBC responded by launching Match of the Day two years later, although it could only initially be seen in London on the newly-launched BBC2. England’s success at the 1966 World Cup increased interest still further, but it was in 1968 that televised football would take its great leap forward. The ITV companies had to periodically reapply for their licences and a big shake-up that year created a new broadcaster for London at weekends called, perhaps predictably, London Weekend Television. LWT was a consortium led by David Frost, who had made grandiose claims about increasing the quality of broadcasting on commercial television; the big shake-up had come about largely because of a government report in 1964 which had been scathing about the standard of their programming. As a weekend-only broadcaster, it would be responsible for the majority of ITV’s sports output. Jimmy Hill had already made his mark on football by 1968. As the leader of the Professional Footballers Association, he’d managed to end the maximum wage rule in 1961, and as a manager at Coventry City, he’d overseen their transformation from a run-of-the-mill Third Division club into a top-flight side. But he’d also dabbled in broadcasting and he was poached by LWT to become their Head of Sport in 1967. Along with his assistant John Bromley, they set about creating a new type of football highlights show. The Big Match first launched in London on August 24, 1968, with Brian Moore hosting and commentating and Hill offering analysis. By modern standards, it was fairly rudimentary, but this new type of show suddenly made Match of the Day, with its highlights from one match only accompanied by the plummy tones of Kenneth Wolstenholme, look rather staid. Between 1968 and 1971, Match of the Day would try several different styles before settling on the format that would serve it well for the next couple of decades.  Other ITV companies started their own shows as well, but some couldn’t afford or didn’t have the technical resources to do so regularly, and many of them would take The Big Match on a Sunday afternoon – Match of the Day held the plum Saturday night slot – instead. In 1970, Bromley and Hill’s innovation would see ITV’s World Cup get considerable critical praise for introducing a panel of pundits who were encouraged to be combative with each other. From 1968 until 1983, this was how things remained. The only club matches shown live throughout the season were the FA and European Cup finals. Each weekend, The Big Match would show three games – extended highlights of one, usually a match from London, then briefer highlights of another and the goals from a third – along with analysis, news and readers letters. The contract signed with the Football League also ensured that a certain number of games from all four divisions would be shown. In 1978, ITV tried to get exclusivity over these highlights by signing a lucrative contract with the Football League, but this caused such outrage that it led to questions being asked in parliament and the tabloid name ‘Snatch of the Day’. The subsequent agreement alternated between ITV and the BBC on Saturday nights for the final four years before, in 1983, ITV dropped regional coverage in favour of networked highlights and, most importantly of all, the return of live matches. They re-commenced for the first time in 23 years with a match between Spurs and Nottingham Forest in October 1983.  But nostalgia can be a persuasive creature and in February 2008, ITV4 started showing repeats of The Big Match from the second half of the 1982/83 season. They’ve now broadcast shows from six different campaigns: 1974/75, 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1980/81 and 1982/83. And the good news for both nostalgists and historians of the game is that four of these series, a total of 80 episodes, are available to watch on the ITV Hub. And a new (well, old) series of Match Time, the Granada Television – covering the north-west of England – equivalent during 1981/82, begins on April 5. There is, of course, plenty of entertainment to be had from coming at these shows from a rose-tinted, nostalgist perspective. Some of the haircuts – particularly from the 1970s seasons – border on performance art. The kits are often glorious. You certainly get an idea of why the Proper Football Men are the way they are these days, and it can be instructive to watch matches while keeping a tally of how many tackles would result in instant red cards today. Similarly low humour can be found in guessing the age of random players and then searching Wikipedia to see how close you’ve got. It’s almost certain that, if you don’t have an inkling and are just guessing based on physical appearance, you’ll be at least five years out. Moustaches abound. Baldness is dealt with… indelicately. But these broadcasts are also incredible time capsules, each one a record of a football world in conversation with itself, unfiltered. Hooliganism does warrant an occasional mention, as does racism. And the regional structure of ITV and requirement to show lower division games does make for some strange episodes to modern eyes, with Liverpool or Manchester United occasionally playing second billing to Charlton Athletic or Orient (no Leyton, in those days).  But 40 years was a long time ago and football was a very different game then. There are, essentially five big factors that have changed everything: 1. The introduction of the back-pass rule in 1992 fundamentally changed the nature of the game. By this time the back-pass was all too frequently being used as a time-wasting option, which looked all the more exaggerated by an increase in pace. In the 1970s the game was slower for a number of reasons and the back-pass fit the rhythm. But the backpass rule changed the nature of defending – especially the role of the goalkeeper, who was now required to be skilled with his feet – forever. 2. Pitch maintenance technology has evolved in leaps and bounds. When regional ITV football coverage ended in 1983 it looked as though artificial pitches would be the future, with QPR having installed one and immediately being rewarded with getting to the FA Cup final and then promoted. But that never quite came to pass. Current generation artificial surfaces are allowed in a hotch-potch of tournaments, but they haven’t become the norm. Far more common are hybrid grass pitches, which combine natural grass with reinforced fibres. First introduced in the 1990s, they have dramatically changed durability of pitches, and this in turn has changed the way in which the game is played. It’s much easier to pass if you can guarantee the roll of the ball. This couldn’t be guaranteed 40 years ago, when clubs treated pitches as a problem to overcome. Mud too wet? Chuck some sand on it. Bit of ice? Thrown on some salt. And if it rained a lot, the only answer was get some poor unfortunate out onto the pitch to stab it with a garden fork in the hope of draining it. It is also notable that frozen and snow-bound pitches were commonly used in comparison to now, plausibly for reasons that are a combination of a greater concern for player welfare and global warming. 3. A foul is most definitely a foul. It’s difficult not to wince at some of the tackles that go in, and the lack of bookings or sendings off is noticeable. But this is counter-balanced – at least from the point of view of player safety – by the considerably slower pace. There may be considerably stronger tackles going in, but if anything, there aren’t as many serious injuries. 4. The other big influencer in slowing the pace of the game was probably the kits and equipment being used. Shirts were made of heavy cotton which held water. Leather match balls were often not as waterproof as advertising might have suggested, while the boots of the time were more like clogs than the slippers that modern players wear. Changes began in the early 1980s. FIFA started using balls manufactured from man-made materials after the 1982 World Cup finals, while kits became smaller and more lightweight. 5. The FA didn’t allow substitutions until 1965 and even then for the first two seasons they were only permitted for injuries and not tactical reasons. Even when the rules changed, many managers continued to replace players only if they were injured. This had started to change by the end of the 1970s, but purely tactical substitutions remained rare. There’s also a plethora of match commentators. Brian Moore doubled as anchor and commentator for The Big Match from start to end, but other voices became familiar, too: the warm, mellifluous tones of ATV’s Hugh Johns in the Midlands, whose commentary still feels like watching a match in the company of your favourite uncle; the recently-deceased Gerald Sinstadt of Granada; ‘Roger de Courcey look-a-like’ (as he was once memorably described in When Saturday Comes) Roger Tames of Tyne-Tees; and the near-Sergeant Majorly Gerry Harrison of Anglia.  The last remaining link between those days and today is Martin Tyler, who started with Southern Television in Southampton in 1974 before going to work for Yorkshire Television and Granada, then eventually heading to Sky Sports in 1990. Some of these commentators were good, others were bad. Some were occasionally accused of being biased towards or against one club or another within their region. Plus ca change. Televised coverage of football changed because it had to change, of course. Commercial pressures were growing and crowds were falling; the introduction of live matches became an inevitability. Regional highlights were an anachronism, though some companies did sporadically persist with them, especially in regions where there were no big name clubs. From 1983 onwards, shirt sponsorship was allowed for televised matches – it had only been permitted for games that weren’t shown prior to this – and networked highlights, a single package, still under ‘The Big Match’ name, were shown across the country. After sharing the live TV rights with the BBC for five years, ITV finally got the exclusivity they’d so craved a decade earlier with a four-year exclusive contract with the Football League in 1988. But ITV’s focus on the ‘big five’ clubs during this period proved to be their downfall in the television rights market. Not only were they ‘blown out of the water’ by Sky’s bid for Premier League rights, but their focus on the biggest clubs also lost them favour with the rest. The big five wanted to stick with ITV in the Premier League, but the rest out-voted them. Sky were offering more money and a more even distribution of live televised matches. The ITV regions ended up as an anachronism, too. A series of mergers following deregulation in 1992 led to them being abolished in 2002. Unless you happened to support Liverpool, Nottingham Forest or Aston Villa, the late 1970s and early 1980s were not a particularly happy time to be watching football in England. Hooliganism was rife and still on the rise. The national team had just failed to qualify for two successive World Cups. Crowds had been falling for a long time and no-one was certain where they would bottom out. And football was a different experience then, played at a different pace and with different expectations. For 15 years The Big Match reflected that and its archive offers an extraordinary glimpse into a half-forgotten world. It is more than worth investigation. ",positive

The France international is out of contract in the summer and there seems little sign of him agreeing a new deal to remain at Old Trafford. That has seen him linked to PSG, Juventus and Real Madrid but, despite numerous reports, there is yet to be a concrete announcement on the Man Utd star’s future. Gossip: Man Utd target Chelsea star to replace Maguire Anelka reckons Pogba is not “psychologically well” at Man Utd and a move back to France with PSG could be good for him. “I know Paul, I played with him atJuventus, and it’s amazing what he can do with the ball,” Anelka toldRMC Sport. “Unfortunately, when he arrives in Manchester, they are not a big team. They are a team that has to rebuild themselves, they are looking for its game plan, they are looking for a coach. “It’s been very difficult for him since he came back. He’s been criticised a lot. It’s not the best club where he can have fun and show his talent. “I think PSG would be great for him. Some say it wouldn’t be good for Paris, because he’s supposedly often injured. But I think his injuries are due to his life in Manchester, because he’s not psychologically well.” When asked if Pogba wants to move to PSG, Anelka added: “I discussed this six months ago with him and he would not be against coming to PSG. If he comes, we will forget all the injuries and we will see that he is a top player.” Meanwhile, former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman insists that he would be “incredibly” shocked to see Pogba end up at one of United’s Premier League rivals. “If Paul Pogba was to make a move to one of Manchester United’s Premier League rivals, I wouldn’t be shocked…. I would be incredibly shocked,” McManaman told Horseracing.net. “If it was Manchester City, Chelsea, or Liverpool I would be amazed, far more than shocked. Why would you? “Is Paul Pogba going to improve Manchester City’s team? No. He wouldn’t improve Liverpool’s either. Probably not Chelsea’s, the way they play. “Paul Pogba’s form for Manchester United over the past five years hasn’t been good enough to reflect that he can go and play for Manchester City or Liverpool. “His reputation is excellent, of course it is. But his reputation is in the France shirt and Juventus shirt. It’s not in the Manchester United shirt. His style of play is too slow for Man City or Liverpool.”  ",positive

Rashford has struggled for form this season, scoring five goals and assisting two in 23 appearances across all competitions. Only two of those goals and assist have come under interim manager Rangnick, who has coaxed better performances out of Jadon Sancho and plans to do the same with his England teammate. During his press conference in the build-up to Sunday’s Manchester derby, Rangnick was asked by a journalist whether the reliance on an out-of-form and 37-year-old Ronaldo indicated “a failure of forward planning at this club”. Rangnick did not mention the Portuguese in his response, although he did refer to the similarly ancient Edinson Cavani. ""They have a very clear identity."" Ahead of this Sunday's Manchester derby, United manager Ralf Rangnick admits City and Liverpool have set new standards in the Premier League. pic.twitter.com/Er6zgSNuCy — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) March 4, 2022 “A few things that happened in the last couple of weeks, or two months, or one and a half months could have been foreseen by nobody,” the German said. “Now with Edinson at least being available for the upcoming games, we have other options. “With Marcus Rashford, we have another player – I will assist and continuously be behind him and with him to develop him. “We have seen that with quite a few other young players in the past and I don’t see why this shouldn’t happen with Marcus. He’s got abundant talent, he’s got the pace, the physicality. “He’s got everything you need for a modern striker, no matter if he is playing from the wing or in the centre. “I will put all my energy into that to help him to take the same pathway that other players did in the last three months.” Speaking earlier this week, Rangnick repeated the Sancho comparison in discussing Rashford. “Right now he is trying to find his best possible shape and performance and we just try to give him helping hands with everything we can,” he said. “We show him video footage and speak with him regularly. In training he is in top form, that’s why I decided to play him. “Now it’s about having that transformation from training performance to the competition in the league. This is the next step he has to take. “We had a very similar situation with Jadon six or seven weeks ago. He is the best example of what can happen. It’s the player himself who has to perform and get the best out of his own performance.” ",positive

Antony is reportedly one of the players Man Urd are looking at ahead of the summer transfer window. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward Ajax paid around £18m to sign Antony in 2020 from Sao Paulo. He has hit the ground running in theEredivisie. The 22-year-old has grabbed eight goals and four assists from his 23 appearances in the league. He made his senior debut for Brazil towards the end of last year. Man Utd are not the only side interested in signing Antony. Italian outlet Calciomercato are reporting that Juventus are ‘intensifying’ their interest in the winger. Ajax’s ‘evaluation’ of the player is described by the outlet as ‘frightening’. It is stated that clubs will need to pay ‘at least€35m’ for Antony. Elsewhere, Anton Ferdinand thinks Declan Rice should “wait a few years” before joining Man Utd: “Manchester United isn’t the place to go right now,” Ferdinand told The Sun. “They’re going through a massive transitional period. “For me personally, if I’m Rice, Man Utd is not a place that I’d be going. I’d wait a few years and see what Ten Hag does. Whether he can implement what he did at Ajax at United and get them looking more like a team that can challenge. “Otherwise, what’s the point in leaving West Ham to go somewhere you’re not even challenging for a title. You’re challenging to get into Europe. That’s what West Ham are doing – challenging to get into the Champions League. “We’ve got something to build on. He’d be in the same place at United and all it would come down to is the stature of the football club. As a footballer myself, I’m not going somewhere just because it’s a bigger club. You’ve got everything at a club where you’re loved and you’re the main man. “At Man United, you’ll be one of many. Whereas, you can stay at West Ham and challenge for Europe and be the main man.” ",positive

That old familiar noise started ringing around Goodison Park well before the final whistle. When Alexis Mac Allister’s long range shot crashed into the roof of the Everton goal to give Brighton a 3-1 lead in the home side’s first match of 2022, the booing started almost immediately, even though there were still twenty minutes of the match still to play. They pulled a goal back five minutes later but, as has been the case for much of the last three months, it was all too little too late. Everton had lost again, the boos rang out even louder at the final whistle, and in the post-match wreckage few could have too many complaints about the result. One of their two goals had taken a huge deflection to get there and while they might have taken a point from the game, had Dominic Calvert-Lewin not blasted a second half penalty kick over the goal a two week break brought about by Covid-19 cancellations didn’t seem to leave the players looking very fresh. Unlike at other Premier League matches over the Christmas and New Year period, there was no Illuminati-inspired conspiracy going on at Goodison Park. Everton just weren’t very good. The booing was so loud at the final whistle because this wasn’t the first time that Everton have played like this recently. They’ve now won one of their last twelve Premier League matches, a run that stretches back to the end of September, and there is little to indicate that anything is going to improve, right now. This run has dropped them to 15th place in the table, and they’re only one above the relegation places in the Premier League form table as well, which seems to bear out the growing belief that if Everton are to avoid relegation come the end of this season, it will be because there were three worse Premier League teams this season rather than because of anything postive that Everton themselves might have done. As ever, when a run of results stretches back like this, all eyes come to focus on the manager, and in the case of Everton the manager is uniquely placed to not be able to ride out a storm like this. As time progresses and the mist lifts, it’s increasingly possible to see what a bizarre appointment Rafael Benitez was as the manager of this specific club. Not only was he the former Liverpool manager with whom he’d won the Champions League a very, very long time ago, but he’d also made disparaging comments about Everton while there. An apparent falling out with Lucas Digne hasn’t helped the growing view that Benitez is simply a bad fit. On top of that, Everton’s recent history of performance art levels of profligacy in the transfer market has left little to continue the club’s recent transfer policy of throwing as much of it at the wall as possible in the hope that some of it might stick. Everton’s recent habit of bringing in a new manager and then giving them £100m to spend and nine months to get results right before sacking them doesn’t seem to have worked out. The squad now looks uncoordinated and flabby, the obvious conclusion of having had five very different managers over the last five and a half years. Well-meaning plan has been layered on top of well-meaning plan, but all of these plans have been administered so badly that it’s impossible now to see what the original drawings looked like or what is trying to be achieved now.  In the Hollywood script version of this story, there is a hero waiting in the wings, a hometown teenage starlet who went away to win everything that club football has to offer and has been sharpening his managerial credentials at a club that has been an even greater financial basketcase than Everton in recent years. But if Everton were to decide that The Benitez Chapter needs to be closed soon, would Wayne Rooney even want the thankless task of trying to steady this ship at this time? He’d make perfect sense as the club’s next manager should they be relegated from the Premier League – he has plenty of Championship experience, after all – but bringing him in before the end of this season might look like an act of desperation that he might not, without any Premier League managerial experience, be able to right. It’s not difficult to imagine Rooney being brought in on a wave of sentimentality to ‘save’ the club, only for him to find that the club’s problems run considerably deeper than any one manager can resolve in just a few months. Everton were last relegated from the top flight in 1951 (since the formation of the Football League in 1888, they’ve only spent four seasons below the top tier), and there is a sense of alarm that the club is heading back towards the relegation positions. Anyone who can remember the close shaves of 1994 and 1998 will be more than aware that even the sense of relief that comes with surviving such a battle is hardly the worth the panic that precedes it. Everton sit eight points above the relegation places at the start of the new year, but even a gap of this size can be whittled down to next to nothing in just a couple of weeks, and there’s been little in recent weeks to indicate that this particular Everton squad is in any way mentally prepared for such a scrap. Rafael Benitez might be a symptom rather than a cause of Everton’s current issues, but the costs of relegation are sky high, and it’s difficult to believe that he will survive much longer unless results start to significantly improve. There’s a banana skin coming up in full view at Hull City in the FA Cup, and games against Norwich and Newcastle on the 15th January and the 8th February. Should they fail to win the former it seems unlikely that Benitez will be there for the latter. But Everton’s unique conflation of poor performance on the pitch and even worse financial stewardship in the boardroom makes even a post-Benitez future difficult to predict. We probably haven’t heard the last of the Goodison Park boos this season. ",positive

It could be a happy 2022 for Spurs, who want two Serie A stars. CONTE HAPPY TO SWAP TWO FOR KULUSEVSKI Both Tottenham and Arsenal have been linked with the same player on a few occasions in recent months, and Juventus winger Dejan Kulusevski is another example. Both north London clubs reportedly want the Swede, who could be available for £30m this month. In order to beat off their arch-rivals, Spurs are willing to offer two players in exchange for Kulusevski. Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele – who have both failed to impress in the Premier League – are the players head coach Antonio Conte is willing to offer in a swap deal for the Juventus star, claim La Gazzetta dello Sport. Both players joined the north Londoners with high hopes, but have struggled to adapt to life in England. The £54m paid for Ndombele is looking like a major mistake at this stage, but Spurs could take some solace from the deal if Juve are willing to take a chance on him whilst allowingKulusevski to go the other way. 🇮🇹Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte’s ruthless response when asked the future and role of midfielder Tanguy Ndombele: 😬""He is a midfielder. He is a midfielder"". 😳“Some players it could be difficult to understand some situations”.#THFC #COYSpic.twitter.com/jkWeX3Ewq3 — Last Word On Spurs 🇮🇹 (@LastWordOnSpurs) December 30, 2021  LEVY WILLING TO SANCTION ‘LUCRATIVE’ KESSIE OFFER January 1 means players who are out of contract in the summer will be able to negotiate pre-contracts with clubs, and the list of stars available for free at the end of the season is nothing short of staggering. AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie is one of the best out there, with a host of Premier League clubs linked with signing the Ivory Coast international. According to ESPN, Tottenham are willing to offer Kessie a ‘lucrative’ deal in order to fight off interest from Manchester United and Liverpool. Reports in the summer suggested the player was happy to stay in Milan, but his wage demands have proved to be a stumbling block. He reportedly wants more than AC’s latest offer of€6.5m-a-year, which Daniel Levy is willing to sanction due to the lack of a transfer fee involved in a potential deal. The report adds that Spurs boss Conte will have ‘significant funds to overhaul the squad’. Any overhaul is expected to take place in the summer due to the difficulty of completing mid-season deals.  HAALAND REVEALS FUTURE DESTINATION Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland is one of the hottest prospects in football and his future has been fiercely discussed in recent seasons, with his current club known to be a stepping stone before he joins one of Europe’s elite clubs. The 21-year-old will likely end up at Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or Liverpool, with his reported £68m release clause becoming active at the end of the season. The transfer fee seems like an absolute bargain, which it is, before taking into account his desired wages, add ons and agent (Mino Raiola) fees. However, Haaland has reportedly told fans:“I will play here, in Spain”. This is according to AS, who also claim that his father, Alfie, loves the golf courses and sun in Spain, which will obviously be a huge part of his son’s decision-making process in the summer. Whether the Norway striker will move to Barca, Real, or elsewhere, is unclear. PSG attacker Kylian Mbappe seems set for Madrid, and the signing of both Haaland and the Frenchman would be ridiculous. Barca, on the other hand, are apparently skint, but what’s a little bit more debt when you can sign such a prolific goalscorer? ",positive
685,https://www.football365.com/news/i-want-to-move-forward-lukaku-apologises-for-controversial-interview,‘I want to move forward’ – Lukaku apologises for controversial interview,"Romelu Lukaku has apologised to the Chelsea supporters afterhis controversial interview revealing unhappiness at Stamford Bridge. The club-record signing has already said sorry internally at Chelsea and returned to training, but has now moved to address Blues fans personally. The Belgium striker fell in hot water with Chelsea after telling Sky Sport Italy last week of his dissatisfaction at the club, just months after his £98million summer transfer from Inter Milan. BREAKING: Putting different players in teams makes them look different The Belgian striker said:“Physically I’m fine, even better than before. After two years in Italy, in which I worked a lot at Inter with trainers and nutritionists, I am physically fine. “But I’m not happy with the situation, this is normal. I think the coach has chosen to play with another module, I just have to not give up and continue to work and be a professional. “I am not happy with the situation, but I am a worker and I must not give up.” Lukaku was omitted from Sunday’s 2-2 Premier League draw with Liverpool, but is now in contention to feature in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge. “To the fans I’m sorry for the upset that I’ve caused,” Lukaku told Chelsea’s official club website. “You guys know the connection I have with this club since my teenage years, so I totally understand you guys being upset. “Obviously it’s up to me now to restore your trust, and I’ll do my best every day to show commitment on the training ground and in games to make sure we win games. “And also to the manager, my team-mates and the board, I apologise, because I think it was not the right moment, also. “And I want to move forward from this and make sure that we start winning football games and make sure that I start performing for the team in the best manner.” ",positive
686,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-tottenham-robertson-arteta-kane,Premier League winners and losers – and some who fit both,"There are some strong words for the Premier League after a weekend of postponements, huge wins, devastating losses and awful Kane tackles. Winners Tottenham’s different midfield Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte seemed to have one thing in common: a shared fondness for the double act of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Oliver Skipp. With the Dane out of action and the Englishman perhaps only fit enough to be a substitute, Conte had to reconfigure his midfield with three who have come to look misfits at Tottenham. But they were all excellent and minus the twin defensive beacons, Spurs had a counter-attacking threat – albeit against a Liverpool side without Fabinho and Jordan Henderson. Tanguy Ndombele played the perfectly-weighted defence-splitting pass for Harry Kane’s opener. Dele Alli came close to scoring and produced his best attacking display of the season. Harry Winks played some of the kind of progressive passes Spurs have lacked at times this season. One led to the terrific Heung-min Son’s equaliser. Conte showed there is life in players who looked like deadwood. And Tottenham’s oldest midfielder – the 52-year-old head coach – offered evidence his team, with his tactical nous, can take on the best as his switch to 3-5-2 worked. Now open a new tab with 16 Conclusions and come back to it later.  AlissonCan a goalkeeper be a winner when he has made a mistake that cost a goal and two points? Maybe not but if so, Alisson surely was. Yes, he was at fault for Son’s leveller but a first-half save from Alli was superb, a second-half stop from Kane even better.  Manchester CityA record 34 wins and 106 league goals in 2021, 10 wins in 11 games in all competitions, separated only by a meaningless defeat to RB Leipzig, and the Christmas No. 1 spot. Beating Newcastle 4-0 may have been the easy bit, but they were the big winners on a day when Liverpool and Chelsea both drew.  Joao CanceloThere was perhaps a solitary element of Cancelo’s game that merited criticism this season: his shooting. He had flourished in the unique role of left-back/playmaker but no-one had attempted as many shots in the Premier League without scoring. That mantle now passes to Adama Traore after Cancelo’s cracker against Newcastle. And if Cancelo’s latest assist owed plenty to wretched defending, perhaps, with him on the right, the left-back berth brings added creativity: Oleksandr Zinchenko’s cross for Riyad Mahrez’s goal was lovely.  Mikel ArtetaThe problem with Arteta’s Arsenal is that they can lend themselves to very different conclusions. But when they are good, sometimes they are very good. Some of Arteta’s gameplans work perfectly. Some of his young players are terrific. Saturday’s 4-1 win at Leeds showed as much. It felt like a clinical dissection of the flaws of Marcelo Bielsa’s side, aided by Arsenal’s youthful verve but orchestrated by Arteta and Alexandre Lacazette. It seemed telling that all four goals came from wingers coming from outside in to take advantage of the space Lacazette created by vacating it. Victory gave them a cushion in fourth place. Look at Arsenal’s season and the two stand-out results – for the wrong reasons – are the defeats at Brentford and Everton. Their other 16 games have brought four defeats against the Champions League clubs and 32 points from a possible 36 against the rest. Keep up that consistency against the other 15 clubs and the Champions League might beckon.  Gabriel MartinelliMartinelli has taken Emile Smith Rowe’s place in the team, even though the Englishman has come off the bench to score in the last couple of games, but in a sense he has proved the internal answer to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Rewind to Arsenal’s first half-season under Arteta and the captain, as he then was, tended to cut in at speed from the left to finish with his right foot and with unerring accuracy. As Lacazette drops deep, the Brazilian is the Arsenal player likeliest to run in behind defences. As plenty of others prefer to operate between the lines, it gives them a different dimension and Martinelli a case, beyond his goals, to stay in the side.  Joe GelhardtLeeds’ bleakest week since their return to the Premier League has nevertheless offered one reason for optimism: Gelhardt scored against Chelsea and won a penalty against Arsenal. It is no secret he is a talent but an ability to make an impact for a struggling side against two of the best teams bodes well. Leeds still miss Patrick Bamford but, when he is back, Gelhardt looks as though he could be a fine impact substitute for now. Joe Gelhardt has played 270 minutes of PL football, 230 of those against Spurs, Chelsea, City and Arsenal. He’s scored 1 goal and won 2 penalties in a team that’s struggling. It’s clear as day he’s ready, good enough and will be a superstar #lufc — Tommo (@LUFC1992_v2) December 19, 2021   Conor CoadyNuno turned his captain into a centre-back. Bruno Lage seems to have transformed him into an even better one. Coady did not need to add to his collection of improbable goal-line clearances to keep Chelsea out, but in itself that was a sign of how well Wolves did. But he was impeccable, both in his positioning and the timing of his tackles. On paper a back three of Coady, Romain Saiss and Max Kilman, plus Jose Sa as a goalkeeper, might not look one of the best defences in the Premier League. They absolutely are on the pitch, though.  Thiago SilvaSo much for the theory he would be phased out this season. Well into his 38thyear, Silva has started 10 of Chelsea’s last 12 games and come off the bench in another. He has begun three in eight days. The mid-match switch to a back four at Molineux meant he had more one-on-one defending to do. He was left isolated as the last man at the back on occasions when Chelsea committed others upfield. Wolves had a policy of looking to isolate forwards against Silva and release them as soon as possible. But he was immaculate and outstanding.  Winner and loser Andy Robertson Made one, scored one, got sent off and Harry Kane tried to maim him. If much of a brilliant game revolved around Robertson, he was brilliant in it. He was marauding and magnificent as Liverpool’s full-backs were dynamic and relentless. The cross Robertson pinged for Diogo Jota to head in was terrific, but far from his only excellent delivery. On the other side, Trent Alexander-Arnold was almost as good, and if they are Anfield’s assist twins, Robertson ensured his sidekick got one by stooping to head in the right-back’s cross. But he could have been stretchered off and ended up sent off for his swipe at Emerson Royal. Robertson admitted the red card was the right decision; if only others involved in the flashpoints shared his honesty.  Losers The Premier LeagueAn embarrassing, farcical week for the world’s best league concluded with an outstanding match, which in turn ought to show them why it is in their interests to actually ensure games go ahead. As they seem to care precious little for supporters, they may want to listen more to the broadcast partners who pay them billions, probably didn’t enjoy seeing their schedules ripped up, sometimes at the last minute, and may soon start to ask for rebates. Out of 10 games this weekend, only four went ahead; this after midweek postponements on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. And while these are troubled times in many walks of life, the Premier League is partly responsible for its own problems. With a couple of notable exceptions, such as the admirable Jurgen Klopp, there has been a lack of leadership. Managers who are obsessed with tiny details have tried to dodge major issues by saying it isn’t for them to tell others to get a jab. That, in turn, has led to the rampant stupidity of unvaccinated players contributing to games being called off. They brought football to a halt. In La Liga, Ligue Un, Serie A and the Bundesliga, with their far higher vaccination rates, this has not happened. It shouldn’t just be Klopp telling players they have a moral duty to be vaccinated. They also have a financial one: to their clubs. At the moment, several multi-million pound businesses are out of action because employees are guilty of professional negligence. The league needs to take a harder stance: unvaccinated players should not be paid, and should be fined, for each match they miss. If unvaccinated players who have not tested positive are isolating, they are neither injured nor ill but absent as a result of their own actions and they should be replaced with Under-23s. Clubs who have 70 or 80 footballers on their books, including Under-23s and Under-18s, should find it harder to get postponements because they allegedly can’t field a team. Difficult as Thomas Tuchel’s task became, the Premier League was correct to refuse Chelsea a postponement when they could still name a bench including Mateo Kovacic, Saul Niguez and Ross Barkley. Both the league and the clubs have a duty to communicate. If players are out, they need to say who, rather than merely expecting everyone to accept diktats from bodies who repeatedly show a lack of transparency. Information is the least supporters deserve. So, too, is a cut-off time so that those travelling to a ground can know they will actually see a game there. Anyone postponing a match after then ought to refund everyone every penny spent getting there.   BurnleySpare a thought for Burnley and their fans; there are times when it seems as though few do but, for the second time in four days, they had a game called off through no fault of their own, one with 150 minutes’ notice, the next with just 140, each after being treated shoddily by their opponents. On Wednesday, Watford didn’t bother to tell Burnley the game was in doubt, which feels utterly unacceptable. This time, they had travelled down the M6 to Villa Park, never a pleasant experience in itself. On the plus side, they now have the best defensive record in December.  Harry KaneIt isn’t saying much to argue this was Kane’s best display of the Premier League campaign so far. Just his second goal of the season was taken superbly. He was more creative and more elusive. His old alliance with Son worked wonderfully. And as he got away with his misdemeanour, some would term him a winner. But his challenge on Robertson was atrocious, reckless, out of control and the definition of a red card. For Paul Tierney and the VAR to keep him on the field was a failure of officiating. For Kane to claim afterwards that he got the ball was nonsensical and embarrassing.  Marcelo BielsaNo-one else plays like Bielsa and Leeds’ last two games, which they have lost by an aggregate score of 11-1, demonstrates why. It is horribly hard to do: get it right and it looks brilliant but get it wrong and you can be ripped apart. Leeds felt shambolic against Arsenal, just as they did against Manchester City, with massive gaps opening up as the Gunners dragged players trained to man-mark all over the pitch. Putting Robin Koch on Lacazette backfired but it was hard to identify a Leeds player who won his duel. Arsenal mustered 11 first-half shots on target, the most in a Premier League game since Opta first compiled such records. Factor in Leeds’ capacity to give the ball away in their own half and they are increasingly liable to be thrashed by the stronger sides. Their defensive record, albeit after playing more games, is now worse than Norwich’s. Bielsa was left looking naïve, a martyr to idiosyncratic policies, including operating with a small squad, which has then meant Leeds were stretched, with understudies unable to play an attacking approach without conceding. He has an admirable refusal to complain about injuries, a reluctance to call for new signings and a self-flagellating willingness to blame himself. Perhaps Bielsa would never forgive himself if Leeds were relegated but it is coming to look very possible.  Cody DramehA maiden Premier League start is not always something to savour, as Drameh can now testify. The problem of a man-marking system comes when a player is isolated against a superior opponent: an in-form, inspired Martinelli, in Drameh’s case. He was nowhere near the Brazilian when he scored his first goal and was caught behind him by Granit Xhaka’s defence-splitting pass for the second. When Smith Rowe replaced Martinelli, Drameh was left behind the substitute when he scored. In a zonal-marking system or a more defensive team, he might have been afforded more cover. In Bielsa’s Leeds side, Drameh was exposed. In his defence, he was probably only the third-best right-back in the starting 11, with Luke Ayling required in the middle and Stuart Dallas on the left. Diego Llorente, Kalvin Phillips and Jamie Shackleton, while all preferring to operate elsewhere, would probably have been better choices were they not part of Leeds’ sizeable injured contingent. It is not Drameh’s fault their squad is so slim. He is not a cause of their problems, but he did look a symptom.  Granit XhakaAt half-time, he ranked as a winner. Xhaka’s wonderfully incisive pass set up Martinelli’s second goal and was a reminder of the ability on the ball that explains why three very different Arsenal managers have all selected him when available. Then came an illustration of why much of the wider world regards him as a liability – the wretched, needless lunge at Raphinha. It should have been a red card and, as Xhaka was already sent off at the Etihad Stadium this season, a four-match ban that would have put him out of the Sunderland, Norwich, Wolves and Manchester City games. Instead, he contrived to get booked for timewasting when 4-1 up, which still seemed the sort of thing that happens to Xhaka.  Ciaran ClarkSome of the joy of football stems from incompetence and there isn’t enough of it in the Premier League. So we should cherish Clark, even if Newcastle shouldn’t. In his last two games at St James’ Park, he has got needlessly sent off in the ninth minute and then taken the equally strange decision to duck so that Ruben Dias could head in Manchester City’s fifth-minute opener. Turning his back when Cancelo doubled City’s lead was scarcely the finest bit of defending, either. Given Clark’s dodgy start to games, perhaps Eddie Howe might want to begin with 10 men and then bring him on after 10 minutes. Or maybe not pick him at all.  Eddie HoweYes, Newcastle should have had a penalty. Howe nevertheless needs to spend less time complaining about referees and prefacing his complaints by saying he doesn’t like to complain about referees, and more fixing a dreadful defence now breached 11 times in the last three games – something that requires spending, but also coaching. Bournemouth’s poor defensive record under him feels pertinent: so, too, the fact that Burnley and Watford are amassing games in hand on Newcastle now.  Ross Barkley, Saul Niguez and Hakim ZiyechChelsea were short of fully-fit midfielders (and players, for that matter) at Wolves. There was no Jorginho and no Ruben Loftus-Cheek. A rushed-back N’Golo Kante put in a heroic shift at Molineux and Kovacic reappeared after 11 games out in a cameo. It was a less uplifting experience for others. Barkley was the only senior outfield player, apart from defender Malang Sarr, who did not get a minute on the pitch. Niguez’s capacity to fall behind virtually everyone other than Barkley was illustrated when he began on the bench as Ziyech and Trevoh Chalobah started in midfield instead, even though the Spaniard came on to produce a tidy performance. And the Moroccan exerted an influence neither in the deeper role nor, after a change of shape, in more familiar areas further forward. ",positive

Chelsea were held to a goalless draw by Wolves on Sunday, losing more ground in the Premier League title race as they now sit six points behind Manchester City. READ MORE: The Aguero anti-climax does not befit a glittering career The Blues asked for the game at Molineux to be postponed due to coronavirus cases in the squad, but the request was rejected by the Premier League. Tuchel named just six players on the bench as his side failed to win for the third time in four games. Asked whether Tuchel is under pressure at Stamford Bridge, Neville said on his podcast: “I think he’s got enough credit in the bank. “I know it’s a club that does things very differently, but I’d hate to think that Thomas Tuchel is under pressure and they’re thinking of making a change, I can’t believe that to be the case. “I think he’ll be a little bit worried. I think mentally when you try to get a game called off and you’re then told to play it, I can’t think that will help the mindset in that game. “I know they didn’t have a full bench, and we’ll have to ask later why more young players couldn’t come onto it, but it was a strong Chelsea team.” Tuchel said after the draw that he was “happy” with his side’s performance “given the circumstances”: “I don’t care about the point. I am pleased with the performance, especially in the second half. The first half was a bit of a struggle for us, we had to grow into the game,” Tuchel said. “Some players had to adapt to new positions. We are not lucky enough in these moments to win games but I am happy with how we played. It was nice to coach from the sideline. On the Covid-19 situation and the game going ahead: “I gave my opinion, the club gave its opinion, we talk a lot about safety and protecting the players, not so sure we did this today. On we go. “If we have tomorrow and the next test and the next positive I would like to speak to the Premier League about what they expect. If they make us play against Brentford shall we not arrive or not train? What should we do? “Everyone is allowed to have an opinion. We had an opinion and the Premier League had an opinion. We agree to disagree.” ",positive

Eriksen, who suffered a cardiac arrest at the Euros last summer, came on as a second-half substitute and scored with his first touch in what was his first international appearance since June. The Brentford midfielder was applauded as he entered the pitch and De Ligt has revealed that he had “goosebumps” at that moment due to the emotion of the occasion. Gareth Bale discovers that hell hath no fury like a Madridista scorned In his post-match interview, the Juventus defender said: “It’s not easy to tackle Eriksen, when he came on the pitch I got goosebumps. We are players but also human beings, in those moments you have to think about playing but it’s clear that we are all happy that Christian is back playing at this level.” Eriksen’s goal came from a cutback from Skov Olsen, which he whipped into the top corner. After the game, he expressed his delight at getting on the scoresheet. “I was happy the ball came to me,” he said. “I thought it was a lovely finish and to start my international comeback like this is a perfect way.” Since signing for Brentford in January, Eriksen has slowly regained his match fitness and he is now making vital contributions towards the Bees’ fight for survival.  After his assist for Ivan Toney in the 2-0 win over Burnley earlier this month, Brentford boss Thomas Frank said of the Danish international: “It was a quality cross from Eriksen and a great header from Ivan. We’ve seen things like that against us a few times this season, but this time it was a bit of quality from us. “There is still more to come from him. Maybe not 10 top crosses a game, but more sharpness in the big moments. He’s at a good level now but the last bit will take some time. “For me [signing Eriksen] was not a gamble. I was convinced he could help us and that he could be the best signing ever for Brentford. “It was not an injury, it was a heart condition. So he wouldn’t have lost any speed or anything. There’s a mental issue but when he decided he wanted to play that was it.”   ",positive

Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta are all out of contract at Stamford Bridge in the summer, leaving Chelsea scouring the transfer market for potential replacement. READ MORE: Premier League midweek winners and losers Jules Kounde had agreed personal terms with the Blues in the summer, but they failed to agree a fee with Sevilla for his sale. Chelsea will likely return to Sevilla with a fresh offer for Kounde, but should more than one of the out-of-contract stars leave, Tuchel will require further reinforcements in that area of his squad. One defender to be linked with Chelsea is De Ligt, who joined Juventus from Ajax in 2019. Chelsea would have to stump up significant funds for the Netherlands international, who moved to Juve for £77million, with various outlets claiming€100m will be necessary to coax him from Turin. His agent, Mino Raiola, said in December that De Ligt“is ready for a new step… he thinks that too.” And Sport Mediaset (via Sport Witness) now claim that Juventus are ‘ready to negotiate the sale’ of the centre-back, who has ‘already decided to change team at the end of the season’. The report adds that he is ‘flattered by the advances of Barcelona and Chelsea’. Meanwhile, former Manchester United midfielder Kleberson has urged the Red Devils to chase De Ligt to replace Harry Maguire. “Manchester United need to make some signings at the centre back position to replace Maguire,” he explained. “He’s a great player and leader, but there are too many moments that he just doesn’t perform, particularly when he’s one-on-one or up against pacey players. He needs help defending. “They need someone faster, stronger in the air, that can anticipate what will happen, and that will be able to stop counter-attacks. “I like Matthijs de Ligt, Manchester United tried to bring him in a few years ago, but it didn’t quite work out. Manchester United need a player like him. They need to get someone in there to do a better job.” ",positive

When they reckon they could have a ‘clear run’ at their biggest target… United’s interest in Declan Rice is well established but it was thought that the Red Devils would have many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, West Ham will demand a fee in excess of £100million; secondly, they cannot offer Champions League football next season, which their rivals for Rice’s signature can. But ESPN says United reckon they won’t have any competition to land the England star. Manchester City are preoccupied by the prospect of signing Erland Halland, while Chelsea’s ownership issues, coupled with the fact they have priorities elsewhere gives the Red Devils a unique opportunity to recruit the ‘new Paul Ince’.  Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham  UNITED, ARSENAL TARGET PREFERS BARCA OPTION United are also said to be interested in Ruben Neves, whom they watched at the weekend when he was hooked at half-time in Wolves’ 3-0 home defeat to Brighton. Arsenal are also keen on the Portuguese midfielder who, like Rice, is valued in the £100million region by his club. But Neves would prefer a move elsewhere. Sport says the 25-year-old wants to join Barcelona this summer, by which time he will have two years remaining on his Wolves deal.  EVERTON OPEN TO OFFERS FOR RICHARLISON Both United and Arsenal have also been credited with an interest in Richarlison as they look to strengthen their attacking ranks. The Brazilian is set to leave Everton this summer, with the Toffees willing to cash in whether they are relegated or not. Football Insider claims Everton would accept an offer in excess of £50million for the forward who turns 25 next week. Richarlison moved to Goodison from Watford in 2018 in a deal that could have been worth up to £50million, with the attacker entering the final two years of his contract.  Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature  ARSENAL, UNITED TO DUEL OVER INTER STRIKER Arsenal, though, may prioritise a move for Lautaro Martinez this summer, with the Gunners having renewed their interest in the Argentina star. Mikel Arteta wants two strikers and The Times says Martinez is on the Arsenal manager’s wish list along with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Gabriel Jesus. Martinez has bagged 17 goals again this season, with United also sniffing around the 24-year-old. Apparently, the Red Devils have offered Inter £42million in cash with Anthony Martial chucked in to sweeten the deal. Which probably isn’t having the effect United hoped it might.  ",positive
691,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-man-utd-ten-hag-rangnik-five-ways-to-salvage-the-season,Five ways for Man Utd to salvage what’s left of this wretched season,"Three games to go until Manchester United can forget this wretched season. Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles. With Gareth Southgate almost certain to call him up for England’s end-of-season fixtures, Maguire could use a holiday now to clear his head and get his knee right. Maybe swerve Greece, though, big man… ",negative
692,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-leeds-0-4-man-city-pep-guardiola-liverpool-title-race,Man City show shower mentality in Leeds paper storm to douse Liverpool hopes,"Liverpool are buoyant while they chase a Quadruple – but Man City are well set to rain on the Reds’ parade… There’s not much that can spoil the mood at Anfield these days. Liverpool are on a relentless pursuit of the Quadruple; Jurgen Klopp has just committed to stick around for a couple more years; and at lunchtime, they overcame what many expected to be their toughest remaining test in the Premier League. There’s arguably never been a better time to be a Red. But still Liverpool remain in thrall of Manchester City at the top of the table and the leaders look in absolutely no mood to relinquish that advantage. At the end of a matchday which started with many feeling in their gut that today might be when one or both of the title chasers drop points, it remains as you were with City one point clear at the summit. With four games to go, it is increasingly difficult to make a case that one of these incredible sides might offer up an opportunity to the other. After Liverpool kept Newcastle on a lead at St James’ Park, City went to Leeds and asserted their own dominance over a ‘tough’ opponent. That’s how everyone describes Leeds – Pep Guardiola said as much himself on Friday. An aggregate score of 11-0 for the season suggests otherwise, but City did not have it all their own way at Elland Road. Which makes the manner of their victory all the more impressive.  Leeds gave no quarter to City and Jesse Marsch’s men went toe-to-toe with the champions for 78 minutes, despite losing half of their defence with Liam Cooper injured in the warm up and Stuart Dallas crocked before half-time. The absence of Cooper was huge. With their captain, Leeds have conceded an average of 1.3 goals per game. Without him, they ship three a game. It is hard to believe that had the no-nonsense centre-back been on the pitch, City’s would not so easily have scored their first two, both coming from set-pieces, with Rodri heading in the opener before Nathan Ake turned in the second after Aymeric Laporte won the first header from a corner. City had to capitalise on set-plays since they found other routes to goal rather more impassable for the first hour, especially with Leeds fielding a back five. Indeed, Leeds created the best chance in open play when Rodrigo pounced on Laporte’s slip but the Spanish forward seemed to get lost during the late stages of his dash from the halfway line. But amid Leeds’ hustle, City rarely ceded control. They matched the hosts’ intensity and never lost focus despite the distraction of Paul Tierney’s lenient brand of refereeing and the paper shower which rained down from the Jack Charlton stand. leeds fans bombard jack grealish with scrunched up paper the club handed out to make a pre-game sign 🤪 pic.twitter.com/7g0PgHlfq0 — Men in Blazers (@MenInBlazers) April 30, 2022  Guardiola implored City last week to show their own shower mentality. “When you win, take a shower and go again,” he said before the visit of Real Madrid. Prior to the Champions League semi-final second leg, City did exactly that at Elland Road to sour Klopp’s Saturday night. What of Leeds? Burnley’s win at Watford leaves them dangling a place above the drop zone with a five-point gap to Everton below them, but having played two games more. Marsch is unlikely to have pinpointed the visit of City as one of their better opportunities to scrape together the points needed to stave off the threat of relegation, but the Leeds boss will remain concerned with a lack of composure in the final third. An arse-twitching relegation fight is hardly the best environment to harness the precision Leeds lack, so solidifying his defence may be the easiest way out of trouble, which makes Cooper’s absence all the more worrying. At the other end of the table, Liverpool and City will each go again next week; City host Newcastle after Liverpool go to Tottenham. In the meantime, the rest of us will scratch around for reasons to believe that next weekend, in fact, could be when points are dropped, even when it looks increasingly likely that these relentless rivals will each take the whole dozen on offer. Which leaves Liverpool, whatever else they might achieve, facing the prospect of missing out on the one trophy central to their Quadruple or Treble dreams. ",positive

694,https://www.football365.com/news/ranking-man-utd-players-erik-ten-hag-plans-fernandes-ronaldo-sancho,Ranking Man Utd’s current squad on how central they are to Erik ten Hag’s plans…,"In terms of how pivotal the Man Utd players might be in the mind of the new manager, it’s a Portuguese one-two ahead of a couple of last summer’s signings. Here’s where we reckon the current squad stands in Erik ten Hag’s thinking… 25) Edinson Cavani Going…  24) Jesse Lingard Going…  23) Paul PogbaGone.  22) Nemanja Matic Matic, too, will be following those above through the Old Trafford exit door. Ten Hag might at least check in with the Serbia veteran to glean his thoughts on the dressing room, given he’s generally a reliable sort who might have something useful to add.  21) Juan Mata Mata also might be worth sliding into Ten Hag’s Zoom schedule, even if lovely Juan probably operates on the principle that if you’ve nothing positive to say, say nothing. In which case, it would just be 10 minutes spent staring at the mute Spaniard. Which is never time wasted…  20) Eric Bailly If Man Utd want a centre-back – never a summer passes these days when they don’t – then we have to assume that Bailly is first in line for the chop since he can’t get near the first team. Unless Ten Hag has a weird penchant for kamikaze defenders who can’t stay fit.  Where might all Man Utd’s players go and for how much?  19) Phil Jones If Bailly goes, Jones will remain fifth centre-back with the arrival of a new one. Would he take the chance to move on this time? Likely to be deployed as he was by Rangnick and may be useful to break out in case of emergencies, like going to Anfield with an untried and unsuitable defensive formation.  18) Dean Henderson The only concern with Henderson is on getting him fixed up with a new club before his existence is forgotten outside Old Trafford. Whether a loan or permanent arrangement, the former England keeper needs to go somewhere. Almost anywhere.  17) Tom Heaton Someone needs to sit on the bench.  16) Aaron Wan-Bissaka Unless Ten Hag’s system relies heavily on the art of slide tackling, then Wan-Bissaka is probably done for. Though Man Utd need to forget any notion of getting anything like their money back, which is something they’ve been absolutely loathe to do in the past.  15) Alex Telles Back-up left-back who may well be on his bike this summer when Brandon Williams returns from his loan to serve as Luke Shaw’s stand-in. Telles has been woeful for months, offers nothing, Brandon Williams is far better — United Are Red (@UnitedAreRed) April 23, 2022   14) Hannibal MejbriKicking a couple of Liverpool players was enough to stand out last week but Hannibal will need to show a bit more in pre-season under Ten Hag. There is the expectation, though, that the Tunisia midfielder will be able to do that, along with James Garner and Alejandro Garnacho; each needs to demonstrate their readiness to step up to the first-team squad.  13) Victor Lindelof Likely to be relegated to fourth centre-back by the time the new season rolls around. Ten Hag will most likely be as content to have trouble-free Lindelof in his squad as he would be to see him leave.  12) Anthony Elanga The Man Utd youngster has had a good run in the side since Rangnick took over, mainly because the interim boss sees him as a player he can trust to carry his basic instructions while the rest seem to do their own thing. That reliability will go down well with Ten Hag but Elanga will have to justify his place in the side beyond simply doing what he’s told.  11) Diogo Dalot Currently United’s first-choice right-back and with so many other issues to address in the team, likely to remain as such.    10) Luke Shaw Shaw’s standing in the Man Utd squad only ever feels 10 minutes from lurching dramatically in the opposite direction, so it will be fascinating to see firstly what view Rangnick passes on to Ten Hag and what initial conclusion the new manager draws for himself. Will start Ten Hag’s reign as first-choice by default.  9) Marcus Rashford Man Utd have held on to players for too long in the past but to sell Rashford this summer would be premature, even if he has had an utterly wretched season. From Ten Hag’s perspective, hopefully a summer of rest and a new regime will reignite the spark in Rashford, who must up his game and pull himself out of his funk. The emphasis is on him, although Man Utd are obliged to provide a better platform for their child-feeding academy graduate.  8) Harry Maguire One thing is for sure: despite the best efforts of some Man Utd followers, Maguire is going nowhere. Whether he remains club captain is for Ten Hag to decide but the England centre-back will still be at Old Trafford next season. And he deserves the opportunity to atone for this season’s clusterf*ck. With the likely arrival of another centre-back and ideally more influence from Varane, Maguire needs to work with the new manager to rediscover some form and fast. Ten Hag won’t stand for the performances the skipper has turned in lately.  7) Fred The Brazilian has been United’s best midfielder this season, which admittedly is a sparse field in which to stand out, but Fred will be there on the first day of pre-season desperate to impress the new manager. Like Donny van de Beek.  6) Scott McTominay Take your pick over which of the many reports you choose to believe but one suggested McTominay is one of five first-team regulars whom Ten Hag is keen to work with and improve. The midfielder spoke for most Man Utd fans on Saturday when he urged his teammates to “show a bit of balls” and his attitude will doubtless endear him to the new manager. https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1517877181124386822  5) David De GeaReports suggest Ten Hag has some concerns over De Gea’s suitability to his style of play – evidently the Dutchman prefers a keeper whose feet aren’t nailed to his goal-line – but given the length of his to-do list, replacing United’s Player of the Season is way down the manager’s priorities.  4) Raphael Varane At times this season, we’ve had to wonder what Champions League Varane has made of it all at Old Trafford. He certainly didn’t sign up for this sh*t. But nor has he really set a better example, having started only half of United’s Premier League games. As he showed in the opening minutes against Arsenal, he’s not immune to the odd brain fart either. After a false start, Ten Hag needs Varane to offer the quality and leadership he was signed by Solskjaer to provide.  3) Jadon Sancho The £72million winger has fallen way below expectations this season – he’s in good company in that regard – but Sancho has shown the necessary signs of improvement in patches and the overwhelming feeling is the winger will shine under Ten Hag next term.  Top ten Prem disappointments who should thrive next season  2) Cristiano Ronaldo Many new managers look to make a big statement early in their reign but a power play involving Ronaldo would be foolish indeed if the 37-year-old is intent on staying and building a relationship with Ten Hag. The Portuguese superstar remains United’s top scorer and while he may be in the twilight of his career, that is not reason enough to bin him, especially when he appears a long way from being finished. And Ten Hag, despite having a reputation for playing youth, appreciates a veteran, which is evidenced by the importance of Daley Blind and Dusan Tadic at Ajax. It is up to Ten Hag if and how he wants to use Ronaldo, but to suggest he is anywhere near the top of the club’s list of problems is ludicrous. 🥴 Cristiano Ronaldo's goal contributions in the Premier League this season (19) have been worth 15 points to Manchester United. Without them, they would only be 10 points above the bottom three pic.twitter.com/zuizstJsjT — WhoScored.com (@WhoScored) April 26, 2022   1) Bruno Fernandes United’s best and most important player. Sure, he moans a lot, but who wouldn’t in this side? At least Fernandes has shown some spark, unlike so many of his current teammates. Ten Hag will build around Fernandes and give the Portuguese the platform to rediscover his very best form. ",positive
695,https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-europa-preview-man-city-real-madrid-liverpool-villarreal-man-utd-chelsea-west-ham,"Big Midweek: City v Real, Danjuma, West Ham, Rangnick, Forest","Liverpool, City, West Ham, Rangers and Leicester all play in European semi-finals this week, while Ralf Rangnick faces his latest challenge to keep biting his tongue… Game to watch – Manchester City v Real Madrid City surely didn’t go through all that against Atletico just to blow it now… The Premier League leaders’ reward for putting the Rojiblancos back in their box is another Madrid assignment – a very different one we would expect – against Real. The first leg is once again at home with a return to the Spanish capital to come next week. While City slug it out with Liverpool at the Premier League summit, Real have La Liga all-but sewn up. But what does Pep Guardiola have to fear from Carlo Ancelotti’s side? Real, despite being accustomed to dominating possession, will likely cede to City, as they did at PSG in the last 16 and Chelsea in the second leg of the quarter-finals. They were almost caught out in both ties, with Karim Benzema and Luka Modric having to bail out Real in thrilling ties that lacked any of the control Ancelotti might crave. But that should be City’s greatest concern: Real’s moments. With Modric and Benzema, ably assisted by Vinicius and co, Ancelotti knows his side can strike at any time. City will have more of the ball and Pep will likely see his game plan carried out to the letter. But at any point in 180-plus minutes over the coming week, City have to be on guard for Real’s flashes of brilliance from their two old-timers. It doesn’t help that Guardiola is mulling over a potential defensive crisis, with both first-choice full-backs set to be missing on Tuesday. Kyle Walker is injured, which hampers City’s plans to repel Real counters, while Joao Cancelo is suspended – a blow at both ends for Guardiola. Nor does it bode well for Pep that while he has flailed in the Champions League, Real seem to have retained an element of their traditional Midas touch in the Champions League. But this is a very winnable tie for City, one that should play to their strengths more than the last. It’s hardly now or never for Pep and City in the Champions League, but there are now no excuses.  Liverpool need to maximise their sponsorship deals…but at what cost?  Team to watch – West Ham No Nou Camp for the Hammers this season but still the biggest games in their recent history await with David Moyes’ men in their first UEFA semi for 46 years and on the cusp of a European final. Moyes knows exactly where his priorities lie and he demonstrated such by restingDeclan Rice, Jarrod Bowen, Michail Antonio andManuel Lanzini as part of six changes at Chelsea on Sunday. He almost got away with it. That late defeat is already forgotten, though, with Eintracht Frankfurt dominating Moyes’ mind since the Germans stormed the Nou Camp and dumped Barca out of the Europa League in the quarter-finals. Frankfurt thrilled in Catalonia and their focus for the rest of the season is entirely on this semi and reaching the Champions League by triumphing in Seville next month. The win at Barca was their only victory in nine games while they sit snugly in mid-table in the Bundesliga. A huge night awaits at the London Stadium, which will host only 3,000 Frankfurt fans, doubtless with thousands more looking for a way in. The same is true for Rangers; they go to Germany to face RB Leipzig in their first European semi since 2008. We are also obliged to mention Brendan v Jose when Roma go to Leicester in the Europa Conference League semi.  Player to watch – Arnaut Danjuma Upon seeing the draw for the Champions League quarters and semis, most of us made the same mistake as Bayern Munich by looking ahead to a Liverpool v Bayern showdown in the last four. Villarreal punished the Bavarians for the presumptuousness, and you can be certain the Reds won’t make the same mistake. The Spaniards have more than proved their credentials on the way here. They came through a tricky group containing Atalanta and Manchester United before beating Juventus prior to dumping Bayern on their backsides at the Allianz Arena. The challenge of Liverpool is a daunting one but we know for certain that Unai Emery will have a plot for his latest meeting with Jurgen Klopp. Perhaps one similar to that Frank Lampard tried on Sunday, only more detailed and with better players to carry it out. Villarreal saw off Juve and Bayern by playing on the counter-attack, with Danjuma one of Emery’s biggest assets. The former Bournemouth winger has scored six goals and offered one assist in 10 Champions League games since becoming Villarreal’s record signing last summer. His form has placed Danjuma ‘among the best wingers in the world’. Or at least that’s what he reckons. And Liverpool evidently agree since they are among the Premier League big-hitters supposedly keen to sign Danjuma this summer, with Manchester United and Arsenal also linked. Anfield offers the 25-year-old the perfect shop window, and Emery will give him the platform to make the most of his chance to shine. If Villarreal beat Liverpool, they will have knocked out the 1974, 1975 & 1976 European champions (Bayern Munich), then the 1977 & 1978 European champions (Liverpool) to set up a Champions League final against the 1979 & 1980 European champions (Nottingham Forest). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) April 25, 2022   Manager to watch – Ralf Rangnick Only one Premier League game in midweek and it should be a biggie – but it’s not. When it was scheduled for Thursday night, it was probably assumed that both Manchester United and Chelsea would still have it all to play for. But no. United could yet reach the top four and Chelsea could yet slip away, but neither is even remotely likely, leaving both clubs to drift listlessly to the end of the season. For United, it will be four long weeks, with Rangnick admitting on Saturday that their Champions League prospects are toast. So what now? The Red Devils have Chelsea and three more games, with almost everyone at Old Trafford just desperate for the season to end. We can include Rangnick among that number, and it will be fascinating to see how the German reacts as the sweet release of May 22 creeps closer. With every abject performance he appears to be struggling to keep a lid on what he really thinks about a squad that he has been unable to effect in any tangible fashion. Word is Rangnick has compiled a dossier of shame on this squad to pass on to Erik ten Hag but the interim manager is only human – he must be desperate to make his mark in the next month after six in which the players have refused to allow him to implement any of his ideas. You wouldn’t blame him for dousing the dressing room in petrol and tossing a match over his shoulder as he goes, but his revenge, if it comes, is sure to be somewhat more subtle. Go on, Ralf. You get yours.  EFL game to watch – Fulham v Nottingham Forest Forest need only a point to secure a play-off place but the Tricky Trees shouldn’t be written off yet in the race for the second automatic promotion place. While Forest go to already-promoted Fulham on Tuesday night on the back of seven wins in eight games, Bournemouth will be at Swansea looking to steady themselves after a run of one win in five. Forest are currently five points off the Cherries but desperate to get themselves into a position where their trip to Dean Court in the penultimate game of the season could be pivotal.  European game to watch – Bologna v Inter It’s a huge midweek at the top of Serie A, where Inter will play their game in hand over Milan, who are currently clinging to a two-point advantage, which looked set to be lost until Sandro Tonali scored a last-gasp winner at Lazio on Sunday night. On Wednesday, Inter will look to capitalise on the opportunity afforded to them by the postponement of their trip to Bologna at the start of the year. Then, the Bologna players were ordered into quarantine after a Covid outbreak, even if that didn’t stop Inter from turning up and trying through the courts to force a forfeit. Instead, they will have to return to Stadio Renato Dall’Ara and earn the points the hard way. With four games left after this, it’s an opportunity the Nerazzurri can barely afford to pass up.

It was confirmed on Friday that Rangnick will become the new Austria boss at the end of the season with the Man Utd interim boss outlining his intention to continue at Old Trafford as a consultant. But Neville admitted on his Sky Sports podcast that he doesn’t like the idea of Rangnick splitting his time between the two jobs. One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Reacting to the news that Rangnick was set to become the new Austria boss, Neville said: “Manchester United’s Sporting Director or consultant can he really be going looking at Austrian players, week in, week out? And then selecting them for the national team? “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” The former Man Utd defender added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time. Laser-focused, clear lines, people staying in their lines understanding what their roles are and actually communicating that to a fan base, this is a real change, this is different than it has been for the last 10 years.” ",positive

The German was placed in charge for the remainder of the 2021/22 season following the exit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November. Erik ten Hag will come in as permanent Man Utd successor this summer, when Rangnick will become manager of Austria. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford But the German will still work for the Old Trafford giants in the consultancy role agreed when he took over. In a statement, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” The PA news agency understands Man Utd have been supportive of Rangnick taking the job with Austria, with the advisory position always holding the option for the 63-year-old to take on parallel roles. Rangnick has been given an initial two-year deal that will automatically be extended by a further two years if Austria qualify for Euro 2024. Lars Kornetka will be his assistant. Speaking after Man Utd drew 1-1 against Chelsea last night, Rangnick was coy over the possibility of managing Austria. Asked if he had accepted that job, he said: “Tonight is about our game against Chelsea and I don’t want to speak about anything else. “Please accept that and respect that, so please only ask questions about tonight’s game.” Pushed on the Austria role, Rangnick said: “No (I won’t comment on it). Let us speak about the game. “What I can tell you and confirm is that I will definitely continue with my consultancy role at the end of the season for the next two years and I am very much looking forward to that. “We haven’t spoken, Erik and myself, but we have spoken with the board about the content and the profile of the job. “The content of that consultancy role we spoke about.

Wolves are reportedly aware that they may have to sell the 25-year-old this summer. On Thursday, it emerged that Man Utd-linked Erik ten Hag is a ‘huge fan’ of the Portugal international. Gossip: Liverpool eye Bayern slayer; Ten Hag wants Neves at Man Utd “I don’t know if it’s Man United or other teams, what I know is we have a special player here with us,” Wolves boss Lage said ahead of his side’s Premier League visit to Newcastle on Friday. “What he is doing this season is very good. I think also the way we play, he can show a better Ruben, and also the way he plays puts our team on a different level. “When you have that player, the best thing to do is improve his salary and years of contract. “But who knows, when you have a top player like him in that specific position, that can defend and attack, and is a top professional and a great man, the big teams are there with £100m to buy these kinds of players.” Neves, whose current deal expires in 2024, is currently sidelined with a knee injury that is expected to rule him out until May. After initial concerns, Lage is now more hopeful that Neves will play before the end of the season and wants his fellow countryman to stay at Molineux. Lage said: “I would have preferred to remain with Joao Felix in Benfica, but 120m euros came and he left. “It depends on the strategy of Wolves also. That’s why it was so hard to find players in the last two transfer windows. “We want to find the best players at the right price and the right age to help us, then after two or three years they can give us economical profit. “It’s not just about Wolves, in these days which club can refuse a proposal of 80, 90 or 100 million pounds? Five or six.” Wolves will climb above Manchester United and West Ham and into the top six – for a few hours at least – by beating Newcastle at St James’ Park. But Lage says that wherever Wolves finish this term then next season will be even more difficult for them. He said: “Behind Wolves comes teams that are ready to invest a lot, like Aston Villa, Everton, Newcastle and Leicester. “They are ready to invest and improve and fight for different competitions. “The challenge for us is to create and build the right team, to fight against all the teams in the Premier League.” Newcastle are seven points above the relegation zone after successive away defeats to Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham. Asked if Newcastle were safe, Lage replied: “If I was in that position with 31 points I would say no. “I prefer to win more points. I think with 34 or 35 points you can be safe, not with 31.” ",positive

Inter have reportedly rejected the offer with incoming United boss Erik ten Hag preparing for a busy summer transfer window. ⚽ | GOALSCORER#Lautaro Martinez has scored 20 goals in one season for Inter across all competitions for the second time in his career!

His loan spell at Sevilla has failed to revitalise his career having drawn a blank in all eight of his La Liga appearances. He is under contract in Manchester until 2024 with the club keen on offloading Martial’s £240,000-a-week contract. The 26-year-old has scored 79 goals in 269 appearances for United and found the back of the net once this term before his January loan. Elsewhere,ex-Premier League striker Kevin Phillips has suggested that Aaron Wan-Bissaka “has not progressed” at Manchester United. The right-back joined the Red Devils from Crystal Palace for £50m but has struggled for form at Old Trafford. “It’s a shame because I like him,” Phillips toldFootball Insider.“However, he hasn’t really progressed at Man United– although the club have been in a massive decline themselves. “It didn’t work out for Wilfried Zaha either, and being a London boy – he couldn’t wait to get back to Palace. I know that because I was at the club at the time. “Some players just don’t suit football clubs. That seems to be the case for Wan-Bissaka – he just doesn’t suit Man United. It happens. “It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he went back to Palace and performed just as well as he was when he left. “That could be the most sensible decision, just to go back to familiar surroundings. If you’re comfortable and happy, then that’s when you play the best football.” ",positive

Sancho has little else to play for this season, so he might as well go for it. Here are the 10 Premier League players to have completed the most nutmegs this season… 10) Marc Cucurella (Brighton) – 7 Even if Brighton fans aren’t allowed to shout ‘Shoooooot!’ anymore, they still have the pleasure of watching the luscious-locked Spaniard do things like this…   9) Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace) – 8 The Palace winger has eight assists but defenders have robbed him plenty of times too. Zaha has been dispossessed 114 times, 22 times more than any other player.  Zaha ‘bullied’ Arsenal defender who ‘couldn’t get near him’ – Pundit  8) Sadio Mane (Liverpool) – 8 The Liverpool star may only be eighth on this list but he can console himself with the best dribble success rate (58.6%) of the 10. Which is probably of greater interest to Jurgen Klopp…  7) Diogo Jota (Liverpool) – 8 More than a quarter of the 31 players dribbled past by Jota in the Premier League this season have suffered the indignity of being megged. But arguably his best came in the FA Cup… The nutmeg by Diogo Jota 🤭 (via @EmiratesFACup)pic.twitter.com/BeLAZSnpS2 — B/R Football (@brfootball) February 6, 2022   6) Said Benrahma (West Ham) – 8 The West Ham winger is yet to convince David Moyes of his consistency but Benrahma has been stealing souls for ages. “He could nutmeg a mermaid,” said Brentford B assistant coach Sam Saunders in 2020… Take a bow, Saïd Benrahma 😲 The Brentford playmaker gets his second of the night and it is a beauty ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/MFLzLyvlQX — Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) October 1, 2020  5) Joao Cancelo (Man City) – 8 The City star has had more opportunities than anyone to increase his megs quota, with Cancelo enjoying 510 touches of the ball more than anyone else in the Premier League this season.   4) Francisco Trincao (Wolves) – 13 The Wolves winger has struggled in his first year in the Premier League but he has managed a nutmeg for every 93 minutes played this season.  3) Jadon Sancho (Man Utd) – 14 Bundesliga defenders were thrilled to see the back of Sancho, so often were they left looking at the back of Sancho last season, 16 of them after he’d slipped the ball between their legs. The £72million winger needs to ruin just two more defenders’ day to equal last term’s mark.  2) Raphinha (Leeds) – 14 Only two players have dribbled past a higher number of players than the 64 poor souls left choking on Raphinha’s dust. One of them being…  1) Emmanuel Dennis (Watford) – 17 Watford are the Premier League’s best when it comes to nutmegs. The Hornets have completed 48 this season, six more than second-placed Wolves and 14 more than Man Utd in third. There are 65 players who know how it feels to be dribbled past by Dennis – only Allan Saint-Maximin has dribbled past more. Many more. One hundred and sixteen to be precise.  ",positive

Raphinha joined the West Yorkshire club in 2020 after they were promoted back to the Premier League. Gossip: ‘Next Salah’ linked to Prem; Everton squad overhaul inbound He has been terrific since moving to England. Last season the 25-year-old scored six goals and provided nine assists as Leeds finished ninth in the league. Raphinha has carried last term’s form into 2021/22 having scored nine goals in 27 top-flight appearances. His fine form, while Leeds struggle, has sparked interest from numerous sides, with Liverpool and Barcelona both keen on the Brazilian. Earlier this week it was reported that the Premier League club turned down a€35m (£29m) bid from Barca. And now Mundo Deportivo (via HITC), say that the club and player have reached an agreement, with Leeds looking for £50m to let him leave. Barca coach Xavi is eager to include incentives or a player swap in order to drive down the price. The same source also claim that Leeds are interested in signing Oscar Mingueza, who has made 15 La Liga appearances this campaign. Mingueza is a versatile defender and it is believed that Jesse Marsch’s side have already ‘made contract’ with him. Their interest can only be a good thing for the Catalan club as they potentially look to include the 22-year-old Spaniard in a deal for Raphinha. Elsewhere,Luke Shaw believes that England captain Harry Kane is the best striker in the world after his winning goal against Switzerland. Having won the Golden Boot as England reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, Shaw believes Kane will now have his eyes on the same prize this time around. “I don’t see why not,” theManchester Unitedfull-back said. “For me at the moment, the way he’s playing, he’s one of the best strikers in the world, probably the best. So hopefully you can keep that form up, keep it going. “He’s showing it week in week out at the moment and it’s a joy to watch.

The English midfielder has been excellent for the West Yorkshire club in recent seasons and has attracted interest from numerous Premier League clubs. Ranking Premier League teams by their top three goalscorers Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Aston Villa have all been linked with the 26-year-old, who is valued at £45m, as per Transfermarkt. Leeds are currently seven points above the relegation zone as they prepare to face Southampton on Saturday afternoon. If the Whites go down they will struggle to keep hold of Phillips, who will be fighting to retain his place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad following a lengthy injury absence. Former Arsenal striker, Wright, believes he will be highly “sought-after” in the summer transfer window, saying that Phillips will want to leave in pursuit of silverware. “A lot of big teams need a player in that position,” Wright said onThe Kelly & Wrighty Show (via MOT Leeds News). “He’s a sought-after player. “Phillips doesn’t strike me as a player who wants to play for Leeds. He wants to win things. “Leeds need to start putting things in place where they’re challenging for Europe for the likes of him and Raphinha to stay but I think Raphinha will leave [this summer].” Meanwhile, Paul Merson also believes that Raphinha will leave at the end of the season, with Barcelona very keen on signing the Brazilian. “Raphinha is a player who has generated a lot of transfer talk in recent weeks, with Barcelona reportedly interested in snapping him up this summer,” Merson toldSportskeeda. “I think he’ll leave Leeds regardless of what happens – he’s capable of playing for any of the big boys in the Premier League. “Real Madrid and Barcelona still have the charm when it comes to foreign players – when either of the two clubs come for a player, they inevitably end up getting them.” ",positive

He has been criticised at times this term as he has been unable to live up to expectations. The 23-year-old scored his first Tottenham goal last weekend as they beat Newcastle United 5-1. He only played three times for Barcelona during his time at the Nou Camp. Royal has now suggested that he was sold because Barcelona “needed money” last year: “In Barcelona, I was going to fight for the position,” Royal said (via Sport Witness). “Barça were going through a very complicated economic moment, and I had good options for me here at Tottenham, in a league that is the best in the world. Barça needed money. I helped Barça and Barça helped me. “I wanted to succeed at Barça. Then I had that desire, and I was going for it. When I arrived in Barcelona, I saw the club’s situation, and they talked to me. “The decision was very complicated because I didn’t want to leave.

He’s been an ever-present in that side for a few years. He makes a lot of good saves and is captain as well.

706,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-five-premier-league-outcasts-stake-claim-internationals-werner-pepe,Five PL outcasts who staked their club claim for their countries,"International breaks can offer respite for some Premier League players from the stresses of their clubs. These five have struggled for form, game time or both with their club sides but impressed on international duty… Timo WernerA report on Tuesday claimed Chelsea would accept just over £33m for Werner this summer, having paid £48m for him two years ago. The formerly prolific striker has become a weird combination of cult hero and figure of fun at Stamford Bridge. He receives perplexing support from the fans despite failing to find anything like the goalscoring touch he enjoyed in the Bundesliga, often tripping over himself before he can even get into a position to score. Watching him play for Chelsea– for whom he’s scored just 19 goals in 80 appearances – it’shard to believe he was banging them in at a rate of one every 100 minutes in his last season at RB Leipzig. But despite having his confidence completely sapped in the Premier League, he continues to perform for Germany. National manager Hansi Flick has started Werner in all seven games for which he’s been fit since the former Bayern boss took over in August. And Werner has repaid that faith with six goals and an assist. Ironically, given they often play as though it’s their first time together whenever they step on the pitch for Chelsea, Werner has formed a fine partnership with Kai Havertz. It may not be a Werner problem, it may be a Werner at Chelsea problem. He’s not the first striker, or even the only current striker, for whom that is the case.  Steven Bergwijn Bergwijn’s Spurs zenith came in his very first game for the club in February 2020, as he scored the opener in a 2-0 win over Manchester City. He’s started just 24 Premier League games in the two years since and just one since the end of August this season. Faced with an already difficult battle with Lucas Moura to be ‘the other one’ alongside Harry Kane and SonHeung-min in the Spurs attack, the signing of Dejan Kulusevski in January has caused him to drift further from the reckoning. But his lack of game time didn’t cost him a place in Louis van Gaal’s Netherlands squad for their latest two internationals. And the forward scored two goals in the their 4-2 win over Denmark – the first a towering header and the second a neat curled finish into the far corner – before coming off the bench to secure a draw against Germany.   Nathan Ake Ake moving to Manchester City was always a strange decision, made stranger by Ruben Dias signing for the club just a month after the former Bournemouth defender had put pen to paper. Fourth-choice centre-back for a team playing a back four is not an enviable role. He’s started just seven Premier League games this term and 16 in his two full seasons at the club. He started and scored in the Netherlands’ 4-2 win over Denmark, alongside Virgil van Dijk andMatthijs de Ligt in a back three for Louis van Gaal’s side. Ake’s best bet of more frequent club game time is to persuade Guardiola to switch to Van Gaal’s tactics, and if that’s his best bet, he should save his not particularly hard-earned cash for something else.   Nicolas Pepe The winger has admitted his frustration at Arsenal this season, citing “the language barrier” between himself and Mikel Arteta as part of the problem. Bukayo Saka is surely the greater obstacle. Saka moved up to the Arsenal first team in the same summer Pepe joined the club for £72m from Lille and it’s the England international who’s nailed down the spot on the right side of the Gunners’ attack. Pepe’s numbers aren’t terrible; he scored ten Premier League goals to Saka’s five last season. And as he showed with his stunning solo goal against France forCote d’Ivoire over the weekend, he is more than capable of the extraordinary.It’s all the other stuff – the pressing, the tracking back, the team play – where Saka’s displays dwarf those of the man vying for his starting spot.  Christian Pulisic An odd choice perhaps, given he’s started eight of Chelsea’s last 13 Premier League games – he’s hardly out in the cold. But there is still very much a sense that we’re all waiting for him to truly catch fire at Stamford Bridge. That’s a compliment really. It’s good that more is expected of a player who is already performing reasonably well. Well enough to play frequently for the third best team in the Premier League, anyway. But he can and should be doing more on a consistent basis after almost three years at the club. He captained the USA to their 5-1 win over Panama on Monday, scoring a hat-trick in that game to take his side to the brink of qualification for the World Cup. One of his touches for his third goal of the night was brilliantly described by a US commentator as “filth of the very highest order”. It would be great to see filth of any order at Chelsea.

707,https://www.football365.com/news/marsch-i-havent-spoken-to-raphinha-about-barcelona-interest,Marsch: I haven’t spoken to Raphinha about Barcelona interest,"Leeds boss Jesse Marsch says he is determined to get the best out of Barcelona-linked Raphinha while he remains at Elland Road. Brazil winger Raphinha, who signed a four-year deal when he joined Leeds from Rennes in October 2020, has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona in the summer. Premier League XI of players not at the 2022 World Cup Leeds have been in talks with his agent, former Barcelona midfielder Deco, regarding a new contract, but Marsch said he had not discussed his future with the player beyond the current season. Marsch said: “He is a massive talent and my challenge, despite all of the talk outside, is to have the relationship where we can focus on his development in helping the team while he is here. “I haven’t had a word with him about Deco or Barcelona. It (Barca’s interest) should be out there because he is fantastic. “I just want him to become the player I know he can be. Everyone here wants to enjoy the football he can play and of course we want him to stay as long as possible. He’s a fantastic player and very good person.” Raphinha missed Leeds’ win at Wolves before the international break after testing positive for Covid but is back in contention for Saturday’s home Premier League game against Southampton. Marsch confirmed both Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper were in contention to start but said neither was “90 minutes fit”. “I don’t think we can start both of them because it becomes two subs we may have to make,” Marsch said. “I’ve spoken to both of them and they are both feeling good. They’re looking even better. I’m excited to have them in the group now and believe they can have an impact.” Leeds survival bid was dealt a blow earlier in the week when it was confirmed Patrick Bamford faces a further six weeks on the sidelines due to a foot injury. But Marsch is hopeful last season’s leading goal-scorer will be fit before the end of the current campaign. Bamford, who has missed large chunks of the season following a succession of different injuries, had been playing through the problem before rupturing his plantar fascia at Wolves. Marsch added: “Six weeks means he can make the last two matches. We have to wait and see, but he is walking better and pain free, which he wasn’t for the last four months. We’re optimistic and hopeful.” Bamford teary response to pulling up at Molineux was captured by the television cameras. The England striker told Sky Sports: “It’s been a bit of a shoddy year for me, obviously had a few injuries, so the fact that I’d tried so hard to get back and done all I could and then for it to go again, and this time fully go… “I was all right coming off and then it wasn’t until I sat down on the bench that it kind of hit me a little bit, but Coops and Kalv (Cooper and Phillips) were great. “Ironically, both Coops and Kalvin know what it’s like, especially these last few months. “Coops obviously is a great captain and did what a captain should do and then Kalv, being one of my good mates, it was just nice to know they were there for me.” Goalkeeper Illan Meslier, Mateusz Klich and Diego Llorente, who were all forced off due to injury at Wolves, are expected to feature against Southampton.

However, it now seems increasingly likely that he will leave this summer after reports claimed that he recently rejected a new contract over the size of his release clause. There are an increasing number of clubs interested in buying Raphinha with his current release clause dropping to around £25m if Leeds were to be relegated from the Premier League. And now Sport (via Sport Witness) claim that Liverpool, Barcelona and Bayern Munich have all submitted their first offers to sign Raphinha. It is claimed that Liverpool ‘need to hurry’ if they want to get to the front of the queue for the Brazil international with Barcelona currently ‘ahead of Liverpool and Bayern’. Barcelona have ‘decided to play their cards to try to close the operation’ before Liverpool and Bayern Munich ‘enter with everything’ after their initial offers. Sport adds that Raphinha has ‘already seen the project that Xavi is building, as more attractive than the one that Liverpool or Bayern can offer him’. Meanwhile, former Liverpool goalkeeper David James has questioned whether the signing of Raphinha would improve Jurgen Klopp’s side. “I like Raphinha…the one thing that sort of concerns me about him already being linked to Liverpool is that usually you don’t know who Liverpool are going to sign until they sign,” James told GGRecon. “I like him but again, when you look at Luis Diaz, who is a sensational signing, is Raphinha as good as him?

And now Spanish publicationNacional claims that Barcelona already has a ‘completely closed agreement’ with the player but must convince Leeds to sell him. The Catalan giants see Raphinha as an ‘undisputed starter’ for them and they have received encouragement from the Premier League star, who has ‘asked to leave’. Raphinha has ‘rejected all the renewal offers that have been presented to him’ and is ‘determined to change scenery’ in an effort to win titles. Leeds ‘understand’ his request and ‘will not oppose his departure’ but want€75m from any club to make a deal happen this summer. Barca are ‘not willing to pay’ that amount for the Brazilian but the West Yorkshire outfit could would be willing to ‘accept a significant reduction’ if the La Liga side include Manchester United flop Depay in any deal. Barcelona do have that ‘bargaining chip’ with Marsch seeing the Netherlands international as the ‘perfect successor’ to Raphinha. President Joan Laporta has already ‘given the approval’ to Depay’s exit, while Barca boss Xavi ‘will not object’, but there is a problem as the 28-year-old wants to ‘prioritise other options long before going to Leeds’.

THREE IN FOR PORTUGAL HERO Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United have all been credited with an interest in Otavio (a new name in the gossip column!), the 27-year-old Porto midfielder who played on the right wing against both Turkey (he scored and assisted) and North Macedonia this week. His price is said to be just £17m, presumably because in football terms he is a little on the old side. Otavio has been credited with an impressive 12 assists in the Portuguese league this season, which has catapulted him into the Portuguese national team. It is said by Fichajes that Liverpool see him as an option in central midfield while Manchester United are attracted to the price and see him as a utility player who can play in central midfield and also on the right wing.  RODRYGO AVAILABLE TO REDS Real Madrid are prepared to sell Rodrygo this summer as they prepare for the potential arrivals of Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, according to Sport. Mbappe is expected to arrive this summer, with Haaland possibly following him a year later if they can persuade him to wait in Dortmund. The Brazilian international has long been linked with Liverpool and now could be available for as little as £34m, which would constitute a bargain for the 21-year-old, who has had an underwhelming year at Madrid but could blossom under the tutelage of Jurgen Klopp. Marco Ascensio is also available as Madrid try and pull off a long-overdue clear-out.  RAPHINHA BID INCREASED Leeds were never going to take £30m for Raphinha, regardless of how much the Brazilian might want to swap Yorkshire for Barcelona, so according to Sport, they have come back with another offer. And what’s that offer? Well, it doesn’t sound quite so spectacular as to be irresistible – it’s an initial £34m with an extra £8m in add-ons if certain criteria are met. ‘The Barça club will not enter any auction and will not move from there,’ claim Sport, who point out that Leeds’ relegation will see Raphinha available for just £21m, which sounds like it might lead to a conflict of interest for the Brazilian. Meanwhile, the Here We Go podcast suggests that Arsenal are interested in Raphinha and are watching events closely.  ",positive

He managed just a single strike through his first 14 Premier League appearances of the season but the Spurs striker is now on 12 goal involvements in 11 league games since the turn of the year.  4) Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain) – 11 goals Appearances: 13 Goals per appearances: 0.85 Minutes played: 1084 Minutes per goal: 99 Even though he looks set to walk out on PSG in the summer, Mbappe is the only member of Mauricio Pochettino’s forward line not copping flak from the club’s p*ssed-off Ultras. Eight goal involvements in nine Ligue 1 matches make it 25 in 26 for the season.  3) Christopher Nkunku (RB Leipzig) – 11 goals Appearances: 14 Goals per appearances: 0.79 Minutes played: 1059 Minutes per goal: 96 If/when Mbappe goes, PSG need a replacement. A dozen goal involvements in 10 Bundesliga games in 2022 puts Nkunku high on the Parisians’ list, apparently. Man Utd’s too… 2) Karim Benzema (Real Madrid) – 12 goals Appearances: 11 Goals per appearances: 1,09 Minutes played: 974 Minutes per goal: 81 Real want to sign Mbappe this year andErling Haaland in 2023, assuming Benzema might slow down when he turns 35 before Christmas. No sign of that yet. On top of 22 goals in 25 La Liga appearances, the France star has also weighed in with 11 assists.  1) Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) – 15 goals Appearances: 12 Goals per appearances: 1.25 Minutes played: 1080 Minutes per goal: 72 Benzema is eight months older than Lewandowski, which should serve as a warning to Bayern if they are thinking of selling the Poland goal-machine before he turns 34 in August. A running total of 45 goals in 37 appearances so far this season is both mental yet completely normal for Lewandowski.  ",positive

Conte has been Tottenham’s manager since November. He replaced former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who only managed Spurs for 17 games. Gossip: Haaland, Sterling updates; Kane and Eriksen reunion Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took charge. They currently sit fourth in the Premier League table with six games to go. Spurs brought in Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentanctur in January. Both have hit the ground running under Conte. The Telegraph are reporting that Conte will inform the club’s hierarchy that he needs six new players this summer. It is stated that they face a ‘homegrown player balancing act’. They could have a ‘depleted squadEurope next season if Levy and Paratici set their sights on the overseas transfer market’. The report adds that Spurs are ‘considering a move’ for Christian Eriksen. His contract at Brentford is due to expire in June. Leicester City star Youri Tielemans is noted as a target. Torino duo Gleison Bremer and Wilfried Singo, along with West Brom’s Sam Johnstone, are also mentioned as players Tottenham are looking at. Elsewhere, Dion Dublin believes Tottenham centre-half Eric Dier “doesn’t have a defensive brain”. Dier is a mainstay in the Tottenham defence having started 29 times in the Premier League this campaign. He has made over 300 appearances for the north Londoners since joining from Sporting Lisbon for £4.5m in 2014. Spurs were beaten 1-0 by Brighton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday afternoon after Leandro Trossard found the back of the net late on. The Belgian winger skipped past Dier before finishing past Hugo Lloris to win it for the Seagulls. And former Aston Villa and Coventry City striker Dublin has hinted that Dier’s “midfielder’s brain” cost Spurs the match due to his role in the winning goal. “Dier doesn’t have a defensive brain,” said Dublin (via HITC). “He has a midfielder’s brain. That’s the way it is. He’s a midfield player, isn’t he?! “(Lewis) Dunk, for instance, he just stands up and takes it wherever it needs to be taken. You take it in the face. “As soon as you turn, that’s it. The goal is bigger. Then you can do whatever you want. “If you stay big, then you can push right or you can push left. As soon as he puts his feet together, which is what he did, then he couldn’t do anything at all. It’s silly things you know as a defender, which come natural to you.” ",positive

The Belgian midfielder has been a crucial player for the Foxes since joining from Monaco in January 2019. Leicester eye another magical storyline after PSV comeback After an initial half-season loan, Tielemans signed permanently for a reported £40.5m, penning a four-year contract at the King Power. He has made 147 appearances for the Premier League side, scoring 24 goals and providing 22 assists in the process. With his contract expiring at the end of next season, there has been plenty of speculation about the player’s future. Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United and Bayern Munich are all rumoured to be interested. A report last month claimed that Tielemans will be available for as little as £25m in the summer transfer window with a contract extension looking unlikely at this stage. Tottenham are confident of landing the 24-year-old, according to GiveMeSport, who say the club’s hierarchy believe he is ‘open to a transfer this summer’. Champions League qualification will do Spurs no harm in their pursuit of the Leicester man. The report adds that the north Londoners are keen on re-signing Christian Eriksen, who has starred for Brentford since returning to the Premier League. Antonio Conte’s side are leading the race to finish in the Champions League places with arch-rivals Arsenal faltering in recent weeks. Spurs have won six of their last seven in the league after initially struggling under the Italian head coach. Harry Kane – who has reportedly snubbed a summer move to Manchester United – is thriving with Conte in charge. He has been involved in 13 goals in his last nine Premier League matches. The England captain only found the back of the net twice during Nuno Espirito Santo’s stint in the dugout at the start of 2021/22.

Arsenal have been linked with Maddison for a long time but a report on Sunday claimed that both the Gunners and their arch-rivals Tottenham were ready to battle it out for the England international this summer. Maddison is currently enjoying his best goalscoring season since joining Leicester with 13 goals in all competitions, while he has also contributed eight assists. Gossip: Pogba to PSG, Neves to Arsenal for £60m? However, with Martin Odegaard showing some top form for the north London club this term, Campbell reckons Arsenal could move for Maddison’s team-mate Tielemans instead. Campbell told Football Insider: “I think Youri Tielemans is the one they will be looking at. “I could be wrong on that but I think the ship has sailed with Maddison. We have Odegaard now so spending another £50 million on an attacking midfielder, I just don’t see it. “Tielemans is a playerArsenalneed. He has a different game to Maddison. “I’m sure Arteta will see him as our type of player. For me, Tielemans is the one and I hope we can get that deal done in the summer.” Meanwhile, Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale says their performance in a 2-1 loss to Brighton at the weekend was “not good enough”. Ramsdale told Arsenal’s official website: “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t. We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. “I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? “It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season. “It’s not good enough. Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you’re losing at half-time.” ",negative

Jurgen Klopp is a huge fan of the England midfielder who has been catching eyes across Europe with his performances for Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool are expected to make a firm approach for Bellingham this summer but Bild reckons Real will look to leave it a year before making their move in 2023. Bellingham is not the only star the Spanish side are hoping to leave in Dortmund for another season. Real are said to be keen to persuade Erling Haaland to stay where he is for another 12 months while they make provisions for Kylian Mbappe before pairing them in their attack from the 2023-24 season. Real may also look to swoop for Aurelin Tchouameni this summer, with Goal naming the La Liga leaders as one of five clubs interested in the Monaco midfielder. The 14 Englishmen with over 3000 minutes of football this season  LEEDS SET RAPHINHA PRICE Barcelona have backed away from Mbappe and Haaland, with Joan Laporta insisting the pair are ‘far away’ from the Nou Camp because of the finances involved in deals for either striker. Laporta, though, admits Barca are keen on Leeds winger Raphinha: “He is a player we really like.” The Brazilian won’t come cheap, however, with the Mirror says Leeds have placed a £67million price tag on the 25-year-old. It seems Barca were hoping to take advantage of a clause in Raphinha’s contract to pay only around half that amount but The Athletic says the clause in his current terms is one that could only be activated upon Leeds being relegated.  ARSENAL IN FOR INTER STAR Arsenal are in the market for a centre-forward this summer, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin said to be among their targets. There were reports that the Everton striker has a deal lined up with another Premier League club but the England forward’s agent has issued a firm denial. So Arsenal may have turned their attention elsewhere, with the Gunners one of two clubs linked with Lautaro Martinez. The Inter Milan striker looks set to move on this summer, with the Italians open to selling the 24-year-old for £58million. Calciomercato says Arsenal have competition from Atletico Madrid for Martinez, though Diego Simeone’s side are also in for Paulo Dybala, with Mundo Deportivo reporting that the Rojiblancos are the Juve star’s preferred destination when he becomes a free agent in the summer.

The Reds have a lot of talent in midfield and out wide but it has been rumoured that Klopp is still keen to add to his squad in the next window. Otavio has been in good form for Porto this season, contributing three goals and 11 assists from midfield in Liga NOS withSergio Conceicao’s side leading the standings. Liverpool have already made one purchase from the Portuguese side this season with Luis Diaz arriving in January and the Colombian has already made a big impact. England strikers among Europe’s top ten goalscorers of 2022… And now Spanish publication Fichajes claims that Liverpool will attempt to raid Porto again in the summer but this time for Diaz’s former team-mate Otavio. His performances for the Portuguese national side recently has cemented the belief that Otavio can perform at a higher level and that has now ‘placed him in the sights of several important teams in Europe for next season’. Otavio, who has a contract at Porto until 2025, is valued at €20m and Fichajes insists that ‘three major teams’ are after the Brazil-born winger. On Liverpool’s interest they claim:‘The red team sees him as an option for the trivote in the midfielder zone, adding that he is a more forward profile and that he can reach the shooting zone.’ Man Utd and Newcastle are the two other teams interested in Otavio and another recent report said that the Magpies had ‘referenced’ the 27-year-old ahead of the summer transfer window. The same source has also insisted that Liverpool have ‘chosen’ a ‘replacement’ for Salah in case he leaves when his contract expires in the summer of 2023. The Reds have been negotiating with Salah’s representatives for a while now but they have yet to strike an agreement over a new contract, although the Egypt international has made it clear he wants to stay.

Raphinha joined the West Yorkshire club in 2020 after they were promoted back to the Premier League. FA as regulators? They have done enough damage already He has been terrific since moving to England. Last season the 25-year-old scored six goals and provided nine assists as Leeds finished ninth in the league. Raphinha has carried last term’s form into 2021/22 having scored nine goals in 27 top-flight appearances. Barcelona and Liverpool have both been linked with the Brazilian international. Fabrizio Romano revealed on Sunday that Barca have been in ‘advanced talks’ with Raphinha’s agent Deco since February. Meanwhile, Sport reckon that Leeds turned down a €35m bid from the La Liga giants, with the player keen to play under ‘brave’ coach Xavi Hernandez. And the club’s former goalkeeper Robinson believes that his old club should look to cash in on Raphinha at the end of the season. “I’d sell him, I’d let him go,” Robinson toldMOT Leeds News. “I think the way that he’s performed and his attitude this season has been in and out. “You know what a top-quality player he is and what a brilliant talent he is. But he hasn’t done it on a regular basis this year. “And if they can bring in £100million – or near £100million – for him, that money will go straight back into the squad to rebuild in the summer. “I don’t think that would be a bad bit of business.” Elsewhere,Leeds are reportedly interested in signing Manchester United youngster James Garner, who is currently on loan at Nottingham Forest. The 21-year-old progressed through the ranks at Man Utd. He made his senior debut for them during the 2018/19 campaign. Phil Hay ofThe Athletichas revealed that Garner has been ‘mentioned recently’ as a ‘target’ for Leeds.

718,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-xi-premier-league-loanees-first-team-arsenal-gallagher,An XI of Prem loanees who have earned a first-team chance,"Premier League teams will be monitoring their loanees to see who might be worth welcoming back next season. Arsenal have a couple of players. GOALKEEPER: Kjell Scherpen (Brighton, on loan at Oostende) Lacina Traore and Costel Pantilimon remain locked in a heated battle to decide the identity of the tallest Premier League player ever; think Godzilla in a 2013/14 Everton kit and Kong wearing goalkeeper gloves. Outside of the most scientific possible method – getting them to stand back to back and unevenly running a hand across the top of their heads – it might never be known who truly claims the crown. But Kjell Scherpen is watching from a distance with a vested interest. Brighton signed the 6ft 8ins shot-stopper from Ajax in July but only gave him a solitary appearance by mid-January, in the FA Cup victory over West Brom. Scherpen was otherwise tasked with watching Robert Sanchez from the sidelines before being sent out to Oostende in the Jupiler Pro League. The 22-year-old has kept a couple of clean sheets since, while his parent club have collapsed with Sanchez particularly culpable. Perhaps he needed the incredibly overbearing competition. Odd that Sanchez went downhill after we put Scherpen out of loan, guessing having a 6ft 8 Ajax stopper at the club pushing him for the 1 shirt after a solid debut against West Brom was going to do Rob a world of good — L🌵 (@L_BHAFC) March 17, 2022   RIGHT-BACK: Neco Williams (Liverpool, on loan at Fulham) Jurgen Klopp is not a typical subscriber to the loan market, preferring that even his fringe players be meticulously coached using the club’s methods rather than picking up bad habits elsewhere. But needs must and when Neco Williams requested a clearer path to more regular opportunities, the Liverpool manager acquiesced. Trent Alexander-Arnold was not for moving at Anfield so Fulham obliged, strengthening their Championship title pursuit with the addition of a prodigious defender and his supreme attacking instincts. Williams has a couple of goals and assists each in nine starts for the Cottagers and the chance to impress has done him the world of good. The Alexander-Arnold barrier will remain well beyond the end of this season but the Wales international has proven himself a capable deputy.  CENTRE-BACK: William Saliba (Arsenal, on loan at Marseille) The method in the madness that has been William Saliba’s apparent Arsenal exile is becoming clearer. Unai Emery sanctioned a £27m deal for the centre-half in the summer of 2019, allowing him to stay on loan at Saint-Etienne for another season. Mikel Arteta inherited the Frenchman within that mess of a team he has spent the past couple of years tidying. But Saliba was omitted from the club’s Premier League squad, was sent out to Nice for six months and then stayed in France after joining Marseille for the 2021/22 campaign. Many were aghast at the decision to sign Ben White while sending a ready-made defender packing but both Arsenal and Saliba have benefited. The Gunners have improved markedly in defence, while an international debut has followed another standout season in Ligue Un for a 21-year-old pencilled into Arteta’s plans. “I know that sometimes it’s difficult to explain or understand after the money that the club has spent trying to bring him in, to send him on loan,” the manager said in September, adding that “he’s a long-term player for us and we need to protect him as well”.  CENTRE-BACK: Levi Colwill (Chelsea, on loan at Huddersfield) After Thomas Tuchel orchestrated ‘the culling of the kids’ at Stamford Bridge upon his appointment as manager, it is difficult to envisage any product of the club’s famed academy breaking into the first team. Reece James has been cast aside. Mason Mount is a distant memory. Trevoh Chalobah provides the foundation for the scrapheap of shattered young dreams. But Levi Colwill could finally change all that. The teenage centre-half has shone at Huddersfield, playing as big a part as anyone in their Championship promotion challenge. Leicester and Crystal Palace have both been credited with an interest and his recent England U21 debut marks the latest chapter in a potential international future. But the volume of centre-half churn expected at Stamford Bridge this summer could open the first-team door for Levi to put down roots.  LEFT-BACK: Niels Nkounkou (Everton, on loan at Standard Liege) “I am learning a lot to return to my club stronger. It was not easy to change leagues, there was a period of adaptation which is now over.Physically, I am well and I hope to continue in this way,” said Niels Nkounkou in November, reflecting on his prescient decision to leave Goodison Park in search of more minutes. The left-back landed at Standard Liege in Belgium, deducing that his path at Everton was blocked by the imposing figure of Lucas Digne. But his compatriot has long gone and the position is proving problematic for Frank Lampard, who has used Jonjoe Kenny, Ben Godfrey and Vitaliy Mykolenko on the left of his defence to varying degrees of non-success. Nkounkou has had his vociferous supporters in the fanbase since signing almost two years ago and would be worth trying out, whichever division Everton end up in.  CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Donny van de Beek (Manchester United, on loan at Everton) Depending on who Manchester United choose as their guiding light into the brave new world of actually governing a club properly and not sustaining it on an exclusive diet of nostalgia and vibes, Donny van de Beek might play an integral role. Erik ten Hag derided the “mortal sin” that was committed by not picking him regularly, while Mauricio Pochettino once lauded his work rate and aptitude in front of goal. Everton have given the Dutchman no more stability but a consistency in selection has at least been welcomed. Van de Beek has strived to return the favour, showing glimpses of talent and application but understandably no ability to single-handedly drag the Toffees out of an increasingly sticky situation. With more support and trust in the Manchester United midfield, he could thrive under a manager able to work out how best to use him.  CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves, on loan at Sheffield United) Nine goals and seven assists in 27 Championship appearances is a fine way to make the most of a less than optimal scenario. Morgan Gibbs-White made 26 Premier League appearances in Wolves’ first season back in the top flight, but only 18 in the two campaigns thereafter. A grand total of seven combined minutes in Bruno Lage’s opening trio of losses in August signified that a change was needed, temporary or otherwise. Sheffield United offered safe haven to Gibbs-White and he hascarped the life out of the subsequent diems. The 22-year-old has also underlined his versatility, starting games as a centre-forward, second striker, attacking and defensive midfielder and right winger. Wolves would be foolish not to find a place for him.  CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Conor Gallagher (Chelsea, on loan at Crystal Palace) Chelsea could not really have planned the development of Conor Gallagher much better. The midfielder emerged with immense potential and expectation from the club’s youth system, signing a three-year contract ahead of a spell with Charlton in 2019. After being recalled from that loan, Gallagher was immediately sent to Swansea for the rest of the season. Another five-year deal followed, as did a first top-flight campaign with West Brom. Chelsea then entertained vast interest in the 22-year-old but opted to align him with Patrick Vieira and Crystal Palace for a year. Gallagher has gone from a Championship relegation battle to a play-off finish, Premier League relegation and now mid-table with two England caps in under three years. His next steps will surely be taken with the Blues, who have played this perfectly.   RIGHT WINGER: PhilipZinckernagel (Watford, on loan at Nottingham Forest) It was December when Philip Zinckernagel outlined one of the “agreements” he had struck with Watford. “I’m willing togo here on loan for the full season,I don’t want to go here for a couple of months and then go back,” said the Dane when the existence of a recall clause was reported.“I want to just play regularly, play a lot of games over a period.” And he has certainly done just that: 37 appearances for Nottingham Forest have produced five goals, nine assists, a promotion tilt and some standout performances against Premier League teams. If Watford survive, a top-flight chance is due. But in the event of relegation emergency, they can break the glass and welcome back a proven Championship commodity.  CENTRE-FORWARD: Deniz Undav (Brighton, on loan atUnion Saint-Gilloise) Brighton have scored 26 goals in the Premier League this season. Deniz Undav has matched that tally in 33 appearances forUnion Saint-Gilloise, the unlikely Belgian leaders. The Seagulls swooped to sign him for £6m in January and wisely sent him straight back on loan to make sure he got all that scoring out of his system before next season.  LEFT WINGER: Folarin Balogun (Arsenal, on loan at Middlesbrough) “I wouldn’t say every player needs a loan,” noted Folarin Balogun, a man who has clearly never been asked to come up with a feature idea for a football website during an international break. “Looking at mine, at the time a loan was the right thing to do so I went ahead with it,” he continued, adding that Middlesbrough has helped him “mature” and focus on “what I need to do to get into the team” at Arsenal. Two goals and assists each in six Championship starts ought to help, as should his status as a Gunners forward with a contract that isn’t about to expire. ",positive

Lyon brought him in for roughly £22m. Ten Hag realism should strengthen not weaken his Man United claim The Dutchman was able to rebuild his reputation in Ligue 1 with Lyon.

I think also the way we play, he can show a better Ruben, and also the way he plays puts our team on a different level. “When you have that player, the best thing to do is improve his salary and years of contract. “But who knows, when you have a top player like him in that specific position, that can defend and attack, and is a top professional and a great man, the big teams are there with £100m to buy these kinds of players.” ",positive

WILF ON THE PROWL “It shows that we don’t need to look over our shoulder. We can look up the table and try to move further on,” said Wilfried Zaha after scoring his 10th goal of the Premier League season in an impressive Crystal Palace victory over Arsenal. The 29-year-old might be surprised to learn that, for the Eagles, it helped prove they might finally no longer need the attacking talisman. The Daily Mail report that Palace ‘are open to offers’ for Zaha as the five-year deal he signed after one of his last proper pushes to leave Selhurst Park in 2018 will expire at the end of next season. Palace ‘have always been open to selling’ but his contractual situation, combined with the prominence of Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and others who can carry the forward burden, should finally bring the valuation down. While the internal view is that Palace have finally built a squad and appointed a coach that could cope with the loss of Zaha, it is added that he is still seen ‘as their best player’. There is every chance he could be persuaded to extend his stay after they win the FA Cup and Patrick Vieira emulates Alan Pardew’s Wembley dance.  DEPAY FACTORY Barcelona’s rise under Xavi has not been fun for everyone at the Nou Camp. Memphis Depay started the first three La Liga games under the new manager but none of the subsequent 14, succumbing to a couple of injuries and then the January arrivals of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres. Ousmane Dembele coming back into the Catalan fold has consigned Depay to the bench and a role as perma-cameo in the closing stages. With Erling Haaland and others being targeted this summer, that squeeze will become even tighter. Super Deporte therefore claim he will either walk or be pushed out, and it is a Premier League return that ‘most seduces him’. That is down to money but also a desire for vindication after his Manchester United past. Arsenal, Everton and Newcastle ‘have already inquired’ for Depay, whose other prospective ‘girlfriends’ include Juventus and Lyon. Everyone get ready to read about expensive cars and garish fashion JUST DAYS AFTER a crushing defeat again. And Arsenal refusing to be burned by Zaha’s availability in favour of moving for Depay is a fun prospect.  TOON UP The Daily Mirror shed some more light on the transfer plans being laid by Newcastle. Simon Bird stresses that ‘theemphasis will be on up and coming young players, rather than fading superstars,’ which might not be great news for the 28-year-old wage-drain Depay. The Magpies are targeting a centre-half, a midfielder and a goalscorer, as well as ‘a new young keeper’ to compete with Martin Dubravka. And plenty of names are dropped, from Lloyd Kelly to Yves Bissouma, Kalvin Phillips, Darwin Nunez, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Dean Henderson and Sam Johnstone. To stay at least vaguely in line with spending protocols, there will also be sales. Miguel Almiron is said to be the most ‘vulnerable’ as a £10m-rated fringe player. ",positive

It was reported over the weekend that Tottenham are ‘top of the list’ of the Premier League sides to sign the former Manchester United forward. It is said that Depay is happy in Catalonia but will ‘study his situation’ with numerous sides in Italy, as well as Lyon, also keen. Renowned journalist Fabrizio Romano has been “told” that Spurs are not prioritising the Dutchman as they head into the summer transfer window. He says that the north Londoners are happy with Heung-min Son and January arrival Dejan Kulusevski in the forward area. “Yes, there are still some rumours about Memphis Depay, especially from Spain about Memphis Depay and Tottenham,” Romano said on his Here We Go Podcast (via HITC). “What I am told is that there is no proposal from Tottenham, it’s something they’re not discussing now and it’s not a priority right now. “Kulusevski will stay next season and he’s a player they’re super happy with, and Son is of course also part of the project. For Tottenham, Memphis Depay is not a priority, that is what I am told.” ",positive
