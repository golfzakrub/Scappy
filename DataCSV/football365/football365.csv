Tchouameni has been coveted by a number of clubs around Europe with both Manchester United and Chelsea linked in recent months. The 22-year-old has played at every age group for France from under-16 all the way up to under-21 before making his first senior appearance in September last year. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Tchouameni completed a move from Bordeaux to Monaco in 2020 and has scored six goals in 92 appearances in all competitionsfor theMonégasques, from a mainly defensive midfield position. And now Liverpool – who have put a brilliant squad together in recent years – are ready to bid for the Frenchman this summer, according to Romano, with the Reds “targeting a new midfielder”. “Aurelien Tchouameni is certainly a player being monitored by Liverpool,”Romano wrote on Anfield Watch. “Who have had conversations with the agent of the Monaco midfielder. However, the €45 million price tag – set last summer – is no longer valid. A far higher offer will be needed to prise Tchouameni away from France. “But the 22-year-old is planning for a different experience this summer and that is undoubtedly why Liverpool may be ready to make their move. However, Real Madrid has been following Tchouameni for some time, and the Reds will face competition from other top clubs interested in the French international.” A deal for Fulham attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho, which collapsed on deadline day in January, is understood to be close with Liverpool to pay “around£5m plus £2.7m in add-ons”. Romano added: “Klopp will also be involved in all the transfer decisions in the coming months and he has already given his green light for the signing of Fulham’sFabio Carvalho. The deal is already closed, the paperwork has been completed in recent days and there is no doubt: Carvalho will soon be announced as the first new signing of the 2022/2023 season, with a long-term contract until June 30, 2027. “The Portuguese talent has already been to the AXA Training Centre to meet with Klopp and he extensively explored Liverpool’s facilities before completing a medical – with Fulham’s permission. “Liverpool will pay around £5m plus £2.7m in add-ons, including a sell-on clause for 20% of Carvalho’s future sale. Liverpool faced competition from other clubs, who had tried to enter the race for his signature in February following the collapsed deal between Liverpool and Fulham on Deadline Day, for reasons of time in completing the contract. “But Carvalho has respected his agreement with the Reds, and the club themselves have an excellent relationship with Fulham after agreeing to keep the terms of the agreement reached in January instead of signing Carvalho on a free transfer this summer. The move has been particularly appreciated at Craven Cottage and future ties between the clubs are likely to be friendly. “Carvalho’s programme for the future is very clear: as things stand there is no planned return to Fulham on loan next season. Liverpool intend to keep Carvalho in the first team and consider him part of the group, but the final confirmation will come during pre-season after Klopp has the chance to assess his new midfielder.” ",positive

The 25-year-old made the move to Liverpool in January from Porto for a fee that could rise to £50m. Tottenham Hotspur were pursuing him but he ended up opting to sign for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Diaz has hit the ground running for the Premier League side. He has grabbed four goals and three assists from his 20 outings. The forward was involved in two of Liverpool’s goals as they beat Man Utd 4-0 at Anfield last month. Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season.” ",positive

Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive

The stars in question are James-Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen. The latter has been linked with Liverpool in recent months. Bowen has been one of West Ham’s standout players this term both domestically and in Europe. He has grabbed 16 goals and eleven assists from his 47 outings across all competitions. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Ward-Prowse meanwhile progressed through the ranks at Southampton. He has played over 350 times for the Saints. He has also featured ten times for England since he made his debut in 2017. The free-kick specialist has impressed for Southampton this term. He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League. Spanish outlet Fichajes are reporting that Ward-Prowse and Bowen are ‘covered by Ten Hag for his Man Utd.’ Ward-Prowse is ‘one of the first names’ on the Dutchman’s ‘agenda’, while it is noted that Bowen has been one of the ‘main Premier League revelations’ in recent seasons. The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive

Arsenal paid £27m to sign the centre-back from Saint-Etienne in 2019. He is yet to make his debut for the Gunners. After spells at Saint-Etienne and Nice, the 21-year-old joined Marseille on loan before this season. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Saliba has been one of the standout players in Ligue 1 this term as he has played 49 times for Marseille across all competitions. His form for Marseille led to him making his senior debut for France earlier this year. The defender stated last month that there is ‘a chance’ that he will spend another season at Marseille. Henry feels for Saliba as he was forced out on loan before making an error for Arsenal: “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” Henry told Amazon Prime. “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” Elsewhere,Darren Bent has said that he would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” ",positive

The Spaniard produced a good performance for the Red Devils on Monday as they beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford with goals coming from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. Mata was making his first Premier League start of the campaign with the 34-year-old starting just three of his ten appearances in all competitions this term. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The decision by interim boss Rangnick to start Mata frustrated Man Utd legend Keane who thinks the German is “giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons”. “I’m surprised. It’s his first start of the season, he obviously knows he’s leaving the club. There’s some loyalty there, giving him a run-out. “He came on for 20 minutes the other night but starting a game is much different. It tells you where the mindset is. They are giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons.” 🗣 “I’m surprised.” Roy Keane says he wasn’t expecting Juan Mata to start over Marcus Rashford this evening for Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/MYVJQzJ9BS — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 But Rangnick was pleased with Mata’s performance against Brentford and when asked whether he could’ve used him more often, the Man Utd boss replied:“Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. “He had moments when he played like a magician.” Mata is out of contract at Man Utd at the end of the season and looks almost certain that he will leave the club in the summer. On Mata’s future, Rangnick added: “I don’t know [if he’s leaving]. He hasn’t confirmed that but it is possible. “It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time and played well for the club.” Phil Jones, who has also struggled for game time in recent seasons, got on the pitch for the final 15 minutes in what is likely to be his Old Trafford farewell with Man Utd finishing the season with away trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace. “For personal reasons he didn’t train a lot, yesterday was the first,” said Rangnick of Jones. “He asked me to allow him some time at home.

It was reported back in March that Tottenham are targeting De Vrij ‘at the request’ of Antonio Conte. The Spurs boss worked with the centre-back during their time together at Inter Milan. De Vrij has played 161 times for the Italian giants since the start of the 2018/19 campaign. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football The 30-year-old won the Serie A title when Conte was in charge in 2020/21. He is out of contract in 2023 and he is expected to leave Inter Milan this summer. Football Insider are reporting that the ‘door has opened’ for clubs to sign De Vrij, with Tottenham, Newcastle and Aston Villa interested in him. De Vrij is ‘yet to open talks’ with Inter over a new deal so his future is ‘up in the air’. He was previously valued at £40m but he is now available for just £15m. It is stated that Conte is a ‘huge admirer’ of the defender and he wanted Tottenham to sign him in January. Elsewhere,The Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘with Graham Potter and Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive

The former Republic of Ireland international played 480 times for the Red Devils over 13 seasons, winning seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League. He played alongside a number of amazing players during his time at Old Trafford and Sky Sports asked him to pick hisgreatest Man Utd XI of the Premier League era on their Monday Night Football show. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United.

Keane continued: “I’m certainly not going to pick myself. Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and a very good team-mate.” On leaving Cantona out, Keane said: “Eric was a brilliant player for Man United. I’m upset to leave Eric out.

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong.

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games.

So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive

They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” Year 1-2 | #UCL qualification Year 3 | Title challengers Year 4-5 | Premier League Winners 🏆 Gary Neville lays out the timeline that he expects Erik ten Hag to achieve things at Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/yd4KtSvhgc — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 Fellow pundit Roy Keane thinks the main thing Man Utd need to improve on is their recruitment with a lack of the right characters in the Old Trafford dressing room. “Whatever their problems, they have to look at where Man City are, where Liverpool are,” Keane added. “Man City, Liverpool and these other teams aren’t going to take it easy over the summer. They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it? The biggest frustration for me, when they’ve had these disappointments, is the reaction they’ve shown. There’s been a real lack of leadership, not enough characters in that dressing room.”  ",positive

The 24-year-old couldn’t have started the season better for the Red Devils after returning from a shoulder operation with three goals in his first four matches. However, it has been downhill since then with the England international scoring just two more goals in his next 28 appearances in all competitions. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Rashford failed to get off the bench for United’s win over Brentford but he was still a topic of conversation for Man Utd legend Keane and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher on Monday. “He seems short on confidence,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I go back, I think he’s taken his eye off the ball, with all his off the field stuff. “He’s got that experience, but he doesn’t mix his game. Even when he’s playing through the middle, I said he plays like a child [againstLiverpool]. “It’s like he’s not learnt from the game. I think he’s lost the eye of the tiger and he’s struggling to get it back. I think the hunger, he’s got to get the hunger back and make runs like Elanga tonight. Rashford has lost that hunger which is huge for a player.” “I think he’s lost the eye of the tiger!” 👁🐯 Roy Keane and @Carra23 discuss whether or not Marcus Rashford has “hit a ceiling” at Manchester United 🥵 pic.twitter.com/tgqt96i5fu — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 It was only a couple of weeks ago that Keane said that Man Utd forward Rashford “played like a child” in their 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. “Jesse Lingard comes on!” Keane said. “Jesse Lingard coming on to try and save Man United, Jesse Lingard should have left Man United two years ago, he’s not good enough for Man United. “Rashford played like a child up front. Okay it wasn’t great service, but the one or two bits he got where he was in on goal and a poor touch. “Defensively, we were trying to help Maguire out here before the match, give him a little bit of PR, but the last goal, Maguire’s passing and defending, not acceptable, not good enough for Man United.”  ",positive

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role. There has always been an understanding that Rangnick would move into a consultancy position at Man Utd after his period as interim manager came to an end – but there was no expectation from fans that he would be doing another job at the same time. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” 🗣 @Carra23: “That is WRONG.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time. Laser-focused, clear lines, people staying in their lines understanding what their roles are and actually communicating that to a fan base, this is a real change, this is different than it has been for the last 10 years.”  ",positive

Fans showed their anger at the Glazer family as their team earned themselves a 3-0 win against Brentford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

In spells we were too hectic. “But OK, fair play to Man United. I think they hit a very high performance first half – some of their better performance that I have seen so far so they did well. “Second half much more the Brentford team I want to see, much more front footed. “We had momentum with chances and half chances and we were definitely on top and then we make a stupid mistake for the penalty, an unnecessary mistake and that of course killed the game off I would say. “If you want to win here at Old Trafford, we can’t make a penalty and concede on a set piece.”  ",positive
15,https://www.football365.com/news/man-united-3-0-brentford-ronaldo-inspires-red-devils-victory-old-trafford,Man United 3-0 Brentford: Ronaldo inspires Red Devils to victory at Old Trafford,"Manchester United enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win against Brentford in their final home match of a miserable season as Old Trafford bid farewell to Ralf Rangnick and some players amid more protests against the Glazer family. Monday marked a year since the postponement of the Red Devils’ home clash against Liverpool, when fans made their anger at the ownership clear in the wake of the European Super League debacle. F365 says: Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Supporters have protested at each of United’s final three home games and the anti-Glazer sentiment was clear before and during the victory against Brentford at Old Trafford. This was the first match that Thomas Frank’s Bees had lost with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up and there were times before and after Bruno Fernandes’ early opener that the Dane threatened to unlock the hosts. A narrow offside decision denied Cristiano Ronaldo before half-time, but the veteran would get on the scoresheet after converting the spot-kick foolishly given away by Rico Henry. Raphael Varane hooked home a deflected third as fans gave standing ovations to departing Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata as they were substituted on their final Old Trafford appearances. There were renewed chants against the Glazers in the 73rd minute, when a few departed rather than the mass exodus planned ahead of a huge summer in every department at United. Brentford may find the scoreline hard to swallow given the impressive moments they showed during their first competitive match at Old Trafford since 1975. Eriksen pulled the strings from the outset and put Bryan Mbeumo behind dozy Alex Telles in the opening seconds of a match that saw the Stretford End applaud the Denmark international at their first corner. Brentford played with confidence under the Old Trafford floodlights but United would strike an early blow, with Diogo Dalot sending Anthony Elanga scampering down the right. The 20-year-old – one of few bright spots for United this term – fizzed over a cross that Fernandes crashed home in the ninth minute. Eriksen attempted to catch out David De Gea with a snapshot when Brentford returned to the attack and provided a brilliant cross that Ivan Toney headed over from close range. While the Brentford playmaker probed, Ronaldo was proving a handful at the other end. From backheels to forcing David Raya into an awkward save from a long-range free-kick, then furiously claiming he should have had a penalty following Mads Bech Sorensen’s challenge. Referee Chris Kavanagh was unmoved. Next Ronaldo smartly flicked into Mata, who lashed narrowly wide of the near post on his first Premier League start of the season. Mbeumo flashed wide as the Bees swarmed forward and Eriksen continued to impress, only for United to celebrate a second. Mata broke down the left and sent a low cross that Ronaldo squeezed past Raya. Provider and scorer celebrated together, only for the goal to be ruled out following a VAR review. That decision gave Brentford renewed hope of a famous result and De Gea denied Eriksen’s stinging 30-yard free-kick in the second half, then stopped Toney with his feet. But it was not all one-way traffic and Raya tipped a Dalot effort onto the woodwork after a one-two with Ronaldo, who had strayed offside in the build-up. Fernandes fizzed across the face of goal having been found by Matic before United created breathing space in the 61st minute. Ronaldo was bundled over in the box by Henry and the veteran sent Raya the wrong way in front of an elated Stretford End. There were standing ovations for Matic and Mata as they were substituted in the final home match before their contracts expire, with the latter able to celebrate a third goal before being replaced. Pontus Jansson nearly turned a Ronaldo cross into his own goal but it went behind for a corner, which Telles swung over for Varane to hook in via a deflection. The planned walk out 17 minutes from time saw some exit but not the masses some expected as flares filled the air and chants increased in volume. Substitute Edinson Cavani looked desperate to score on what is surely his last Old Trafford appearance, but the closing stages petered out and Brentford failed to score a consolation. ",positive
16,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-premier-league-worst-xi-leeds-brentford-wolves-newcastle,"Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI…","Four Leeds players make the worst XI of the Premier League weekend, joined by three Wolves, three Bees and a Magpie. It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

17,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive

They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

19,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-career-mino-raiola-demonstrated-absurdities-modern-football,The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football,"Raiola was loved by his clients and made himself a lot of money, but the influence of agents in remains at best mixed for the game. In the end, he died as he lived: bullish to his final breath and shrouded in controversy. At a human level, the death of Mino Raiola at the age of 54 is obviously a tragedy, and a sobering reflection upon how fragile life can be. And that shouldn’t be forgotten as we pause to reflect upon his life. But he was also one of the most divisive figures in one of the most divisive part of football’s universe, and that cannot be ignored either. Even his actual passing had an air of hyperreality. His death was first reported in the Italian press early on Thursday morning, only to be contradicted by a tweet from Raiola’s official account which read: ‘Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in four months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate.’ Later the same day, Jose Fortes Rodriguez, a close colleague, told reporters that “he’s in a bad position, but he hasn’t died”. But on Saturday afternoon, his death was confirmed; this time the confirmation came from his official Twitter account and there have been no subsequent contradictions. Raiola inspired polarised opinions and this is hardly surprising. In one respect, he fitted a stereotype: overweight, usually wearing shades and jogging bottoms, seldom (if ever) seen in a suit, and more often than not with a mobile phone pressed to the side of his face. And he was famously abrasive, with a tendency to berate anybody who got in the way of him negotiating the best deal possible for his clients or those who criticised him. He certainly seemed plenty aware of this perception. When he decided to purchase a property in Miami, he spent €9m on the former home of Al Capone. But he also polarised opinion because he was amongst the most successful agents, at least in terms of making himself a lot of money. It’s always been the case that the transfer of an elite-level player can change the course of a club’s history, and the growing influence of agents as power-brokers within the game has had a strange effect on others. Raiola found his name being sung by fans of clubs desperate to sign his clients, but has also found himself being criticised live on television in post-match discussions. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the players with whom he was most closely associated and a player with a similarly abrasive way of dealing with the outside world, was a close personal friend. Those who criticise agents as ‘leeches taking money out of the game’ (or variants thereupon) are almost missing the point; in this day and age, agents are very much part of the game and its inner workings. Consider, for example, the influence of Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the club having won promotion to the Premier League and established themselves in the top half of the Premier League, with European football under their belt. We might not like the fact that agents hold this much influence, but it doesn’t make it any less true. But the career arc of Paul Pogba does ask questions of whether the influence of the agent is always beneficial to the player concerned. Pogba won four Serie A titles in a row by the time he was 23 with Juventus, but his £89m sale to Manchester United in 2016 has seen his career stall (at least at club level), and it remains likely that he will be leaving Old Trafford at the end of this season with just a Europa League and a Carabao Cup medal to show for the six prime years of his career, although who might now be representing him now is unknown. But the facts are stark. Manchester United didn’t get anything like what they were expecting from him and the player doesn’t seem to have had an especially happy time there, but Raiola was reported to have earned himself €27m from the deal.  Right to the very end, Raiola was understood to be working feverishly to complete the transfer of Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but his death comes with this contract not having been completed and there were even reports that Manchester City had visited him in hospital to get it over the line. What happens to that deal now – or to any of his clients – is a question for another day, but with the end of the season and the opening of another transfer window on the horizon, that other day will have to come sooner rather than later. There is a case for saying that agents are good for football. Players need representation when contracts are being signed, and few would question that they would be highly vulnerable to exploitation if that representation didn’t exist. And there’s a case for saying that redistributing football’s vast wealth to players is better than it staying in the hands of those who run clubs, even if the distribution of those wages isn’t particularly even. And even criticism of the Paul Pogba career arc should be tempered by the fact that Pogba never asked Raiola to stop representing him. If the player thinks the agent is doing a good job, that’s all that matters, right? Well… not quite. What the life and death of Mino Raiola exposes is the absurdity of modern football, a world in which an agent will have their name sung from the rafters if he brings a client to your club but is a game-sucking leech if he doesn’t; a world in which transfers are often treated as more important than matches, in which being abrasive and obnoxious is perfectly okay, so long as that person is throwing shade upon someone else that you disagree with; a world in which grotesque inequalities and the commoditisation of people – including children – are simply accepted as if there’s nothing that can be done about them, and in which millions of not-very-wealthy people pay substantial money in season ticket money and pay-TV subscriptions, only for a fair proportion of it to end up with already very wealthy people who often seem to love football while holding it in contempt. There’s every possibility that, wherever he is right now, Mino Raiola is having a good old laugh to himself over the absurdity of it all – including the reporting of both of his deaths – and he’d be absolutely right.

We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

21,https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-midfield-targets-rice-gravenberch-tchouameni-haidara-phillips,Man Utd’s five midfield targets: the cases for and against,"Manchester United’s priority for the summer transfer window is said to be a central midfielder. But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive
22,https://www.football365.com/news/tuchel-tells-chelsea-beat-man-utd-e80m-ligue-1-star,Tuchel tells Chelsea to beat Man Utd to €80m star ‘at all costs’,"Thomas Tuchel has urged Chelsea to beat Manchester United to the signing ofAurelien Tchouameni ‘at all costs’. Tchouameni has emerged as one of the finest young talents in European football in the last year, starring for Monaco and the France international team. READ MORE: 2020 vision: Every PL club’s best signing of the decade so far Paul Pogba played alongsideTchouameni in France’s 2-1 win over Spain in the Nations League final in October, and hailed his “extraordinary” talent. Pogba said:“Very, very good. He’s not a boy, he’s a man. “It’s a pleasure to play next to him. He brings a lot of energy. A lot of energy, extraordinary technical and physical quality. “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” Despite Chelsea’s strength in the two holding midfield roles, they have struggled with absnences in those positions this season, and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho both now 30 years old, Tuchel wants fresh blood in the middle of the park. Conor Gallagher is expected to return from his loan at Crystal Palace to stake a claim for a place in the Chelsea team next season, but his form hasn’t lessened their interest in Tchouameni. The 21-year-old – valued by Monaco at €80million – is also on United’s radar, with some reports suggesting the Red Devils are leading the race. But Marca (via football.london) claim Tuchel has singled outTchouameni as his number one target and he’s told Chelsea to land him ‘at all costs’ this summer. In an interview with L’Equipe, Tchouameni has previously discussed his future, insisting that he does not let it distract him from his work with Monaco. “I remember I was in Paris, after the Nations League. I woke up and my phone had blown up,” he said. “My father called me, we talked about everything and he told me that I was on the front page of Marca. I went on Twitter and saw for myself. “I told him it was cool, but what does it actually matter? It doesn’t. The front page of Marca will not define me or allow me to perform well in matches. It’s not real life, but it is the media world, the football business.

23,https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-man-utd-rangnick-brentford,Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here?,"The Mailbox ponders how Liverpool’s season will be viewed if they don’t win any of the three remaining trophies they are going for this month. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… What qualifies as Liverpool success? I think it’s pretty crazy that Liverpool could finish the season as FA Cup finalists, champs league finalists, runner up in the league and winner of the league cup and pretty much every fan will think of it as a failed season. Myself included. By any other standard any two of those four achievements is a superb season for 99% of teams. Which I guess highlights just how high Klopp has raised our expectations now. I said after we drew with city that the title was gone. That was a must win game. My friends (also reds) said I was pessimistic and city would def drop points along the way and we would win every game. Winning every game for us at that point would mean a 14 game winning streak, one of the longest in club history. So far we’ve done that. But pep just knows how to put giant runs together and looking at the calendar at the time I couldn’t see any teams taking points off city. Still don’t. 4 games left and it’s looking ever more likely that the season will finish with city being one point above us and that game Vs city being a costly one (though really any game we dropped points is just as costly). But I genuinely believe (as objectively as I can) that we will win a cup treble this season. Regardless of who makes it to the final it will be a very tough game with either two teams who play fast attacking football and a high tempo pressure game filled with talented players or Liverpool against a team of dark arts masters who are older than the Bible with twice the staying power. Would other Liverpool fans be disappointed with a cup treble? I want to say no but I know in my heart of hearts that that premier League trophy is the one we really want. I’d swap the champs league for the premier League this year for sure. I shouldn’t be disappointed, especially considering only a few years ago we almost ceased to exist. But I know that pang of regret will be there anyway…Lee  Eye on the ballIsaac, believe me, my eye is very much on the ball. I am making no assumptions about Liverpool winning their last 4 games. In fact in my mail on Sunday I said it was a real possibility that they wouldn’t. I am very worried about the game against Tottenham, just as I was worried about the Newcastle game, worried about the Man United game, worried about the Everton game and worried about pretty much every other game Liverpool play. I do find the comment about the ‘ridiculous’ concern from Liverpool fans about where City could drop points slightly odd though. Isn’t that what football fans do? Are Spurs, Arsenal, Leeds, Burnley, & Everton fans not scouring the fixtures list to see where points may be won and lost? Seriously, if you’re not doing that are you even a real football fan?Mike, LFC, London   Everton relegation bad for Man City Not only would Everton’s relegation be bad for the city it would also be bad news for Manchester City. As it stands City only have the Manchester derby as the game where “form goes out of the window” but Liverpool have two, with the Merseyside derby and the rivalry with United. It is rare that Liverpool actually do the double over Everton (this season aside) and it is hard to imagine a promoted team taking points off them. With the margin between the two being so small, Everton’s relegation might make all the difference next season and (perish the thought) beyond.CDM  Departing manager bounce 29th of April – Rangnick appointed Austria manager for next season. 2nd May, Man United play their first convincing game of Rangnick’s tenure, displaying flair, composure, and effort. It turns out these players can play, and they can defend, and score goals too. Coincidence? Or motivation? And if you believe it was ‘just Brentford’ consider that if United had played this way and won all the games we played against teams in the bottom half of the premiership we would have had 16 points more. Contrary to popular opinion, this team doesn’t need surgery. It needs a spark.Ved Sen, MUFC.  Ralf finds the formula Man Utd finally played good football. Huge shout outs to Mata & Matic. All the others players have 100% and it showed. Is it a coincidence Man Utd plays good football without Maguire & Rashford? The former simply doesn’t deserve to be in a top six team, the latter is a footballer turned book writer who can’t be bothered to run on a football pitch. If only Ralf had found this formula earlier. CheersAshwin – Man Utd fan  Where did all the nicknames go? Two things which have been rolling around in my head recently – What ever happened to nicknames for players? It feels like they are not as prominent anymore. In the past, here in sunny and loadshedded South Africa, we had wonderful nicknames for players like Ace, Computer, and my favourite, Lucas ‘Masterpieces’ Moripe. According to Wikipedia, Steven Gerrard is referred to as the ‘Hammer of Huyton’. I can’t recall ever singing for the ‘Hammer’. ‘Scores from forty yards’, uncountable times. Was he referred to as the Hammer at all up in England? I know Luis Suarez went by ‘El pistolero’ but this seemed to be more widely used for him in Uruguay? Maybe Salah’s ‘Egyptian King’ moniker might currently be applicable but in truth, are nicknames still assigned? I’d love if we could start calling them James ‘the Anvil’ Milner and Joel ‘Pureclass’ Matip. My second mental wandering I confine to brackets.

Tchouameni is on the wishlists of a number of top European clubs, including Manchester United and Chelsea, but Liverpool have also entered the fray. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The 22-year-old midfielder has been a stalwart for Monaco since his £16m move from Bordeaux in the summer of 2020. The Times claim ‘the clever recruitment of the likes of Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Ibrahima Konaté in recent transfer windows has maintained the club’s forward momentum by freshening up the squad and that approach is likely to continue’. The report continues, ‘they like Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni, although they are aware the France international is attracting interest from Real Madrid. Whether they press ahead with interest depends on a number of factors, including price, but it would be a midfielder with a similar profile to the powerful Tchouaméni that they would target should he be out of reach’. It’s also claimed that the club is interested inAberdeen’s 18-year-old right back Calvin Ramsay, who is also wanted by Leeds United, while a deal forFulham’s Fabio Carvalho, 19, has already been lined up. Liverpool’s desire to continue to improve the squad has been boosted by ‘positive noises’ from Jurgen Klopp over signing a new deal at the club. President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal with his ulterior motive to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’.

The Frenchman has also been linked with a move to Manchester United. It is said that Monaco’s asking price ‘could go up to £50m’. Following a spell at Bordeaux, Tchouameni made the move to Monaco during the winter transfer window in 2020. Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together The 22-year-old has been an ever-present for Monaco over the past two seasons. He has been in fine form as he has played 47 times this term across all competitions. Tchouameni made his senior debut for France last year and he has now been capped eight times. Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna has revealed (via Twitter) that Liverpool are targeting Tchouameni. It is said that ‘contacts have been initiated’ between Liverpool and Monaco. In a boost to Liverpool, the player is reportedly ‘interested in the idea’ of playing in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has been taken aback by the recent performances of Divock Origi: “If you are in a rhythm, the easy bit is coming on and making an impact as a sub,” Owen said. “Everyone is tiring and it’s a free punch, that’s the easy bit. “The hard bit is the never playing bit. You get out of rhythm. Your mindset is not playing. “You go to bed on a Friday and you don’t even expect to play. “If you keep doing the right things, keep eating the right food, go to bed at the right time, and training perfectly. And you keep getting disappointed every weekend, then something switches off, at some point. “For him to stay at that level and that sharpness, and every single time he is called upon he comes on and makes a difference is quite staggering. “He doesn’t lose his fitness, his sharpness, he doesn’t lose anything, appetite and his attitude. “If I kept coming on and scoring, and being brushed aside and not starting and not playing, I’d start to get sickened by it. “So fair play to him, [he’s got] a great attitude.” ",positive

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive

But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere.

It is understood that Juventus are another team interested in the midfielder but thatTchouameni would not be willing to move to Serie A at this point in his career. The big rivals to the two Premier League sides comes from Spain, though, with La Liga giants Real Madrid eyeing upTchouameni as a replacement for Casemiro. He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

Crouch wrote in the Daily Mail: “Now I like being on the right side of history, so I don’t think it’s particularly wise to pick a Player of the Year before we know who has won what. “I’m often left surprised by how early they are generally done. The winner has to come from the best team and the best team is often unknown until May. “All the awards should be left as late as possible and I always thought voting for the PFA Player of the Year was done far too early, often months before the season finishes. “It seemed strange timing to me, with so much of the league left to play, and I could never quite get my head around why voting was not electronic either. There should be an app for your phone that takes 10 seconds to complete. More players might vote then, too! “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season. Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks. “Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them. If the two clubs trade trophies, Salah pips the others in my view for his sheer weight of goal contributions.” ",positive

Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United.

Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that.

F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe The quadruple would be an unprecedented feat in England and both Ferdinand and fellow BT Sport pundit Michael Owen were in awe of the Reds on Wednesday. “This is the best Liverpool team I’ve ever seen,” Ferdinand said. “They’re relentless with and without the ball. It’s the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application, you marvel at it. “That [the quadruple] has got to be the aim.

The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp said. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding.

Increasingly stranger things Ian Ladyman of the Daily Mail understandably enjoyed himself at the Etihad but something was eating him up inside: ‘We are four years in to the second decade of Middle East ownership now and watching this incredible game of European football it was hard not to wonder what further fabulous dramas may lie ahead. ‘More particularly, it seemed increasingly strange – as City traded thunderous blows with the best team in Spain – to ponder why Pep Guardiola would even think about leaving when his current contract expires at the end of next season.’ That does seem an ‘increasingly strange’ angle to ‘ponder’ after ‘watching this incredible game of European football’, which is presumably why literally no-one else did. But here we are. Guardiola has a contract that runs until 2023. He has been at Manchester City since 2016. This is already his longest unbroken spell as manager of one club by two years. That tenure, a four-year reign at Barcelona, came to an end because of a self-confessed need to “recharge my batteries”. It is not difficult to figure out why Guardiola might leave when his deal expires. But again, why is this hypothetical scenario that might come to pass in 13 months’ timeeven a subject of discussion after the first leg of an enthralling Champions League semi-final? There is no answer. Only more instances of things seeming strange. ‘This is the City team that Guardiola built and much as they were brilliantly expansive and precocious here, it is one that will only grow better, wiser and more talented from this point. ‘Next season, for example, the Premier League leaders are expected to have the Norwegian forward Erling Haaland in their ranks. ‘So, yes, it seems strange that Guardiola would even think about leaving as he has previously suggested he will.’ It would be strange if Guardiola didn’t think about leaving when his current contract of employment runs out. It would be strange if Guardiola was even looking beyond May, considering this season could yet end with Manchester City winning no trophies or claiming a Premier and Champions League double. It is downright bizarre that this is such a point of focus. ‘For all its quirks, this has the look of the greatest City team Guardiola has assembled in his six years in England. Its rivalry with Liverpool is magnetic. ‘If Guardiola does not continue to work here beyond next season, it’s hard to wonder where he will go. Even harder to work out why.’ It truly is impossible to predict what a man who took a sabbatical after four years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching could potentially do after seven years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching. Hopefully by the end of that seventh year, Ladyman has figured out the ‘increasingly strange’ world of football contracts.  Pep talk ‘Pep Guardiola must be furious with narrow Man City win – Real Madrid are comeback kings’ – the Daily Mirror headline to John Cross’ opinion piece. ‘Pep Guardiola’s delight with Manchester City’s swashbuckling win against Real Madrid outweighed any frustration about their inability to put the Champions League semi-final to bed in a jaw-dropping first leg’ – MailOnline.  Spill the Thi The biggest story on Wednesday, of course, is not Manchester City beating Real Madrid 4-3 in a thriller. It’s that Rio Ferdinand has said some words about Thiago Alcantara. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to sign for Man United before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich and says his ‘ridiculous’ form shows ‘players need time’… as he tips Jadon Sancho to emulate him,’ is the beefyMailOnline headline. They add with no little specificity that ‘Ferdinand reveals the player told him he was keen on becoming a Red Devil in 2020 when he was linked with a move away from the Bundesliga’. Except Ferdinand revealed no such thing. He was asked about Manchester United’s previous interest in the midfielder, said that he “spoke to him” and Thiago “wanted to come to United”. But this was in 2013. Not 2020, and definitely not ‘before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich’. Ferdinand has even spoken about this at length before on this very same podcast. Still, if one outlet blinks then others must follow: ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara “wanted” to join Man Utd before Liverpool transfer’ – Daily Mirror website. ”I spoke to him’ – Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago transfer claim over Liverpool and Man United’ – Liverpool Echo, who echo the demonstrably erroneous claim that ‘the former England international has claimedThiagotold him he was keen on a move to Old Trafford in 2020’. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to make Man Utd transfer before moving to rivals Liverpool’ – The Sun website, who even quote Ferdinand as saying “I spoke to him at the time he joined” Liverpool to make it sound more current, when he said no such thing.  But credit where it’s due: Manchester Evening News say ‘Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago admission over Manchester United ‘interest’, yet they clarify that he is talking about a situation many years ago, instead of following everyone else in pretending Thiago rejected Manchester United in favour of Liverpool. Actual fair play.  Saint Etienne “Anfield is hell!” – Villarreal’s Etienne Capoue claims Liverpool have worst stadium’ …to play at as a visiting team, as the Daily Mirror website well knows.  Trophy strife The Liverpool Echo headline: ‘Liverpool trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’ The Liverpool Echo sub-headline: ‘All Liverpool fans will want the quadruple from here if possible – but is there one trophy that means more than the others?’ You would hope so, considering Liverpool’s ‘trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’. Yet of the two writers tasked with debating the point, Sean Bradbury argues the case for the Premier League and Richard Garnett is in favour of the Champions League.

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday night. Jurgen Klopp made three changes for this game. Matip, Naby Keita and Diogo Jota all dropped out. Ibrahima Konate, Jordan Henderson and Luis Diaz came into Liverpool’s starting eleven. The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago Liverpool signed Matip in 2016 from Schalke. He is arguably enjoying his best season to date on a personal level. The 30-year-old has started 38 games across all competitions this term. Konate has featured less – starting 19 games – but he has impressed in his own right. Ferdinand thinks Matip has been one of the best defenders in the Premier League this season: “If I am Joel Matip, I am fuming. He has been exceptional all season and we talk about being the best defenders on form in the league, he would be in there for a shout after (Virgil) Van Dijk,” Ferdinand said (quotes via The Express). “So yeah set-pieces must be a big thing for his team selection this evening. I think the most impressive thing for me is the way [Klopp] has been able to utilise his squad. “Just shuffling the back at any given time, and those players are coming in and impacting the team. They are playing big roles in that, Konate is a good example for that, he has come in and scored goal after goal, and as a manager it is a dream scenario at the business end of the season.” Thousands of friends all round about you ❤ pic.twitter.com/ADmd4tj8m7 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2022 Michael Owen added: “It is a Champions League semi-final so of course you are going to play your best team, but I think Matip all season has been number one all season, but I think the goals that Konate has scored in the past few games, he does add something different.” Peter Crouch went onto suggest that Liverpool will be helped by Konate’s “dominance” in the air against Villarreal: “I think it is their strongest team, I think the only position you could argue is between Matip and Konate. “But he has brought in (Jordan) Henderson for (Naby) Keita, and (Luis) Diaz, for (Diogo) Jota and I think for me that is the strongest squad available. “The reason I think Konate has been brought in is for his dominance aerially at set pieces and he as proved to be dangerous at set-pieces in previous rounds and that can be an influence on these games.”  ",positive

Thiago was criticised last season for playing a part in the Reds poor that saw them in sixth place in the Premier League table at the beginning of April. They recovered to finish third in the end and they have had a great season this campaign with an amazing Quadruple still within their grasp. Revealed: The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago Thiago produced an incredible performance as Liverpool beat Man Utd 4-0 eight days ago and has put in a number of high-level displays this term. When he joined Liverpool he was regarded as one of the best midfielders in world football and he is now living up to that tag this season. “Thiago has been the stand-out midfielder for the last few weeks and months he’s been absolutely top,” Ferdinand said on hisVibe With FiveYouTube channel. “You look at his stats. Thiago’s pass accuracy by the way in the last two games against Everton and Man Utd 98.4 percent against Everton and 95.6 percent against Everton. That is ridiculous. “I spoke to him at the time. He speaks perfect English, he was a great guy, wanted to come to United. But you look at him now and he couldn’t be happier.” A number of Man Utd signings, such as Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, have not hit the ground running at Old Trafford and Ferdinand has urged his fellow Red Devils supporters to see Thiago as an example of players needing time to settle. “There were ex-players I saw saying ‘he’s side to side, doesn’t play the ball forward he isn’t ready-made for this league’. Players need time. “It goes back to this thing with managers and Man Utd as well the club need to give the manager at Man Utd patience, the clubs need and the fans need to give players that come in from other leagues especially patience. “Sancho is another example. I bet you see a better player with Sancho next season for sure.” ",positive

Goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus,Phil Fodenand Bernardo Silva made sure that the Citizens kept their noses in front of Real in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final clash. Vinicius Junior had a quiet opening 45 minutes at the Etihad Stadium but came alive after the break with Fernandinho – who normally plays in midfield – slotting in at right-back after replacing John Stones on 36 minutes. Champions League? You’re having a right f***ing laugh Vinicius scored a brilliant individual goal for the Spanish giants in between Karim Benzema’s brace and Ferdinand thought the decision to put Fernandinho at right-back cost Man City. “Yeah, I didn’t have that. I didn’t have that in training!” 🫢 “I grabbed Joleon. I said ‘Oh my god, how dare he!'” 😂@JoleonLescott and @rioferdy5 on THAT Benzema penalty!

I think Pep will have a lot to say in that changing room. Real MadridI think will be buoyed I think by the way they showed the character and courage to come back. “But I still fancy City to go over there [to Madrid] and finish the job off. I think a big, big change in the way the game went was when Stones coming off. I think Stones’ injury destabilised the City team. “Unfortunately, Fernandinho at 36 years old having to play right-back against one of the most in-form wingers in the game at the moment, that was a vulnerability then in that Man City team.” Fellow pundit Steve McManaman was frustrated that Man City allowed Real back into the game and thinks they should’ve been out of sight at the end of the first leg. “You never accuse City of being naïve but they were at times,” McManaman added. “They shouldn’t have let Madrid back into the game. I don’t know what it was, whether they were just overly confident because they were so far ahead, so superior, as soon as they went two goals ahead they started to drop deep, even the third goal, the Panenka penalty, they [Madrid] just had a chance prior to that, you’re thinking to yourself, ‘how’s that happened?’. “City should be just controlling the game. I still think City will score goals and probably win the game over there, the way they played, but they’ve given Madrid a glimmer of hope. “And once they go back there with the fans it will be a different scenario to tonight.”  ",positive
37,https://www.football365.com/news/antonio-conte-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-boss-lured-daniel-levy-contagious-enthusiasm,Conte appointed Spurs boss – lured by Levy’s ‘contagious enthusiasm’,"Former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has been appointed as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager and he is “extremely happy” to return to management. Spurs have acted quickly to appoint Conte. He replaces Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Italian has penned an 18-month contract. He previously led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2016/17. Antonio Conte by the numbers: Games, trophies, signings… He had previously been in advanced talks with Spurs in June about becoming Jose Mourinho’s successor, but they broke down after the two parties were at odds over key issues. However, managing director Fabio Paratici is now in position at the Premier League club and has a strong relationship with the 52-year-old, having worked with him at Juventus. And those differences have now been overcome, with chairman Daniel Levy looking to the serial winner to turn Spurs back into a force in English football. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,” Conte told the club website. “Tottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.” Nuno was relieved of his duties after Levy and Paratici met on Sunday to discuss his future, with the news delivered early on Monday morning. The Portuguese was a condemned man following Saturday’s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United, when fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and roundly booed him at full-time. Spurs have lost five of the last seven Premier League games and have gone two hours and 16 minutes without having a shot on goal. Conte inherits a team in ninth position in the table, five points off the top four after 10 games. The Italian, who is expected to be given some funds in January to strengthen the squad, is due to take training on Tuesday and be in charge of Thursday’s Europa Conference League clash with Vitesse Arnhem. He becomes the fourth manager to cross the divide between Stamford Bridge and north London, following Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Mourinho in managing both clubs. Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. “I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.” Spurs said an update on Conte’s coaching staff will follow in due course.

Son grabbed his second of the game and 19th of the season in style as he curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to put the seal on Spurs’ victory. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player. But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive

READ MORE: Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Conte, who has 12 months left on his contract, has continually refused to commit his long-term future to Spurs, but insists the latest round of speculation is not true. He said: “Obviously I think that it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invest news – only to speak, only to create problems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we’re really focused on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies. “In this situation, who works in football – players or managers – know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out.” The Italian does not want this issue to be a distraction for the club’s push for Champions League qualification. Spurs are two points behind Arsenal with five games to go and Conte has called on a joint effort to get over the line. “In this moment our fans, me, the players, the club, the fans we need to be focused, we need to be concentrated on an important target for us,” he said. “We have a big opportunity to try to get a place in the Champions League. “It’s a big opportunity for us because no one can imagine to stay and fight for this target in this league now in this moment. In the past it was different, but now you know very well what I said in the past that it would be a miracle to get this achievement. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and its the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “Now it would be very important to be focused and not listen to fake news and the people that for sure want to create problems for the environment. “We have to play these five games and then you know, because I answer a lot of times, that at the end of the season in a private way I will speak with my club and I will see the best solution. “We’re working very hard and my players know very well we’re very focused. We’re speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment.

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive

Reports emerged this week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Pochettino is likely to win the Ligue 1 title this campaign but their failure to advance beyond the Round of 16 in the Champions League has sealed his fate.

Rothen said on RMC Sport show Rothen S’enflamme (via Sport Witness): “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team.

When asked if Conte would be a good appointment if he came in for the “right reasons”, Rothen added: “Yes, every day, because Conte brings that grinta, and I think that he identifies really quickly with the club he manages, but not with those financial conditions.

But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs. Really all that we know is that he wasn’t right for this specific one of the biggest jobs. The criticism is unsurprising, but what is strange is that there also now seems to be some negative retrospective reappraisal of his time at Spurs, much of it coming from Spurs fans themselves. Nothing that has happened to either Spurs or Pochettino since his departure appears to support this view, but it’s definitely there. And that’s because, inevitably, the news of his imminent Paris exit sparks talk of a Spurs return. The timing is key here, because even a couple of weeks ago it would not have played out quite the same. When the Manchester United job was still available and Antonio Conte’s Spurs appeared to have struck gold by simply scoring four goals every week, the talk would have been more in the direction of United. But Erik Ten Hag is in at Manchester United, and Spurs have gone two moribund games without a shot on target against Brighton and Brentford. Conte is once again making eyes at the exit door and uncertainty has returned. Champions League football has also gone from ‘probable’ to ‘unlikely’. So would and should Spurs consider bringing Poch back? The case from the heart is easily made. There is without doubt unfinished business on both sides here, and Pochettino has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day. The appeal of just running with the energia universal vibes and bringing him back, re-signing Christian Eriksen and re-swapping Bryan Gil for Erik Lamela should be obvious even to those dreary trophy-counters turned trophy-dismissers. But is there an argument to be made with the head? We’re saying yes. And it’s this. Antonio Conte is a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, but is he a better Spurs manager at this moment? That’s less clear-cut.  The reports of his interest in the PSG job coming moments after news that Pochettino was likely on his way out are the key. His camp moved to brief against those reports, but the fact is that even if not true they are entirely believable and plausible. He is not a manager for the long haul at even the biggest clubs, and certainly not at Spurs. He has achieved a lot in a short space of time in the “painful rebuild” that was already overdue when Pochettino left Spurs in 2019 and became more and more urgent as Jose Mourinho huffed and sulked around the place for a year and a half. If he were a manager Spurs could realistically keep for five years, then everything Conte has done since November would be fine and dandy. From where he found them they had no business being in Champions League contention this season. If this was stage one of a proper new five-year plan they would be ahead of schedule. But with Conte, Spurs are always against the clock. His contract runs only to the end of next season and even that looks a long way away. The possible 12-month extension to that contract even more so. There is no escaping the sense that however things are currently going in what has been an up-and-down five months he has always had and will always have one eye on the exit door. Spurs will always be in this curious stalled position while Conte is manager. He’s not going to instantly turn them into top-level contenders again because nobody could, but any improvements he does make – and there have been plenty – are caveated into oblivion by the near-certain knowledge that he won’t be around to finish the job. Under Conte, Spurs are far better than they were without him, but it all feels oddly directionless. He is laying solid foundations for a palace that will never be built. Under Pochettino, Spurs would at the very least have the prospect of a manager who might still be around to finish what he started. And even if it did go horribly wrong, as the “never go back” truism and the fact this is Spurs suggest is quite likely, the closure that would provide – even if painful – is something both club and manager need to properly move on. It’s not as strong as the case from the heart, admittedly, but it’s there. There’s no denying an element of Tobias Funke “but it might work for us” to it all. Yet it’s hardly damp-eyed delusion to look at Conte and Pochettino and conclude that both men are probably better suited to the other’s job. And even then, wanting to stick with Conte is a perfectly viable position that it should be entirely possible for Spurs fans or anyone else to hold without having to denigrate what Pochettino achieved and could still offer. At the very, very least, Pochettino’s likely availability and keenness given the closing-off of alternative avenues offers the security of a better and cheaper back-up option than Spurs could realistically hope for should Conte’s wandering eye take him elsewhere.

The former Chelsea boss replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at Spurs back in November. Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took over. He has won 17 of his 31 games in charge across all competitions. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? Spurs are in the running for a Champions League place. They are two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go. It was reported earlier this week that Conte has ‘offered himself’ to PSG. The Ligue 1 side are currently managed by former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentinian is under pressure at the moment. PSG are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Athletic have noted that reports linking Conte with PSG have ‘irritated’ Levy. Tottenham experienced a similar ‘distraction’ in 2020/21 when Harry Kane announced that he wanted to leave before the season concluded. They add: ‘There is generally a desire at the club to block out the noise and get on with it. ‘There is also an acceptance that volatility is part of the package when you appoint Conte, and that the focus has to be on the team overcoming their recent blip and qualifying for the Champions League. It’s also inevitable that when you have one of the game’s elite managers, they will be linked with other clubs — especially when you are not in the Champions League yourselves. ‘That said, there are some who feel Conte has hardly dampened speculation over the last couple of months, given the way in which he’s refused to talk about his future at Spurs beyond the immediate term. ‘As for the players, with no midweek fixture they were given pre-arranged days off on Sunday and Monday, and are not expected to have been too affected by the reports. ‘In general, Conte is very popular with the players, though there have been times, most notably after the post-Burnley meltdown in February, where they have been unsettled by the up-and-down nature of their head coach’s mood.’ ",positive
44,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-juan-mata-shows-man-united-wasted-beautiful-old-trafford-swansong,Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong,"Juan Mata came, he conquered, and was forgotten about. The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive
45,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-seriously-interested-bringing-bowen-west-ham-premier-league-transfer,Liverpool are ‘seriously interested’ in bringing PL star to Anfield,"Liverpool are keen to bring West Ham forward Jarrod Bowen to Anfield in the summer transfer window, according to reports. The 25-year-old has made 31 starts this campaign and has found the back of the net 12 times whilst providing nine assists. He has been hotly tipped to receive an England call-up amid his terrific form, with the next international break taking place in late March. Liverpool have Salah situation wrong and Leeds fans want more Liverpool were rumoured to be interested in the Hammers man earlier in the season but now his form has only served to increase their desire to bring Bowen to Anfield in the summer. GiveMeSport transfer insider Dean Jones has claimed: ‘Maybe Jarrod Bowen is next on their radar and he’s somebody they’re seriously interested in.’ The Reds reinforced their forward line in January when they invested £37m on Luis Diaz, with the fee potentially reaching £49m if the winger triggers certain add-ons. Liverpool are trying to tie Mo Salah down to a new contract with the Egyptian’s deal expiring in the summer of 2023. There have been rumours that the Reds will attempt to bring the average age of their frontline down further and now Bowen could be their main summer target after he ‘caught the attention of Jurgen Klopp’s side’. Meanwhile, John Barnes doubts Bowen would ever be able to replace Salah but the former Liverpool midfielder doesn’t doubt the West Ham player’s class. “Jarrod Bowen is playing for a team that are in the top four or five in the Premier League, so he’s playing at the very top – as of right now,” Barnes toldBonusCodeBets. “He needs time to develop; he’s in his first real season playing for a better side. “Bowen’s never going to sign for Liverpool and replace Mohamed Salah. He is a different type of player to Mo, he isn’t going to score 30 goals a season, that’s not what Jarrod Bowen does. “In terms of his talent, can he play at big top five club? Absolutely.” Joe Cole was waxing lyrical about Bowen after their recent draw against Newcastle with the former West Ham midfielder claiming the 25-year-old is “getting better and better”. Cole said on BT Sport: “He’s unbelievable, every time I watch him I’ve been so impressed with him. He’s getting better and better and better. He’s movement is so good. He’s a lovely deliverer of set pieces as a well. He’s one of the most improved players in the league.” ",positive
46,https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night to move six points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham – who have a game in hand on Rangnick’s men – but it’s unlikely that that the Red Devils will now finish higher than sixth position. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Ten Hag has a huge job on his hands to get Man Utd competing for Premier League titles again and Neville has set out his timeline of expectations for the Dutchman. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” Year 1-2 | #UCL qualification Year 3 | Title challengers Year 4-5 | Premier League Winners 🏆 Gary Neville lays out the timeline that he expects Erik ten Hag to achieve things at Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/yd4KtSvhgc — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 Fellow pundit Roy Keane thinks the main thing Man Utd need to improve on is their recruitment with a lack of the right characters in the Old Trafford dressing room. “Whatever their problems, they have to look at where Man City are, where Liverpool are,” Keane added. “Man City, Liverpool and these other teams aren’t going to take it easy over the summer. They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it? The biggest frustration for me, when they’ve had these disappointments, is the reaction they’ve shown.

Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

It was confirmed last month that Ten Hag will become the new permanent Red Devils boss once the current campaign ends with interim manager Ralf Rangnick heading into a consultancy role. Rangnick had sparked rumours there could be a major overhaul of the playing staff in the next transfer window when he claimed there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope However, a report in ESPN last week insisted that Man Utd have moved to distance themselves from Rangnick’s claims and instead expect to sign three players. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino toldThe Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks). He is brilliant at keeping the ball and helping his team dictate play. “I can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy him.” Redknapp recently told Ten Hag to sign “good, honest pros” as his priority in the summer transfer window after rumours of unrest in the Man Utd dressing room this season. “Ten Hag will need to have a look at the players he wants to keep,” Redknapp toldSky Sports. “As bad as things are at the moment, things can change quickly with one or two good signings. “Who do you get?

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

As per the Mirror, the Dutch manager is keen on building around ‘energy and youth’ with a big summer squad overhaul on the cards. They say that Ronaldo is ‘not guaranteed’ to play every game under Ten Hag, which will not sit well with the club legend who has scored 17 times in the Premier League since his return to Man Utd last summer.

The Spaniard’s time at the Emirates Stadium has been full of highs and lows with the Gunners winning the FA Cup in his first six months in charge. It was disappointing first full season in charge at Arsenal for Arteta as they finished eighth in the Premier League, missing out on qualification for Europe. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature However, six new signings last summer helped Arteta remould his squad for this season and they are now favourites to finish fourth and secure Champions League football for next term. Arsenal – who beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday – are currently two points ahead of Tottenham with four games left of the season, including a north London derby, which could go a long way to deciding who will finish fourth. Despite that, there are still a number of doubters among the Arsenal fanbase that Arteta is the right man to lead the club forward in the long term, but Bent thinks they should keep the faith. Bent said on talkSPORT: “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” Meanwhile, former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell claims that Nicolas Pepe, who has been linked with a move away from the club in recent weeks, doesn’t have a future at the Emirates Stadium. Campbell told Football Insider: “Arsenal paid over the odds for him. “It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him. “You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again. “I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.” ",positive

Having been frustrated in the first half, Jurgen Klopp’s side scored two quick goals within ten minutes of the restart to hand them a healthy advantage heading into the second leg. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Henry believes the Reds “weren’t showing a lot” beforePervis Estupinan got in the way of a Jordan Henderson cross and deflected the ball into his own net. “If you look at the game, I think a lucky goal bailed them out, for me,” said Henry. “I think they would have knocked on the door, if not all night. “It’s a lucky goal, the own goal of Villarreal is a lucky goal and I think, before that, they weren’t showing a lot. “But, along the way, I would say, when you are going for the quadruple, then you need to have that luck. And, after that, there is nothing about luck.” Meanwhile, the BT Sport pundits believe the tie is still just about alive. “Villarreal have just got a pulse,” Owen said. “If Liverpool nicked another one it would have been game, set and match.” “I think three would have killed it, that would have been too much for Villarreal to come back from,” Peter Crouch echoed. “Two is a possibility but it’s a slim, slim chance when you watch Liverpool in the form they’re in at the moment.” And Owen believes Klopp made a mistake in bringing Joe Gomez on for Trent Alexander-Arnold with then minutes to play as he felt Liverpool should have gone for the jugular. “I thought he made substitutions that almost didn’t promote going for an extra goal,” Owen said. “Joe Gomez for Trent for starters is much more defensive when your right-back is one of the most attacking players you’ve got on the pitch. “I thought maybe not that he was settling for two, but I thought he was comfortable and rested a couple of legs. “They’re going to have to go out there knowing that the game is still alive. It’s still got something in it. If they concede the first goal, it’s really alive. An extra goal tonight would have put it to bed.” ",positive

The winger is expected to leave PSV this summer. He has revealed that he wants to play in the Premier League: “The Premier League is a big league.

You have to create something else as a team, create a mentality and look for the details in the preparation. “Against a team that is normally better, we will be dominated for seventy or eighty minutes but there will remain 15 or 20% of the match during which you will have chances and that is what we will work on. “I impose the same demands on myself here as in Seville, at PSG or Arsenal. What changes here is that there is less ‘noise’ outside! At the same time, the noise, if you go out, you will hear it. “If you don’t go out, you don’t hear it.

60,https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive

The 24-year-old couldn’t have started the season better for the Red Devils after returning from a shoulder operation with three goals in his first four matches. However, it has been downhill since then with the England international scoring just two more goals in his next 28 appearances in all competitions. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Rashford failed to get off the bench for United’s win over Brentford but he was still a topic of conversation for Man Utd legend Keane and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher on Monday. “He seems short on confidence,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I go back, I think he’s taken his eye off the ball, with all his off the field stuff. “He’s got that experience, but he doesn’t mix his game. Even when he’s playing through the middle, I said he plays like a child [againstLiverpool]. “It’s like he’s not learnt from the game. I think he’s lost the eye of the tiger and he’s struggling to get it back. I think the hunger, he’s got to get the hunger back and make runs like Elanga tonight.

Okay it wasn’t great service, but the one or two bits he got where he was in on goal and a poor touch. “Defensively, we were trying to help Maguire out here before the match, give him a little bit of PR, but the last goal, Maguire’s passing and defending, not acceptable, not good enough for Man United.”  ",positive

Fans showed their anger at the Glazer family as their team earned themselves a 3-0 win against Brentford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

In spells we were too hectic. “But OK, fair play to Man United. I think they hit a very high performance first half – some of their better performance that I have seen so far so they did well. “Second half much more the Brentford team I want to see, much more front footed. “We had momentum with chances and half chances and we were definitely on top and then we make a stupid mistake for the penalty, an unnecessary mistake and that of course killed the game off I would say. “If you want to win here at Old Trafford, we can’t make a penalty and concede on a set piece.”  ",positive

The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive

The Italian was desperate for reinforcements last month at Tottenham but, after the club missed out on deals for Adama Traoreand Luis Diaz, they only brought in Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur on deadline day. On the same day Conte saw the club’s two most expensive players – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso – leave on loan, with Dele Alli joining Everton on a free transfer and Bryan Gil going to Valencia less than six months after his £25m arrival from Sevilla.

Tottenham had lost three Premier League matches in a row before their dramatic late 3-2 victory over champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Their poor form and lack of activity in the January market seemed to have demoralised Conte in recent interviews but they bounced back to maintain the seven-point gap to fourth-placed Manchester United, who they have three games in hand on. And Inter Live insist that Conte now ‘expects signings of players ready to win’ in the summer transfer window if he is to remain as boss beyond the summer and De Vrij and Martinez tick those boxes. Conte won the Serie A title last season with the duo key cogs in his winning team and now it is claimed that Spurs are prepared to pay€90-100m in a double swoop for the Inter pair. However, it is understood that Tottenham would fall around €20m short of their valuation as the Nerazzurri ‘would ask for €110-120m for both of them’.

But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool.

Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Diaz has hit the ground running for the Premier League outfit. He has grabbed four goals and three assists from his 20 outings. The forward was involved in two of Liverpool’s goals as they beat Man Utd 4-0 at Anfield last month. Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season.” ",positive

The Spaniard produced a good performance for the Red Devils on Monday as they beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford with goals coming from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. Mata was making his first Premier League start of the campaign with the 34-year-old starting just three of his ten appearances in all competitions this term. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The decision by interim boss Rangnick to start Mata frustrated Man Utd legend Keane who thinks the German is “giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons”. “I’m surprised. It’s his first start of the season, he obviously knows he’s leaving the club. There’s some loyalty there, giving him a run-out. “He came on for 20 minutes the other night but starting a game is much different. It tells you where the mindset is. They are giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons.” 🗣 “I’m surprised.” Roy Keane says he wasn’t expecting Juan Mata to start over Marcus Rashford this evening for Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/MYVJQzJ9BS — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 But Rangnick was pleased with Mata’s performance against Brentford and when asked whether he could’ve used him more often, the Man Utd boss replied:“Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. “He had moments when he played like a magician.” Mata is out of contract at Man Utd at the end of the season and looks almost certain that he will leave the club in the summer. On Mata’s future, Rangnick added: “I don’t know [if he’s leaving]. He hasn’t confirmed that but it is possible. “It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time and played well for the club.” Phil Jones, who has also struggled for game time in recent seasons, got on the pitch for the final 15 minutes in what is likely to be his Old Trafford farewell with Man Utd finishing the season with away trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace. “For personal reasons he didn’t train a lot, yesterday was the first,” said Rangnick of Jones. “He asked me to allow him some time at home. Tonight was one of those nights I would have loved to have five subs.”  ",positive

Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. This followed his prolific spells at Real Madrid and Juventus. The 37-year-old has been criticised at times this season but his contribution in terms of goals cannot be disputed. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters The forward has netted 23 goals from his 37 appearances across all competitions this term. This includes eight goals in his last five Premier League games. Last time out he earned United a point at Old Trafford against Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea. The Blues were by far the better side on the night but they did not make the most of their chances. Keane argued post-match that Ronaldo would score even more goals if he played for Chelsea: “I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn’t do in terms of his pressing but he was never great at that anyway,” Keane said (quotes via Football London). “He is the greatest at what is the hardest part of the game, putting the ball in the back of the net. “You see the chances that Chelsea were creating. Imagine if he was in the Chelsea team, he’d probably get 50 goals. He’s in a poor Manchester United team who aren’t creating many chances for him and he’s producing.” Keane also stated that there was a problem with the “attitude” of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku: After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” ",positive

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role. There has always been an understanding that Rangnick would move into a consultancy position at Man Utd after his period as interim manager came to an end – but there was no expectation from fans that he would be doing another job at the same time. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” 🗣 @Carra23: “That is WRONG.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Konate signed for Liverpool last summer from RB Leipzig. The Red paid around £36m to bring him to the Premier League. The centre-back has been a bit-part player this term. This has largely been down to the form of Joel Matip and Van Dijk. Klopp’s Liverpool contract: Great for the Premier League, bad for Premier League clubs The 22-year-old has still impressed when given the chance though. He has started 20 games across all competitions. His latest start came against Villarreal at Anfield in midweek in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Carragher thinks Konate will be playing more regularly next season as he is a “fantastic” talent: “[Konate] is great, isn’t he? Joe Gomez is having a very hard time getting back into the team – he is playing right back at the moment,” Carragher said on the ‘It’s a Funny Old Life’ podcast. “But the three now, wow. I think Konate, next season, might become the first choice to partner Virgil van Dijk. “He may just edge Matip, not that Matip has done anything wrong. I just think Konate is that young and he is that good that you have to just go and let him play. “He’s getting a lot of games now – but he is fantastic.” Elsewhere, Jurgen Klopp believes him signing a new contract is the start of a new era at Liverpool: “We don’t think about changing the team in the next two or three years or whatever, but you have to prepare the little things so that you are ready for the future as well,” he said. “That’s why I really think it’s a really good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place. “We cannot wait 10 years. We have to do it now. It’s no threat. This is only the start, to be honest. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. “There’s nothing guaranteed, it’s why we have to enjoy the journey.

Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started…. Football’s greatest mystery How can a team spend a billion to become this bad? Opposition players must be p*ssing themselves laughing how easy it is to play against United!Manyooligan (Do Telles and Rashford even realize the problem is on their flank???) SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season.

The pressure at the bottom of the table has shifted on to 18th-placed Everton and Leeds, who dropped to 17th following Burnley’s win. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward An own goal from James Tarkowski handed the home side the lead, and the visitors can consider themselves unlucky with the manner of the goal, as Juraj Kucka’s strike rebounded off the crossbar and into the net off the back of the Burnley defender. Burnley left it late to find a leveller, with Jack Cork heading in an 83rd-minute equaliser before Josh Brownhill’s strike sealed the comeback victory for the visitors. The Hornets had started the game second from bottom and nine points behind their opponents with five games remaining, however they now require wins in all their remaining matches this season as well as a big goal-difference swing to remain in the top flight. Burnley’s turnaround after parting company with Sean Dyche continued, with the Clarets taking 10 points from four games since Mike Jackson took over at Turf Moor. Watford opened the scoring with an eighth-minute own goal from Tarkowski. Joao Pedro had an opportunity to double his side’s lead in the 14th minute when he cleverly controlled a long ball from goalkeeper Ben Foster, taking the ball away from the defender, before firing over the bar. 🤩 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗬 𝗔𝗧 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗚𝗘 𝗥𝗢𝗔𝗗!!!#WATBUR | #UTC pic.twitter.com/8vz2vy6TBI — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) April 30, 2022 Burnley looked to hit back, with their first significant chance of the game, but Brownhill’s strike from distance skidded wide of the target. The visitors looked to have been given a way back into the game when referee Craig Pawson pointed at the penalty spot, but it was correctly overturned by VAR and a free-kick awarded instead. Burnley looked to get on the front foot at the start of the second half, with Nathan Collins attempting to lift the ball goalwards, only for Foster to make a straightforward save. However, Ismaila Sarr drove forward to create an opportunity, and the ball fell to Kucka, but his well-hit strike was saved by an outstretched Nick Pope. Burnley had a good chance in the 74th minute when Ashley Barnes’ header was tipped onto the crossbar by Foster who then managed to scramble the ball away. Foster had to make another save less than four minutes later with Burnley continuing to push for the equaliser. Burnley had been pushing throughout the second half for an equaliser, which came in the 83rd minute, as Cork timed his run well to head home from a ball from Charlie Taylor down the left. Less than three minutes later the Clarets had taken the lead, with Watford struggling to contain the visitors. The hosts were unable to clear their lines before the ball fell to Brownhill who fired it into the bottom corner, before sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate with the travelling support.

It was as frustrated as Chelsea have looked, and they’ve played this game at least 25 times this season. They had 78 per cent of the ball, did nothing with it and allowed themselves to be riled by Everton. Kai Havertz was the case in point. He had 30 touches in the first half but none in the box and spent most of the time being wound up by Yerry Mina, who dealt with him brilliantly. Everton were aggressive and defended as one. The problem, if you can call it one, was their inability to string more than two passes together. Abdoulaye Doucoure was excellent, Fabian Delph was typically dynamic, but neither of them were able to put their foot on the ball and dictate play for more than a few seconds. They were relying on a Chelsea mistake, which Cesar Azpilicueta dutifully proferred shortly after half-time. The Chelsea captain had plenty of time to play the ball long for Reece James or pass it back to Edouard Mendy, did neither and was robbed by Richarlison, who calmly slotted the ball into the corner. The ploy to frustrate that ended in defeat to Liverpool is a viable method against this Chelsea side, who have been profligate in one box and mistake-ridden in the other for weeks. Bide your time and they will hand you a reward for your patience and hard work. And as Chelsea tried to break out of their funk, with Jordan Pickford making one brilliant save to deny Azpilicueta after Mason Mount hit both posts, before getting the ball smashed in the chops from the resulting corner, Everton could easily have doubled their lead as Richarlison continued to be buzz around and irritate the Chelsea defence. The Brazilian was at his pestering best and had to be replaced in the 80th minute, having run himself into the ground. It wasn’t pretty from Everton. There was very little skill and only fleeting quality to speak of, but they did the ugly stuff so well. It’s as though they have now finally realised they’re in a relegation battle and – roared on by the Goodison Park crowd – are weighting their efforts hugely in favour of substance over style. That’s absolutely how it should be. Frank Lampard, frequently criticised for his inability to organise his teams defensively, both in his time at Chelsea and more recently with Everton, played this one perfectly. They sat deep for the majority of the game, allowing no space for Havertz or Timo Werner to hurt them in behind, pushing up occasionally to press in packs and harass what is an increasingly shaky Chelsea backline into mistakes. And they fully deserved the victory. Pickford did make some world class saves, but an Everton xG of 1.82 to Chelsea’s 0.94 illustrates just how effective the home side were compared to their opponents. They played Chelsea at a good time – Thomas Tuchel’s side don’t appear to have anything left in the tank this season – but if Everton can harness the passion they showed on Sunday and use that as the bedrock for their remaining five games, they will still be a Premier League outfit next season.

79,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive

Cottee said (quotes via Metro): “West Ham needs to sign players like [Jesse] Lingard, like Michael Keane. “Players like that, good English players, coming and buying into what David Moyes got going on and want to be a part of the squad and that good team spirit they’ve got there.” Cottee also criticised the club for not investing in the January transfer window, and urged them to bring in up to six new names in the summer. “I think first and foremost West Ham should have signed players in the January window. That would have helped what’s going on. “The main priority in terms of this summer transfer window is to sign a centre-forward. They’ve had two years without one. “Michail Antonio is a fabulous player. I love watching him play but he is a converted right-back who became a centre-forward. He’s not a natural centre-forward. “Then you look at the midfield. What do you do with players like [Andriy] Yarmolenko, Alex Král and [Nikola] Vlasic who’s been very disappointing this year? These players haven’t quite progressed as they should have done. “West Ham, without a doubt, probably needs five or six new players into the squad. They’ve also got quite a few players out of contract, five or six players leaving so that’s a surplus of requirements. It’s exciting times at the football club.” ",positive

The Englishman progressed through the ranks at Man Utd. He has played 232 times for the Red Devils across all competitions. Lingard has fallen down the pecking order in recent seasons though. He had a fruitful loan spell at West Ham in 2020/21, scoring nine times from 16 games. Ranking Man Utd’s squad on how central they are to Ten Hag The Hammers were unable to sign him permanently last summer so returned to the fold at Man Utd. The 29-year-old has only started twice in the league as he has spent much of the campaign on the sidelines. Newcastle looked to sign him in January but the Red Devils pulled the plug on the deal. Lingard is out of contract in June so he will finally be free to move elsewhere. McCoist is of the belief that the midfielder would be a good fit for Newcastle: “I think it would be a great move for both parties,” McCoist argued (quotes via The Chronicle). “Jesse, please get out of there and start playing football, it’s what we want to see, it’s what you want to do, it’s what you need to do. “We saw your talent when you went down to West Ham, that’s what you’ve got to do – get back playing for yourself. A move to Newcastle, a team that are on the up and are going places, I really do think it makes sense.” Elsewhere, Paul Scholes thinks Lingard has been “treated pretty poorly” by Man Utd: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. “He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him. We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” ",positive

Lingard turned down offers in the summer to leave Old Trafford as he wanted to give himself a chance of earning a starting spot under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, neither Solskjaer nor his replacement Ralf Rangnick have given Lingard the game time he desired with the England international starting just four matches in all competitions this season. Garner heads ten-man queue ready to ‘save Man Utd millions’ His lack of time on the grass saw Lingard attempt to leave in January withNewcastle chief Amanda Staveley claiming the Man Utd winger “desperately wanted” to move to St James’ Park. Lingard, who is out of contract in the summer, had his move reportedly blocked by Man Utd with the 29-year-old advised to take a break in early February to clear his head. A report emerged late last month insisting that Man Utd ‘have no intention to open talks’ with Lingard over a new contract but Scholes thinks Ten Hag could attempt to keep him at the club. Scholes said on talkSPORT: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. “He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened.

And the Red Devils legend regrets talking about their private conversation. Scholes added: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that.I don’t know why I did it! “Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth.

We should have scored more goals than we did,” he told BBC Sport. “We bounced back from a poor start and had numerous chances. We hit the crossbar and the post twice. We had enough chances to get a better result. “The one thing we didn’t do well was defending in and around our own box. This has been an issue all season. We should have defended better. The third goal was a clear offside and I do not understand why VAR did not intervene. “But in possession we created enough chances to get two or even three goals.” Before the game, Paul Scholes told DAZN that he “had a quick chat with Jesse [Lingard] the other day,” adding:“I’m sure he won’t mind me saying – the dressing room is just a disaster.”  When asked whether the dressing room really was “a disaster”, Rangnick replied: “I don’t know, you have to ask Jesse Lingard. “Obviously, after games like today, there is massive disappointment in the locker room. This is, for me, normal. “I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other, I’m not daring to say get on well, but I don’t see there is an issue with the atmosphere in the locker room. “They are very disappointed and frustrated. Had we converted the penalty it would have changed the whole game, but we didn’t. “We hit the post and had another VAR decision, we thought Cristiano’s goal was not offside. There were three unlucky VAR decision against us, there was also a handball decision inside the box. “But again we have to deal with it and cope with it.

We have conceded an average of three goals in our last three games, we were far better a few weeks ago. “There is a lot of work for sure. We knew that before the game.

The stars in question are James-Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen. The latter has been linked with Liverpool in recent months. Bowen has been one of West Ham’s standout players this term both domestically and in Europe. He has grabbed 16 goals and eleven assists from his 47 outings across all competitions. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Ward-Prowse meanwhile progressed through the ranks at Southampton. He has played over 350 times for the Saints. He has also featured ten times for England since he made his debut in 2017. The free-kick specialist has impressed for Southampton this term. He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League. Spanish outlet Fichajes are reporting that Ward-Prowse and Bowen are ‘covered by Ten Hag for his Man Utd.’ Ward-Prowse is ‘one of the first names’ on the Dutchman’s ‘agenda’, while it is noted that Bowen has been one of the ‘main Premier League revelations’ in recent seasons. The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive

The Reds produced a good display to beat Eddie Howe’s side 1-0 on Saturday with Naby Keita scoring the only goal of the game as they put pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City. Klopp chose to leave out Salah for their trip to St James’ Park, as well as another couple of regulars, and Liverpool should’ve probably won by a greater margin. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Neville doubted Klopp’s decision on Saturday, as well as Pep Guardiola’s choice to leave out Kevin de Bruyne in their 4-1 win at Leeds United, but admits that the two managers will have made their squad “feel a million dollars”. Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “It’s the first time Jurgen Klopp’s left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don’t know. But when I saw that, I thought, ‘Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?’. “I just thought because he’s played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that’s a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he’s number one. So can we get through without him? “So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that’s the two best players – I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance – but those are the two star players. To come through those games without their two star players, the rest of the squad will feel a million dollars, and you’ve rested your two best players.” Access all areas ✅ Go behind the scenes of our win over Newcastle United at St. James’ Park 📽 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 2, 2022 Neville added: “What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they’re basically empowering the squad. You hear managers say ‘I’ve got a great squad’, but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? “Where you know if you don’t win there is a large consequence, or you’re probably going to lose a league title, or you’re going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win – you’ve empowered everybody. “You’ve made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone’s had a game, no one feels like there’s a first eleven. “It’s a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you’re going to go for three and four trophies because you’re going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it’s for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. “It’s really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you’re going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. “We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they’re contributing to the success, and it’s not just a token gesture where you’re being played in the sort of weak games.”  ",positive

Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles. With Gareth Southgate almost certain to call him up for England’s end-of-season fixtures, Maguire could use a holiday now to clear his head and get his knee right. Maybe swerve Greece, though, big man… ",negative

The German was placed in charge for the remainder of the 2021/22 season following the exit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November. Erik ten Hag will come in as permanent Man Utd successor this summer, when Rangnick will become manager of Austria. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford But the German will still work for the Old Trafford giants in the consultancy role agreed when he took over. In a statement, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” The PA news agency understands Man Utd have been supportive of Rangnick taking the job with Austria, with the advisory position always holding the option for the 63-year-old to take on parallel roles. Rangnick has been given an initial two-year deal that will automatically be extended by a further two years if Austria qualify for Euro 2024. Lars Kornetka will be his assistant. Speaking after Man Utd drew 1-1 against Chelsea last night, Rangnick was coy over the possibility of managing Austria. Asked if he had accepted that job, he said: “Tonight is about our game against Chelsea and I don’t want to speak about anything else. “Please accept that and respect that, so please only ask questions about tonight’s game.” Pushed on the Austria role, Rangnick said: “No (I won’t comment on it). Let us speak about the game. “What I can tell you and confirm is that I will definitely continue with my consultancy role at the end of the season for the next two years and I am very much looking forward to that. “We haven’t spoken, Erik and myself, but we have spoken with the board about the content and the profile of the job. “The content of that consultancy role we spoke about.

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” ",positive

The Reds and the Citizens have matched each others last four results as both sides look to avoid slipping up at a crucial moment in their pursuit of the title. City currently lead Liverpool by one point with five matches of the campaign remaining with Jurgen Klopp’s side appearing to have the tougher run of fixtures. Big Midweek: City v Real, Danjuma at Anfield, West Ham, Rangnick, Forest However, Carragher believes both sides – who have only lost five matches all season between them – will drop points before the end of the season but that the forwards at Liverpool’s disposal gives them the “slight edge”. “We’re talking about two brilliant teams,” Carragher on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “You can’t really split them in an area of the game, but I can see both of them dropping points, I do believe that. “If you look at the attacking stats, this is when Liverpool have the slight edge, you look at the goals per game they have the slight edge. “Liverpool have scored 85 goals, Man City 80, when you talk about not having a striker the goals are still absolutely phenomenal from Man City. “The XG per game shows that Liverpool have the edge.Man City’s top scorer is De Bruyne with 11, and for Liverpool it’s Salah with 22. There’s a big difference. “Man City obviously spread the goals out a bit more, but the numbers in terms of their top scorers show Liverpool have a big advantage in attack.” 🗣 “This is where Liverpool have the slight edge.” Jamie Carragher pinpoints where Manchester City could drop points in their remaining Premier League games. pic.twitter.com/m8coIUZQMa — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 25, 2022 Carragher added: “If Man City are to drop points, it would be down to the fact they could have games where they fail to score. “Man City have failed to score in four games this season – Liverpool only one – and they have only scored once in seven games too, so that’s 11 games where they have scored one goal or zero goals. “So, you think, if Man City are going to drop points, it must be from a 0-0, there’s been evidence of that this season in games that we’ve seen.” Speaking about both side’s defensive capabilities, Carragher continued: “We should add that lot of those games where Liverpool dropped points were early on in the season and there has been a change, defensively, in the second half of the season. “But, if Liverpool drop points, you feel like it wouldn’t be a 0-0, it would be a 2-2. “The perceived weaknesses of the two sides are that City haven’t got a striker, and Liverpool’s high line. But I think in some ways those are both strengths for them as well. “The defensive stats show City have the edge. Most people would say Liverpool have the best defender in the world in Virgil van Dijk, but as a team, City are better defensively and that might have something to do with not having a striker. “Maybe having more control of the ball in the game means people can’t attack them.Again the numbers are very close. Man City just have the edge. “Where there is a big difference is the xG per game. It’s almost a third higher for Liverpool. “There’s nothing in the clean sheets but the big one that stands out is that Manchester City have only conceded one goal from a set-piece, Liverpool seven.”  ",negative

The Reds beat the Toffees in the Merseyside derby 2-0 on Sunday but Frank Lampard’s side made life difficult for their arch-rivals before Andy Robertson broke the deadlock on 62 minutes. Jurgen Klopp brought Divock Origi and Luis Diaz off the bench and the changes worked as Origi headed in the second goal from Diaz’s acrobatic effort and the Belgium international also had a hand in the opener. Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism There were a few controversial moments in the game with Everton feeling they should’ve had a second-half penalty, while Sadio Mane was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch after poking Mason Holgate in the face. A number of comments by the Sky Sports commentary team of Martin Tyler and Jamie Carragher incensed Stubbs during the match. Stubbs tweeted: “Will have to turn this commentary off I think @Everton because it’s so biased!! “Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!!

Stupid from Doucoure trying to stop the game but Richarlison… there’s nothing wrong with him.” Stubbs appeared this morning on BBC Radio Five Live and he revealed his frustration that major decisions went against Everton. He said: “Everton had a game plan to try and frustrate Liverpool and they did that for large parts of the game. Some major decisions also went against them, for instance the penalty. The first incident isn’t but the second one (Matip on Gordon) is a clear penalty there is no doubt about that. The referee is in a great position and he bottled it. There is no other way to describe it. “Everton have been on the end of dubious VAR decisions in recent months but that is not the reason they are in the position they are in.” When asked whether Everton will stay up, Stubbs added: “I hope so. I have everything crossed. But it’s going to be close.” Stubbs also urged the players to show they have what it takes to stay in the Premier League after Burnley’s victory on Saturday plunged the Toffees into the relegation zone. Stubbs continued: “I know Frank Lampard’s record doesn’t look great but he has inherited a group of players where a lot of the damage was done before him and he had to pick up the pieces. “Could he have done more? Certainly. But ultimately it comes down to the players. They have not performed well enough this season, though there has been signs of improvement in the last three performances. “When you are down the bottom every run-in is tough. They have another tough game on Sunday at home to Chelsea. “It’s not about talk, it’s about actions. We have heard the talk all season about ‘we are too good to go down’. Well now is the time for the players to stand up and be counted.”  ",negative

Jurgen Klopp changed the game by bringing on Divock Origi and Luis Diaz in the second half with the former involved in the build-up to Andy Robertson’s opening goal before getting on the scoresheet himself. Everton youngster Anthony Gordon was booked for diving in the first half under a challenge from Naby Keita and the simulation came back to haunt him in the second half as he was denied a penalty. ‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox… With the score still level at 0-0, Gordon – who had caused Liverpool problems all game – went down after being bundled over by Joel Matip but the referee waved away his penalty protests. But Campbell was adamant that it should’ve been a spot-kick and insists the referee “bottled” the decision. Campbell said on Sky Sports: “This is a pen for me. It’s a push in the back. He’s in the box, it’s a push in the back. He’s nowhere near the ball, he pushes him. “You see that. If that was at the other end, I’m sure this stadium would have gone crazy. That’s the one break that Everton needed. “I thought the referee bottled it a little bit, if I’m honest with you.” 🗣 “I’ve gone one v one with him and I’ve got the better of him and he’s stood on me foot.” Anthony Gordon explains why he feels he should’ve had a penalty and that he didn’t deserve a yellow card for his “dive” pic.twitter.com/lhCkgxiwqB — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 24, 2022 Former Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher warned Gordon that he doesn’t want to get a reputation as a diver. Carragher added: “He’s got to be careful, Anthony Gordon. He’s a great lad and a great player, one of the best players on the pitch today, caused Liverpool massive problems. “But he’s just got to be careful of that, it’s not the first time, the one in the first half, and it definitely will be in referee’s heads.” Fellow pundit Graeme Souness reckons Gordon “planted a seed” in the referee’s mind after the simulation in the first half. Souness said: “He’s planted a seed in the referee’s head, in the very first few minutes when he dived to try and get a penalty. “You can bet, if we’re players out there, we’re in the referee’s ear: ‘he’s a diver, ref.’ You’re planting a seed in the ref’s head as well.”  ",positive

A lot of money has been spent on the squad and you expect them to be higher up the league. For a club like Everton not to win away from home since August is ridiculous.” Graeme Souness says he wants the Toffees to avoid the drop, but is not holding his breath. The former Reds captain said:“It was the easiest way to play football for Everton. They didn’t ask the players to step up and play football, everyone was back in their own half. The only threat they had was Anthony Gordon in a race with Trent Alexander-Arnold down the left. “I’m not pooh-poohing their attitude – I’d just say it’s not that they played well. It was just about sitting in and trying to nick it. Can they do that every week? I’m not sure. “I want Everton to survive. I lived in the city for a long time. They are a big proud football club with a fantastic history. It’s going to be difficult for them though. They can’t play like this in the last six games.

Ralf Rangnick became United’s interim manager back in December. One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Erik ten Hag has been confirmed as the club’s new permanent boss ahead of this summer. Rangnick has only won ten of his 26 games in charge of Man Utd across all competitions. They exited the Champions League and they are five points adrift of the top four. It was announced on Friday that Rangnick will be Austria’s new manager. It is worth noting that he will continue working for Man Utd in a consultancy capacity. Jordan believes that “the whole outlook is wrong” at Man Utd currently: “I felt [Ralf] Rangnick would go into Manchester United and he would be a sea change, and have the courage of his convictions to be able to put his foot down,” Jordan told talkSPORT. “I think it is much more difficult than that, the entire culture at Manchester United is wrong. The fabric of the playing squad is wrong, they have bought the wrong players, and they are going to have to change it. “I think if you put Pep Guardiola in for six months, he would have struggled with the current crop of players. “The attitude and outlook of disposition of that football club from the owners, to the fans, the whole outlook is wrong. “The fans are not satisfied because of the Glazers and the performance of the team, but anybody could have done it for six months. “But why would he want to be a consultant? He is a person who makes decisions and wants to implement them. “The problem is that he wasn’t involved in the selection process of the manager – he obviously has not been as Erik ten Hag has not spoken to him. “As a consultant, he basically parachutes in and looks at other people’s work, and let others implement his decisions.” Jordan went onto suggest that Darren Fletcher and John Murtough should be “working a little bit lower down the food chain”: “Darren Fletcher is not fit for purpose in his role, and neither is John Murtough – you need to get the best in class. “I am sure they are very decent individuals, but perhaps they should be working a little bit lower down the food chain inside Manchester United, so the club can start to bridge the gap. “Not just on the pitch, but off it, because off it will influence what happens on it.” ",negative

It was confirmed on Friday that Rangnick will become the new Austria boss at the end of the season with the Man Utd interim boss outlining his intention to continue at Old Trafford as a consultant. But Neville admitted on his Sky Sports podcast that he doesn’t like the idea of Rangnick splitting his time between the two jobs. One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Reacting to the news that Rangnick was set to become the new Austria boss, Neville said: “Manchester United’s Sporting Director or consultant can he really be going looking at Austrian players, week in, week out? And then selecting them for the national team? “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” The former Man Utd defender added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Ten Hag will have numerous issues to deal with when he takes the reins in the summer with reports all season suggesting unrest in the Man Utd dressing room.

Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, five points off fourth-placed Arsenal, who have played two fewer games than the Red Devils. Ronaldo scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Thursday night to take his goal tally for the season to 23. When he was asked about Ronaldo’s future after the match, Rangnick replied: “This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself.

Rangnick said: “We have to still be fair with the players. We had quite a few other players scoring goals. “I remember, in my first 10 games, we had 10 different goalscorers. It is how many opportunities can we create and how many goalscorers. “Right now, we very much rely on Cristiano, he also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession.

A temporary amendment to the rules had been implemented to increase the number of substitutions from three when football resumed in the summer of 2020 following its mid-season suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The changes were extended last summer by the International Football Association Board’s advisory panel for a further 18 months before a permanent decision was made in October to keep the option of using five substitutes in place. Liverpool trio among Europe’s top five for most appearances… However, despite clubs across Europe following IFAB’s proposal, the Premier League had decided against using the recommendations for the 2020-21 campaign and instead reverted back to three substitutions.

The Government has placed the club under a special licence after sanctioning owner Roman Abramovich over his ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The licence is designed to prevent Chelsea – and by extension Abramovich – generating any new revenue, including from ticket sales. READ MORE: Ten stars who would solve issues if they were ten years younger Chelsea released a statement on Monday afternoon saying they were pressing the Government for the right to sell tickets, and that the club were holding daily meetings to get the licence amended. The club also revealed the Premier League and the FA had raised concerns over the licence, which prevents Chelsea selling new tickets to home areas of the ground, to away supporters visiting Stamford Bridge or to Chelsea fans wishing to watch their team on the road. “We are pressing the Government to allow our supporters to have access to tickets,” the club statement said. “Meetings are taking place daily in search of a resolution. In addition, the Premier League and FA are also discussing with the Government the sporting integrity issues raised if they do not permit fans to attend. “We are aware of the high level of frustration our supporters are facing over this issue, and we are doing everything we can to resolve it as soon as possible.” The licence has already been amended since it was first imposed, with the limit on matchday spending increased from £500,000 to £900,000, and the club have already insisted they will push to have it further amended in order for them to be able to operate as close to normal as possible. The club said they were awaiting further updates from the Government regarding the sale of further tickets for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough this weekend. Meanwhile, Chelsea fans have again been urged to stop chanting Abramovich’s name. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said it was “completely inappropriate” to sing in support of the billionaire, who has brought unprecedented success to Chelsea since he bought the club in 2003. Downing Street said supporters should not let that blind them to Abramovich’s association to Putin, the man who ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We recognise the strength of feeling around people’s clubs, but that does not excuse behaviour which is completely inappropriate at this time,” the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. “I think people can show passion and support for their club without resorting to that sort of stuff.” The Government has said it is still “open” to Chelsea being sold but that a new application would be needed to enable a sale. So far, the spokesman said, the club had not applied for a variation to its strict special licence. “We are open to the sale of the club, we would consider an application for a licence to allow that to happen in the right circumstances,” the spokesman said. “But it is for Chelsea to determine the exact process. My understanding is potential buyers would approach the club, who would then need to apply for a further amended licence to facilitate the sale. “As far as I’m aware that hasn’t happened at this point.” ",positive

MAILBOX: Liverpool fans are the luckiest in the world, bad for city if Everton go down “I didn’t want to hear those details but I did,” he said. “It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. “We need to play a perfect game.

Emery accepts they cannot allow that to happen again. “They played a tremendous game at Liverpool,” he said of the Reds’ midfield. “Thiago was man of the match, Fabinho has been fantastic at Liverpool. “They are two players who can play really good football but they have the work-rate and intensity and they were at a world-class level at Liverpool (last week). “If the player of the match is again a Liverpool player we will be out for sure but if it is one of ours we can be there.” There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. “Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,” said the Villarreal boss. “I don’t know to what extent he will be fit for contention.

The 26-year-old signed for Arsenal in 2011 when he was 16-years-old. He was unable to establish himself as a regular for the Gunners. Gnabry only played for them 18 times and he had an unsuccessful loan spell at West Brom during the 2015/16 season. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min The attacker left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen on a permanent basis.Following an impressive debut season, Bayern Munich activated his release clause to sign him. The Germany international has been a key player for Bayern Munich in recent seasons. He has grabbed 63 goals and 40 assists from his 169 outings across all competitions. So far this term, he has been involved in 26 goals from his 43 appearances. His future at Bayern is in doubt as his contract expires in 2023. It was reported last week that Gnabry has rejected Bayern’s latest contract offer. If he signed the deal, his salary would have doubled. Robinson thinks Tottenham should be “in the hunt” to sign Gnabry this summer: “Gnabry is a world-class player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “If he is to leave Bayern Munich you would like to think that Spurs are in the hunt for him. “It is going to be a big summer for Spurs. A lot will depend on whether Harry Kane stays at the club, which I hope he does. “I’d question whether Gnabry would get into the Tottenham team ahead of Son, Kane and Kulusevski right now. He’d be competition for Kulusevski but I don’t think that position is a priority at the moment. “That level of player is what you want Spurs to be signing though.” Elsewhere, ex-France international Jerome Rothen has warned PSG against pursuing Antonio Conte because he’s “more passionate about his chequebook” than Spurs. Reports emerged last week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team.

Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope It would take a minor miracle for the Red Devils to finish fourth this season and, with questions over whether Ten Hag will want to keep Ronaldo next term, the striker’s future is up in the air. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to askErik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” CR7 in front of the Stretford End 🎯 👏 @Cristiano #MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/Qrnd0G1hKx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” On the appointment of Ten Hag, Rangnick continued: “Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I’m very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league. “There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea – yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. “If you know what you’re looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn’t hopefully take too long.”  ",positive

After beating Chelsea and Manchester United, Arsenal travelled to face West Ham United on Sunday afternoon. Holding was handed a rare start and he headed the Gunners in front in the 38th minute. The score was 1-1 at the interval though as Jarrod Bowen scored. Everton top PL winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Arsenal ran out winners in the end as Gabriel’s goal in the 55th minute earned them all three points. Tottenham defeated Leicester earlier in the day so Arteta’s side remain two points clear of their rivals. The battle for fourth is now just between the North London rivals. They face off at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. Holding has suggested that Arsenal “looked more like a team” after being told off by Arteta: “Yeah, we were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half-time,” Holding told Arsenal Media. “It would have been nice to go in one-nil, but he gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play.” On fans calling for him to be brought on off the bench in previous weeks, he added:“Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on! “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better.” Elsewhere, Chris Sutton has criticised Arsenal for “celebrating like they’ve won the league” after their 2-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday. There were dramatic scenes in the away end for both goals and at full time as they celebrated a tight win at the London Stadium but Sutton didn’t like what he saw. “Arsenal celebrating like they’ve won the league… dear me.” ",positive

Rice has been a standout player for West Ham and England over the past couple of years. The centre-midfielder made his debut for the Hammers during the 2016/17 season. He has now played just short of 200 times for them across all competitions. Five ways for Man Utd to salvage what’s left of this wretched season The 23-year-old has blossomed into a fantastic midfielder and it is only a matter of time before he leaves West Ham. He has been heavily linked with Man Utd. ESPN are reporting that United are likely to ‘have a clear run’ at Rice this summer. This is because other clubs are not in a position to splash out around £100m on the Englishman. It is stated that Man Utd want Rice to ‘become a modern version of Paul Inceby adding tenacity, determination and leadership’ to their midfield. Elsewhere, Kevin Phillips has suggested that Aaron Wan-Bissaka “has not progressed” and that he “doesn’t suit” Man Utd. The 24-year-old has already played 126 times for the Red Devils. He has been criticised for his performances this season though. Wan-Bissaka has been in and out of the team as he has only started 20 games in the Premier League. It was reported earlier this week that Crystal Palace are interested in re-signing their former defender. Phillips has argued that it would be a “sensible decision” for Wan-Bissaka to return to Palace: “It’s a shame because I like him,” Phillips told Football Insider. “However, he hasn’t really progressed at Man Utd – although the club have been in a massive decline themselves. “It didn’t work out for Wilfried Zaha either, and being a London boy – he couldn’t wait to get back to Palace. I know that because I was at the club at the time. “Some players just don’t suit football clubs. That seems to be the case for Wan-Bissaka – he just doesn’t suit Man Utd. It happens. “It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he went back to Palace and performed just as well as he was when he left. “That could be the most sensible decision, just to go back to familiar surroundings. If you’re comfortable and happy, then that’s when you play the best football.” ",positive

He said: “I encourage them to celebrate every victory. Because you can tell how difficult it is in this game to win football matches. “Our supporters are the same, every time we win we should celebrate because when you lose or draw you know the faces are always (sad).” After the match against West Ham, Arteta insisted that he was relieved to win “ugly” as they won their third Premier League match on the bounce. “In England you say ‘win ugly’ and from my point of view we won ugly,” Arteta said. “It was a massive win in very difficult circumstances because we caused ourselves problems, especially with our decision-making. “But the team showed huge character, not giving up but to continue doing the right things. The way they fought and the way they understood how they had to manage the game in certain moments, it was phenomenal. “I am extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and to show the character they showed.” On the pressure of staying above Tottenham, Arteta added: “When you have to pass the ball from A to B under pressure or no pressure, this is an excuse. “We were just sloppy at times and not precise and that led to a game we didn’t want to play in many moments. “We recognise that and sometimes it happens. To play here against this team is not easy at all and we found a way to win the match.”  ",positive

The German has been United’s interim boss since the start of December. He will be replaced this summer by current Ajax manager Erik ten Hag. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope Under Rangnick, Man Utd have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions.

United host Brentford on Monday night. Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game. They’ll have a go at Manchester United and I think they’ll cause them a few problems this weekend.” ",negative

The Gunners sit fourth in the table with four games to go. Their form dipped at the start of April as they were beaten by Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. They have responded in recent weeks though, with them picking up victories over Chelsea, Man Utd and West Ham. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Fifth-placed Tottenham are chasing them down. Antonio Conte’s side returned to winning ways on Sunday as they got the better of Leicester City. The rivals meet in a vital North London derby at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. O’Hara has made an early prediction for the derby. He thinks “you have to back Spurs” to win given that they are at home: “Arsenal will slip up. I think they’ve got tough games,” O’Hara told talkSPORT. “I think [Tottenham] have got one more tough game, and then it’s the North London Derby. That’s like a cup final which could go either way. “I just have to back Spurs, surely you have to back Spurs under the lights, at home, against Arsenal.” Ray Parlour then chimed in: “It’s quite funny you saying Arsenal will crumble, Spurs do it every year!” Meanwhile,Jamie Redknapp has praised Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for his decision to give the captain’s armband to Martin Odegaard in recent weeks. “Xhaka was captain for a while, didn’t really work, [then] Aubameyang, then they give it to Lacazette. It was almost that no one wanted to be. “But giving it to Odegaard, it feels right for me. He may not be the most vocal but when you watch him play, he organises people, he plays the right pass. He’s a lovely player to watch. “You can see from Mikel Arteta’s point of view, he’s almost his manager on the pitch. It might be one where, he’s there for the future, he’s a fantastic player, good type of guy as well. It’s a masterstroke from Arteta.” ",positive

The Lazio standout has been linked with a move to the Red Devils. They are understood to value him at€70m. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope The Serbia international has been with Lazio since 2017. He has consistently been their top performer both domestically and in Europe. The 27-year-old has played 291 times for the Serie A club. He has been capped 30 times by Serbia since making his debut in 2017. Former Chelsea player Mateja Kezman is Milinkovic-Savic’s agent. Foot01 have quoted him saying that they are ‘dealing with Manchester United and PSG’. It is also noted that the player ‘wants to go’ to United. Kezman has now suggested that these quotes were fabricated and that it is “fake news”: “It’s fake news. I have never given interviews in the last period, some journalists are really incredible,” Kezman said (quotes via MEN). “I’m very angry, it is a lack of respect towards me, towards Sergej and Lazio.” Elsewhere, Tony Cascarino has insisted that he “can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy” signing James Ward-Prowse when he arrives at Man Utd at the end of the season. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino told The Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks).

The Red Devils suffered another blow to their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they lost 1-0 to out-of-form Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Defeat against the Toffees means Man Utd are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League table with seven matches to go. ‘Laughable’ Liverpool exposed; Man Utd must shift quartet out To make matters worse, their last seven games of the season look extremely tricky to navigate, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace to play away and Norwich, Brentford and Chelsea to face at Old Trafford. After watching Man City and Liverpool put on an amazing spectacle on Sunday, Neville tore into Man Utd after the weekend’s results. “I’ve got very few words left for Manchester United,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don’t see anything anymore.” And Neville now thinks Rangnick’s reputation is now taking a hit with the Man Utd interim boss looking ‘weaker and vulnerable on the touchline’ in recent weeks. Neville added: “Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he’s now starting to be wounded by what’s happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It’s a real difficult position for the club to be at. “I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don’t know where to turn next or what’s going to happen. “I’m living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. “Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn’t have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it’s time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. “I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.”  ",positive

Saka has made 122 appearances in all competitions since making his senior debut for Arsenal in 2018. READ MORE: Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool When asked who his toughest opponent was in an interview with GQ, Saka named Barcelona midfield general Busquets. The Spain international has won eight La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies in his time with the Catalan giants. Saka has come up against Busquets just once, in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. Saka said: “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.” Saka has played in a number of positions for the Gunners, including wing-back and central midfield. But he now operates on the left wing and is a key part of Gareth Southgate’s England squad. The 20-year-old grew up idolising Barcelona legend Lionel Messi and recalled one of the Argentinian’s famous Copa del Rey goal against Athletic Club as the one he would most like to have scored himself. Saka added: “Because of the moment,” said Saka. “I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone. Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. “People are trying to kick him, to bring him down in the process, and he just keepsgoing, and he still scored in the final, as well. I was just like, wow. When he says he’s going past you, you’re not stopping him!” ",positive
