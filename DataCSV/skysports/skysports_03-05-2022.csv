Rashford was an unused substitute for United's 3-0 win over Brentford at Old Trafford - a game in which Ronaldo was the man of the match after scoring his 18th Premier League goal of the season with a penalty in the second half. ""It [Ronaldo's signing] was a short-term fix, for the fans, for the share price. But he has still scored the goals,"" Keane told Monday Night Football. ""Manchester United have bigger problems than Cristiano Ronaldo. ""I just think with the goals that he has got, his performances, warrants staying at the club. But Manchester United have to get players around him, they have to get other strikers in, there has to be competition for places. ""If the leading goalscorer, the man you are depending on, is 37 years of age then that is certainly not good but I would certainly be holding onto Ronaldo.

But why would you get rid of a player who scores that many goals? I don't see the logic in it."" Man Utd thump Brentford as planned protest falls flat How long for Ten Hag to fix Man Utd? Is Klopp the template? Premier League table Get Sky Sports Jamie Carragher suggested to Keane on Monday Night Football that Ronaldo's personality may make it more difficult to keep him around if he is not starting every game. The former United captain believes that is something Erik ten Hag must address. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think a top manager will come in and have that conversation with him and cut that rubbish out, like at Brentford when he is shaking his head 15 minutes after coming off. That is where Ronaldo has to be more mature and be a better leader. ""Of course you are disappointed when you come off but don't keep it up for one or two days, that is where you have to sort that maturity out.

""And when you do have that conversation as a top manager, make it plain to him that won't be tolerated, if he is not buying into that then you do say, 'No, you're not going to be part of my plays.

The 24-year-old should be approaching his peak but his form has dipped with Anthony Elanga and Juan Mata preferred against Brentford. ""Whether it's short on confidence, we've seen his quality before but we've not seen it for a year or two,"" said Keane. ""I think he's taken his eye off the ball, whatever [it is] with his off-the-field stuff. Rashford has been around for a few years now, he's got that experience and played international football.

We've seen a few games recently, when he was playing at Liverpool through the middle, I said he was playing like a child. ""It's as if he's not learnt about the game. He's drifting. He's lost the hunger. These young players get a lot of money and good luck to them, but I think he's lost the eye of the tiger and he's struggling to get it back. ""Wherever Man United want to go, Marcus is being left behind. He's left out again tonight and he must be sitting on the bench going 'where has it all gone wrong for me?'. He can get it back, he's shown it before, but sometimes when you do lose it, it is hard to get it back. ""He's got to get the hunger back into his game and make the runs like we've seen tonight from Elanga. Rashford has lost that bit of hunger, which is huge for a player.

Gary Neville threw that question to his colleagues in the studio during Monday Night Football as Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane discussed the ""catastrophic fall"" and how long it might take Erik ten Hag to turn the club around. ""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season. The first task for me really is to find out what has gone wrong. ""Why has this catastrophic fall occurred? ""Why has this team that finished second last season, 10 to 12 points behind City, found themselves where they are? I still can't put my finger on that. Surely that is something that Ten Hag has to deal with first and foremost?"" Carragher pointed to the noises coming out of the dressing room. ""I think it is really interesting hearing stories about how toxic the dressing room is. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there was something about Manchester United. They were nowhere near as good as Liverpool or City, but they looked like decent lads, a decent group. ""But the things that keep coming out about what is going on inside the club, who is that and where does it come from? It doesn't seem like those things were coming out in the last two seasons under Ole. The supporters were behind him. Get Sky Sports Watch with NOW Man Utd fixtures Man Utd transfer rumours ""He was never at the level of Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola and was never going to overtake them, but it felt like something was just building. He was getting to semi-finals, getting closer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Roy keeps talking about dressing rooms to me. We were not talking about that in the last two seasons. It feels like we have been talking about it a lot this season."" Keane reiterated the importance of character. ""If you have not got a decent dressing room, forget about it, you are in trouble anyway,"" said the former United captain. ""Whatever about the talent and the board room and who the manager is, you have to have a decent dressing room, decent personalities, decent characters. ""We have seen Manchester United through the season, when things have gone against them, that is it, they throw the towel in. That is a bad reflection on the players - the senior players and the younger ones who think they have made it and are players."" Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were signed last summer with many expecting to see an improvement. Instead, the opposite happened. Was their arrival part of the problem, perhaps? ""That is the only thing you can point to,"" said Neville. ""You can point towards Ole reaching his height and they could not go any further and they got, not sick of the message, but it had become stale and they did not believe he could overtake Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. ""Or something had disrupted that changing room. They had put the wrong ingredient into the dish and it has made it completely go sour. That is the bit that has to be dealt with because these players are not as bad as the points tally that is on that board. ""They are better than that. There is something deeper that is wrong in that dressing room that is making them play the way they are and get the results they are getting."" The task ahead of Ten Hag is not just to climb the table but ultimately to close what has become a vast gap to the teams chasing the Premier League title. For the third season in four, United are likely to finish more than 25 points behind the champions. Perusing the list of deficits since Sir Alex Ferguson last delivered the title in 2013, Keane stressed that the quality of the opposition is a big problem for United. ""It is ugly, that,"" said Keane. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is not good. We know it is a long way back for Manchester United but of course there is a way back. Maybe the new manager coming is a good time because I always think, you cannot get any worse. ""It is the points tally that worries me because they are so far behind. Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole.

The rescheduled match was postponed back in February after damage was caused to the Vitality Stadium by Storm Eunice. With just three points separating the two teams, the stakes are now a lot higher: Such a prospect seemed remote early in the season as Bournemouth flew out of the blocks while Forest struggled. In response to last season's play-off semi-final defeat to Brentford, Bournemouth stormed their way to the top of the Championship this term after going unbeaten in the first 15 league games. As they had done in 2020/21, a wobble followed - consisting of six defeats in 12 games - paving the way for eventual champions Fulham to lead the way. But the Cherries had clearly learned their lessons. This time, they recovered and have almost exclusively held onto second ever since. Forest's story could not be more different. While Scott Parker and Co were flying high, Forest under Chris Hughton were bottom of the league as recently as September 18. Championship table Get NOW to stream big moments Sky Sports EFL Podcast Get Sky Sports To suggest they have thrived under Cooper - who led Swansea to the play-offs in the last two seasons - is an understatement. In his 37 league games in charge, they have won 22 and lost just four games, scoring 63 goals along the way. They travel to the south coast off the back of a stunning run of nine wins in their last 10. Bournemouth will have to be at their best to stop this machine from steamrolling its way back into the Premier League for the first time since 1999. Forest boss Cooper said his side go into the game without any fear. ""We are so looking forward to this game,"" he said. ""We are excited about it, we are focused, we are ready for it. We are thinking about wanting to win and why we want to win. ""If you get too caught up in focusing on it like a cup final then we are focusing on the wrong thing. This is what professional sport is all about, these moments, and we really want to capture the opportunity."" Bournemouth full-back Jordan Zemura added: ""Of course it's going to be absolutely buzzing here [at the Vitality Stadium]. It's our last two games and this one is a very important one. ""I'm sure the crowd are going to be on their feet for 90 minutes, and obviously they [Forest] have got good support, and a good following.

3,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12604635/premier-league-clubs-concerned-over-unfeasible-champions-league-reform-and-fixture-congestion,Premier League clubs concerned over 'unfeasible' Champions League reform and fixture congestion,"Premier League clubs have major concerns that plans to expand the Champions League will lead to ""unfeasible"" fixture congestion, and the potential for European matches to be staged on the same day as top-flight domestic games. Up until now, there has been an agreement with UEFA that there should be no clash between Champions League matches and Premier League games, with the weekend protected for domestic fixtures. But Sky Sports News has been told there are widespread concerns that UEFA's plans will be unworkable, and may lead to European and domestic games going head to head - especially if proposals are pushed through for 10 Champions League group matches per team from 2024 instead of the six matches currently played. UEFA has already committed to expanding the Champions League from 32 teams to 36 from 2024. That was voted through without fanfare at their executive committee meeting last month. We understand the Premier League is currently lobbying UEFA for only two extra matches per team in the group stages instead of the proposed four. That would take the total number of games in the group stages to eight per team. Under the current system, there are 125 Champions League games in total per season. If the tournament is expanded to include eight group games per team, that would mean 64 more matches - 189 in total (a 50 per cent increase), while 10 group games would lead to 100 more games, and a total of 225 Champions League matches throughout Europe, over the course of the tournament - a 80 per cent increase. Some officials have told Sky Sports News that such a sizeable expansion could well lead to a drop in UEFA revenue, because broadcasters across Europe might be put off from bidding for the rights to host the tournament. UEFA rules dictate that broadcasters who win the rights must show all matches, and not cherry-pick the best. Big Six all to qualify for CL? Why many PL clubs oppose new plans Latest Champions League news Champions League fixtures Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The new ""Swiss format"" which UEFA has proposed is expected to be ratified next month by its executive committee - though there are murmurings among European officials that UEFA may be forced to compromise. The plans include 36 clubs all in one ""conference"", whereby each team is drawn to play eight or ten different opponents, based on UEFA's ""coefficient"" - which means those teams who have done better in European competitions historically will be seeded higher, and play more of their group games against lesser opposition. The top 16 teams in the conference will then progress to the knockout stages, where the format will remain the same as now. There will no longer be home and away games against the same opposition until the knockout stages. Elsewhere in Europe, there are concerns that UEFA is pandering to the elite English clubs by offering them more and more places in the Champions League, at the expense of smaller footballing nations. Currently, the champions of 44 European countries have to pre-qualify for the Champions League before they have the chance of reaching the group stages.

The issue was discussed by UEFA at its Executive Committee meeting last week, and a vote will be taken at the UEFA Congress in Vienna on May 10. It is expected to be ratified then. When it is, for the first time in history, European football qualification will be based on something other than the season that has just finished. The proposals mean that, from 2024, there will be an extra two places in the Champions League reserved for European clubs who have failed to qualify via their domestic league, but who have traditionally done well in Europe's elite club competition. To use hypothetical examples from this current Premier League season, it would mean that if Chelsea, as reigning European champions, finished fifth in the Premier League, they would nevertheless stand a good chance of still qualifying for a Champions League spot for the following season. They currently rank fourth on UEFA's 10-year club coefficient. However, if West Ham were to finish fifth, they would not gain a place in the Champions League because they don't have a strong enough historical record in Europe. In fact, there are 89 clubs ahead of them in the 10-year rankings. One senior executive at a Premier League club told me that this means, for the very first time, the introduction of a ""two-tier system"" - one for the biggest clubs, one for the rest. CL wildcards - your questions answered PL or CL? What do Man City and Liverpool need to win? CL reforms 'Super League via back door', warns fans group Find out more about Sky Sports It's important to stress the new rules won't come into play until 2024. That same executive says there is also the danger of ""a creep effect"", where more and more places in the Champions League are allocated by historical European performance and not by current domestic success. ""It's almost like this is 'European Super League Lite', and the fear is that two might become four, might become eight - with the Champions League becoming more and more of a closed shop,"" they said. The idea that most worries other clubs is the idea of ""leap-frogging"" whereby a team finishing fifth in the Premier League automatically goes into the Europa League, and yet a team finishing behind them in sixth could be ""bumped"" into a more profitable Champions League spot - if they have a better ""coefficient"", or history in European football. Sky Sports News understands all 20 Premier League clubs unanimously asked league officials in 2021 to oppose UEFA's proposal for wildcard places that might lead to ""leap-frogging"" and the inevitable sporting integrity issues. It's thought the Premier League is still lobbying UEFA, via the European Leagues group, for the idea to be removed, with some apparent success. One such meeting happened on Tuesday, I'm told. As a result, it now looks likely that ""leap-frogging"" will be banned under the new UEFA plans, but the coefficient calculation will remain. That allows the possibility for the Big Six in England to all qualify for the Champions League each season, so long as they finish in the top six places in the Premier League. The sixth-placed team will qualify so long as the fifth-placed team does, and so long as their coefficient is among the top two from all of England, Spain, Italy and Germany. In the last year since the European Super League collapsed, a number of officials have told me that the ""coefficient qualification issue"" was a hugely controversial piece of football legislation that was offered in the background to help appease the biggest clubs in Europe and England. The hope was that, if the big clubs had some sort of safety net for missing out on Champions League qualification, they would drop their plans for a breakaway league. It worked. With the exception of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid, the other nine elite clubs all backed out of the European Super League when offered this ""face-saving compromise"", and when confronted with the huge backlash from supporters. However, there has always been strong feeling within the bulk of Premier League clubs, I'm told, that this plan for wildcards to help the biggest clubs qualify for the Champions League is against the spirit of the game. They felt last year, and still do now, that the hugely significant changes had sneaked in almost unnoticed amid the noise and controversy surrounding the European Super League. One official has told us: ""They (Europe's elite clubs) got what they wanted from UEFA. They wanted a safety net, in case they missed out on qualification, and that's exactly what they are going to be given. ""The European Super League was a sideshow - it couldn't practically happen. But a ""super league"" within UEFA, via the Champions League, very much could happen."" In addition, in the aftermath of the collapse of the European Super League, the Premier League vowed to introduce a new Owners Charter which would provide legal guarantees that clubs couldn't try to break away in the future. The Government at the time said it was fully behind those plans to introduce ""appropriate legislation"" to protect football from breakaway leagues. In the year since the collapse of the European Super League, the Charter is yet to be agreed upon, or put to a vote. In fact, whilst it was on the Premier League shareholders' agenda in the first few months after the European Super League, it isn't any longer. Sky Sports News has been told by one club executive that the Owners Charter has been ""kicked into the long grass for now"" with no prospect of it being voted upon at any of the upcoming Premier League shareholders' meetings. Sources say it is simply too sensitive a subject between clubs to discuss right now. In the meantime, UEFA is still haggling over the final details of how the wildcard system will work, and there may be compromises in terms of the fixture congestion that the new Champions League format poses to the English football calendar. But compromises to the 'coefficient system' I'm told, are very unlikely. The idea of two extra wildcard places for the tournament is set in stone. And traditionally, whatever is put before the UEFA Executive Committee is voted through, so big changes are afoot next month. Another controversial issue still being discussed is the idea that the winners of the FA Cup might be able to claim a place in the Champions League. If there was to be a fifth Champions League spot available for the FA Cup winners, that would be unanimously applauded, I'm told. But that's not what's on offer. The proposal is that the FA Cup winners will only get a Champions League spot if their European coefficient is high enough - if they have traditionally done well in Europe. Again, this favours the big clubs. Of the current FA Cup semi-finalists, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Crystal Palace, Palace alone would miss out on the new European wildcard system if they were to lift the trophy. City, Liverpool and Chelsea's success in Europe would mean they would be very likely to get a wildcard into the Champions League, if they won the FA Cup (and didn't finish in the Premier League top four). And so, as one executive put it me, you could have two teams lining up at Wembley for the final potentially ""with very different prizes on offer to each."" ""The same prize has to be awarded whoever wins a trophy, and the idea you can get ""bumped"" is just wrong."" Another Saturday, another chance to win Â£250,000 with Super 6.

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfieldâ¦"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win Â£250,000 with Super 6.

The Addicks announced the decision having finished their League One season on Saturday in 13th place, despite winning six and drawing one of their final 10 games. Jackson took over the reins in his first permanent managerial role in October, stepping up to replace Nigel Adkins who he had served alongside as assistant, with the club 22nd in League One. A run of 20 points from nine games saw him appointed as permanent boss on a contract until the end of the season in December, with the club announcing would be 'automatically extended based on success on the pitch'. Any hopes of a play-off push were dashed by six defeats from seven games in February and March, before the club recovered to end the season 19 points above the drop. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Charlton owner Thomas Sandgaard told the club website: ""This decision has been a very difficult one to make, Johnnie has done so much for the club, but I felt the time was right to make the change as we continue our preparations for next season. ""Our search for a new manager has begun. This season wasn't the season any of us at the club wanted.

Sky Sports' Charlotte Marsh: ""It was hardly the easiest season for Johnnie Jackson. Replacing Nigel Adkins following his departure in October - first on an interim basis and then permanently after nine wins in his 13 caretaker games - he steered Charlton away from a relegation battle and to a mid-table finish. ""There was also a squad blighted by injuries not long after Jackson took over. At one point, five forward players were unavailable - that would hamstring even the best sides in the world, but the players coming into those positions couldn't quite fill the same shoes. ""Jackson was joined by another club legend in Jason Euell in the dugout and although he won 19 points from his final 10 games, owner Thomas Sangaard clearly did not feel he was the right man to help push Charlton forward and up the leagues. ""Among the fans, many understand the decision, although that does not make it any easier to take. Jackson is a legend of the club that has helped steer the Addicks through some of their best and worst times. ""As a player, he took over Chris Powell's iconic 'tunnel jump' after a home victory and was part of the League One-winning side of the 2011/12 season under Powell. He was also a coach under Lee Bowyer when Charlton beat Sunderland in the final minute of the League One play-off final in 2019, running down the touchline to celebrate with his players. ""He also stuck it out during the dark days of Roland Duchatelet, which bought years of turbulence to Charlton. Not once did he jump ship, even when the club wasn't sure who owned the club at some points in 2020. ""It marks the end of an era at the club and whoever Sangaard appoints next has big shoes to fill, especially in terms of fan endearment. It remains to be seen if this is a good move, and it could be one that will come to define his ownership of the club. He wants Charlton back in the Premier League, and so do the fans. ""However, although the dream of Jackson leading Charlton back into the big time as manager has sadly been brought to an end, 'JJ' will always be a huge part of the club's history.""

Villarreal manager Unai Emery admits his side need to play the perfect game if they are to shock Liverpool to reach the club's first Champions League final. The former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 56 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. ""I didn't want to hear those details but I did,"" he said. ""It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. We need to play a perfect game. ""We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season."" There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. ""Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,"" said the Villarreal boss. ""I don't know to what extent he will be fit for contention. We will not take any risks."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""I really enjoyed the Liverpool-Villarreal first leg. Villarreal were massive underdogs, defending so deep in the 4-4-2 system. I thought highly of Liverpool and their persistence. ""Liverpool were doing the right things. Liverpool are a team who can win in different ways. They can outbox you; they can go toe to toe with you, punch for punch and they can be patient. Liverpool have demonstrated that in the last few years, they can wait, they can pass it around, they don't get panicky. ""I remember that game where they lost the title under Brendan Rodgers- they didn't have the experience to handle a different type of opponent.

Everton are 18th in the Premier League table, just two points behind Leeds and Burnley outside of the relegation zone with a game in hand on both. Burnley enjoyed a hard-earned 2-1 comeback victory over Watford on Saturday, meaning the pressure was on for Frank Lampard and the Toffees to get a result. Richarlison's second-half goal at a raucous Goodison Park gave them victory, but speaking on Monday Night Football, Keane said some of the delays in play, prompted by Everton, left a sour taste. Keane said: ""Every time there was an injury, they were staying down for ages. Pickford made some great saves, but his time-wasting was disgraceful. ""But I totally get it. They must win a game of football. I think where Everton are, you're fighting for your lives, fighting for survival, for Frank, the players and for the supporters yesterday.""

""Now that is a complete change for Frank Lampard in terms of his philosophy and how he's gone about things at Everton. Now, the interesting thing for me is: will that continue? ""What they did - and I have said it a lot doing this show for seven or eight years, Everton football. I've known that ever since I was a kid.

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each clubâs attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

It was widely expected that UEFA will ratify its plans at next week's Executive Committee meeting. However, there has been wholesale lobbying in the last fortnight since Sky Sports News highlighted the issue, from senior officials across Europe - including those from the Premier League, Scottish Premiership and the influential European Leagues organisation. UEFA is already committed to expanding the competition from 32 to 36 teams from 2024, but it has also announced plans for two Champions League ""wild cards"" to be allocated from then on. They would be given to the clubs with the highest UEFA ""coefficient"" who just failed to qualify via their domestic competition - for example, if Manchester United finished fifth in the Premier League. But those plans met an angry response from clubs across Europe who felt the plans were unfairly weighted towards the continent's elite, rather than based on sporting merit. The European Leagues has led calls for the extra places to instead be given to smaller nations whose champions don't automatically qualify for the Champions League group stages. The Scottish Premiership is one such league. Premiership winners to get CL group spot after Russian clubs banned Scottish Premiership live on Sky Sports Scottish Premiership fixtures Get Sky Sports And so if UEFA bows to pressure and scraps its plans for ""wild cards"" that would make it much more likely that future winners of the Scottish Premiership might automatically qualify for the Champions League group stages. As things stand, this season's Scottish Premiership winner will automatically enter the Champions League after UEFA banned Russian clubs from competing in its competitions, while next season's champions will also go straight into the 2023/24 group stages due to Scotland's ninth-place UEFA coefficient ranking. However, with an expanded Champions League, if the idea for ""wild cards"" or coefficient places is scrapped, that would offer a further boost to Scotland's top-flight winner in particular, who would be much more likely to gain automatic entry to the group stages from 2024.

On Monday night, the Cottagers thrashed Luton 7-0 at home to clinch the Championship title after they had made automatic promotion safe earlier this month with victory over Preston. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2001-2014, Fulham's fortunes have been somewhat less stable in recent years, with their last five campaigns ending in either promotion or relegation. No one can question Fulham's bounce-back ability. The pattern is consistent. Relegation woe is followed by the joy of immediate promotion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And once again it's only taken the London outfit one season of Championship football to realise their potential as a first-tier club, but questions over their longevity remain. Here we look at how Fulham can ditch their yo-yo past in favour of a sustained run as a genuine Premier League entity. Having won the Championship with a game to spare, Fulham boss Marco Silva will have one eye, or possibly even two, on next season. Fulham seal return to PL Championship table Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week In Silva, Fulham have a leader with Premier League knowhow. In both top-flight forays of recent memory, they have been led by managers who lacked such experience. His Premier League win percentage (35.71) may be somewhat underwhelming, but counts for something given his predecessors - Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker - started their respective top-flight campaigns on zero. Fulham have also led the Championship since mid-January and despite suffering a delay to their promotion parade with a few rogue results - notably against Coventry City and Derby County - have known their fate for weeks. Fulham have tried spending heavily with limited success in the past and will need to be shrewd operators in the summer transfer market to ensure they boost their squad in the areas they lack most. This time around, with automatic promotion secure without the need for the play-offs, Fulham are ahead of the competing pack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That security may pave the way for player trading earlier in the window and offer any newcomers more time to bed in. Fulham's recruitment policy has been flawed in recent years and relied too heavily at times on loanees. They splurged over Â£100m on 12 players ahead of 2018/19, before being forced into the January market for a short-term fix in an attempt to save their ill-fated season. A more considered plan of attack, which centres around two or three key targets in specific areas of weakness, as well as some pragmatic fine-tuning to the current squad will provide a better platform for success - this model has been well executed by both Leeds and Brentford over recent seasons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aleksandar Mitrovic is undoubtedly Fulham's talisman, although question marks remain over his Premier League suitability. Regardless, Silva appears to know how to get the best out of his record-breaking striker. He is thriving in a settled system guided by Silva's dynamic style. In March, Mitrovic broke Ivan Toney's Championship scoring record by notching his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in a win over Peterborough. In Monday night's win over Luton, the 27-year-old broke Guy Whittingham's second-tier record of 42 goals in a single 46-game campaign with his two second-half strikes taking him onto 43 for the season with a game to play. There is a very clear correlation between Mitrovic's bounty and Fulham's fortunes. In 2020/21, the striker scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did at club level (4), as Fulham were relegated having only found the net 27 times all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's clear that under Silva, Mitrovic has much more potency. He has got better at coming deep and linking play and is much more of a complete forward, registering a further seven assists. It's also no surprise that Fulham possess the league's most abundant provider in Harry Wilson - 19 assists. In order to dictate the outcome of games in the Premier League, Fulham need to figure out a formula that puts their prized asset, who was named Championship Player of the Season, at the centre of the action. Championship winners tend to fare better than play-off winners - although Norwich City remain an exception to that rule. Fulham must therefore harness the momentum gathered from such a successful season and put it to good use in the early part of the new term. Leeds, Wolves and Burnley are all examples of clubs who have won the Championship title in recent years and exhibited staying power in the top-flight by profiting from the promotion wave. This does not last forever - as demonstrated by Sheffield United's second season demise - but could serve to energise a positive start. The same impetus applies to individuals. There will be a void left by teenage sensation Fabio Carvalho - who is set to depart for Liverpool in the summer - but among Fulham's Premier League 2 (Division 2) title-winning youngsters there is a clear abundance of talent to supplement the quality within the first team. The carryover must also extend to Fulham's stellar strike force. If Mitrovic and Wilson can hit the same heights and deliver a comparable amount of firepower in the Premier League, it's entirely reasonable to forecast Fulham's stay in the top tier to extend beyond a single season. Plenty of ifs, buts and maybes, but there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism. Another Saturday, another chance to win Â£250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive

It shocked us and it would have shocked Leeds United. When asked about Burnley's revival, Neville added: ""I know a few Burnley fans and we were all horrified when Sean Dyche got sacked. We were all shocked because maybe we are not as close to the situation internally at Burnley. ""Burnley fans were respectful of the job Sean Dyche had done. What an amazing job, and I think it is one of the amazing jobs in the Premier League to do what he's done, but actually there was a feeling from Burnley fans that maybe the change was needed to have any chance of staying up.

Maybe that was actually the case because we've seen what has happened since, which is absolutely incredible. ""They've got a spirit Burnley and we've always known that. Dyche has put that into those players, but if the same voice of the manager has talking to the players every day for a large number of years there comes a point whereby the manager is tired of talking to the players and the players are tired of hearing from that manager. ""It just felt like there was a bit of that at the end of Dyche's reign at Burnley.""

""I am aware of their model in terms of they do have a very strong incentive model on the players staying I the league. They've always been committed so I think you always get a fight to the end. ""From somewhere, they've galvanised, they've brought it all together and that was a massive win moment at Watford.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

INCIDENT: Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale races off his line to make an interception, seeming to catch Jarrod Bowen in the process, but the West Ham forward is booked for simulation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player VERDICT: Yellow card for 'diving' is harsh. DERMOT SAY: ""The outcome of this was actually a yellow card for Jarrod Bowen for simulation. ""People talk about this incident and say: 'Is it a red-card offence from the goalkeeper?' ""For a red-card offence, it would have to be serious foul play. I'm not saying he didn't go to take the player. He wants to stop the player, there is no doubt about that. ""It's very difficult to send a player off when there is no contact made for a serious foul play offence. I wouldn't say it is impossible, but it is very difficult. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table ""On balance, I think the best decision would probably be no yellow card for simulation. Let's accept the goalkeeper went rashly, if you like, the player took evasive action, but he didn't simulate."" Gallagher added: ""I don't think a player has to suffer serious injury for it to be a serious offence. ""I do think it is very difficult to pull out a red card for a player who hasn't made contact with another player. I don't say impossible, but it is very difficult. ""On this occasion, the goalkeeper was rash. He took a risk. The goalkeeper has in his mind that he's got to stop the player and I think he's got lucky. ""Bowen had to evade him, there is no doubt about it, and that is why I think no yellow card. If the referee had just given a throw-in, I think that'd be more acceptable. Bowen is the one I feel sorry for. I'm very glad he didn't suffer injury, but he was unlucky to get a booking."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Warnock: Ramsdale's rash. Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""Ramsdale's rash ""I think it is a foul by Ramsdale because of the speed in which he comes out. Bowen has to ride the tackle and naturally he's going to lose his balance. I don't think it is a red card but Ramsdale's rash, which tells you it is a foul."" Smith: No Bowen booking, but Ramsdale's lucky Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""It's a really interesting debate. I don't think Bowen should have been booked for it because as a player, when you are running through at so much pace, you knock the ball around and you see the challenge coming in. You see Ramsdale coming at you with so much pace and you do everything to avoid it because you don't want to get injured. ""He certainly shouldn't have got a yellow card for that and I'm more in favour that it should have been a foul by Ramsdale, even though he didn't make contact. That's where the dilemma is because he's very lucky he didn't connect with him because if he did it would've been a definite red card."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  INCIDENT: There is a suggestion defender Rob Holding handled the ball in the build-up to Arsenal's winner. VERDICT: Correct call, accidental handball. DERMOT SAY: ""It was looked at and it was deemed that it didn't rebound off the hand to a guy that scores. There's no doubt about that because the game goes on. ""The ball may have touched his arm, but it wasn't deemed a handball because it was totally accidental. The referee quite rightly says play on. ""If the ball strikes you on the arm, it has to be deliberate, or your arm has to be above your shoulder and in the air. ""But I would say, if it did strike his arm, it was totally accidental, and it didn't lead directly to a goal.""

""Milner wins the ball and then Schar goes into him. That is why he goes over. ""The ball goes on and as I say, it's not a foul for me. That set the tone for the rest of the weekend for me, and I think it was a really good level. ""Milner didn't win the ball and go through Schar. He wins the ball cleanly and then Schar connects with him and goes over. No foul and it is great refereeing."" INCIDENT: Richarlison picks up a flare that has landed on the pitch and throws it back into the crowd after scoring Everton's winner. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  VERDICT: The incident should be included in the referee's report. DERMOT SAYS: ""I would suggest the referee has sent it straight to the FA. In his match report after the game, he's contacted the FA and said: 'This has been drawn to my attention. You need to look at this.' ""As you've said, it has already unfolded that the FA are to investigate it and we'll see what happens after that."" When asked about the procedure with the ref having a lot to remember, Dermot added: ""That's the benefit of the fourth official. The fourth official will coordinate everything for him, they will talk after the match and put the report in based on what they've seen together. ""It's about accumulating as much information as you can, relaying it to the FA, and the FA dealing with it. ""The referee would have to be convinced that it is a danger to a spectator, if he's thrown it into the crowd like that. It doesn't show where it went. We saw an incident years ago where Jamie Carragher was sent off for throwing a coin back into the fans at Arsenal once in the FA Cup. ""He got sent off that day, but it is rare and I think the best procedure really is for the referee to leave it to the FA because they are in charge of discipline."" INCIDENT: The ball appears to strike Heung-Min Son's arm as he challenges Leicester forward Ayoze Perez for a loose ball just inside the penalty area, but referee Jon Moss waves play on. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  VERDICT: Son is very fortunate. DERMOT SAYS: ""I think Son takes a massive risk. He puts his arm into it. ""If a penalty is given, I don't think he's got a lot of argument. ""As it was, I don't think the referee saw it and the VAR wasn't convinced so it was play-on, but I think he was lucky. ""VAR wasn't convinced because it is a subjective decision. Has the ball struck his arm? Has he moved his arm into it? I think because of the way he is turning his body he's moved towards the ball. Other people say no. ""There were four people in the studio on Sunday and two thought penalty and two thought no. That's where you are."" 'Son's body language points to penalty' Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""I think it's a penalty and what you can also see from the incident is, Son's under no pressure when that ball drops to him once he's handled it and it drops at his feet. ""Now he knows he's clear of Ayoze Perez but look at him lash at the ball. It's almost like he's saying he's made a mistake and that's a natural reaction when you think you've done something wrong. You panic. ""If he's thinking I haven't handled the ball I think he'd have run with it out of the box. Body language comes into it again, but I think it's a penalty."" 'Son's arm is close to his body' Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""I think this is where subjectivity comes in because I don't think it is a penalty. ""I think his arm is quite close to his body and he just gets in between. The ball does touch his arm but I don't think he's actually moved his arm to the ball.""

Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp's sides look destined to remain almost neck-and-neck until the very end of the Premier League season for the second time in four years with both sides victorious on Saturday, to leave City a point ahead in the standings with four games remaining. Both sides rested players due to their Champions League semi-final commitments but after a Mo Salah-less Liverpool edged to a 1-0 win at Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off, Manchester City saw off a Leeds side unbeaten in five games with a 4-0 victory at Elland Road to leapfrog them back to the top of the table, despite making five changes from their match with Real Madrid in midweek. Neville told the Gary Neville Podcast the two teams had transformed the title race from the ""fights"" of his time as a player at Manchester United into a spectacle both appear to enjoy, with the increasing pressure of keeping up with their title rival never showing - and the prospect of a faultless end to the season a real possibility. He said: ""The thing that actually City have done tonight, which is massively impressive, but they make it look easy, is that when we were up against the team going for a title and they played before us, we always wanted to play first. ""When Liverpool have gone and done what they did at lunchtime today at Newcastle, after Villarreal in midweek and all the games they've had recently, you're thinking that switches the pressure to City, but you never really get the impression that these two teams feel that pressure. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""That's because of their dominance, because of their class, because of their composure, because of their rhythm. Everything that they have. They just seem to be in control, they seem to be enjoying it. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table ""When we were going through these tussles with Arsenal, or Chelsea or Blackburn in the mid-90s, it always felt like a fight. But this doesn't feel like that, even when they played against each other in that brilliant 2-2 draw. Liverpool did very well to come back in and then there were hugs at the end and it's a very pleasant, respectful run-in. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""But you cannot deny the excellence of both of these clubs and both of these teams at this moment in time because it is a standard that we've not seen before in terms of consistency at the end of the season. ""You could say that in other seasons, teams have gone on these types of runs towards the end, but these teams are in the Champions League, they're in the FA Cups, they're in the Carabao Cups, they are playing tonnes of matches and still doing it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville felt both Klopp and Guardiola took a chance by making changes for Saturday's Premier League matches - but says to have come through unscathed will be of huge benefit to both teams in the remaining games this season, with fringe players feeling more confident and ready to make an impact off the bench in pivotal moments. ""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? ""Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win - you've empowered everybody. ""You've made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone's had a game, no one feels like there's a first eleven. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you're going to go for three and four trophies because you're going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it's for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. ""It's really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you're going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they're contributing to the success, and it's not just a token gesture where you're being played in the sort of weak games."" ""It's the first time Jurgen Klopp's left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don't know. But when I saw that, I thought, 'Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?'. ""I just thought because he's played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he's number one. So can we get through without him? ""So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that's the two best players - I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance - but those are the two star players. To come through those games without their two star players, the rest of the squad will feel a million dollars, and you've rested your two best players.""

Find out here... Blackburn got a big win at Preston just when you least expected it to keep themselves in the hunt for the top six. It is needless to say they need to win their last two to have any chance, though. Bournemouth fought back bravely at Swansea in midweek, but they have Nottingham Forest breathing right down their necks now. I think this will be a draw that does not hugely help either side. Prutton predicts: 1-1 (Sky Bet odds) Coventry's play-off hopes are all-but over. But it has still been a fantastic season in the Championship for them, considering the budget they have to work with. Huddersfield have booked their play-off spot and need to keep fighting for that second spot until it's mathematically impossible. They still have that little bit more to play for here, which could see them edge it. Prutton predicts: 0-1 (Sky Bet odds) Championship table Championship fixtures Millwall still have hopes of the top six and just need to keep winning games and hope other results fall kindly for them. Peterborough are down but Grant McCann will be keen for them to keep going to try and build some momentum. I just think Millwall will be too good, though. Prutton predicts: 2-0 (Sky Bet odds) What a rise it has been for Nottingham Forest. You wonder where they would be if Steve Cooper had been in charge from the start of the season, but the fact they have automatic promotion almost in their own hands is pretty incredible. Swansea almost did them a favour against Bournemouth in midweek, and Forest will hope that game took a lot out of them. This is a home win for me. Forest look too good right now. Prutton predicts: 3-1 (Sky Bet odds) Fulham looked a little sloppy in midweek as they missed a chance to clinch the title. It could be won by Monday depending on what happens elsewhere, and they would love to lift the trophy in front of their own fans at Craven Cottage. Luton again will be keeping a keen eye on results over the weekend. They will want to get the job done one way or another and get that top-six spot. I think they have enough for a draw in this one, despite all the injuries. Prutton predicts: 1-1 (Sky Bet odds) Barnsley vs Preston (12.30pm): 0-2 Blackpool vs Derby: 2-0 Bristol City vs Hull: 1-1 Cardiff vs Birmingham: 0-0 Middlesbrough vs Stoke: 2-2 Reading vs West Brom: 1-1 FREE TO PLAY: Do not miss your chance to land the Â£250,000 jackpot for the fifth time this year!
